video we're gonna be looking at classes
and one of the previous videos we looked
at what functions are and how functions
are very similar to what I was talking
about with methods and methods are
attached to class objects objects are
created from a class so a class can be
basically thought of as blueprints for
how to create an object also known as
like an object kind of Factory so it's
it's just instructions on how to create
an object and what that object can do so
in order to create a class in Python 3.5
it's very easy we just have to say class
and we'll just call this my class and
that's all it is and then just a colon
so it looks just like the defined
statement for the functions that we have
made except it's different so a class is
going to consist of a bunch of different
what look like functions but they're
really called methods because they're
attached to a class object so if I said
defined test this looks like a function
but it's you need to know the
terminology that's going to be
considered a method because it's under a
class so this is alright now if I want
to actually do something ability use
this class I need to create an object
from it so I could just say X equals my
class and I'm gonna do open and close
parentheses now X is an object that was
created from this class so I could now
say X dot test and call that method that
I was telling you about so I'm calling
the objects and method so if I run this
one of the things that Python is really
weird about is that you do have to
explicitly pass and the argument to
itself and that makes no sense
especially for anybody that's just
starting out and I'm trying to think of
the best way to explain it but to be
honest with you it's it's very difficult
to explain but when object and when this
when an object is created from this
blueprint in order for it to be able to
call its object methods it has to
actually pass itself as the first
argument to any sort of method that you
have under that object so you just sent
essentially have to get into the habit
of putting self as the first argument
for every method that is inside of your
your class and it's nuts I know but you
see by doing that it now operates and it
does what we expect it to do so you're
probably wondering well what is self
self is X so in order for it to know
that test
it's just weird like I said just so just
get into the habit of putting self on
your methods any sort of method that's
inside of a class now one thing I want
to try to explain to you guys without
getting too complicated is how scope
works in Python and I'm scoping a
programming language can be thought of
as two basically variables can share the
same name but their values can be
different depending on the scope of how
you call that variable so to give it so
to understand that let me just give an
example here we're gonna say scope
variable equals this is the global scope
so anything that is any sort of variable
that is going to be declared outside of
a class method or something like that
especially you know this particular
start of the program this variable is
going to be put into memory and the main
execution block of the code so this is
going to be known as a global variable
right so don't think about it too much
but just know that this is global now if
we went ahead and we
define that down in here we could
actually change the value so we change
the value which it really isn't anything
spectacular but instead of printing this
out we're gonna print out the scope
variable so obviously what's gonna end
up happening when we call this we're
gonna have scope variable is going to
overwrite the global variable so we said
change the value so this this local vet
this local this scope changed the actual
global value and even though we're
executing it from within our class it's
important that if I said print scope
variable you see what's going on
we didn't actually overwrite the global
scope so just so you know everything in
Python is an object and it's a reference
to a memory spot so when the program is
is created the variable is created and
then it's defined a memory spot to this
value of this is a global scope and then
we execute it in a different scope and
we change the value but we're not
overwriting the original so by using
classes and objects in Python you can
actually control the scope of your
program to actually have variables that
only exists within the execution block
of the class that you're defining so
that way you don't have some rogue class
accidentally overriding global variables
that may be referenced throughout your
program and other areas otherwise you
could have one class accidentally does
that and all of a sudden it just wreaks
havoc on the rest of the program that
might have to rely on scope variable so
that's why you wouldn't want that to
occur now typically when you're building
a class object python has a weird method
which is considered its construction
constructor method which is the eye net
method and what these are is there are
actually two underscores and it's 204
zine it and then two underscores and it
stands for initialization and just like
the method below you have to actually
send the self keyword and what this does
is this gets executed it will be fired
every time an object is created so when
this is created here it's going to
automatically call this without having
to actually specifically call it so
that's why you'll see the inet method a
lot and python and here is where we
typically would say something like self
dot scope variable equals change you
know and then we would start doing this
we could just reference self dot scope
variable
and you can see it's the same same exact
output
now what's good about this eye net
variable too is you can actually add
arguments to it so we could say r1 and
instead of actually doing that we're
gonna just go ahead and define this
local scope variable the argument value
that gets passed and so when we
instantiate the class we're actually
gonna pass in the first argument will be
whatever we want so this is what
whatever we want and you can see that
the value has been passed in on the
class instantiation and then it was
actually executed automatically without
saying hey call line it so if we wanted
to we can see that the iana it's gonna
be called before the print statement
gets called and it's using this value
that was passed in right here so that's
how you could create a class that
actually takes in a lot of different
values and then you also have local
variables that only exist within the
scope of their call the the class
context you know so basically this class
container scope you know so a scope
variable does not exist so if we
actually went ahead and we said like
self dot test cuz normally you probably
wouldn't want to have the same global
variable name you probably want to be
somewhat I'll cautious with how many
global variables you're using in a
program but so we'll say just self dot
test is the name of the program if I
wanted to actually reference that let me
go ahead just run this real quick
I'm sorry we're not passing in
now here's an actual test of may not
really paying attention but what I did
here is I actually over wrote my method
name with this the string value that's
being passed into the class object so
you get this string object not callable
because there's no longer a method on a
class I over wrote it to a string so you
gotta be careful with that kind of shite
so you would want to say like print
string is the name of the method so
instead of that I'll say print string so
you can see we get the same output so
you always wanna be careful if I'm not
paying attention I just quickly
overwrite method I can I can do that in
fact I can even name variables like
protected words and Python like print
and stuff like that I can rename print
by accident if you're not careful so
it's it's kind of it gives you a lot of
flexibility to hang yourself now one
final example of this class video is and
the scope scope discussion is that I
want to show you what happens if we
create a local variable without using
the self it doesn't even you can create
variables locally in the class without
having to use self if you if you want so
if I wanted like within this method to
just have like any sort of value so
we'll just say my variable equals test
my test this mother and then I go ahead
and under here I'll just go ahead and
say print my variable right so I'm
actually referencing inside this
constructor function or method I'm sorry
I call it a and constructor method and
you can see it prints out it fine it's
it's local now what happens if I
actually try to rest at that local
variable within that class object from
the global scope so meaning an outside
of the class object if I try to do that
and we'll go and do that and see what
happens so I'm trying to call that and
it's defined inside of this class object
if I run this here we're gonna get a
runtime error that it says my variable
is not defined because it's not
in the global scope it's only in this
locals class scope so that's why scope
isn't is important and just takes a
little while to get the hang of and just
so you know the scope of this particular
variable is defined only within this
method of this class so technically the
scope isn't even the class it's the
method within this class so it's
actually the constructor method within
this class so if I try to access that
from this second method in the class and
I try to say print my variable and we
run this we're going to get the same
problem that my variable is not defined
so that's why it's important that if you
are gonna have variables that need to be
accessed throughout the class under
several different methods you're gonna
want to define those using this self dot
you know method that I showed you if
it's going to be values passed into the
object you use it this way if you don't
have to worry about passing in stuff you
can just list unlimited number of you
know class like glow it wouldn't be
called basically class level method
variables you could list as many as you
want here using the self dot notation
and then if you know that you just want
to have a variable that's only going to
be restricted to the method that's being
called then you could just you know do
it this way so basically we looked at
several different ways of creating
variables and accessing them from a
class outside of a class what the
difference is and it takes a long time
to get to hang out with pythons a little
bit a little bit strange with its object
orientation but I'm sure you'll get the
hang of it eventually and you definitely
got to play around with this stuff so
this is a more advanced level Python
stuff but something you definitely need
to know and get the hang of all right
