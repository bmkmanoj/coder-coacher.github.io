building of Jenga website series in this
video I want to touch on extending the
user profile module which comes with
Jango by default and whenever new
registered user signs up to your site it
creates a user object inside of your
auth database which like I said comes
out of the box in Jango and what we can
do is we can basically extend that so
that we set up a user profile for every
single user that gets signed up to your
site but since you the user profile
module and we're just going to call it
profile it doesn't have any any way of
knowing when a new user is instantiated
or created so we're going to be looking
at using one of Django's newer features
which is signals Jango signals to signal
this apt we're about to build every time
a new user is created so that way it
will also build a user profile
associated with that user so let's go
ahead and start that process now so go
to whatever command line that you're
using whether it's Windows or Linux and
we're going to go ahead and start an app
called profile so just like we've done
in the past we're gonna say in Python
manage that py start app that's going to
just be called profile
okay yeah that's not a good idea we're
gonna call this then a user profile I
didn't realize that that name clashes
with a standard profile name within the
Django framework so do not use profile
then we'll call this user profile all
right so now that we have our app let's
go ahead and get it from the server and
and bring it down so that we can access
it
so like we've done in previous videos
we're using via FileZilla to go ahead
and download that locally and now we
should be able to see it inside of our
editor okay so here's the user profile
and what we can do with the band similar
to what we did with the bands on let's
take our models file actually that won't
be necessary let's take our admin file
though and just save as and we'll save
it in the new user profile directory
that way we don't to create another
admin dot py file and inside that we
need to go ahead and alter it to what it
should be which is the name of our new
app user profile and the class name is
just going to be user profile and are
capitalized on user in profile so we can
say user profile admin
I realize though that there is an error
in our band's model there that should
not say title because I think we're
going off of the band's name that title
but anyway that's a different story
right so alter this admin code so we can
view our new model object and admin
I know that we've done that let's go
ahead and pull up the models file and
we'll clear rate the class user profile
which inherits from models dot model and
the first object that we're going to be
using is user and that's going to
actually be the Django user object that
gets created so we're going to do this
as a 1 to 1 field and we're going to
bring in user now since we're using user
we have to import it and we're gonna go
from Django dot contribs import user now
a few things that we want with our user
right now to be honest with you I don't
know enough about exactly how involved I
want my profile system to be for this
web application I have a basic idea in
mind how the websites going to work but
as far as like exactly how much stuff I
plan on tracking with the user that's
this might change but once again in
previous videos that's why we use Django
South so that we can handle database
migrations when we update our model
objects so that when we figure out what
we don't have that we need then we can
make an amendment to that all right so
let's just add a few things because I'm
out of BIOS every user should have some
sort of bio where they can explain
themselves and stuff like that and we're
going to make sure that it's allowed to
be empty and null and for right now
that's really it because honestly the
user name of the user is going to be
handled by the Django oath because the
author comes with a first name last name
and then a user name so I kind of want
whoever is on our app to use the user
name and so that pretty much this leaves
bio so we'll just do that alright now
one of the things we're going to add
down here is gonna say define Unicode
and then we're going to feed itself
and we're gonna return it self dot user
dot username so what we're basically
saying is um every user is gonna have a
URL that can be associated with that
person and when you actually if you
didn't do what I just did here if you
looked in your Django admin you would
see for every new user profile object
that had created it would just say user
profile dot object no but it would be
all it says it doesn't differentiate
from you know Chris Hawkes to John Smith
or whatever it would always just say
user you know we'd always say just
object so what we're saying is we're
saying with this statement don't do that
when you're returning a user profile
return self dot user dot user name so
it's basically saying if I am registered
as Chris Hawkes then my user name is
Steve Hawks I guess and what I'm saying
here is in the admin when I see a user
profile don't just say object say Chris
Hawks or I'm actually you would be my
username which is seahawk hopefully that
makes sense if you took that out and
looked in the admin and then put it back
in you know exactly what I was talking
about but others save time from having
to do that all right now what we had
mentioned at the beginning of this video
is we are going to be using Django
signals in order to create a user
profile object every time a new user is
created so let's go ahead and add that
code now and we're saying from Django DB
models dot signals import post and then
underscore save and then we're going to
also say from Django dot dispatch and
pour receiver
all right and then down here we're going
to say at receiver post save sender
equals user and then we're gonna create
a method to find create profile send our
instance created keyword args now as far
as everything that this is doing in a
nutshell like I said it's sending a
signal every time a new user is created
and it's going to call this method so it
actually creates an e profile that we
need it to be associated with
actually we're gonna do a get her create
alright so um once again this is a bit
complicated it's not for really beginner
level stuff but if you just follow along
with the code and basically just copy
and paste it'll suit your needs anytime
you want to have a user profile module
associated with the registered user to
your site alright let's go ahead and add
a URLs file here and just like any other
from or any other Jango URLs file that
we've created we're gonna say from
Django doc config URLs dot defaults
import all and we need to define our URL
patterns
all right and basically what we want is
we want the profile to be able to be
visited you know from a URL so we need
to create those URLs so that we can if
we're looking at Chris Hawks profile we
can see his actual profile so we're
going to do that now so profile and then
just follow along with this regular
expression
sorry this should not be this should be
user profile' should be the name of the
module
and I'm going to create two additional
user profiles one is let me think here
alright so we're gonna have three
different methods we're gonna have one
where it's a outside user looking at
individuals profile right so you don't
have specific information that may be
hidden to a logged in user is not going
to be seen externally so that's gonna be
handled by this profile URL up top the
second one is going to be update
profiles so basically what URL are we
posting to whenever somebody updates
their profile the third one is going to
be okay what is the user profile look
like when the actual registered user is
logged in and viewing their own profile
so just follow along yeah this is like I
said this is more advanced level stuff
but if you really want to I guess take
the next step you know what I mean it's
it's definitely something that you just
have to kind of grit your teeth and get
through the name of this view we're
going to just call it update profile
alright and then the final one is going
to be I was trying to think if I'll just
call this your profile I guess and then
I take out all this middle stuff here
okay all right so that should be pretty
good I think I could really take this a
step further and say update your profile
but you know what date profile is fine I
know if I want to keep it as as short as
possible I think all right so that
should be good for our URLs now we're
going to get into even more complicated
stuff with our views and since this
isn't you know exactly like I said a
beginner level thing it's gonna be just
a little bit difficult for if you're
jumping right into this video if you
haven't led up to the previous Django
videos in a series but let's go ahead
and add some stuff here I'm just gonna
copy and paste this in here for to be
able to save time another thing we're
gonna add is we're gonna add something
called Django got court context process
there's an import CSRF which protects
against cross-site forgery and let's go
ahead and we're gonna add our first
method here so it's going to be another
we're using a this is like a helper tag
I guess is I forget to name a bit but
this at logging required is a shortcut
that Django adds you can add your view
which it says that in order for
something to be able to view that they
have to be logged in now in order to be
able to use that particular shortcut we
have to actually import any login
required attribute so to do that I'm
gonna paste this statement and from
Django can't rip off decorators import
login required all right and let's go
ahead and do this update profile and
it's gonna take a request
now the first things first is we need to
actually get the user profile the person
that's being updated so we're gonna say
user profile it's user profile
objects taht you get and we're gonna say
user equals request dot user nice we're
actually grabbing the user profile with
the currently logged in person with that
statement now since we're acquiring the
database for the user profile object um
in order for Jenner to know what that is
we have to import the user profile class
and it's great indeed that we're gonna
say from user profile import user
profile it actually that needs to be
models user profile dot models import
user profile all right now we're gonna
go ahead and um when they update their
their profile we need to have a form
associated with that so I kind of wanted
to get in the forms in the next video
but for right now I think we are gonna
just go ahead and lump in the form into
this video all right so we're actually
gonna do that now this is another not
really complicated thing but Django has
the ability to have forms to a lot of it
basically handles a lot of hard work for
you when you're dealing with forms
because they can have automatically a
form associated with a particular model
object so when you define a model first
name last name email stuff like that if
you build a form you can basically say
hey build me a form based off of that
model and it'll have all the form
elements that have the right thing so if
it's a date/time it'll have like a date
picker and all that stuff and it just
does that all out of the box which saves
you a lot of time because typically
whenever you have a form you're updating
a model so we're gonna kind of gloss
over that as quickly as we possibly can
in this video but let's go ahead and I'm
add something to our user profile model
and it's going to be called a form
py and really it's supposed to be form
to stop you why is more standard for it
and in this we're going to go ahead and
just say from Django import forms from
models import user profile and we'll
create a class called user profile form
and then it's going to instantiate from
forms dot the model form and then we're
also going to add a inter class here
class meta and we're going to say model
equals user profile and we're gonna
exclude something so this is a keyboard
that you can add here basically saying
don't add anything to that
foreign key relationship or that
one-to-one field that we had for our
user profile existing with our user
object we don't want any of that to be
included in the form right so that's
what that does it basically says um
don't do that okay alright so we've done
our form here now that we've we've done
that we can go back to our views and we
can import that form into our our
application and let me see here we named
it user profile form so when we go to
our views we need to go ahead and import
that with the same name so we're gonna
say from-from forms
import user profile form
all right and now that now that we've
imported it we can actually use it so
it's great a form in this video I'm
going to say form equals user profile
form and then in here we can actually
set the initial values for for whatever
they may have filled out already so like
we only have the name bio that's all
we're doing so we have bio we can say
hey and don't show me a form with no bio
information we could say pre-populated
with whatever is already there and we do
that based off of the User Profile
object that we query right here we can
just simply say pre populate it with
this user profile dot bottom bio and if
we had more object so we want the pre
pre populate it with we could always do
that as well finally we're going to say
return render to response and we're
gonna have our own let me say so I want
to make sure it's the name of the module
so we're a user profile and then it's
called update profile dot HTML and here
we're going to be returning to the
template a form and then we have to do
like we've always done request context
request
all right so let's go ahead and move
over to our templates directory here so
that we can create the proper folder for
our profile now and we'll add our HTML
file here which is going to be called
update profile and similar to what we
did with the band we want to go ahead
and inherit from our base page so just
copy the band code in there and since we
don't have anything we can just describe
just be a static name like update
profile
and we'll just say update your profile
all right so what we can do down here
let's get rid of this part and we're
going to add a form action equals on
this is actually going to be where it
goes to update the user profile and we
actually will need to for right now just
bear with me we're gonna call this user
user profile so it's actually gonna post
to that user profile view that we've not
yet created yet but we'll go over that
in just a minute so it's gonna be
request post now whenever you're dealing
with Django it has some built-in
protections to prevent the cross-site
forgery from occurring so we want to
make sure the CSRF token exists right
inside of the form element and let's
create a label here for bio
I'm probably won a br here and then down
below we can just simply say form and
dot bio and we do need a way of actually
submitting the four months we're ready
so let's just go ahead and add that now
button type equals submit we'll probably
want to add a style to eventually but
for right now let's just make it say
submit all right so let's go ahead and
go through the process of uploading all
of that stuff
now in order for us to be able to visit
the update your profile page we have to
actually add the URLs and this is where
I got into this user right here so like
we've done in the previous tutorials
regarding the band module that we had
created and we need to do the same thing
to the user profile module which means
that we need to add it to the URLs file
so under this other includes for social
off so let's go ahead and do the same
thing when I say URL
and we're going to call user include
user profile URLs
okay so it's gonna merge that up as well
as we made a ton of changes here let's
see if we throw any errors right off the
bat and we do know module name default
it's actually supposed to be defaults so
we must have done that in the user
profile using URL yeah this should say
defaults
all right so we got to secure the
initial setup there and we'll go to user
and then update profile I think actually
may have jacked up our regular
expression there
yeah we're missing the closing
parentheses
all right now one of the things that
well one of the reasons why this is
going to fail is because our newly
created profile is not even in existence
yet so let's go ahead and run the sync
DB and really since I'm gonna be
updating user profile a lot we need to
go to make sure that we're using South
so so right off the bat let's go to the
schema migration as we've discussed in
previous videos and we'll say user
profile and initial what up with that
didn't we name it that
okay um you know obviously I forgot to
add it to our settings not py file
anytime we add a new new app we always
have to add it to our installed apps I
should have known that okay so we add it
to our installed apps re re update that
let's run our schema migration again
okay now after building the schema
migration we just say migrate user
profile and with the admin let's pull up
the admin again
name is not callable or an attribute oh
yeah and we actually got ahead of
ourselves there as well sorry this is
typical programming whenever you're
changing and adapting things we change
our admin here we're basically saying
hey search by name but it doesn't
actually exist
so we need to make this a little bit um
a little bit smarter we wanted to say
user all right that nut should give us
the desired desired result I think all
right let's merge that back up
alright the reason for that is because
of the three URLs that we created and we
have not finished it so it's these guys
right here so that's for right now just
comment those out and it merges back up
will uncomment that in just a moment
okay it would actually help if I uh if I
commented out the correct one here all
right hopefully this works Jesus sorry
about that
finally okay alright so it's been a
little bit of time since we've been back
in our profile here but now you can see
that we have user profiles which is our
brand new thing and we want to go ahead
and create a new user profile for the
one existing user that we have and I'll
just write a little bio about myself
all right so now what we want to do is
we want to go to newbies again we're
going to go to user update profile
all right I'm one other thing that we
need to do is we need to run sync TV
okay
all right so I was looking at the URLs
here and the reason why is I have
another error which is here the aura
needs to be on the outside of the quote
so it's been one thing after another but
this is you know typical anytime you're
developing after just try to figure out
okay would I mess up right user profile
has no attribute object yep so it's just
the next error and the line of errors
that we have one on here but none of
these are big deals it needs to be
objects
and request context is not imported
which it needs to be imported so pretty
much every view you're gonna deal with
you need to have the request context
imported
all right well after a little bit of a
delay there hopefully you guys were able
to continue to bear with me we have the
profile that is the form that is being
built from the form object that we
created and you can see that the value
that was currently in the database is
already pre-populated in there so you
don't end up overwrite and what somebody
may have already entered into your site
and we can go ahead and update it here
and we'll say this is a test message now
the reason why fails is because we are
trying to we're trying to post to a user
profile view that does not exist so
let's go ahead and create that now
all right so for starters let's go ahead
and make sure we have the log-in
required decorator added and we're gonna
call this define user profile actually
no we didn't call it that we called it
update profile and the first thing we're
gonna say here is if request dot method
equals post form equals user profile
form and then we're gonna save request
stop post will say if form that is valid
user profile equals user profile dot
objects I get user equals request dot
user and we're gonna say for our bio
with respect we'll define our bio here
bio equals form dot cleaned data bio and
then we'll say user profile dot bio
equals bio so make sure it's clean make
sure we're not uploading in sort of
viruses or anything like that now once
we've done that we want to go ahead and
take our user profile user profile dot
Save I'm sorry that's not just a dot
Save
and then we're gonna return redirects to
http WWI noob music.com user and then
we're gonna direct them to the profile
page which should be their profile page
let's say string to make sure it goes to
the right profile page when user profile
dot ID now we want to do an else
statement in case the form is not valid
or not posted correctly we'll say user
review form basically just sets the form
to blank it's technically called an
unbound form and then finally we want to
return redirect user this is assuming
that it's not successful at all we'll
say update profile we'll send it back to
the original page that came from alright
so now that we have actually a means of
extracting the data out of the form and
then posting that to the database by
using this user profile that save method
let's go ahead and run this again and
see if we can get the form to actually
save the new data
we have to uncomment the the URLs file
to
I swear I was up here
well it's not user review form it's user
user profile form
goddamnit alright we need to import
something else I Django it's another
shortcut for so from Django shortcuts
just import and redirect and we'll paste
this at the top
and now the view and does not exist
I thought we call the you or your
profile what the hell did we call it
I always said update profile yeah
actually we can't have a queue update
profiles what the hell am I talking
about
alright so it's called your profile
can't have two methods with the same
name obviously that's not gonna work so
well
alright so finally let's read and see if
we can test this out this has been a mo
ever of a tutorial alright so let's see
here so reason why is the redirect here
user profile that page does not exist
and this does not exist either should
say your profile
all right so let's change this real
quick back to post back to update
profile I am the reason why it's jacked
up is actually the URL that the the HTML
pages are pointing to is not pointing to
the right location so this update
profile I says user profile needs to say
update profile
all right so this thing just redirects
right back so we'll just say testing and
it doesn't work you know what I've
decided
my name's suck ass you know what I mean
like these naming conventions are
horrible so hopefully you guys might
want to just think about a different
naming convention I'm kind of just doing
this off the fly it sucks your profile
shouldn't be the name of it I was
obviously posting to update profile
which is the same name as the page that
we're currently on so it's clearly not
going to work clearly not gonna go
anywhere do anything which is what we're
seeing it to and it really needs to go
to this stupid name and you know that
name doesn't make a whole heck of a lot
of sense but you know what that's what
it is right now so it definitely
shouldn't be posting to update profile
because that is the page that we're
finally on
and I said saying um let me see I got
too much going on here
hmm
what did this thing redirect you
all right so just because these names
suck I'm gonna say send update profile
this is going to redirect here
okay and then we need to update our URLs
all right so that makes a little bit
more sense than what we had before I
want to go to an update now
and we also need to update the templates
for where it is posting
once again I have the regular expression
spelled wrong that is just
sorry guys get a little bit frustrated
because I usually don't want you know
something like this happened while I'm
actually doing the tutorial series but
there's really not much I can do I'm
trying to develop the stupid site while
making a tutorial just trying to help
people out and really improbably just
piss some people off but oh well what
can I do you know I mean she's testing
I'm gonna submit this now so now we're
not getting paid is not found we're just
just test so it's finally working when
we play it like test test test the
redirects not working but you can see
that the updated information is being
sent to the oh there's an extra W in
there yeah all right anyway so the test
was being were it would it would go all
the way to the database and then it was
redirecting and sending it to an invalid
domain this is finally working sorry
everybody and I still have an updated e
template I just upload the template
actually and not to my project okay
sorry guys this is working now
and this is working you're not gonna
leave me because it's actually going to
the profile page which we have not
created that was the third and final
domain URL that we were going to add to
our view to actually view profile 1
which is the first profile object that
was created which is my user name and
we'll go ahead and add that now alright
so we're gonna try to make this as quick
as possible this has already been a long
video and I apologize but we're almost
done here so we're gonna have a request
and then we'll have a profile ID of the
person that's being requested this is
similar to what we did with the band and
we're gonna go ahead and we'll end up
we're gonna add a little bit of a
shortcut type of thing that I had done
just before so basically when they're
viewing their own profile I want the
message to be like a profile ID of 0 so
we're going to say if the profile ID
equals 0 which no user profile can
actually equal 0 but if it does we'll
say if request user dot is authenticated
we'll say user profile equals user
profile dot objects get P k equals
profile ID and then we'll say else user
profile and really this else is going to
be if it's not equal to 0 and we'll say
user profile equals user profile objects
dot kids
user equals user profile dot user oh
 that's not right we're gonna say P
k equals profile ID
okay and then we're going to return
render to response we'll just call this
profile dot HTML will send back to the
template user profile user profile and
then just paste this in here
all right so we have that now created
let's go ahead and go over to our URLs
and then comment this last line here and
then we need to create the actual
template so let's go down here and do
that now it's gonna be called profile
dat HTML and similar to update profile
I'll paste this in here and now since we
have the actual user profile name we can
go ahead and just say user profile name
or dot user dot user name and then some
of the things that we want to add just
so that we can actually see the actual
users user name let's go ahead and take
this form stuff out of here the h1 will
be the actual user's name so we'll say
user profile dot user dot user name and
then for right now just because we're
running out of time I'm gonna go ahead
and just inside a div container just say
user profile got bio all right so it's
good now these templates to our project
and we also have to change I just I did
the wrong regular expressions across the
board on the URL so I don't know what
the hell I was thinking there but we
need that to be updated so after we do
that and we go to profile one we have a
new issue a template does not exist for
profile that profile that HTML I thought
we added it but I guess did I not save
it correctly
let's see pointing to the wrong
we should say user profile
so that was a lot of bullcrap there but
we now have the username of Chris Hawkes
now this could be seen by anybody
because what we said is um if dammit
what we said is that if they visit this
page you're taking the user profile
number and you're querying the database
for the user profile associated with
that ID that got passed and now if I was
logged in and I went ahead and I sent in
a zero request we're looking for that
zero request and what we're looking for
is the ability to not query the database
actually under that circumstance so yeah
I mean there's a little bit of a fault
of my logic here but what I was trying
to do is say if the profile ID equals
zero basically show this currently
logged in user their profile that they
should see and everybody else would see
you know this particular profile so let
me just fix that logic real quick in our
view is not py file and then this entire
complicated video series of user profile
is going to be wrapped up and I
apologize for the errors but I'm kind of
you know coding as I go along and this
is just typical trial and error type
stuff that anybody's gonna try to you
know run into really whenever you're
developing like this but here's the
Fault in the logic I said if profile ID
equals zero which it did and the users
authenticated which they are in our case
and get p k equals profile ID well
there's no profile idea of zero
obviously right so we want to take this
out and you're actually going to say
user equals request and dot user so what
you're saying is if they're logged in
and the ID is zero get the user of the
currently authenticated user and you get
their user profile based on that user
information so let me go ahead and
update that and we
you know here so once again this is how
normally somebody would see somebody's
profile if the request is coming at zero
your viewing your own profile which in
this case it you know it's the exact
same information but I would obviously
have like some sort of update your
profile link which would take them to
that form that we just added where they
can update their bio and if there was
like secret information that only they
should see as you know as the registered
user of the account and you would be
able to display it here now if somebody
else went to profile zero they obviously
wouldn't be seeing Chris Hawkes his
information they would actually be
seeing their own information if they're
logged in and if they're not logged in
they wouldn't even get that far that
would just simply get it a 500-page
which you would want to gracefully
handle on the application which will
touch on that at a later time adding a
500 error page and a 404 error page all
right guys so once again this very been
a very complicated video of this series
and really if you're not worried about
authentication you can skip this entire
video but if you are dealing with some
sort of a relatively tricky profile type
system then this is definitely a good
video to just try to bear with and get
through and hopefully you guys have a
better understanding now all right thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
