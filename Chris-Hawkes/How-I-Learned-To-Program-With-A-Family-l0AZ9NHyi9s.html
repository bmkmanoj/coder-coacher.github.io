these questions coming because i love
these questions because every once a
while like man I don't know what to make
a video on I don't think them to be able
to do one this week or you know the next
three days or something like that and
it's just uh and then I start cramming
to try to get things in and that's just
not good but the questions I think it
really brings a lot out and not just
that I have these answers but also that
I have the same questions as you guys
sometimes so floods manasse keys that he
says I'm as a married guy with kids in a
job how do you manage work life keeping
updated on new technology I'm not
working right now so I'm learning as
much as I can but I have a crazy
schedule wake up at 12 p.m. lunch
studying until seven to eight some time
with my wife and dinner back to studying
until 5am I'm kind of a night owl and
it's hard to explain as a family that I
can't spend more time with them to keep
up so there or I would say so some of
these things I faced as well and it's
actually one of the worst parts of being
a programmer the fact you have to keep
up because the technology changes very
quickly but one of the things I will say
is that if you if you keep up on stuff I
mean and when I say keep up you
shouldn't have to cram knowledge like
six hours a day every single day or even
I would say more than maybe one extra
hour a day or so I mean I would think
people can even reduce it down all the
way to that also if you have a job that
allows you to learn as you go in most
jobs that I've seen allow you to learn
on the job because we all admit that
with especially front-end technology
things change so much then we're dealing
with one frame work one day and another
frame work the next day by the time you
get back into you know framework a that
thing's already been rewritten three or
four times and there's always different
you know different ways of doing in the
documentation becomes out of date
basically there's no way anybody can
possibly be the master of all of that
stuff but most jobs are I think
understanding of the fact that you will
have to to kind of kind of freshen up on
certain subjects and allow you to watch
for you obviously videos or pluralsight
or YouTube for you know I think you know
that knowledge that you need in order to
get whatever sort of job you have done
now if you allowed yourself to get so
far to the point we're like you don't
know what modules are in Java
you don't know what me s6 is where you
don't know why we use that or why we use
web pack or you know what a task runner
is if you don't know what minification
is there are JavaScript developers
basically people that write JavaScript
that I've seen in the wild is that don't
understand some of those basic basic
things and and when I say basic to them
it's not basic at all so it you know I
sound like an asshole thing that's basic
but the thing is is that that's the kind
of terminology that we've been talking
about in the JavaScript world for at
least you know what four years maybe
more so where i was using jquery at one
point I was thinking that you know
jquery was the end-all be-all we were
kind of moving into that whole nodejs
and then all the you know the requirejs
in the commonjs and all the different
modules the way that we could load
modules whether it was a synchronous or
using something like you know web pack
or the Gulf and browserify so these
tools were actually moving in and for a
while I wasn't keeping up to date with
understanding why we were using them but
the problem was for me is that I needed
to build up enough knowledge and what I
was doing at the time you know could be
even be able to focus on some of those
newer stuff but the best advice I can
give is that if we don't allow ourselves
to get too far out of date in the first
place then I don't think it's going to
be so daunting that we have to cram so
much studying and one thing that is a
bit you know nerve-racking I think for
anybody that works in the corporate
world is sometimes you're going to be
given responsibility for certain things
that you just don't feel comfortable
with or that you didn't write any of it
it was a team of people that wrote it
some of the code could be documented
well it could be documented poorly there
could be unit tests there could be no
unit tests and the only thing you can
really do in that case is you know no
amount of studying in the world is going
to be able to just allow you to
understand how to deal with that
situation it's more about okay I need my
code base that I'm going to be working
on and I need to spend you know a day or
two maybe five or six hours this week
studying okay why are we using number
one what tools are we using there are
any reasons that I can conceptualize
from the data here that
indicate why we're using those tools or
anything or with somebody just tool
happy and decided to use this because
they want to learn it but now you have
to identify like in a new code base what
are those new tools that they're using
so okay so it's using the web pack and
obviously if you haven't used what back
for you need to spend some time learning
web pack but just because the market
itself is like hey we think roll-up is
the next thing you don't have to mess
with roll-up if your day job does not
require you to know roll it would be
helpful if maybe took a look at my video
and understood you know that whole tree
shaking feature of roll up because other
than that it's really the same thing as
web pack so the really the entire thing
people need to understand these days is
that we write write our JavaScript code
in multiple different files and then we
bring all those multiple different files
together and and then we also then you
know we minify it so we take out all the
white space and we reduce the amount of
you notified as well where we change the
names of the variables and functions to
to make it take up less disk space so
that's really just you know in a
nutshell like all we're really going
with with javascript and then we make it
a lot more complicated because of all
those different tools that actually do
some of those different pieces of
functionality there but you know the
core of it also is that we're writing
es6 so understanding the new es6 syntax
shouldn't take more than maybe a week or
two now it doesn't mean you're going to
be an expert in and be like oh I
remember how to use the arrow function
and promises and how to import modules
you know the way that I'm supposed to or
you know there's going to be points
where you're like oh yeah I understand I
remember that es6 can do that i now need
to just google real quick on es6 look at
a stack overflow answer and figure out
everywhere you know remember you know
how it is that you do that so that i
think that that is also normal and if
it's not then you know tough shit i mean
i did anybody can I guess tell me that
I'm not a programmer because to me
that's normal and most of the people
that I've ever worked with so one of the
best ways of actually getting overall
experience is actually to build project
so one of the things I like to do is I
like to actually if I'm going to be
using a new web technology
I built my base ijs framework because I
wanted a framework that I thought it
could be easy for me to just you know
spin up and then be able to implement
reactor and a lot of people could say
well use just as well use Express and
all that stuff will express I mean
didn't have the template engine working
by the salt right after you know enable
that and I just I wanted to have my own
framework anyway but the thing is is
that the main reason why I even learned
are built that framework is because I
wanted to use get with the Visual Studio
code application so instead of me
looking at a tutorial or you know trying
to study out of a book or some sort of
web blog or something about how to use
get with Visual Studio code I just went
ahead and create a freaking project and
then where I needed to spot tracking
Google certain things that's what I did
and I feel like it allowed me to gain a
lot of knowledge and just how to manage
a project really and how to get it on
github and do my kid pushes and pulls
and things like that because really to
the to date I have been more involved in
like the TFS way and so I feel like
those are the best ways to learn so what
may take you you know a week to kind of
finalized and you know get your
framework and project set up on github
or maybe it can even take you a day
depending on the amount of knowledge you
have that I feel like gives you a much
more long-lasting knowledge of being
able to work inside of this industry
because then it just you're not reading
out of a book you're not reading
somebody else's experience you're more
it's more about building your own
experience and then looking up little
details of how other people were able to
do it some people tell you to look at a
code base and that actually is very
helpful in some cases when you're very
experienced and you know the technology
that you're using but I can tell you
that you know looking at some github
projects on you know like react or
something like that it gets me it can be
very daunting even for a senior program
to be able to look at something like
that and i read a phrase about how to
handle you know a complicated codes a
specially ones that don't have unit
tests or good documentation that can be
very unwieldy like with the amount of
files and everything I've
some huge solutions that were just
complete monsters to deal with and the
best way to you can do that is to just
take it one bite at a time how do you
eat an elephant you eat it one bite at a
time and don't eat elephants I mean I
was entering our nice things but that's
kind of that whole mentality that you
can only do what you can do and you take
it piece by piece so no amount of
cramming and studying is going to allow
you to just magically understand how to
deal with that situation only experience
where you say I'm going to look at all
the files in this solution I'm going to
go one by one that might take me a few
hours I'm gonna look at every file even
though i don't understand everything
that that file is doing that's perfectly
fine I at least want to i want my brain
to say okay you know i'm looking at this
file it looks like it does this just
make assumptions about what you think it
does without having to really dissect a
code and then just go to the next file
the next while the next file and then
once you do that that's when you want to
you know fire up the application if you
can and then you want to start playing
break points and you want start looking
at individual pieces and really probably
the pieces that jumped out to you when
you were looking through you know the
technology there one of the things even
before that step also is that if there
are different tools that you notice that
this application is using that you're
not familiar with you probably need to
write that down on a list of you know
piece of paper and just come back to
that after you're done reviewing that
initial you know review of the code and
to make sure you understand each one of
those pieces of technology and then that
kind of goes back to ok if it's using
roll up jas the best way to use royal jf
spend up an express J application or a
base ijs application install roll up jas
by used to watch my tutorial on that if
that was helpful to really I kind of cut
straight to the point like get that set
up in an actual project don't go to roll
up Jas and start reading through all its
documentation of all of its different
parts and stuff like that because that
is where you're going to end up spending
eight hours a day so these are just some
of my thoughts guys on this subject I
know I've been talking for about 11
minutes now so I have I think a lot and
I have a lot of those same fears where
it's like I don't want to spend all
time studying to keep up and the fact
that matter is there I feel like I feel
like I do enough studying on my own so
I'm not going to be able to cut it at a
particular position I'm just going to be
willing to you know to call it a loss or
basically probably look for something
else I mean I would rather not that you
know how that happened but there may be
certain positions out there that that I
just can't keep up with and I don't know
about them I hope that's not the case
but in it but if it is then you know
there are places that I know that I can
keep up so it's just that's that's the
mentality that I need to have because
worrying about not being able to keep up
and and and things like that even though
i do the same thing I try to tell myself
there is no point in doing any of that
because if you're worrying about that
kind of thing it's not going to help you
so even if even if it's something that
you should maybe you'll have a mindset
of or that's something that could affect
you down the road it doesn't it doesn't
help anything to worry about it so you
can only do what you can do and that's
and I've also said as well that if
you're not spending time with your
family getting out doing exercise and
all this other stuff you probably feel
pretty bad about you know the situation
at your end luckily for me my kids are
already starting it older a little bit
so that you know they're much more
actually any other quite a bit older now
but I spent quite a bit of time with
them as young children where you know
they were baking a babies toddlers
growing up into grade school kids and
and now I have a teenage daughter and a
son who's ten years old so I i I've been
fortunate enough to be able to to spend
I feel like a pretty decent amount of
time but at the same time I also know
that I dedicated a pretty good portion
of my life so far to getting where I'm
at and you know I've had to make the
sacrifices that so many other people who
have and I think that in a way that
sucks but at the same time like whose
life doesn't actually have the same
thing I get would it be better for me to
work part-time and make you know eight
to ten dollars an hour and come home and
not ever be able to buy my kids health
insurance or they'd have to live off the
government you know for most of their
food and their in their clothes you know
I mean like there's there are sacrifices
that we make not just for ourselves but
for our family and for the most part if
you're like me you do it for your
family you do it so that you can leave
something for your family when you're
gone I mean that's a lot of the
motivation behind you know why it is
that I try to do what I do but I mean it
we don't live in some perfect world like
maybe if you hit the lottery you could
stay home every day and hang out with
the wife and kids every single day I
think that would probably drive
everybody crazy though the wife should
probably be interested in some of her
own things that she's interested in and
have some of her own friends husband
should also be doing the same thing
being interested in like fishing golfing
boating if you can afford that you know
even like four me Mia mutant probably
you want to get out how she want to do
those things that's going to make it
easier to learn because if you're not
doing that stuff that I think it's going
to be harder as well because just you're
not getting out there you're not living
one of the reasons and one of the things
I talked about a lot as well is that
when you're trying to solve business
problems to help being out in the real
world to understand what problems
business is being faced with then you
only get that when you go out into the
real world and live otherwise you're in
this tunnel vision I need to learn this
code because I'm going to do something
with it and then another thing to last
thing I'm going to say on the subject is
that living close to your employer also
helps because if you're somebody has to
be in the office then that is a you know
that's that can be a tough thing like
for me I just recently took a job where
I have a longer commutes from adding an
hour to my day that is an hour that I
can't study it's an hour that I can
listen to audio books that I couldn't
listen to before so I kind of guy I look
at that on the positive side but it's an
hour now that I don't have available to
me so it's also crossed my mind as well
it's like well if I'm already dedicating
an hour for this new job then where do i
find you know another hour that could
replace maybe the hour that I was using
before to keep up so those same things
have crossed my mind but the only thing
I can really say is that you know we
make these you know these sacrifices
like I took this new job for doing
opportunities and and I made that
conscious decision to do that so I'm
living with that reality now one day I
could move closer maybe but I'm not
necessarily sure that I want to move
down there yet I want to i'm going to
give it time and I think I wouldn't want
to move by
in the middle of the school year but
those are those are things that have
crossed my mind did not and also i will
say if you have a laptop most developers
have laptops you can bring the laptop
home with you on the weekend and i know
that sucks but uh you know for this new
job like I brought my laptop laptop home
this weekend because I wanted to take a
look at some of this you know that's
like the first week at the new job I've
just been basically their training
course kind of understanding the
industry but I haven't been looking at
any code so today or Friday afternoon
was the first day actually looked at any
code and you know I wanted to take the
laptop home so I could understand a
little bit more about some of the codes
that I'm going to initially be working
on and I think that's it has two lot to
do with you know being in your job and
hopefully you know when you get more
comfortable you don't have to do that
kind of thing but that's something that
I took upon myself and I didn't have to
nobody asked me to do it nobody expected
me to do it but again it's so that I
don't get to the point where I feel like
I have to cram so much I'd rather learn
and kind of balance it out then have to
cram all right guys that's it man that's
a lot of information I know but
hopefully it helps somebody out there
you guys take care thank you bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intent of course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here and now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in the Suevi course it's geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery no jf react
angular how to use github so a lot of
the things that you're going to need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
