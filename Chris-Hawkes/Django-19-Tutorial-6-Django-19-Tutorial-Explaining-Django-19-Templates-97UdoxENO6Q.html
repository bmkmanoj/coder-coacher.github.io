last video we looked at how to send back
some data from our view function and we
did it the quick and dirty way where we
were just sending back raw HTML which
would be very fast if like all you
needed to do is send back like a simple
you know test page or something like
that you probably don't need a
full-blown template but Django does
offer its own templating engine the
engine itself can be thought of as
similar to even more popular view
engines that you hear about nowadays
which is like jinja to even react which
is like an all JavaScript engine it's
essentially just say you know it handles
the view as a templating engine but
Django has one built in it's pretty good
works out of the box and it's actually
the best I've ever seen I've used razor
with MVC net and I like Django is a view
and view engine much better as far as
the templating just the syntax and
everything I think razors a little bit
ugly but it raises not too bad either
but it's the same boat the same same
type of concept if you've ever done that
and if not don't worry about it we'll
get into it right now so let's go ahead
and get rid of this HTTP response
because we're no longer going to use it
and we're going to be importing
something else we're going to go from
the Django template response and we're
going to import the template response
object so now in order to be able to
render this let's go ahead and just say
a copy i'm going to copy this from
another test that i have here so i don't
mess up anything and the template itself
we just we make use of the object that
we just imported and then we pass back
the request object which is mandatory
and then we tell it to locate a template
which does not exist yet we're going to
be adding it and then this here you want
to get into the habit of if you're going
to be passing down data from your view
from you this is all server side stuff
so if you want to send data from your
server and pass it down to the client
browser through their web you know to
their web page you would pass it down
inside a Python dictionary and that's
what these curly braces are
we're not going to get into that right
now as far as passing down data let's
just get the template working first so
since we have this index template this
views file is under our video app so
what we probably want to do is we're
going to create a video folder inside of
our templates directory which does not
exist yet so we'll have a templates
directory with a video directory and
then we're going to have an index HTML
for the main video file so let's go
ahead and handle creating that template
directory now so if I go over here I
really feel like movies 2 is a terrible
name for the app but it's too late now
alright so this is all the stuff that's
inside of our app itself what I want to
do is I want to put my actual templates
directory right here and I'm going to
say new folder and we'll call it
templates and let's go ahead and inside
the templates will add that video folder
that we just talked about and then
inside here let's go ahead and just
create a HTML page and I'll do that
using i'll use my editor for that so
what I can do here is I can say stop the
debugger here
what I'm doing here this is a visual
studio specific but visual studio has
the ability to manage multiple projects
so i can have like my main you know
python code right here and then i have
this templates directory and I just find
it easier because now I can just go
ahead and use my editor to add like a
web page so i can say HTML page and this
is going to be called index because
remember that's that's what we decided
to call it we call the index here we
could have named it your mama or
whatever it doesn't matter and let's
just go ahead and put in a message here
just to show that we are getting I don't
know what I just pressed just to show
that we are getting a message here so
this is the video template
now we need to go into the movie app of
our project and we're going to go into
the settings file and we need to do some
stuff inside here in order for the
templates to work so let's go down to
this template directory here and this is
going to be an absolute path to where
your your templates can be found
so mine is going to be /aa jects and
then 4 / movie two and then forward
slash templates and make sure you have
that forward slash on there go ahead and
get used to putting in the extra comma
just in case because that will bite you
with a Python tuple eventually so
projects movie too so this is just a
straight location to this templates
folder see his projects movies too so
it's just a straight path to where that
folder can be found
alright so now that we've done that we
should be pretty pretty good to go I
think let's go ahead and run the app and
see if I'm missing something I said in
the same video I'm actually the last
video i did I said I was tired and I
just kind of feel tired right now I need
to go to bed but I'm trying to pump out
a few videos tonight if I if I can
so we're going to go to movie or no it's
video my bad dammit see I knew I was
tired did I call that thing movie no I
called a video that's good so video
index what I call it in the views video
index ok so that's good alright so it
might need to say /video then maybe
hmm yeah my error here is um my folders
called movies too instead of movie too
which is like I said terrible name so
the template directory was wrong so
let's get rid of that forward slash
because that's not going to be needed
now let's see if that one guy was right
maybe this will reflect if I oh no I
think I have to restart it
so let's see if it's found now all right
so now we're Excel was just simply a
typo so instead of actually passing down
raw HTML if we inspect the element we're
going to see a full HTML web page which
is the exact template that we sent down
so it's still a very basic message but
most of the time you're not going to
have a very basic message you're going
to have a very complicated website that
is you know it all throughout the
template it's going to have data it's
going to have images and it's going to
link to external files and libraries and
it's going to do all kinds of crazy
stuff so we'll get in to all that
eventually but for right now we're going
to keep it real simple this HTML page
typically you do not want to have like
your entire doctype your HTML your
header all this stuff that is repeated
amongst every page like say because this
is you know the video page maybe you
have you know 15 different apps in every
app has 15 different HTML pages it would
be nice if you could reuse some of this
code so that you don't have to repeat
yourself over and over again because
anytime you repeat yourself it may not
seem like a big deal but it's always
adding increase risk for error so
whatever can go wrong will eventually go
wrong and it's a good idea just to
minimize code reuse or to maximize code
reuse and minimize you know duplicate
code so to do that django has a layout
page that you can call and that's what
we're going to look at right now so
let's go ahead and in our templates
directory we're going to add a new
folder
which I'm gonna have to do that through
my Explorer here so inside this template
so we're going to have a folder and
we're going to call this master or you
know we'll call it layout I think that's
typically what they call it in the
Django community so now that we have the
layout
come on
so I just need to refresh the folder so
we're going to add a HTML page to this
layout and we're just going to call it
layout one and I'm going to take all
this code from the layout page well
actually I only need to do that it's
already there alright so what we're
going to do instead Django has little
tags that are called block tags and
block tags identify places in your
template where you want to actually
customize and anything that's not
customized is going to be repeated for
every page that uses that master page so
you're never going to want to have a
hard-coded title that matches every page
or pay your title is dynamic meaning it
changes all the time so we're going to
have a tag right here every time you
have the way the tags work is you have a
curly brace and then a % than a space
and then you're going to say block you
always say block and then space and then
whatever name you want and this has to
be a valid name so it can be title it
can be title to you can't go like that
though that's not a valid name you can't
have spaces so it follows the same
convention as a Python variable name so
don't be create you know creative and
cute and try to you know make that
complicated make it a tag that is easy
to understand make it one word if
possible if you have two words use an
underscore so here's a block title and
we can copy and paste this because we're
going to put down in here we're going to
block content is going to be like where
the meat of the application is right
here so here's our master page and that
looks good for right now so if we go to
our index page we can now get rid of all
this stuff that we don't know we no
longer need and we're going to use a
different keyword up here we're going to
say extends and then when you say
extends you're going to actually give it
the location to where the layout for the
layout folder is
so that should work so you know layout
and the layout one and then here we're
going to say just like we did before in
fact let me just pace it block title but
instead of just declaring the block this
time you're going to actually put the
title so this is our video page in fact
you know that's kind of a stupid title
you want to keep it short and sweet so
video page and then we'll say block
content and block and then inside this
block content this is typically you can
put HTML in here this is all just
straight HTML
and then we can even put it so we can
even put a image tag so basically I'm
just trying two identically lay out a
lot of the common HTML elements that
you'll probably end up putting into a
template and this is all just going to
be printed out pretty ugly so I may have
to refresh it I don't know actually it
took effect right away so obviously the
image is huge you'd want to use CSS to
shrink that down but you can see that
this template page is now operating just
the same way but we look at the like you
can see the title to page video page
right there that's the title that we
gave and if we look at the page source
you can see that it has all that common
stuff that's inside the layout page and
then this stuff that's in the middle
here is all the stuff from you know that
custom content block that we passed in
from the index page so now the index
pages i use is the master page by this
statement here is very short and concise
and easy to maintain and you know you
can have multiple layout files if you're
if you're you know page structures
change dramatically but I can tell you
that as I've gotten further along in my
web development skills i mean i don't
typically have more than a couple of
master pages you know at all and most
the time I can just get by with just one
so I've even worked on major
corporations websites where it's just
one so yeah so anyway that's a pretty
cool feature it's built in a Django's
templates the templates do a massive
amounts of stuff I mean there's there's
a ton there and I can tell you from
looking at other technologies I find
Django's technology that's written by
the open source community to be second
to none I mean it's great compared to a
lot of the other technologies i'm using
i wish all technology was documented as
well as Django's Django's website this
tells you about all the different
engines but I mean there is a ton of
stuff about things like
template tags that can be used so
there's like already built-in template
tags and what's called filters and stuff
like that we'll get into that later but
template tags on just to give you a
brief overview I mean you can do stuff
like like this auto escape means that
you can have like HTML on your page that
doesn't get get rendered as HTML you can
actually do for loops you know to
actually loop through data and stuff
like that which is something you'll
commonly do you can display date times
like here's the for loop I was telling
you about there's if an else statement
so if persons logged in display this if
not display that you have greater than
equal density of all the operators
logical operators that you would
normally have in the programming
language these includes we'll get into
that in a later view but it's very
similar to how we extended the master
page but if you wanted to have like your
your navigation go into its own separate
page you could actually have a
navigation and then include it by using
this include statement let's think so
like here's like this now so this is
actually displaying you know the date
time so the Python daytime is a very
complicated object it displays
differently for different you know
different cultures and time zones and
stuff like that so very complicated
thing but luckily it's already built
into the Django's template system so you
don't have to do any sort of like
complicated server-side manipulation to
display the right day time and values
instantly that so anyway we can go on
the verbatim tag if you guys are ever
going to get and start intertwining like
angular into your app angular's template
tags will conflict with Django's
template tags but this verbatim means
ignore the template tag so you can have
like angular style tags inside of a
Django template so that is something
that the angular crowd will want to know
if you want to use angular with your
django project other than that I mean
you can see obviously some of this stuff
is explanatory so it's going to
capitalize the first letter you can
content you can actually truncate words
meaning chopped off words so if you have
like you just want to display a
description you can display just you
know you can display just 140 characters
like Twitter or you could say 140 words
and Django's templates going to be smart
enough to be able to differentiate
what's a word not a word so basically
it's just a lot of code that it saves
you from having to write so a lot a lot
of stuff here that you have to learn it
takes a long time to master all this
stuff but the documentation like i said
is great alright guys so we're going to
end this video here this is all about
Django templates and I haven't decided
what the next video is going to be about
but just stay tuned please subscribe
please vote vote and I thank you for all
the support have a good night pipe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
