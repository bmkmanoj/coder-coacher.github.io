is john sama he's provided me the free
t-shirt I think there's a cool man he
ended up reaching out to me to say hey
I'm giving out you know these t-shirts
or whatever and you know he'd always use
another t-shirt
no John Johnson's the cool guy and a lot
of you guys would be like well he
doesn't talk about programming stuff all
the time if he's always like mixing out
how to hit on girls like how to be a
programmer at the same time with like
how to not a book review and stuff like
that I don't know anyway I liked his
content I really do I mean I do watch
him you know when I can but just like a
lot of you guys and my videos and things
like that you can't watch everybody
stuff when they're doing videos like
every other day or even every day and
the reason why we do that by the way is
that like YouTube will actually penalize
this for the most part of we're not
making videos almost on a daily basis at
least when it comes to growth and things
like that so when you when you want to
grow your YouTube channel you pretty
much you got to do a video like every
day or every other day probably that
would be my best advice at this point
the issue with that though is that if
you don't if you don't have if you don't
connect with people you know it's like
you're just kind of inundating them I
would say and even my stuff it's like
Matt I put I put out like too much
content there's no way anybody can watch
all of it so and I think it's
unfortunate in some sense because if I
do it like a video a week more people
would be able to see the stuff but then
it's like if I'm only doing a video a
week in that video is not very good or
like I just wasn't feeling it then I
think it can also you know hurt the
overall thing so anyway I just do what I
do and seems to be okay and thanks to
John once again for the t-shirt like
that he also gave me a sticker to simple
programmer um so I mean what have I been
doing the last couple weeks man I've
been working I've been working a lot man
like I said a lot of react read our
stuff like my whole world is always
around like es6 right now so everything
is like I'm kind of late so and I feel
like a noob with es6 because it's still
pretty new I'm just like a year and a
half ago I was
writing us dicks you know so this is
what maybe it was I think it was a year
and a half so you got to take these
dates and everything with a grain of
salt it's not like I remember 100% but
like all I know is that with this whole
modern day es6 react Redux kind of
environment and that a lot of people are
using even if you're if using mob X
instead of redox or something like that
but yeah the whole thing is new to me
it's new to other people and and whether
you've been a developer for a couple
years or even just a year I mean we're
all kind of new at this sort of thing so
it's like you know the modern day web
developer now is definitely more tying
tools together and and trying to figure
out why they don't work and get them to
work and stuff like that than it is
about like writing projects and things I
have some scratch so I mean I'm
interested to see where things are going
to go but I'm not like feel like right
now like I haven't been really creating
much of anything I work on my hipster
code website every now and then just
kind of you know maintaining it I would
say making sure that some of it is up to
date I do pay a writer mark Alyn on
there that's a write and I've had other
people one of my viewers Owen has
written articles for that site so I
appreciate that and that site actually
does okay I mean it's getting a few
thousand people a week and it seems to
be growing a little bit so I don't even
really push it on this channel so if you
guys I do write every now and then and
the writing is not that good I I think
I'm going to try to do that a little bit
more maybe try to put a little bit more
effort into it cuz right now like my
writing I used to like writing I used to
blog quite a bit but I just you know
with a lack of time and stuff like that
I just haven't really been doing that
too much although I do make like coding
snippets and stuff that I'll put on
there everything every now and then I
want to do more of that so basically my
point is guys check out my website
history code go to that I call it news
not only news more like a kind of a
commentary type of thing but you will
see like fresh content not just for me
from other people that write for now
this site that I've created so I do want
to try to drive people over there if I
can you know in case you want more Chris
off man when when the video stops
rolling
another thing do Richmond is a fantastic
town and I live in Fredericksburg
Virginia which is a city of about it's a
small city so like if you look at city
limits about 30,000 people somewhere
around there and then but when you look
at the like surrounding counties around
it like there's two major counties that
surround the city and each county has
like well over a hundred thousand people
in it so when you look here like the
Fredericksburg regional area there's
like you know probably 300,000 to
probably about 300,000 people I would
say so it's it's for a city the size
that it is not really sure how I would
describe it a if you've ever been to
like frederick maryland they're probably
you know similar in size I would say
something around there
Frederick might be a little bit bigger
but anyway not not a huge city right but
like I'm going to Richmond and in
Richmond like I said it's just a state
so it's a pretty awesome family there's
always something to do there's a lot of
new transient people so like for the
most part like I feel like I fit in the
most with transient town and and I've
heard the same thing about like a lot of
Texas towns like Austin Dallas Houston a
lot of people from like all over the
place in Richmond is it has a lot of
that going for it as well but it's just
much smaller and it's kind of on the up
and up
but like I've just met a lot of really
good people man from around Northern
Virginia from Austin from New York from
DC like a lot of these people are moving
down into the Richmond area because it's
an emerging tech scene and and they're
just fun to hang out with man so it
makes me feel a little bit younger than
I am I think and that's good man because
I'm not that old you're old as old as
you feel right so but I've been having a
lot of fun I think in Richmond and
almost to the point where it's like man
I feel like I'm on some sort of vacation
from my previous job which was Geico no
Geico is a fantastic company to kind of
have a career and things like that but
when I compare you know Geico to my
current employer like my current
employer is just it makes much more tech
it's a software company so and they're
not entirely like software they did they
have a business model in a commercial
real estate but like the it was
something like Geico I mean they're
they're an insurance
company primarily and they have a pretty
large IT presence so but they're not IT
first so like I've still been kind of
going through this whole transition of
working for it actual software company I
think there's a lot says a lot to learn
you know a lot that I'm learning along
the way so a lot of you guys do ask like
you know I want to be a developer and
things like that and I've kind of said
that there's like this difference
between like when I got in the
development I was trying to build
businesses I wanted to make you know
money on the web I wanted to show my
ideas ideas and things like that like it
wasn't necessarily about trying to find
like a better algorithm to do this or do
that or something like that but you know
I definitely respected it and I tried
but I guess there's like when some ways
like I think we need to try to figure
out what it is that we're actually
striving to do are we trying to make a
billion dollars are we trying to make a
million do we know what we're even going
to do is we make that kind of money and
you know what our plans are and whether
or not we even really need that amount
of money to even realize our plans and
sometimes like with software's I want to
get that software development job but do
you want to be in like a software
development shop or would you rather be
working for a smaller business and
helping their IT presence or or even a
larger company like you know like an
insurance company where they have you
know a business model that isn't
surrounded by IP and technology but the
point is is that like you find out you
know pretty quickly what it is that you
want to do you know once you're there
and then you find out pretty quickly
whether or not it was actually what you
would hope for and things like that so
we'd like it an actual software company
I'm like I'm having fun man it's a lot
of fun it's a great city and everything
I wouldn't mind living there for sure
but you know right now I'm also in a
pretty good spot but I don't know I
really have to decide whether or not I
want to move down there or not and when
we do when we make decisions like that
man we want to make sure that you have
you have options right so one of the
things that always be tailed above or
over my head and mostly on my own
biggest critic like I have my own worst
critic for sure you know not having that
college degree is something that I think
what I've seen man like I've seen it and
people seem to be a little bit more
laughs on it the other day I had a
Django Company from Northern Virginia
out of McLean Virginia and they reached
out to me so they found me online they
know I don't have a degree if they did
any sort of research or anything like
that but they found me and they're like
hey we have this Django position in
Northern Virginia I'm not interested I
told him that but they they were
reaching out to me and it was you know
with no degree and then another company
a major defense contractor reached out
to me as well and that was for a dotnet
C sharp job so it seems to me like
eventually companies that are like you
know closed closed book like we're not
going to hire you because you don't have
a degree number one they're probably an
asshole company to work for you probably
don't want to deal with that anyway
because a job should always be about
whether or not you're capable of doing
it and how well you can do it and the
degree should have absolutely no bearing
on that whatsoever so a lot of people
bring up the argument over what about a
doctor would you want to have a surgeon
working on you that didn't get his
medical degree and things like that well
of course not like you you there has to
be certain checks and balances but IT is
not equivalent so only I think in
experienced IT developers would think
such a thing but there are you know
obviously you know the extent of like
you know aerospace engineering and
things like that you're not going to
programmers you know like writing
someone like that you know the formulas
and things like that a years for rockets
to go insert extra directories and
things like that a lot of that stuff is
like data scientists people that are
physicists and things like that and
they're basically saying hey we need the
code to do this from that and
programmers can make that happen but
it's not like what I'm trying to say is
that like even if you were a programmer
that was working on medical systems that
were going to automate some sort of
surgical process well you're going to
have a doctor sign off on that stuff
anyway so I even with architectural and
engineering some but I understand that
you can actually write up architectural
diagrams without being an architect and
then get an actual structural engineer
to like sign off on it and then it's
still just as legal so it's like the
same thing exists I think with any
profession and like you know clearly if
you're if you're going to be a surgeon
that you want to have
somebody that is capable of doing if you
try to build a website and you want that
website to be fast responsive things
like that then you don't need to hire a
freaking medical doctor to do that you
know and neither do you need an actual
program with a degree it's just a fact
it's absolute fact but not not going to
great degree not at all man because I
know you're obviously going to learn a
lot of really invaluable stuff but when
it comes to actual writing code and
getting in and working with other
programmers man that's what you do after
you graduate so that's my thoughts on
that but anyway other than I mean things
that things have been going pretty well
for me I've been trying to do some other
stuff like the other day I took my dogs
fishing I don't even fish man I didn't
catch nothing either like I just went
out there for like about an hour so for
the most part I watched my dogs swim in
the water which is probably why didn't
catching fish because she's making all
kinds of noise on the shoreline but you
know yeah I don't even like touching
fish anyway so if I would have caught
one like I probably have to like put the
fish on the ground maybe stuff on like
lightly and then take the hook out of
his mouth and I'm not trying to grab the
thing you know what I mean like it just
thinks they squirm and they wiggle and
like it not for me really but I thought
about getting golf clubs actually and
then I thought against that I'm like
dude what are you doing like you've
never even hit a golf ball like once in
your entire life so I think in a way
though man I'm looking for other things
to do trying to get you know just trying
to mix things up a little bit trying to
get that passion because I think you
know what the amount of work that I've
been putting in and everything that like
I go home and I'm not really trying to
like the other day I pulled up UJS and
like I was just looking at it for a few
minutes and I have nothing to get the
beauteous but I was like you know what
I've already put in you know years worth
of effort now and on react and things
I'm not at this point like I'm not going
to use UGS and for that reason I just
haven't I haven't been all that
motivated to learn it and it's something
that I do plan on learning but just I
mean whatever man like you you have to
in my opinion I have to do other things
every now and then and that's what I've
been doing a lot of lately and it's been
fun it really has ended the longer I
kind of do other things I feel like it's
rejuvenating my efforts to do new things
like I actually want to look into
building another framework and it'll
probably be terrible just like my last
one but really that there's things that
I do want to do that is more than just
hey how do I assemble a bunch of web
development tools into a web website
because that's what I do day in and day
out and that's what I get paid a lot of
money to do and that's what gets old and
I don't feel like doing when I get home
so things like voj has no interest
really right now I'd rather get in I
want to get back into like rust or do
something else you know just something
completely different I'm still working
on that game man but the game is slow
going but right now just because like
I'm having a hard time with water and
physics and things like that and I need
these waters and physics things to to
interact with objects and and you can
buy some of those assets that also you
know that have like the proper wave
motions and everything of water but when
it comes to actually like you know water
like colliding with other things like
you know I've been struggling on that
and that's something that words like if
you're you know if you're if you're a
game developer and you have like
advanced math and things like that and
that would be something where you know a
degree would definitely have helped you
because you would have focused on you
probably a lot of a lot of that higher
level math and things that's responsible
to make that a reality and that's
probably one area where I would say
definitely it would have helped my dog
is rolling in mud that's not good it's
like raining and Virginia morning here
anyway guys I'm just like babbling on so
hopefully I can get that game out
eventually I was trying to aim for June
and it right now like I'm cutting
corners trying to even get that get that
to try it well it's kind of like an
artificial or superficial date anyway
it's not like it means anything I don't
have any anything on the line but just
kind of like a personal date that I set
for myself to try to get that thing done
and and that's not going to happen
not at this point but anyway guys have
fun man thanks for watching oh by the
way I did want to mention somehow my my
son got ahold of my YouTube account so
like I just noticed on May 4th
apparently I did a live stream where I
could hear a young child in the
backround humming some sort of music so
that was not me and I'm sure you guys
realize that but still trying to I think
what ended up happening is somehow I had
my credentials on the downstairs
computer that the kids used and and I'm
sure he he thought he was in his account
and I'm like you need to talk to me
before you livestream anyway like you're
too young to be live-streaming
what at least without enemy being around
or something like that so alright guys
uh that's what that was all about that
was not the Chris Hawkes all right take
care good bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
