programming languages to learn in 2017
and yes it is finally 2017 so I actually
did this video about six months ago
where I was trying to project what I
thought was going to be the top
languages in 2017 and looking back on it
I have now changed that there were a few
items on there number one was typescript
and I really don't think that it
deserves a place in the top 10 after
dealing with a little bit more so I just
went ahead and I want to update this
this video to just reflect where I am on
2017 of the languages and just so you
know that there is no definitive like
math or algorithm or anything like that
that you can use to try to project like
what are the 10 best languages this is
mostly you know what I feel the top
languages to learn for opportunity for
frameworks and just for building things
so I think it covers a relatively wide
area of development and not just web
development but my expertise is
primarily in web development so let me
go ahead and get started so number 10 is
Ruby Ruby is a dynamic language it's
object-oriented it was developed really
in the 1990s but the it wasn't until the
advent of like Ruby on Rails the web
framework that Ruby got very very
popular but then one of the reasons why
Ruby barely makes this list is that it
is still somewhat of a one-trick pony I
mean people are using Ruby for Ruby on
Rails and and rails has had some of its
on its market share of get eaten into by
things like no js' and python django and
other things so ruby unfortunately is
not you know it barely makes this list
just simply because it's just not using
enough areas I don't think in 2017 and
going forward but it is still a very
relevant language so that's why I think
it definitely deserves its spot in the
top 10 number 9 is C so C is obviously
the grandfather of all these languages
that are going to be on this list so C
is in some people some people considered
a low-level line which is really not a
low-level in the sense of like assembly
but it's much lower than you know
higher-level languages like Python and
and c-sharp and things like that but C
is you know the language that a lot of
these other languages are written on top
of which is includes Ruby and Python and
c-sharp and so knowing C is going to be
able to give you a lot of understanding
of how programming works but at the same
time we are kind of replacing a lot of
you know the old-school C code with a
lot of these higher-level languages so
you don't necessarily have to write C
but there are going to be a lot of jobs
and opportunities especially for
embedded systems like the system that
was on the Mars Curiosity rover was
written in C I believe was like five
hundred thousand lines of C code instead
of using anything like Java or C sharp
or any of that stuff because it does
have overhead compared to just writing
raw C so C definitely makes the list at
number nine here
number eight is PHP it's server-side
scripting language so this was a
language that wasn't really designed
with like you know best practices in
mind for the most part it was actually
to get things done so you know getting s
done and in 1994 was really the motto I
would say a PHP because as we've grown
as the language has grown things get
tacked on and sometimes you kind of look
at anyway well that that's kind of weird
the way they tack that on but the point
is PHP still runs the majority of
websites out there so they have the
largest market share of any server-side
language for all websites out there so
there is um as much as people hate you
know hate on PHP there's still a lot of
opportunity there especially for indie
developers and just getting websites up
and running most web hosts work with PHP
where you know you might struggle a
little bit to find them for some of the
other other languages listed but PHP
definitely deserves a top ten spot
number seven is Swift and I have Swift
here instead of object Objective C but
really Objective C could also be used
side by side with Swift here because
they're both Apple based languages that
are you know designed to to solve Apple
problems and I'm obviously Apple has a
huge amount of market share and a lot of
different arenas so if you're an apple
developer then Swift or Objective C is
going to be
you but I mentioned Swift because Swift
is like their the you know Apple's
newest language that they've introduced
number six is a C++ and C++ has been
around for a long time since the 1980s
it's object-oriented it's very fast and
you have to deal with memory management
and things like that so it's going to be
faster than other compiled languages
like C sharp or Java and it's still used
widely in games and 3d applications and
things like that so anywhere you have
process intensive stuff a lot of C++ is
still being used and it's really not
going anywhere it's also the language of
choice for the Unreal game engine so C++
is definitely a popular option in 2017
number five is go and go is actually
number five on this list because it's
growing so quickly on the in years past
like it seemed like it took a little
while for this to actually catch on but
in the last couple of years I've seen go
grow by pretty tremendous amount and
really it's because of the influence
that Google has Google hired these guys
to develop the go language and and go
well Google's original stack goes back
to Python and then a lot of their
process intensive stuff they switched
over C++ go was created so that they
could solve a lot of their you know
their hardware like being able to be
fast and concurrent and go was built
with that in mind so it makes it easier
to develop fasting and current based
applications over something like Python
and C++ so with the influence that go
and Google has it is continued to grow
and really the top ten I think this is
going to be the most surprising list of
all of them so c-sharp is on number four
here Microsoft has been doing a lot of
good things and developer community
they've open sourced a lot of their
technology they create a Visual Studio
code which is one of the best text
editors out there right now it's
definitely better than atom in my
opinion and and they're continuing to
grow so Azure can now host on note
applications it can host a Django and pi
and other things that typically you know
Microsoft just kind of focus on their
own thing another thing is their dotnet
core ecosystem is now open source and
available cross-platform so they're not
just a Microsoft only technology or
language and finally they also bought
Ameren which allows you to do mobile
development and c-sharp so that's why
the c-sharp is all the way at number
four on this list number three is Java
Java has been the king of all languages
and it still probably has arguably the
most jobs of any language on this list
the Java is going to be the server-side
stack for a lot of different languages
there's other things that are written on
the Java Virtual Machine you have things
like solar index based searching you
have all kinds of different applications
a lot of api's are written in Java a lot
of actual applications including games
and software is also written in Java so
it is definitely highly regarded and
high up on this list number two is
Python but python has been growing so
tremendously over the last like really
ten years and python goes all the way
back to like 1990 so it wasn't until
really Google and IBM started picking up
Python in the 90s that it really became
like a household name but ultimately
ended up replacing a lot of what Perl
did really well because Python was much
easier and much easier to read than Perl
and a lot of what Perl did really good
Python did just as well or at least
close enough to just as well that people
just kind of flocked over to Python so
as far as network administrator's and
things like that Python still has it you
know it has its place there but it's
grown a lot and like machine learning
and data science is it's also very
popular in web nowadays with like Python
and Django sites like Instagram and
reddit are all on Python so another
thing too is it's relatively cheap to
host it's cross-platform so python is a
very very popular language and the
reason why it's so high on this list is
because newbie developers like Python
really more than any other language that
I've seen so I've had hundreds of
thousands really millions of views on
the
channel and some of my most and some of
those newbie developers you know they
they flock and they love Python so you
know if you know the the modern
coming-of-age programmers are flocking
the Python that means it's going to have
its place in the future so you know
we're seeing all kinds of startups using
Python so some people say well it's not
a compiled language it's not as fast as
some of these other language is it's not
you know it's duct typed and all this
other stuff but the the Python can get
the job done in so many different cases
that it's going to it's just it's
extremely popular you're not going to
write a game engine in Python but once
again every language has its own purpose
and need and Python just saw is good
enough for so many different areas that
it makes it high up on this list number
one is JavaScript now this is mostly
based off of you know web development
and also not mobile development because
there's things like react native that
allows you to write mobile applications
using JavaScript there's also the
server-side technology which is no js'
which allows you to write server-side
language and java script and then
javascript has been predominantly you
know obviously just using a browser as a
browser-based language but it's the only
language that that's supported by all
major browsers out there so if you want
to build a an application whether it's a
software as a service or a game or
something in the web javascript allows
you to write it in one way that works
across different browsers now of course
some browsers interpret JavaScript a
little bit differently and those can
deal to some headaches but that's going
to be with any sort of language but the
point is though is that javascript is so
tremendously popular because everything
is done on the web know that there's
just no question that javascript is the
most popular language and really has the
most opportunity I would say at this
point because any sort of web
development gig you need to have
JavaScript and most of the jobs out
there are in web development in some way
shape or form so anyway guys this is the
updated top 10 programming languages to
learn in 2017 this is the best guide to
go off of don't deal with what in my
compare
tanja because they all just copy off me
anyway I'm just kidding
but guys this video is sponsored by Deb
Melton coding boot camp and they are a
twelve and sixteen week boot camp that
is designed to get your foot in the door
on the industry as quickly as possible
and they're based out of Provo Utah but
they have courses in Dallas Texas and
also in Salt Lake City and they're
continuing to grow they're adding new
curriculum all the time they're focusing
on things like nodejs angular and react
on things that companies are using right
now and by focusing on these you know
these specific areas their hope their
intention is to get you in the door to
these development companies in order to
be able to you know get brought in as a
junior developer to start learning the
skills and the ropes and and really have
enough to compete with senior developers
that may not be as experienced as some
of these newer technologies and things
so definitely check out Deb fountain
coding boot camp they're one of the
top-rated boot camps out there alright
