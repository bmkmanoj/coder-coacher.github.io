from a viewer asking whether or not
Python is only a server-side language
similar to something like PHP which is
very server-side language and here's the
thing to answer that as simply as
possible the only client side language
that exists that works across browsers
is JavaScript that's the only thing
that's the reason why javascript is so
popular JavaScript has a lot of
shortcomings but the reason why
everybody thinks it's so great is
because it's the only language that
works similarly if you're using an Iowa
handheld iphone vs and android
smartphone or even a linux desktop
everybody that has a browser all those
devices at how browsers understand
JavaScript and that means that you have
a language that you can you can focus on
that works across the board now in
programming and computer science in
general you would think that getting a
bunch of big players like Google and
Microsoft and Apple and Mozilla and all
these guys to just get along with each
other and come up with a standard that
every way you can agree on would be
something similar but early on that
similar but simple and the temple fact
the matter though is that none of these
companies like each other they're all
competing for market share and they all
want to continue their dominance so when
Google came out with their dart language
which was almost like a like at least
they're their dart browser based
language was almost like a replacement
to JavaScript that was being proposed
people didn't get on board with it like
so is a lot of what dart was trying to
do was getting you know fast games and
like C++ types you know experience or
speed or at least close to that inside
of a browser require that other browser
providers like Mozilla and Microsoft be
on board with you know getting their
their browsers to be able to implement
the same set of standards so the coach
and run but they're basically like screw
you google you already have 27 billion
dollars in profit and we want to compete
with you and what I can just let you do
whatever it is that you want to do so so
then you know Google ends up driving
support for the dart language Microsoft
now has the type line type script which
isn't a separate language it it's
basically JavaScript with types meaning
that you can
clear types like this function takes in
a string and an integer and it makes
things a little bit easier to reason
about but even that excitement it's an
optional thing you don't have to have
static type checking and typescript but
a lot of people aren't jumping on
typescript because babble and babble
allows you to compile es6 and es7 in the
es2015 so it works in older browsers and
things like that so even that has a hard
time I think taking off and then getting
widespread adoption so getting these
companies to actually get on board with
each other has always been the biggest
headache now because all of the
companies use browsers for their devices
and the browser is you know the main way
that we obviously use what we know of as
the world wide web and you know the web
browsing and things like that we're able
to focus on JavaScript for a client-side
language so there are other languages
that end up compiling to client-side
languages but all they're going is
really compiling to JavaScript so dart
elm typescript closure script hacks and
pure script so that is a those are in
languages that aren't going to be really
JavaScript replacements or anything like
that at least some people could argue
that these if they are to some extent
they're still just your boiling down to
JavaScript because javascript is the
client-side language that works in
browsers Python though and it shouldn't
be misunderstood though if you're going
to use a like there's going to be
server-side languages that you're going
to use like c-sharp PHP Python Java Ruby
a lot of major server-side languages and
so you shouldn't be like well it doesn't
work in the browser so I'm just going to
use noche ups or something like that
node Reyes is written in C and C++ and
if they service on language it can be
used as a server-side language but it's
not JavaScript technically that's that's
creating that server-side language so
even though you write note in JavaScript
it's not like you're using the
JavaScript language itself to actually
do what it is that no chance is doing
may I know that that sounds a little
complicated but no jess is essentially a
technology so should you not use Python
for that reason and no not really play
sounds great i mean i use python for my
website which is history code i'm going
to always drop it also check out my blog
i got a writer writing for me now so i'm
trying to keep things a little bit fresh
here in my blog but history code is
written in Django so here's the Django
web framework so Django has all the
server side stuff but it can also send
down it has a templating language that's
included so you can do a lot of
interesting things than template
language so bottom line is Python just a
service droid language yesterday's it's
used for server-side rendering but the
good thing about Python compared to some
of the other languages it's also used
for robotics and Michigan learning and
things like that so if you become good
at Python you can use Python for all
kinds of different reasons besides just
web servers but that said if you're
doing web development with Python it's
not going to just work in the browser it
doesn't work that way alright guys
thanks for watching have a good day bye
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention def Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12 week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here and now for web development some of
the things that are actually teaching in
the 12 week course is geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
