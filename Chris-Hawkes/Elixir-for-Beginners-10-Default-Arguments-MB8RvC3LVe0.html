elixir tutorial series and in this video
we want to look at default arguments to
our functions within our module so we've
already looked at modules in a few
videos previous to this one and in this
video we're going to go ahead and create
the module again Soria is a defined
module and we're just going to say test
and then we say do will indent and then
we'll say define add we'll just create
add function here we'll say a and then
the value of B is going to be a default
which we're going to say B but the
default value is actually going to be
let's just say 5 so that it can say do
and now we're gonna say what we want is
we want to say a plus B and that's
really all we're gonna do and now we're
gonna say end and we'll close off our
module so now if we said test dot add
and we pass in a value which will just
say 5 to make things easy and now you
can see you get two value return of 10
and why is that well we passed in 5
which is the value for a we didn't pass
in a value for B but B by default
because it's a default argument using
this - backslash syntax is is 5 now if
we were to call the function in the
exact same way but this time we actually
add another value then we're going to
get 15 back because instead of having
the default of 5 we have a value being
passed in for 10 and you can see you get
15 back so it's important that you guys
understand about these default arguments
a lot of people don't use them but it is
important to at least understand you
know what it is in case you do run run
across it so that's mainly what we're
doing in this video just making sure
that we raise awareness towards these
default arguments and make sure you guys
subscribe I appreciate all the support
and have a good day bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to be
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev mountain coding
bootcamp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this what we course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
