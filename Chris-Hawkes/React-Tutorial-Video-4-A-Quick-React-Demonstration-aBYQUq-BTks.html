let's go ahead and add a new file which
we're gonna add and we'll just call this
the first component not Jas so it's a
dot JS file and in this component here
we're going to do just a basic basic
component setup in fact we're going to
copy the tutorial video or tutorial
example from Reax website and it's using
the react on project that we that we
need it's also using this react and it
just simply is outputting in a comment
box but you'll see that document dot get
element by ID it's necessary that there
we have an ID that this should be bound
to so let's go ahead and add another
file to the root directory which we're
just going to call our index files this
is an HTML file so index dot HTML so
HTML is gonna have an HTML field and
then it's gonna have a head
I never have a body in here and you'll
see that the example here binds to a
give with an ID of container you're
probably like well what do you mean
container why where did that come from
what are you talking about well if you
look at the first component you'll see
that it says document get element by ID
can content are actually no sa container
is content so we need to make sure that
that can that ID with the content tag
exists inside the page that we can bind
to it next thing we need to do is we
need to make sure that we're actually
referencing our bundle j/s file so we're
going to say script source equal ge'ez
bundle ji so we're just pointing to this
bundle J s that webpack is outputting
for us and we're gonna close all of our
script so now this app dot I'm sorry
this bundle J s is going to to
eventually work with us here so here's
just this this simple box and in order
for this thing to work we're gonna use
some of the beauty of using webpack is
that we can then import and require
plugins that we need so we're gonna say
it from import react from react and
import react down from react Dom so it's
actually going out and obtaining these
values from those plugins that we
installed in the first video so if you
didn't actually watch the first video
you may want to take a few steps back
and check that out
the next thing we want to do and the
reason why we need these obviously is
because you can see they're rendered
here and they're rendered here
I'm sorry not they're react and react
Dom so those are two libraries that you
would end up getting a an error on if
you did not you know if you did not
import them so now in our app guess
since this is our starting point we want
to go ahead and actually import this
first component that we just created so
how do we do that we're going to say
import first
actually we'll just simply say so yeah
just in the app Jess will just say
import first component from and then
here we need to give it the actual path
to the components I think it's actually
going to be I think this will work first
component and you don't need to add the
dot J as part of that shouldn't be
necessary but let's see if I whip that
complains because you can see it okay I
didn't find first component so what am I
going to say here I just I say that it
is just a simple path problem alright so
that worked so that was just a path
probably just needed to /then so I
believe that will work this so now let's
go ahead and open up our index.html so
I'm gonna open up the folder and just
double-click on the index.html
alright so when we go to look at this in
the browser you're gonna notice nothing
happens in your like Chris what are you
doing what isn't this work my stuff
doesn't work you're gonna pull your hair
out you're gonna reconsider your career
as a programmer and probably give up
entirely or you can inspect the element
in your Chrome browser and try to figure
out by clicking on the console what's
going on so it says failed to load
resource what resource so I click on
this and it says bundled ijs I can't
load it so it's like a bundle digest and
see if we made a mistake and it looks
like we did if we look at our index.html
you can see that the source is looking
for this this folder in the wrong
location we need to get rid of that
first forward slash now it's gonna be
found now let's go ahead and when we
save it and we refresh this looks like
we now get a different error message it
says I'm caught in variant violation
registered target container is not a Dom
element what this means is that react
loaded before the page did so react is
looking for a can
a Content div tag but it doesn't exist
because reactant loaded before the
content div tag we even got a chance to
load so what you want to do is move this
entire script at the bottom of the body
tag and that's actually why if you've
ever done any HTML work you'll notice
that they are constantly put scripts at
the bottom of the body tag because they
want all this stuff to render before the
page tries to load otherwise you need to
do some sort of JavaScript manipulation
in order to get things working but now
when you refresh it you can see that we
now have hello world I am a comment box
that's being rendered by react and we're
working I mean everything is great it's
gold and we have the web pack working
and Babel and react in HTML and
everything's just great so we're going
to end this video here we actually got
react working in the next video we'll
get into some more heavy and depth stuff
