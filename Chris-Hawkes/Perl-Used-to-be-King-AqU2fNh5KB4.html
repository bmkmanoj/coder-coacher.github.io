comment from Shahrukh many comments a
lot definitely love appreciate the
comments he says I learned that a lot of
Amazon stuff was built off of pearl
so he's quoting me he's like I know
right but all these days in late 90s a
recession Pearl has baked into the core
of the biggest e-commerce site in the
world and the developers over there at
Amazon are pulling their hair out
because they still have to maintain that
pearl code a lot of these newer
programmers are like what's Pearl man I
don't understand like where did Pearl go
but what people fail to understand is
that websites like Amazon that predate
the the.com bubble they predate c-sharp
and Java man there wasn't some perfect
object-oriented solution to everything
on the web pearl had its place man Pearl
was top dog for the longest time because
it was a shitload easier to write a
bunch of CGI scripts in Perl than it was
to write a bunch of and C Java came
out in like 1999 and it was a slow-ass
piece of nobody wanted to use it
and then eventually over time it started
getting faster and things like that but
you know even in that day like you look
at what did Google do in the 90s did
they want to use Perl like Amazon no
they went with Python and they made
Python a thing because if Google hadn't
have used Python in 1996 or 1995 then
there's no way that Python would be the
most near the popular language that is
today including you know what's powering
this this channel YouTube so a lot of
these object window programmers are like
you know like c-sharp does this and dot
does that and I could just use job and
all this trouble imagine a world before
that stuff you know you have what C++
you had Perl you had Python that was in
its infancy and like didn't have a whole
lot of support or anything so you didn't
have a ton of option so if you don't
have the options man what do you do you
turn to a language that has the
solutions that you need and that is Perl
so it's not the perfect solution it's
not the perfect language a lot of people
tell you pearls the worst
language to exist man but the fact of
the matter is is that Amazon was able to
utilize pearl as the best tool for the
job at the time and they turn themselves
into from a online bookseller to one of
the
largest one of the largest really retail
operations in the world in the history
of mankind as well as definitely the
largest e-commerce platform of all time
so pearl was able to get them to that
level so people can on Python now
you could say oh you go lying and rust
is all Betty is because it's going to
happen currency all that stuff but it do
to Python if I could actually get a
project off the ground with Python and
get it done like a matter of a month or
something like that then did I'm going
with Python man I like I'm not going to
spend a bunch of time doing a bunch of
extra stuff that I want me to do and
that's kind of the mindset of the people
Amazon at the time you mean it's like
they could have used something else they
probably could have started getting into
like groundbreaking Java but you know
these newer technologies sometimes
aren't the best solution and also if you
look at Google's history like when when
the first search engine was written by
Larry Page who wasn't even like a like a
brilliant programmer from what I
understand his first program was written
in Java when it was brand-new is
brand-new was buggy as and it was
slow and then some guy comes along is
like let me rewrite that in Python so
they ended up using Python for the
longest time in their history because
Python was you know the best tool for
the job for you know for what they
wanted to do it was easy to understand
that were able to write quickly people
were able to learn it quickly and all of
a sudden you have massive productivity
so that's another thing that a lot of
programmers fail to understand
especially the really smart ones and
want to actually spend all their time
writing Elm instead of HTML and CSS when
you have to onboard somebody how to
learn Elm it so it's a lot more it's
much more difficult than having to teach
somebody HTML or CSS so it's like
there's these trade-offs and and most of
the time business and success and
everything else is going to come from
people they get the job done with you
know as quickly as possible that it's
you know sufficient enough to get the
job done so we've talked about you need
to have a full sack you know react react
router or sub where he use some basic
MVC dotnet jQuery things like that maybe
you don't need to sophisticated
front-end app especially if the projects
that you know fail or fold in six months
anyway so I don't know man just just
kind of my thoughts but there was a
I am that pearl ruled the world and like
everybody wanted to use pearls and and
that day is you know obviously it's
coming to pass it's already passed and
it's been that way for quite some time
but when I was first getting into
programming Perl was still talked about
relatively a lot and nowadays it's just
it's mostly just like scoffed at and and
I understand that though but all right
guys thanks for watching have a good day
