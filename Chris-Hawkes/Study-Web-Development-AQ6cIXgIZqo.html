talking about alternative ways that
programmers can make money I have a
buddy here Kyle who is a programmer he
actually gets paid to write code for a
company but on the side he's managed to
be able to make his own consulting
business he's turned it into actually an
e-book that he's now created I mean that
he's selling through his website which
is study web development comm there's a
freelancing bundle here and if you look
at the website you can read all the the
details here be conceived and sure I've
never seen traversée that's funny the
first time I've seen Brad traversing
this picture in here so anyway he's got
some support and backing from some major
content creators on YouTube but it's
just interesting how they we have
alternative means as programmers to make
money doing other things we can work
with other business partners and try to
bring like an IT type of like every
business needs IT I've said that before
so it doesn't matter if you're doing
something like like maybe of a buddy
who's an architect I've actually worked
on a project with an architect one time
and it was cool because even though we
were doing architectural stuff that I
knew nothing about like he still needed
I information technology that I knew a
lot about so we were working on websites
with 3d modeling and things like that at
the time but it's just it's it's funny
and interesting like you never know
where this is going to take you so Kyle
is now selling his e-book and he's
making money doing that so compared to
other professions it seems like with
information technology we never know
where it's gonna take us now I know a
lot of former programmers that are now
like full-time teachers but they work
and and you know they're still getting a
paycheck for a company but they they
teach other programmers and like
training classes and not even
necessarily just other programmers they
can work with the business and train
business people because programmers over
that over time you like you learned to
be able to speak to a non-technical
audience in a very technical way and
that's actually a skill on its own but
anyway so the thing is is like you never
know where it's gonna take you this
channel has taken me to teach other
people I never thought I would be doing
that when I first started programming
and then obviously Kyle is now selling
he his e-book and he's having some
success with it to make sure you guys
check that out
so here's the e-book that you're gonna
get if you pay for the freelancing
bundle it actually covers all the
different topics of being a freelance
web developer so if you guys are trying
to make money like Kyle is he's actually
teaching you how he's found ways to make
money using affiliate websites and
search engine optimization a lot of
different things that he's been able to
discover over the years so if you guys
are interested in that make sure you use
the promotion code that's in the
description tab below because that will
save you 20% on the bundle if you have
any questions feel free to leave a
comment and either I or Kyle will
respond to you and thank you guys for
watching have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
