and what I'm talking about here is what
is the best 3d program to use to build
your next game these game engines like
unity what we what we see here is um
making it extremely popular for Pete
basically nobody's to jump into the
gaming market but the problem is you
really can't make a modern game anymore
unless you go completely to D which
immunity wasn't originally even built
for it does support it somewhat well now
but typically you know people play 3d
games and either if it's a first person
shooter if it's like some sort of
adventure game or you're walking around
or just freeform like in Grand Theft
Auto but but the bottom line is that
pretty much every single game is 3d
which means that if you want to be a
top-notch awesome game developer at
least if you're going to be an Indian
like a one-man crew you're pretty much
going to have to do some sort of 3d
animation the problem is though is that
3ds not easy at all it takes forever to
learn every one of them has a steep
learning curve no matter what they say
some of some people be like oh susie and
then other people are like you know it
I've been doing 3d for 10 years and I
learned something new every day the
problem with somebody like me is I'm a
programmer I just wanted I want to make
games but I don't want to be like a 3d
artist in fact I kind of blacked some 3d
skills you know what I mean I lack
artistic ability to just creatively come
up with like you know it's just some of
the stuff I've seen like you no rust on
a school bus or like scales on a dragon
or something like that you know I mean
none of that just pops in my head and
like really with gaming I'm trying to
make the most block eous crappiest 3d I
can probably do just you know to
actually keep the game in scope and you
can get it done so the question is I
mean what is the best 3d program out
there and we're going to look at a
couple right so the number one is this
autodesk 3ds max Autodesk owns like all
this autocad architecture stuff and it
is like basically the top-of-the-line
product when it comes to 3d and 3d
animation and also just like you know
it's not even just for games
actually used for architecture for
gaming for movies like 3ds max they use
this for harry potter and some of the
stuff so all the visual effects that
goes into you know people flying around
on broomsticks and stuff like that i
mean they're using 3ds max and i'm not
really sure what a graphics artist makes
in 3d but i'm pretty sure it's less than
what a typical web developer makes so i
don't really have a strong desire to be
some sort of 3ds you know expert so 3ds
max is basically probably any of the
most powerful application out there and
it's also one of the most expensive
which is the major downside to any sort
of indie development so they have some
sort of monthly crap I don't even know
what this is but essentially what you're
looking at is close to about 3,000 bucks
or so and then they also it looks like
they have a cloud subscription type
thing like adobe has done with photoshop
of late so a lot of people use 3ds max
they say if you're going to end up
having the teacher self 3d programming
or I mean 3d graphics then you might as
well learn the industry standard tool
because if you end up getting a job
doing that it's going to be autodesk 3ds
max or the other product that all of
this has which is Maya and Mayas
somewhat I guess scaled-down version of
3ds max and it's used pretty widely in
gaming but once again it's also not
cheap at all it's very very expensive
the old edition before this cloud based
model was around 3000 as well so it's
really expensive for any sort of P
anybody getting into it now some people
were going to be like well you know I
can I'm going to school as a college
student so I can get their college
version or whatever well if you do that
you're not going to be able to monetize
your unity games and that means through
ads as well so you make some you know
kick-ass mobile game and you try to
monetize it with some ads next thing you
know you got Autodesk you know
billion-dollar company knocking at your
door and trying to sue you for 15 times
what it could have cost you to know just
by the normal version so that also
brings us down the road to another
product which people say is a lot easier
to learn than 3ds max because i can tell
you 3ds max to me is a pain in the ass
the UI is terrible the amount of like
crazy terms for all the different
geometry and everything is like just
mind-boggling it takes forever and I
just feel like you know that's enough of
a headache on its own and then you also
on top of that have this you why that
just basically is I mean to just
describe it in one word so that's the
downside of 3dsmax to a lot of people
are like well what about cinema 4d
cinema 4d has been around for like two
decades now are close to it and it's
like now it's emerging as one of the
easier alternatives to 3ds max and maya
and game developers like oh you know
just do cinema 4d it's easier and blah
blah blah so the thing was with any sort
of 3d program you get cinema 4d and
you're going to still have a major
headache trying to learn the ropes and
everything of 3d development but that
being said I do think you know from the
trial that I use of cinema 4d that it is
a little bit easier than 3ds max but
it's not like you're just going to be
able to get this program and next thing
you know you're creating the basketball
like what you see there that's not going
to happen anytime soon the next one is
uh this pixel logic has e brush well
zbrush isn't really a full of fledge
like 3d program it's more of like
modeling so some programs have you know
very poor support for modeling and
because mostly with 3d is like polygons
and geometry and stuff like that but
when modeling it's a lot more you know I
guess it's a lot more flexibility with
the amount of Polly's and stuff that
almost give you like a block of clay
that you can just turn into weird things
and zbrush is certainly a top of the
line tool it's very expensive I don't
even know what it costs to be honest
with you but um they use this the ZBrush
in the game the last of us with you know
that those excellent graphics so those
those are clickers inside that game you
zbrush so that's pretty cool
it's it's not it's not cheap at all so I
mean I don't I don't even know what it
is here but it's probably in the
thousands at least so the problem with
zbrush is like I said you're not going
to build all your 3d and zbrush it's not
really made for that it's made more for
facial modeling humanoids things like
that so the final the vinyl program
we're really going to look at and really
is the recommended route that I that I
advise and I'll give you a reason for in
just a moment is blender blender is open
source now so it's just user-contributed
code and it's completely free for
commercial for non-commercial education
whatever you want to do blender is free
and it can do a lot of really cool
things a lot of people say well you know
you learn the blender ropes and you can
do stuff that all the other programs are
capable of doing they've used it to make
some movies people have used it to write
some games no no like Hollywood type
movies and a lot of commercial
industries are not using blender they
are enticed into using a better product
but at more money which is Autodesk and
the Autodesk products you know they they
kind of control the education system as
well as far as been able to get their
product into college students so
companies have a big reason to continue
to use Autodesk and when you know they
start their development shop if all
these kids already know how to use it
and everything blender has made some
major headway zone explore azam you know
just even like five years ago it seems
like blender was like not even given a
second look for gaming for modeling for
movies for anything and now a lot of
people especially young people are
saying hey blender first you know
3ds max because of that price tag you
know and they're indies and they're
trying to get their their games out to
the market so blender is growing as a
community so a lot of the NOC set that
used to be against blender like oh I
didn't have the features well the
features keep getting added to it oh the
UI is terrible with the UI has been
rewritten to be a lot more flexible
especially for newcomers who are just
getting and
started UV mapping is actually much
easier and blender than it is in 3ds max
or cinema 4d so at least that's my
opinion and just the biggest thing is
that it is free now a lot of you guys
are going to be like whoo what about the
pirate bay right so you can just go and
download 3ds max off the pirate bay and
use the net you know latest x-force to
crack with a key gender to run autodesk
or numb or any sort of those three
thousand dollar programs right just go
to the pirate bay well you probably
don't know it but when you export your
models as FBX is like unity requires
when you when you actually build them
and these pirated applications they
still carry water marks for whether or
not autodesk is in you know the student
version or whether or not it's a pirated
version and if you have the success of
the guy who made minecraft which is a
notch you know say say all of a sudden
you know you have a company that's worth
hundreds of millions of dollars or even
a million or two autodesk is certainly
going to be coming knocking at your door
i mean there's no reason for them not to
most of the kids probably are not even
worth you know pursuing and the bottom
line is you might also be in another
country outside the united states and
but i have you know i'm not going to get
caught here but the problem is is that
any sort of product that you make with
that as soon as it's determined that you
had pirated software to make these
models and animations you're not going
to sell it on any sort of modern
platform where at least we're all the
dollars are you know so countries like
the US UK can and don't all it said
we're all you know a lot of the money is
a lot of the online sales for these
video games so you could be in Syria or
something and you're still you're not
going to be able you may not get
arrested over there but you're also not
going to be able to monetize your stuff
very easily if you have a lawsuit being
brought against your product so all that
being said man I mean I'm not trying to
like get on a soapbox like don't pirate
stuff or whatever because I mean
pirating I think does help software
applications pirated software helps
autodesk because
I me a lot of kids aren't in college
whatever they can pirate that software
they can learn it and then one day
they're going to either be productive in
a company that legitimately bought it or
one day you know they should be
efficient enough to be able to you know
produce some stuff you know with a legal
copy and I think they do because I mean
let's be honest I mean if some kid
Pirates 3ds max right and he's learning
the ropes he never gets a game to
production where he was never going to
buy that program to begin with so it's
not like Autodesk lost any of that money
right it doesn't make it right but at
the same time it's like they didn't lose
money because of it they didn't lose a
sale in fact an argument I think could
be made for the fact that you know this
kid learn how to use the product and
maybe he ends up getting a job at some
development firm that uses 3ds max
things I already know 3ds max because I
pirated it when I was 14 years old and I
I taught myself it's good for the
company it's good for 3ds max at that
point so I think you know there are some
things to be said for that but the
bottom line is if you guys are going to
be trying to make some money trying to
make you know a few thousand dollars
trying to sell some mobile apps or
whatever you might as well just take the
plunge with blender it may not be as
good as some of these other programs but
none of them are going to be that easy
and if you're going to invest your time
you might as well make sure it's
worthwhile and you know what it also
gives the middle finger to some of these
high-priced 3d applications because if
blender can be done for free and they
have a stronger following and you can
turn the tide of this some you know
commercial enterprise to start using a
blender and instead of some of these
other higher price products and it
basically starts a revolution in the
software industry we're next thing you
know blender is the you know they go to
a tool it's the you know python
programming languages it gets things
done just as well as other languages
that maybe not free so anyway guys that
that's really my my whole point so I
choose blender because not just because
it's legal but because it's free because
it's really probably the right thing to
do so just my opinion let me know what
you guys think and out if I miss any
other program so leave and leave any
comments or whatever and I appreciate it
thanks guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
