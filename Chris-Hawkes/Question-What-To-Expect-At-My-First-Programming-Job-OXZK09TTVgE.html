question here I think and it's from Dan
and he says any tips or thoughts on what
to expect for from a first job for any
of us who get a shot at actual program
programming job he said I've been
approached by someone who might be a job
lead they're looking for a c-sharp and
sequel experience and made it mainly he
looks like he's going to be assigned to
finding bugs or whatever so my first
question in response to that would be
like what type of company we'll be
talking about is this gonna be like a
large company or is it going to be a
much smaller company personally I've
never worked in a startup environment
but I've actually created what I
consider to be my own startup so that
you know the code that is going in is
very like very friends or
balls-to-the-wall like you're just
releasing new code all the time you
don't have a bunch of requirements that
major companies have to deal with like
all these different rules and
regulations so you don't screw something
up because there's not there's not as
much money on the line
so no with your question they were like
I would say like if it's a large company
the number one thing that you're gonna
experience which I think was a big shock
to me because I came from Python and
into like a big c-sharp corporate type
of thing and code repositories were a
big confusing thing for me so you're
gonna deal with like you have all these
different branches of code and like you
need to be working out of the right
branch and sometimes it's not it's not
clear like oh we're releasing this code
on this month or this day and this is
the branch that we should be working in
oh and I'm working out of the wrong
branch and you're like oh damn it
another big thing with repositories
especially if you're using something
like TFS I feel like it doesn't handle
the conflicts as well as like a git and
I'm not a git expert in fact I know TFS
much better than I know git but from a
little bit I've seen when it when you
deal with conflicts and merging branches
and things like that it seems to be much
easier and get than it does in TFS and
TFS like I run into all these different
on you know these conflicts we're like
you're trying to check in a bunch of
code and you wrote the code yesterday
you waited like a day for a senior
developer or like a group of people to
review the code and say okay go ahead
and check this in then you go to check
it in then you go is conflict so you
grab the latest from the repository you
realize people are changing the files
that you're working on and then you have
to go through line by line and deal with
all that stuff so those you know these
merging conflicts are a very big
headache and a large development
environment when you have hundreds of
developers you're gonna have these
conflicts where you do not want to
override overwrite what they were
working on but you need to be able to
take what they were working on and your
file and be able to merge both both of
it end and you want to make sure then
compiles and and that you're not going
to run into any unexpected errors
because sometimes the changes that they
made break the stuff that you had that
was getting ready to go in so now I'm
dealing with that is something that it
will get easier with experience but it's
it's something that I think literally
takes years in order to be able to
perfect basically to not freak out when
you have to deal with you know these
headaches sound the more the more senior
you are the more you just kind of go
whether you're like you know this is you
know typical that I deal with
those a developer and you just get it
done but that is definitely a big
culture shock another big culture shock
to a larger company is that if they're a
big c-sharp or Java shop then some of
their code might be outsourced so you're
gonna have code that's written by people
from overseas and sometimes you know
English isn't their primary language and
sometimes they barely speak English at
all so not only do you have a you know a
challenge when it comes to like you know
communicating there's also cultural
differences so there's cultural
differences between you know people
based on their religions where they come
from all these different things and for
the most part you know companies are
very agnostic and don't have you know
obviously take any sort of political
preference or you know religious
parental preference it's not like
they're like hey you've got to be a
Christian or you're not working here
nobody does that but what I'm saying is
that people's backgrounds it's more than
just like linguistically communicating
with people that can be a challenge it
can also just be a cultural challenge
like the things that you're talking
about and that you that you might be
interested in they have no idea like
they don't play games in their company
like they they don't they don't play on
PlayStation 4 or Xbox one or they don't
know American football or maybe they're
big in soccer or cricket or like
whatever like pooping like India for
instance they're big in the cricket but
I have no idea what cricket is I think
of cricket as a bug that jumps around is
nasty and you feed them too like lizards
and stuff like that that's the cricket
in to an American boy who grew up in
America I don't know the first thing
about cricket I should probably look
that up now that I'm talking about it
but I never I'm just kind of coming off
the cuff here that that even mentioned
this because typically if I don't know
something and I have an even the remote
slightest bit of interest I'll look it
up but anyway so that is interesting and
by the way from a simple fact that I
will not really fact but a little tidbit
that I looked up the other day I had no
idea but like the Sioux Indians when
they were fighting
you know the frontiersman basically the
white men that were invading their
country and the late 1800s they um they
had never seen the ocean like for
instance Sitting Bull who was a famous
Sioux chief who actually United a bunch
of the Lakota and Cheyenne tribes to
make up the Sioux Nation who ended up
defeating Custer in the you know the
American military and making an
embarrassment out of them
but it was interesting that he had never
seen the ocean so he always grew up on
the American frontier and never saw the
ocean but the and for the most part no
Sioux had ever seen the ocean but you
know through generations of passed down
information they knew about the shark
and like apparently at some point you
obviously these people knew about shark
attacks that happened on that on the
coast with coastal Indians and things
like that and and then that ends up you
know spreading all the way out west to a
Sioux tribe that I've never actually
seen you know Indians are not Indians
but I've never seen sharks or anything
like that and then to actually have you
know that be a part of their culture is
very interesting to me but you know but
my whole point is that culture is weird
it's something that you just either you
don't have it and when you didn't grow
up and you're not experienced with that
so that's another thing a large company
especially ninety they try to save money
they ship jobs overseas they they bring
in h1 B's you know to take jobs in
America a lot of that stuff is because
companies are just gaming the system and
they're trying to find talent that
there's going to be cheaper than typical
talent that
already in the country an h-1b visa
that's a whole nother subject but that's
not very good for the the person that
actually comes here on an h-1b either
because they're almost an indentured
servant at that point they have to deal
with the company that they work for it
if that company gets rid of them for any
reason or they decide to quit they have
to find another company that will end up
jumping through the same hoops in order
to you know sponsor their h-1b program
and things like that so it doesn't
really help either side and the whole
thing was that it was supposed to bring
in top talent but for the most part
companies are gaming the system they're
not bringing in top town they're just
bringing in people that know you know
the status quo with job of c-sharp and
things like that and you know and then
they do it to save a lot of money so
that part kind of sucks what else so you
know large-scale projects are gonna be
much much different than typical
startups so a typical startup usually
has like if you're a snapchat type or
something like that you have like this
one niche or niche you know sometimes
and that's a funny word by the way
because I've always said niche and I see
edgy but a lot of people say niche and
like people that say niche they get a it
rubs them the wrong way when you say
niche and then when I say niche like
Miche rubs me the wrong way I'm like
that's you know it's weird but anyway a
lot of the startups they have this you
know this this fine-tuned niche and
that's what I'm gonna say because that's
what I'm used to saying and it's very
very focused on that so they're not
doing a whole you know ton of stuff but
then a larger company whether you're in
like banking or you know some sort of
finances or insurance or you even even
gaming for the most part there's gonna
they're gonna be involved in a lot of
different things like there's gonna be a
lot of different departments so you're
gonna be working on very very small bits
of something that take up a very very
large portion you know the larger bigger
picture is harder to see I would say in
some of those larger corporations than
they are with a start-up like a start-up
you're working 14 16 hours a week you
know you're trying to grow you know that
you're trying to finish this UI or you
hook up this database and create this
API you pretty much know like the bigger
picture I think and in a startup much
more easily than you would and
and a larger corporation larger
corporations also there's a lot of
political that you're gonna
deal with Tim you have a chain of
command you have you have obviously the
executive vice presidents and then you
have assistant vice president's and
things like down then that's going to go
down into like the director levels and
management and then into leads and then
developers and senior developers and
it's just there there's a whole big
humungous hierarchy and if you've ever
seen office space that is there is a lot
of accuracy to that whole TPS jobs
report thing where the guy had six
different bosses you have six maybe 15
maybe even 35 different bosses in a
large corporation as opposed to much you
know smaller start-up and in a way that
the smaller start-up is going to be
pretty awesome too because you can have
a very very good relationship with
somebody that ends up controlling the
destiny of the company much much more
than you know like having a good
relationship with a manager who then
becomes a director who still has 15
bosses above him or her so there's a big
big difference I think between you know
the the startup world and the large
development but you're gonna you're
gonna obviously see that so that's a lot
different than being a plumber or being
an electrician or working on the job
where you're working with five or six
guys trying to do some HVAC work and
laying some duct work or something like
that you know being being in a
corporation is much much different like
when it comes to big open oh yeah let's
bring in the open office space so that's
actually you know been plaguing
companies all over the place so they try
to tear down the cubicle walls and
everything is this big open spot and
you're expected to be able to code and
collaborate and talk on the phone and
have meetings and you know think clearly
with all these visual and audible
distractions that are around you and
that's actually another unfortunate
thing too I think a larger type of set
up now the smaller start-up though that
has an open office space I would imagine
that that would actually be much more
suited you know towards the open office
space and for that reason it would
probably be a much better experience
however these startups are also plagued
with younger developers so there's
probably going to be a lot of immaturity
if you've ever read that disrupted book
you'll realize that you know
was telling the story about this one
young guy that worked for HubSpot in
Boston Massachusetts that ended up
studying he came in like still drunk
from the night before one day and said
like the the cleaning crews cleaning
cart on fire for some reason they lit
their trashcan on fire but it can be
like and then they're called programmers
and you know some of the younger
startups you know they're doing a lot of
different they're doing a lot of
different parks in order to keep people
in the office longer so they'll be beer
and alcohol involved there may even be
some you know some you know I'm not
going to use hand gestures but you know
what I'm talking about men women men men
I don't I don't know but whatever
people's preferences are there is going
to be some of that new office space
you're not going to find that in a
larger corporate environment now people
obviously do end up finding their
spouses and significant others and their
companies and stuff like that and that's
fine but you can't have it you can't
have your boss be your wife or whatever
most major companies have policies in
place for something like that I guess
I'm going off on all kinds of side
tangents and probably moving away from
what you're talking about with uh you
know specifically with programming stuff
but either way this this seems
interesting enough so what else I could
actually make several videos on this I
really could because I feel like there's
a lot more to talk about larger
companies in my opinion also like
they'll have on-site conveniences so
there's gonna be wait rooms and there's
going to be some time I like I've even
heard about like quite a aquatics and
stuff like that but like your basketball
horseshoes grilling out a lot of that
stuff will be available on a larger
programming company though I'd photos
balling all that stuff they're some of
the younger smaller startups are not
gonna have that same stuff but then you
guys might be illegal leaving the office
a lot more which I wish we did a lot
more in large corporate worlds I wish we
could get outside in fact if I had my
way and I led a team of like ten or
eleven people I would have our daily
scrum take a you know a walk even if
there's a walk around the building or a
walk around
the outside of the campus like I feel
like you know let's talk about what are
we working on guys oh yeah let's get
face-to-face if we can now obviously
that's not the case with a lot of this
remoting stuff but you know basically
let's try to get outside in nature a
little bit more we don't have to be
cooped up in offices all the time and
and for me like if I ever ran my own
company I would be pushing that a lot so
that brings up the whole in a large
company maybe even a small one too in
fact I talked to a smaller startup that
was doing cyber security and they worked
for it they got bought by a much larger
defense contractor but this company half
of their their developers were in
Orlando Florida and the other half were
in Northern Virginia and they would use
things like slack and and like Google
Hangouts and stuff like that in order to
have face-to-face meetings and and
that's a big part of your day because a
lot of the times you're communicating
with people that are all over the
country in fact I mean I've witnessed
that firsthand will have people in
Buffalo and you know in New York and
Washington DC and Georgia like I mean
and we're all like in the same meetings
and that's something that that is it's
cool but it also either there's some
challenging things there too so when
you're trying to be this open
collaborative thing and half your team
is on the other side of the country it's
not it kind of defeats the purpose of
the open office space in that in that
regard so that's really uh that's
probably where I'm going to end this I
try to keep my videos at like 15 minutes
make sure you gotta check out my sponsor
or dev Mountain coding boot camp so
thanks to them I'm able to make these
videos and you know I want want to
stress to the fact that they do help me
out and that you guys will be doing me a
great service if you also check them out
and that's about it so this is a great
subject though because honestly I didn't
even think that I had this much to say
until I started saying it and I really
feel like there is so much more than I
could talk about so I plan on doing that
some more in the future then I'm just
because I like to reflect on it too so
anyway guys thanks for watching and take
care of please subscribe bye hey guys so
a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp
is a 12-week intensive course that
focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
