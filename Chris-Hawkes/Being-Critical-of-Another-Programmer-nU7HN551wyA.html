how to win friends and influence people
this book was written in 1936 so it's
like really old they try to do a remake
to make it apply more to the digital age
and all that but I heard the original
was better so I went ahead and started
with the original one of the guys I
admire pretty well is a Warren Buffett
the second richest American probably
second richest in the world actually
right now but I'm you know he's an older
guy he's been investing in companies
since the 1950s and mana bisa and he's
considered one of the best investors and
in really the history of the world but I
so he's super wealthy but one of the
books that he's always recommended was
this book from 1936 that he actually had
a college course on at the Wharton
Business School where he went to and you
know he said the book changed his life
so for so far into the book I think it's
rather drab I guess very bland someone
but I mean I'm William like the first
couple of chapters but you know
essentially it does actually point out
the fact that um whenever you're
critical of somebody it naturally puts
the other person on defense to have to
justify you know their position or the
reason why they did something a certain
way and when you're critical of them
then you don't really get anywhere in
that situation you just create a bad
situation and one of the things that he
actually had mentioned which I thought
was rather interesting was that Abraham
Lincoln when he was a younger man used
to be very critical he's always despised
slavery and stuff like that but he was
very critical publicly with somebody
back in the early 1800s and in the
United States I mean our first secretary
of treasury died and a gun duel with the
vice president Aaron Burr Alexander
Hamilton was the first secretary and as
of you know getting killed in the actual
gun duel and in the United States
because of you know just bitter
arguments and bitter public disputes
with people so you know they criticize
each other they criticize back they feel
the need to justify themselves and
and when you publicly sham somebody you
know back in those days you had to put
your life on the line to to back up
those accusations and you know in this
particular case so it was with Abraham
Lincoln and the book mentions this is
that he actually got in the same
situation where he publicly you know
disgraced somebody and was essentially
challenged to a duel and almost got into
a duel which could have ended his life
and then he would have never been
American president and possibly you know
the free freeing of the slaves and all
that stuff and the you know would led to
really the Civil War I'm not gonna get
in a civil war history but you know
obviously the Emancipation Proclamation
having a couple years into into the war
but slavery was a big part of why the
American Civil War was fought leading up
to it and states rights and all that
stuff so you know all that could have
never happened maybe if he would have
died in a gun a duel for publicly
criticizing somebody and you know in
this book it's interesting because
you're not supposed to be you know
critical of other people because it
doesn't really get you anywhere and I
think I realized that you know I've been
critical of people my whole life and
people have been critical with me and
it's just one of those basic things in
life that nobody actually spends enough
time with to you know to I guess you
know to really you know examine
themselves and what they do in the
actions that they that they have and
what it would effect they have on other
people so I just find it a rather
interesting so far in that book that you
know it's something that I personally
have to watch myself and with that said
so I work with a lot of a lot of other
programmers and sometimes programmers
aren't necessarily the best people
persons you know they're they're very
introverted you know they're they're shy
sometimes you know some of these kids
have been picked on their whole lives
because they were gonna be over smart
and I am nerdy there ended nerdy things
compared to you know your mainstream
media things like you know even even
video games to some extent i would say
or you know sports and and they weren't
really all that well around girls
Crawley who knows you know what I mean I
was never mr. popularity either
so the thing is so you get into to IT
and some of these these introverts then
get put into leadership positions and
and they don't necessarily know how to
manage people but they could be the best
programmers in the world so it's one of
those things that the earlier you focus
on that the better and um yeah we
actually reminds me of something that
Eli said the other day which I thought
was pretty funny but he was talking
about Millennials and how they go on
linkedin and they post some
inspirational photo and talk about like
a title or a tag line that says
something like you know how to be a
leader versus a a boss and stuff like
that so how to effectively lead people
and you know Eli's response to that was
rather funny I have a downed tree in the
way hey we gotta go around base I come
on hopefully there's no poison ivy in
here anyway we're gonna go the long
way hopefully you guys watching YouTube
here can spot any snakes on the ground
um so with Eli he was basically his
response was like f you you know it was
funny throughout two middle fingers
because you know for him he's
approaching 40 I believe and he doesn't
want to hear from bunch of Millennials
I've never actually managed the team of
people on how to be a leader versus a
boss because they've never been either
one time so why that's well that's funny
and super critical I think it's a little
bit misguided in the fact that you know
the younger that these you know
Millennials and kids coming out of
college can understand you know how to
properly lead people the better it's
going to be for their organization
because you need to have an effective
team in order for programmers to work
effectively together and write you know
effective code so i think it's uh you
know it's a rather like i said it's a
funny comment actually cracked up
laughing the way through up the two
middle fingers on the video you guys
should watch that has something to do
with the hypocrisy of you too if you
just posted a couple weeks from the date
that this video will be posted
so yeah so I mean the earlier you can
work on that the better because usually
we're not the most social crowd in the
world being programmers and you know
there we can work on that though that's
something that you can work on a lot and
actually Johnson mess talks about that
allowed on his channel about how to be
more confident and you know basically
work on yourself he's more of a people
motivator and he's trying to step into
that next phase of development he's been
a programmer and now his new thing it
would seem to me from afar is too he'll
be an effective leader a motivator and
and he could possibly do that I mean
he's already accomplishing some of that
with his channel I mean I think it has
quite a few more subscribers than I do
and that's basically from what I see of
his videos you know ever since I've been
watching him this year is mostly
motivational so we could always use more
videos like that I think anyway guys let
me know what you think and yeah I guess
try to recognize when you're being
critical of other people that's
something that I'm working on personally
whether or not you want to work on that
or you can be critical of this statement
tell me go myself I understand that
too so no no I no offense taken all
right guys talk you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
