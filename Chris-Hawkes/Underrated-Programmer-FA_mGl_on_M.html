wanted to comment on something that had
somebody had said to me on this channel
on a comment and they said Chris he's
like you're the man you're severely
underrated and um I thought it I thought
it was great because honestly I've
always considered myself to be somewhat
of an underdog type of story I've said
before in my past you know with being
rejected for different programming jobs
I was looking for an IT job for three
years while I was a self-taught
developer trying to get projects off the
ground
I went from building things and a
different you know type of frameworks
deploying applications and having to set
up the servers and mainly you know
running you know static HTML pages and
then transitioning into more database
driven design and you know all the all
of these new hurdles and things that I
was that I was gaining along the way but
even with all that experience and even
owning a business and being able to say
look at you know I've had some success
as far as getting you the content
websites up and running but still
getting rejected you know time and time
again basically for different jobs and
and not just the rejection you know
straight up from you know the employers
that you are potentially interviewing
with and trying to get into the door
with you know but also amongst your
peers like people maybe your family your
friends people that don't understand
programming and IT they don't understand
why you're spending as much time doing
it you know what it is that you're doing
I remember in case in point my sister
she's like why are you doing all that
like now you know she's like amazed that
you know I've been able to you know
excel in my career and things like that
through all this like self-taught
determination but one of the things that
people fail to understand that you know
at least people close to me and then
those are people that you know that know
me fairly well but maybe maybe they
don't really know me as well as you know
even you guys know me from this channel
but the the underdog role that I've
taken on in life you know I feel like
you know I've notched this chip in my
shoulder or be basically being told that
I wasn't good enough and that I wasn't
gonna be able to do it I didn't have a
computer science degree I'm not smart
enough to handle the logic or whatever
but I I never let any of that stuff
bother me because it wasn't about know I
just want to be successful like I pretty
much had a plan on
what I wanted to be and what I wanted to
do and I felt like you know regardless
of what anybody was telling me I wasn't
gonna allow it to to get in my way and
for the most part I didn't know I've
been you know I've been kicked in the
balls like that that Android interview
where I get to rest up and I go all the
way to DC and granted you know we talked
about the suit thing has nothing to do
with that this was more suit based
business as well but I go all the way to
DC to do this interview for an Android
job after I've been working on this
Android app for two I'm sorry it's like
two weeks and I was working in my off
time so I have a family kid kids and at
that point trying to remember where my
commute was either way it was it was
there's a commute in there as well so my
day is already pretty long but I worked
my ass off trying to work with the
Android SDK and getting this and this
Android app set up and it was a basic
you know it was a basic thing I had a
small database lookup for different
Hospital providers and it was basically
a way that you could upload medical
bills and things like that so that was
an idea it was an idea that I made based
on what I felt like the business was
looking for because they gave it this
open-ended interview where it's like hey
just build us an Android app you know
that you think would be useful to our
business or something like that and so I
built it I drove all the way up there I
went through the interview process I was
basically made a fool of they didn't
look at the app and immediately it was
about the fact that I didn't have the
education and I didn't have what they
were looking for and all this other
stuff and you know they could have
easily have told me that on the phone it
was it was a really crappy experience
but that wasn't the first time I've been
rejected I've been rejected several
times before that but that one that
one's stung a bit because you know on my
way home back from DC I remember I
called my boss and you know my boss knew
what was up because I was working in an
industry that had nothing to do with IT
and that you know that this job was
completely separate from but she was
cool with me trying to you know to you
know to build you know my ambition I
think she understood my ambition to want
to be a you know successful developer
and and she was she was very supportive
of that so I think honestly a lot of my
success now actually is is you know
thanks to her because on the way back
from that interview I was like yeah this
is you know this is probably stupid I
think
to retrace you know my you know
everything I had been working on for
almost three years up to that point
where I was just say this isn't going to
work manda I need to I need to probably
do something else I remember before I
even got into programming I had thought
about you know writing novels actually
and that's another thing where people
are like you can't just write novel so
you get you have to go to school for
that you have to be you know sort of an
editor or a writer for some major
publication or journalism or something
and in many cases you might be right but
I was trying to do something else I was
trying to find you know what what it was
that I felt like was my calling I think
in life and and I didn't know at that
point but the point is is that I did
have ambition even before I decided that
I wanted to be a programmer but it
wasn't just ambition of hey I want to
make money and be successful like that
it was actually something that I wanted
you know I want to leave a mark on the
world if I can you know I think that a
lot of people that start businesses and
become entrepreneurs and things say they
want to leave a mark on the world but
more importantly than that they want to
leave their if they have kids and then I
had a wife you know they want to leave
them with more than what they had when
they were going into this world I think
that's a natural thing for a parent to
do and when I got rejected from that job
and coming back from DC and I was
talking to my supervisor and telling her
I was thinking about you know just
giving up this whole programming thing
because it was something that you know
spending a tremendous amount of time on
it and wasn't paying off and clearly I
wasn't gonna be able to be able to get
my foot in the door and things like that
but she like come completely talked me
out of like she's like no Chris said
just you know take the rest of the day
off and you know you need you don't give
up and she was just very very supportive
I mean like literally talking before
like 30 minutes like making me feel a
lot better but even still like secretly
I was you I was saying yes and going
through the motions and and thinking in
my head that you know I'm really going
to consider giving up the possibility of
being a programmer and and luckily I
didn't listen to those assholes in DC
that didn't want to look at my app and
and it's not even their fault for not
hiring me I probably you know that was
my inexperience for even applying to a
position like that but you know at the
very least if you guys are interviewing
people you could at least look at their
apps like as a business owner now
as somebody that is a senior developer
for different companies that that that
works with other people I would always
give them the benefit of the doubt to at
least look at the product and hear them
out otherwise I would at least be I
would man up and call them and be like
look you know unfortunately we're
looking over your resume and we're not
gonna be able to do you know what I mean
just don't waste somebody's time like
that you know because you know on the
streets you waste somebody's time like
that I mean that that's kind of grounds
for getting your ass kicked really I
mean I think if somebody does that to
somebody like it's just and I'm not
condoning violence or anything like that
but what I'm simply saying is that it's
a complete jerk move and and and nobody
wants to work for anybody like that
anyway so it was probably for the best
I'm sure and and honestly those
experiences though they you know like I
said they notch that that chip on my
shoulder just a little bit deeper and
and I use that to you know try to say
that I can be the underdog and that it
motivates me to try to be better now
here's here's the problem with that
mentality is that eventually you're not
considered the underdog anymore you're
brought in to do a specific job where
you're like expected to perform with the
best of the best and when we talk about
not having the the programming degree
computer science degree many will tell
you that the computer science degree
gets people in a much better frame of
mind to be able to solve a lot of
complicated programming problems and I
agree with that a hundred percent I I do
agree with that but I also know that
some of the best developers I've ever
worked with don't have a computer
science degree I know some of the
richest people in the world never
finished college I know that I've worked
personally with people that have gone to
college and they're some of the worst
programmers I've ever seen so there's I
think there's you know obviously a mix
of the two I would imagine the ratio is
a bit higher for people that went to
college because they're just simply
going to have probably the better either
they're probably going to have a more
solid foundation growing up you know the
entire talk about whether or not
intelligence is hereditary and things
like that a lot of it plays into your
environment so if you're provided a
clean environment you know somebody
where there's not a lot of drugs alcohol
physical abuse things like that you're
obviously going to have a much gray
possibility of being able to succeed at
life as opposed to living in you know
some you know dirt poor area where you
know there is crime and drugs invested
in and that's a lot of people's reality
and they're still able to work their way
through that and that is to me that's
even more special than somebody that had
a silver spoon in their mouth even
though they may or may not have known
that they did and then they have the
scooper you know perception towards the
way that the world the way the world is
and operates you know based on their you
know their personal life ringing and
things like that so it's kind of a side
tangent there but the fact of the matter
is is that being an underdog is good
because you you typically you have less
there's less expectation for you to be
able to succeed but eventually you start
pushing that bar a little bit higher
each time and you can't always consider
yourself an underdog so I feel like in
my particular position now it's like I
can't just go into a development
environment and be around a bunch of
junior developers and be like oh yeah I
know that and I'm better than them and
then I'm somehow a better programmer
than them because I probably should be
at this point if I've been doing it for
five to seven years now there are
certain people that just they they have
an intellect that I don't have and then
there's other people that just can't
seem to grasp certain things I think we
all fall in between there somewhere and
and I think we could all find success
wherever we fall and that and that you
know that array of possibilities there
but the but the underdog thing is is
very beneficial for somebody like me
that came in with no college degree to
be able to like look you know I don't I
didn't go to school for this and I
learned on my own and blah blah but
eventually that runs out you can't you
can't always make that excuse so if
you're not able you know to keep up at a
certain position or you know a certain
group of people you know you might just
have to say you know what I'd that's you
know that's not that's not for me right
now or you know maybe that's just not
you know my skillset it could simply be
the fact that you know you didn't get
that College Foundation and some of the
advanced math or that you have a
particular lifestyle or set of
circumstances whether it's kids or you
know health conditions or whatever it
could be that prevent you from being
able to compete on that same level and
so I you know and I guess the whole
underdog thing goes
out the window at that point but the
thing is is that it is good being
underrated it's good being an underdog
eventually you're probably going to be
in a group of people that you can no
longer consider yourself that underdog
or that undervalued person and and
that's a it's a good place too because
then you know that you've arrived but
it's always then another pass another
set of you know basically just a whole
other set of responsibilities to make
sure that you continue to be on top of
your game and things like that but one
of the things I did want to comment on
just the final thing is that it's not
necessarily you know just about success
a lot of people do want to be successful
and that's why they get into IT like
they want to make money they want to be
the entrepreneur a lot of people wanted
to be Zuckerberg and myself included
like I saw some of that I had some of
those aspirations of being able to to
develop the next big thing and things
like that it and I think it's healthy
honestly I do because that drives you
but the but what is exactly driving that
if your if your entire mentality is like
I just want to have money well then
that's really not going to work because
people like Zuckerberg and people that
have success and the businesses that
they're in and they put their heart and
soul into it
they put a tremendous amount of time
into it I put a tremendous amount of
time and to getting to where I'm at and
I probably had to put in more time that
a lot of people that maybe maybe had a
better background or had more time and
like I said all those different criteria
that I mentioned before that all plays
into how long it takes to learn things
so when people ask me you know what is
the minimum amount of time like you
shouldn't even be asking that question
you should be asking yourself what is
the minimum amount of time I'm gonna
give because everybody's different and
it and really your success is going to
depend on you and and overall even more
important than that the happiness that
you have surrounding your success
whether it is you getting up to
Zuckerberg level or you know just being
somebody that can get their their foot
in the door as a junior developer
somewhere you know your happiness I
think along the way is also probably the
most important thing because if you're
literally going through the motions and
you and you don't like programming it's
it's going to be very difficult
think you have to you have to enjoy this
and you have to put a lot of time and
effort into it you wanna you want to
understand how you can use new tools and
things like that and how they can help
you hey guys so a lot of you asked me
how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
