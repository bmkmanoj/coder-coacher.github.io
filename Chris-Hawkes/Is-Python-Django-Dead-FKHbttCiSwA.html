actually trying to answer a question
about whether or not Django is dead or
dying as a lot of you guys know that you
know I've been a fan of Django for quite
sometime like Django for me it gets the
job done and I'm all about trying to get
the job done I don't want to you and
basically don't want to have to you know
make my life more difficult even though
it might not be the coolest or newest
technology but with Django man there's a
lot of things so for instance like if we
look at like jobs and things like that I
don't think that Django jobs are as
prevalent as they weren't and once were
I mean so that that to me it's
concerning a bit because you know
clearly everybody wants to be employed
when they when they start using a new
technology so one of the things that the
reasons why I use Django actually was
that when I was creating hipster code
back in June of last year or might have
been may or something like that
basically I worked on the site for like
a month and a half and I was in a hurry
to try to to try to release the product
and everything so it's not like an
impressive site or anything like that
but using basic bootstrap it's got you
know quizzes and things like that 3d
models and that's interesting so the the
actual site is using a django mudra so
it's using Django bootstrap in genetics
Apache 2 as actual back-end web servers
and then it's also using a reactant
readouts for their the quizzes so if you
end up taking these quizzes which you
have to be logged in in order to do it
let me just do that real quick and it's
making me pay ok all right well I was
going to demonstrate but I have to
actually log in as my own account and
not like another test account that I
have where it says that I have to pay in
order to do that but clearly there's a
lot I mean there's a decent amount going
on with this website right so you have
these these newest news articles and
things like that I have something that
writes for me some of my UI definitely
needs we worked on extra long time right
now
and then you have like your actual
pricing model here so if you actually go
and you purchase something you know
there's there's complexity there which
usually means you have to have at least
two HTTPS and then you end up all ten
ocation authorization things like that
so one of the things that pisses me off
a lot is like a lot of the es6 and
nodejs fans are like oh but no it is
noted it is the best and jQuery is a
piece of and Django and Python
better that's not the answer but when it
came time last year not even a year ago
where I had to get something done
because I didn't want to around
with it for a long time especially
because if I don't know man like a lot
of projects don't end up working they
don't make any money and that's just a
fact of life so I've known that from my
experience of trying to build all these
different products and everything that
most of my ideas don't make any money
they don't they don't ever pan out like
most of the time actually as I lose
interest like halfway through and I
don't see it through so that's another
reason why you want to get something out
to go quickly so you can kind of
discover whether or not you feel like
this thing is going to be successful or
not and get that feedback as soon as
possible that way you know you're not
wasting more time you need to so for all
those reasons man I use Django I was
looking at note at the time I was
looking at dotnet core I was looking at
just simple MVC dinette I looked at a
lot of different prices like I was
looking at Asher to see whether or not
that would be something I where I'd want
to host and I looked at AWS but I ended
up choosing the node as my web server so
it's a virtual private host and that
means that I'm guaranteed a set amount
of assets and everything it's pretty
cheap I can run everything on a $20 a
month windowed account so they're
actually great I think and in addition
to that so like you need to deal with
authentication authorization if you guys
have ever seen
passport jas man this number one like it
just irks me this white font on
a black background I can't stand it it's
terrible but then a documentation you're
kind of left hanging man like you could
go through this and monkey around and
play with it if you want but for
what Django provided me with with pie
socialism and being able to hook into
you know like a bunch of different
logins so I can eat all this works I
mean whether it's Google Facebook or
Twitter for me it just worked a lot
easier on Django and PI so off than it
did using nodejs because you know I did
try to go that expressly s route and
then use a passport and it just to me it
was it was somewhat of a CF so once
again what am I trying to say basically
I'm trying to say that I hope tango is
not dead I don't think it's dead I think
it gets the job done better than most of
the nodejs
flavor of the week frameworks that are
out there including Express and I also
think that if people want to criticize
somebody that uses PHP level or if
they're using Django or even rails or
any of those things that have been
around the block for a time or two now
then if they don't have their own stacks
with their own problems that we're
trying to solve and that we've solved
with these tools and everything then
they're just a jackass they really are
because they don't know what they're
talking about and that's kind of that
inexperience that I was telling you
about
with a lot of developers that really
shines through on some of the more
junior and beginner level programmers
once again run your own stack set up
your own Postgres server and firewalls
and rules and and and your SSL and you
know you're talking about like
certificates and then credit card
integration and things like that and
once you feel comfortable enough doing
that with a MongoDB like maybe you feel
like meteor is the answer or something
but I personally don't I've looked at
all those different different stacks and
I choose Django because it gets the job
done now I understand that it's not as
popular as it once was so I'm curious to
see where it's going to be in the future
that would suck it's like if it got
disbanded completely but Django just
recently came out with his newest
version just a few days ago actually and
which one is Django 1.11 so you can see
one of the problems with Django it's not
really a problem but another thing about
Django which is actually good
believe it or not is that you know the
Python to series to Python 3 it's been
about 10 years now for people to try to
adopt Python 3 in technology when you
have entire stacks that are built on
older technology of companies that are
that are still working with older
technology and don't want to spend
hundreds of thousands of dollars
bringing in developers to upgrade their
systems and things like that you know
they're either using older versions of
Python or using PI 97 sometimes out of
laziness sometimes out of necessity
because some of the libraries never got
ported over to Python 3 and maybe
they're relying upon those libraries so
there's a lot of different reasons why a
django website would still be running
Python 2 7 and the Django community is
not like this hey let's jump on angular
2 and use typescript and rewrite
everything that we we did you know it's
not bridge there's not all these
backwards incompatible things and if
there are backwards and compatibilities
it's much more about it's much much more
well-documented I would say within the
Django community than it ever has been
with like react and redux and that's
including you know like if you look at
and that's saying something too in my
opinion because if you look at some of
the communities behind they react router
just the other day react router came out
with it's 4.0 version with all kinds of
braking changes and it's just I don't
know man it's there's a different
mentality between the older school
developers that don't want to have to
spend a bunch of time around
with their stuff trying to figure out
why the latest versions of the project
or have completely broken everything
that they were using you know that we
don't we just don't have time so once
again do I think Django said hell no I
don't think Django is that I think that
Django has its purpose I'm going to
continue to use it I'm actually going to
write another tutorial series for it and
I want to actually get in my tutorial
series of also integrating it with react
with redux that's what I'm using on
hipster code even my my blogs and
everything so for people that are
writing for me and some of the stuff
that I've even written so this is one of
my viewers actually wrote this article
right here on so if you guys have
anything you want to write let me know
I'll post it but I'm not paying for it
sorry the website doesn't make any money
but the is that even this stuff is
relatively cool I think that the the
editing way that I'm doing this I'm
using quill Jay has to actually write
the blogs and then also be able to
display the blog so we'll Jas if you've
never seen it is more of a front-end
basically like word you know word for
for web or whatever so it should say
trusted by hipster come here
by the way slack man I need to do a
video on slack actually love their
product so let's see yes I man dude once
again if you're a hipster trendy asshole
then and you think that everybody should
be using nodejs or whatever because you
know Django is old and all this up I
will respect your opinion on that as
long as you've actually taken the time
and the effort to create a full stack
web site where you have to manage it and
it has to work and you're taking
people's credit card information and
you're taking people's personal
information and things like that
if you trust meteor and Mongo or Express
and passport and all the other stuff
that's perfectly fine once again I
respect those people's opinion and if
they if they have that opinion of
Lakeville both using Django and using
note and they look at my like hipster
coab website besides the UI layout and
things like that I'm not a UX designer
but they're like medicine slows folk or
doesn't work or what I mean I don't know
man I guess that's a valid concern and
this is uh this was about getting the
job done getting your feet wet as wet as
quickly as possible
figure out whether or not your product
was going to work or not and for those
reasons I use Django and for those
reasons also I feel like Django is not
going anywhere and once again I continue
to I will continue to promote it on my
channel I'm going to actually do a lot
more tutorials on it and you know
integrating it with more future future
you know you I sighs maybe if you J s I
mean you could
use of your jasmine and replacement of
into the Django templating engine which
has recently also supported things like
Jinja 2 and everything so anyway I think
there's a lot of it to be excited about
like if you're trying to build a product
especially a content type product than I
think Django definitely fits to build
very well there I'm also working on a
YouTube tool eventually I hope to
release that but right now I don't I
don't know when that's going to be but
that is something that I would probably
also have on a Django back in but it's
mostly reacting and Redux that's doing a
ton of work there but anyway we'll see
if it ever gets released in may not all
right guys thanks for watching make sure
you subscribe and have a good day bye
and just a quick shout out guys this
video is provided by Deb mountain coding
bootcamp is a sponsor my channel they
sponsor my content they sponsor this
video so make sure you guys give them
the time and day to check them out if
you're interested a a twelve and sixteen
week intensive courses it's in person is
not online some of the people that I've
talked to with uh with some of the
coding boot camps are like I don't
really trust the online ones as well as
you know the the actual in-person
hands-on approach because the in-person
hands-on approach you're working with
real developers you're not just having
somebody who you know recorded a few
video sessions like on Pluralsight and
telling you hey you know blah blah we're
going to spend the first you know six
six courses just kind of talking about
what we're going to do with a bootcamp
like Deb mountain you're going to
actually be doing a lot more work a lot
more intensive stuff you're going to be
using a lot of the newer technologies
nodejs you're using a lot of JavaScript
es6 they're going to be using source
control repositories mainly get so
you're going to be working within a team
environment which is something you're
also going to need to have experience
with when you get your foot into the
industry so make sure you guys check out
Deb melon coding bootcamp if you're
interested there they have once again
they're they're based out of Provo Utah
and Dallas Texas so if you guys can
travel they do provide housing
opportunities through them but you have
to reach out to them to find out more
information
there alright guys thanks for watching
