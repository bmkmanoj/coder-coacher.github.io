requests to show my my desk tour so
based on my first desktop and if you
guys r understand that reference that's
from the other guys movie was funny as
hell with mark wahlberg and welfare but
I've had a few people actually asked me
to show the work area where i actually
do my work and I guess just cuz people
are interested I don't know why but
anyway I feel like dog because I've
been sick with some sore throat illness
for like seven days it's I mean
even after seven days i'm still like
dealing with this tyrone nonsense so
anyway you know that said I probably
look tired because it is keeping me up
at night a little bit I've been trying
to take pain killers and to try to
try to soothe that so I can actually
sleep for more than six or seven hours
without waking up with throat pain
hopefully I'm not dying or anything but
anyway guys so here is uh here's a tour
of the office area where I work out of
my home so first things first you got
the closet area which is this really
just a bedroom turn into an office but
on you got my closet area where you see
those lights and everything so I have
several lights and and things like that
and uh honey I've already showed my my
big old telescope that i just recently
bought a few months ago which is pretty
badass but this orion telescope me you
can see everything roughly 240 times
magnification something like that with
the right attachments that's pretty
sweet i got my guitar I never play it I
should probably play it more often but I
don't and then you have the actual desk
so I'm not sure if you guys are aware of
it man anytime you're doing development
you should be using multiple monitors
like I can't show you guys you can see
the mouse actually moves over to the
other side but I have until you know the
two twin monitors and I mentioned this
before it's an absolute necessity when
you're doing programming these days
there really any sort of computer work
and a lot of people don't realize but
you know these these some these
computers I mean even my standard
computer is just an age
pmv it's nothing nothing spectacular but
these computers all have the
capabilities of being able to support
two monitors so if you if you've never
done that before it's certainly worth
checking out because you definitely just
you know it makes life so much easier to
be able to do that so this whole thing
is anyway I was hoping my camera
revealed as you remember the office
space is relatively small so it's hard
to show you guys but anyway there's
there's a deaf set up so you got the
table lamp all that and then um so
yeah just you know that the two monitors
is absolute necessity and then the
computer that i did my programming on is
nothing spectacular just to HP envy i
think i paid like six or seven hundred
bucks for here's one of my more recent
additions is my my green screen so
sometimes i don't know if you guys have
seen where i do programming and i'm able
to remove the background from my videos
and you use you know you do do that with
a green screen something like this and
then you guys have obvious to see me
shoot my videos from the backyard so up
here there's a three-story death fall
down there well yeah i mean this is this
is where gets done right here so oh
yeah one last thing these things I just
ripped a label off them but it's cherry
cola tic tacs they're absolutely amazing
I'm not getting paid to say that then we
got this guy right here too i'm going to
show you this my wife got me him a
couple years ago he actually fell behind
my desk and I just recently found them
but he actually talks yep anyway oh and
then uh one of the things since I'm a
Python guy I got my Python little toy
here in fact the other day I actually
I've had this thing for years and I
realize you can pull the tongue out and
it makes it vibrate so he's kind of
dusty
yeah he kind of looks like the Python
right from the Python logo you got he
has the right colors and everything so I
actually bought him downtown at a small
bookstore and he just sits up there on
the monitor so here's a double monitor
as I was talking about guys like when
you when you do like I mean it's just
like I talked to some older people that
didn't even realize that you can do this
by me it's just like if you want to have
something open so if i pull up Firefox
so you can see it gets pulled up over
here on the right-hand side and for
anybody that knows this obviously knows
that this is nothing spectacular but you
can move it over to the right to the
left you know me but you can drag and
expand in that window and all that stuff
so anyway definitely check that out if
you guys do not have two monitors you
should be working with two monitors and
makes life so much easier alright guys
anyway take care of man have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
