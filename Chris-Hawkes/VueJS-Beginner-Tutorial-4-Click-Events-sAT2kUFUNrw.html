this video we want to look at click
events so how do we add click events to
do some more dynamic new behavior for
view Jas and in order to do that we need
to go ahead and I just want to show you
my JSON data that we had from the
previous video I added some similar
artists to the the JSON data here so we
have this new similar category and what
I want to do is actually be able to
display and also add new similar bands
or artists to this junk so let's all
let's look at band similar we're gonna
add this data element now to our view
and just so you guys can see we now have
these additional artists next to it now
once again don't worry about the styling
and presentation that's all stuff that
is not necessary to this tutorial but
when we look it's similar like how do we
go ahead and we add the ability to be
able to add something new so we need to
create an input and we need to say you
don't even have to say type I'm just in
a bet I'm in a habit of doing that but
we want to say model equals and we're
gonna give a new a new name here that
we're gonna reference and we're gonna
say so the new band this is an input
textarea so now we need a button so that
it actually does something and this is
where we're going to look at the v on
click function that's built into view J
s and now we're gonna call a method in
this area here but what we need to do
before we do that is let's just say an
artist is the name of the button so now
that we've we've done that let's refresh
and you can see that we have add artist
but nothing happens here when we click
it doesn't do anything and I'm just
gonna go ahead and put a placeholder
here as well so I'm gonna say
placeholder
all right so nothing happens here so
let's go ahead and create an on-click
event so how do we queue that we're
gonna create something called add band
and it's going to be a function so it's
going to call it as a function and I
want to now go down here to my data I
need to put a comma after the data and
we're gonna say methods and this is an
object and we're going to give it the
name of the method that we just created
so it's add band we're gonna copy that
put it right here and then this is going
to equal an actual function and then
here this is where I want to do
something I'm gonna stay alert index now
in order
so if UJS has a built in index item so
if we know band this actual band is an
array this is an array of JSON object so
how do we get the actual index like if
I'm in the zero element of the array or
the one element or the two element of
the array I need that to be passed to my
function there's a built-in keyword here
which is dollar sign index from within
of UJS which will actually pass the
index to the function so I can do
something with that so let's go ahead
and add our index here to the function
and then we can alert the actual index
and I want to show you guys this working
in action so if i refresh and i say add
artist it says zero because Bayside is
the first element of the array this will
be one and this will be two so the
reason why that's important is because
when you're dealing with a an array of
data you need to make sure you're
editing the right one so if I were to
say be a little bit more specific I
could say this bands
dot index so I'm now learning the entire
bands index and we go here and you can
see it's an object object so if we
wanted to be a little bit more specific
we could say consoled log
this man's in fact we're gonna say yeah
we'll just a console that law just fine
and now if I go over to the index here
I'm going to right-click I didn't mean
the view source um and inspect element
I'm gonna go to the console and we're
going to you don't worry about this
error message here don't it's not
necessary but when I click on add artist
it's actually going to log out the
object so this is the actual VJ s object
that has all the information so you can
see there's an image element there's an
origin there's a similar and all that
other stuff so how do we add to the
similar let's go ahead and do that now
so now that we have the index and we
know that we can we can edit this
properly we need to go ahead and say we
need to pass in this value so after the
index we're gonna say new band and we're
going to be passing in the actual value
that gets inputted into this this input
box and now we need to go into our
methods and we need to add new bands so
that way we can do something with it
and then here we're gonna actually
update this bands and then we're going
to use the index that gets passed in and
say similar equals this bands and then
index dot similar plus we're gonna give
it a little comma here plus new band so
what we're doing is we're changing or
taking what's already there in the
similar and we're saying it equals what
it's already there plus the new band
that gets passed in and we make it make
sure it's separated by a comma so when
we go over to our page and we go and we
add
and we decided to add artists you can
see it gets dynamically added to our
list here and we could do the same thing
now the interesting thing is that we
would want to reset the value that gets
inputted because you can see it shows up
on multiple input elements which isn't
cool because of this two-way
data-binding as we type it's being
entered in all this other stuff at the
same time so that's why you need to have
separate IDs on your input elements so
that they do way data binding is not
occurring but that's something for
another video but you can see though
that it only adds to the actual element
that is being edited so and if I were to
add it down here you can see it adds it
so you can do a lot of different things
with this stuff but this is how you end
up using click events and view j/s
alright guys thanks for watching please
subscribe and bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
