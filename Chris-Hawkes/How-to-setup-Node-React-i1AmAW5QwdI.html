gonna be looking at a new piece of
technology here microsoft visual studio
is released visual studio 2015 Community
Edition for free which is kind of a new
thing that they've done over the last
couple years to try to compete with
other open source project so you can now
get visual studio for free the Community
Edition and in this video we're going to
be looking at node JavaScript and really
looking at isomorphic JavaScript which
means JavaScript they can actually run
on the server and the client which means
when I say client browser so the browser
can render JavaScript but the reason why
you want to use isomorphic JavaScript
that can be executed on the server using
something like node is because it's
better for search engines Google is one
of the few search engines that actually
has the ability to be able to translate
JavaScript and determine what sort of
content a site has although there are
still skeptics and I'm skeptical myself
of how well they actually run that
JavaScript with their search engine so
for search engine optimization it's
still really important for content to be
delivered from the server without having
the client haven't to build the data
another thing is it's a better user
experience so a lot of times the server
can render JavaScript and markup quicker
than maybe a client with a spotty
internet connection that has to make a
bunch of Ajax requests to get data and
things like that so in this in this
particular video what my goal is to
actually be able to get a website that i
currently have sitting on a Django
server transferred over to nodejs using
the Express framework which is written
on top of node node can be thought of as
an engine while expresses thought of
more as a web framework kind of like
Django or ruby on rails or asp.net and
expresses very bare-bones close to the
metal language that is not very Minato
encompass ting it doesn't try to solve
all your problems for you it actually
does a very little bit but what it does
do is it makes things a lot easier
when you're dealing with like template
engines and things like that so in this
video we need to go ahead and install
visual studio also install the nodejs
tools and you can do that by downloading
them both from this link here once you
do that you need to go ahead and start
out visual studio we're also going to
open up a command prompt you need to run
it as administrator all windows if
you're using Windows I feel bad for you
like I am and what we need to do is when
you go into the projects folder or
wherever we actually want to have our
project located and I'm going to create
a directory cell do to make their
command and we're going to call it until
a bun to or not a bunch I'm sorry I'm
gonna call in tell node and I'm going to
CD into that all right let's go and
close that down and visual studio should
be open for you now after you have it
installed we want to go to new project
and you're going to notice all these
templates on the left hand side if you
installed the nodejs tools for visual
studio you'll see the JavaScript command
here and then there's a bunch of nodejs
options and we're going to go with the
basic nodejs express for application and
we need to actually browse to the folder
that we just created so I called it
until node I'm going to select that and
this thing asks me if I want to create a
directory for the solution which I
actually don't i'll call the project
intel node and then just click ok so
this is going to build a lot of
boilerplate code with express the
default template engine is going to be
Jade and we're not going to use Jade in
this tutorial we're actually going to
use react but the project's going to
create for you automatically and that's
fine
now on the right hand side you're going
to look at your solution Explorer which
is where all your project files are
located and in here you're going to have
your node modules which come with this
project directory that that was created
for us so you see express is there which
is just a node module and then Jade is
also a node module which is used for
templating which we're not going to end
up using the project that we're going to
use instead of jade is going to be
called Express react views and it's an
open source project available on github
and it was created by some of the guys
over at Facebook and it tells you the
command that we need to actually run so
if you have no Jas installed which you
should mpm will be installed for you
which is just a package manager allows
you to install modules and things and we
need to actually run the command from
the directory where our node modules can
be found so you'll see that I'm two
levels into my project directory and you
can see that I now have a folder called
node modules so if I just paste this
here hopefully this will install without
problems on Windows
so it's probably gonna take a while has
to pull down a lot of stuff from the web
all right so if you don't get a bunch of
red and everything then everything went
well it installed so it installs all
these options now Express react view is
requires Babel and Babel is a really
cool project which actually takes your
JavaScript code and it can even be the
latest standard of JavaScript which is
on called ECMO script 6 is the latest
version and most browsers don't support
all the latest versions of Java Script 6
so what Babel does for you it allows you
to write JavaScript six types in tax but
then it also compiles it down to an
aversion that would work in the earlier
standards of JavaScript 5 and earlier so
Babel does F worry it's a really popular
project it's gaining a lot of steam
lately but on express react views
actually uses that now in the
instructions here you can see that it's
telling you to set your template engine
and by default ours was set to Jade and
we want to remove that and we're going
to put in the react view instead so
we'll just paste that in here react uses
a syntax called jsx you actually don't
have to use jas actually going to use
raw JavaScript but it's probably best
that you just bite the bullet learn jsx
it's really easy at first it'll seem
like like it gets in your way but once
you get past that stage like I actually
turned it down like twice I mean I tried
learning and I was I aw as a waste of
time but by the time I really started to
grasp it and really started to
understand what it was doing for me I
wouldn't have it any other way it just
makes our writing complicated JavaScript
so much easier so anyway jsx is the
syntax that's that's used for that and
if you'll notice on the right hand side
in our solution Explorer that our
project comes with routes and it also
comes with a views folder and the views
folder is actually our templates and
it's referencing these Jade files that
we don't even use since we're not using
Jade let's go ahead and delete that and
under views if we right click under the
folder and we say add will say add new
item
and we're going to create a jsx file
which is going to be our index jsf so
make sure you have the dot j sx o it
will create the right file type and then
we're going to go to github here and
we're going to just grab the hello world
example that they have and will paste it
inside of our view and if you've ever
done react before you'll notice that
this dot props is going to be familiar
for you for you it's the immutable data
the data that you know doesn't need to
be stored in state because it never
changes and you'll notice that this stop
props is just standard and then dot name
is the variable that that's being passed
down so it really just name and the way
that that data gets passed down is
actually gets passed down through the
route so if we went over to our index
route you can see that we're currently
passing down the title and were you
saying Express but we're going to change
this over to name so that way our new
jsx index view and we'll make use of
that now another thing too if we go back
to our apt jas file you're going to see
that there's some code that's included
for us which means them any sort of 404
page not found is going to redirect to
an error page but right now we have no
error view so let's go ahead and create
that as well this is going to be just
called air jsx and then in here let's go
ahead and paste and instead of actually
using a variable name we'll just put
inside like a h1 say an error occurred
and really we might want to just a
change this to error message this hello
message is just terrible alright so now
that we've done that let's go ahead and
go back over to our apt ijs file and
you'll say see this is how the react
sorry this is how the routes are set up
here is that you have the basic domain
when your application is fired up is
going to just be sent to the routes
folder which is here and it's going to
look for the index route that matches
and you can see that this is the
matching route and it's going to render
up our it's going to use the template
renderer to actually spin up the index
and indexes jsx code which will be
compiled down the raw JavaScript and be
sent to the client as fully rendered
react code that just looks like a
regular web page so let's go ahead and
try to run this here and see if we have
any error messages if everything goes
well this thing's going to pull up a
Chrome browser and we should see
something like Hello react or no I
should say hello Express I'm sorry
because we that's the name of the
variable that we pass down so you can
see Hello Express and when we go ahead
and we right click and to inspect
element or really we could just say I'm
also view source as well so view page
source is even more important you can
see that the doctype HTML and it's just
raw HTML that just got sent down which
is which is what we want so the search
engines that request this page it's not
pulling down javascript include files
and stuff like that and waiting for the
client to actually build the page the
page was already built when it was sent
down and that's by definition would
isomorphic javascript is just so you
know this particular project that's all
it does is actually renders react code
on the server now much of the time
you're going to end up using
included react files that are going to
make Ajax calls to whatever sort of API
on that is set up under your node
installation to be able to do a lot more
dynamic behavior but just initially
you're going to want some sort of markup
created on the server and passed now all
right guys let's jump back over to our
application here and this thing has
images javascripts it's just that's a
horrible name I think I have to kill the
star trib by pressing this red stop
button but I'm going to change the name
of the javascript file or folder I
always colleges JSI javascript is
terrible and stylesheets is even worse
and I'll just call this CSS and then
this style stl I've no idea what the
hell that is I'm i get rid of that and
under main.css let's go ahead and create
our first CSS file and we can just say
down here main dot CSS and we'll just go
ahead and style this thing will make a
color bread alright guys so I'm actually
running out of time so we're going to
leave the video at this point and in
future videos we'll get into more of how
we can bring in style sheets and
javascript i'm using react on the server
side alright guys thanks for watching
