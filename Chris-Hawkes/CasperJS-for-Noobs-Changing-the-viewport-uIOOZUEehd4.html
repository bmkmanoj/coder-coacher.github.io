last video I showed you the screenshot
was showing like a small view like a
cell phone sighs view the reason why is
phantom JavaScript comes out of the box
with like a 400 pixel wide view port and
Casper does not override that by default
but you can go ahead and just add an
additional function to your start
function here to set the viewport size
so when we do our Casper dot start and
we grab the google page we're going to
go ahead and say dot viewport and then
in here we're going to give it the the
width so we'll say 1200 pixels by 800
pixels and height and let's go back over
to our program and run that and see if
the screen shot looks any differently
alright one other thing in this video
and I apologize for not showing you
before was that I did add two seconds on
the wait here we had it at three
thousand milliseconds before but one of
the things if you notice intermittent
problems with requests that works
sometimes I don't work other times
generally it's because you didn't wait
long enough for some sort of Ajax call
or maybe it's some sort of intermittent
internet connection on your end or on
the servers and that you're trying to
connect with it could be any one of
those so sometimes just increasing that
weight will solve a lot of the issues
but anyway let's go ahead and see what
the the screenshot looks like here all
right and here it is so you can see the
full this is the full view port desktop
size free asian women what the heck is
that that's a Google Adsense ad I have
nothing to do with that anyway so that's
that's what you got here so anyway thank
you for watching I'll get into some
other stuff in the next review bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
