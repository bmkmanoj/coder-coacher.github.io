I'm talking about is darker and darker
is a very popular product you hear about
all the time and a lot of people don't
really understand what it's used for but
what I wanted to mainly say to my
viewers and anybody that's just getting
started programming docker is mainly
built for been able to develop within a
team a consistent way have been able to
take your application and deploy to
other machines to other operating
systems where typically that is a major
major headache for instance even when I
as a single developer and working on a
Django project and I'm writing my code
in a Windows environment and then I take
that Windows environment code and I
upload it to my linux server on the node
using something like FileZilla myla note
setup is completely different there's
different path variables there's
different you know like different pip
libraries and things that you've added
on that you need to then install inside
your your Linux environment to match
your Windows environment there's
typically different databases so I have
a Postgres database running on windows
which is my dev database and I have one
that runs on my window or my linux the
database or Linux server and ultimately
it's always a headache trying to bounce
between you know the two environments
with something like Django though and
really any web project what you want to
do is you build like a configuration
right now a lot of times if you've ever
gotten any sort of node development you
can see with NPM you create an inet file
and it makes the Jason config and the
Jason config says hey everything that is
that this project depends on so that way
when you take it to another location you
can just simply say NPM run build or
install or whatever and it's going to go
through the config and it's going to
pulled out all those necessary
dependencies docker can pretty much be
thought up in a similar way and that it
makes dealing with those nightmares much
easier especially when those nightmares
are amplified by like times however many
developers you have on your team and
however many different machines that
they have so there's always a battle of
of keeping different environments up to
date so this environment will
eyes on this package and this one relies
on that package and you know this guy's
got that package installed on his
machine but you don't have it on your
machine so now when this guy uploads
this code it screws up everybody else
and you can't run the code because you
know your code doesn't have the package
that he downloaded so a docker creates a
centralized way the centralized wrapper
I've been able to manage all those
dependencies for you so when you upload
a docker application to a Mac I Mac
Linux Windows it doesn't matter it
should it should work it should be a
write once run anywhere type of
application we've heard that going all
the way back to the Java days write Java
in the late 90s was was built for that
you write once it's going to run
anywhere that the Java Virtual Machine
is installed on it never quite works out
that well and we're still battling that
you fast-forward 25 years and we still
battle that in that same battle so
docker is catching fire but one of the
things i do want to mention is that for
me personally i don't need to use docker
when I'm dealing with my windows / linux
environment differences when i'm working
with within windows or linux or whatever
it may be i just simply have to create a
few you know if else conditions inside
my settings file to say hey if I'm in a
windows environment do this if I'm Anna
Linux environment do that so I can have
different pass codes and different
database connections and all its stuff
and it could all be relatively you know
safely managed in my settings file
however I'm also a single one developer
guy writing all the application code so
if if I start breaking out you know if I
start breaking out in hiring new
developers and they start having their
own machines and maybe ones using Linux
ones using Mac or whatever it is then we
start running into problems but you can
see this particular website right here I
just simply created a you know a config
for it so that way when I run it on a
Windows environment it just works if I
run it on my linux environment it just
works but the code is built in you know
to be able to manage both of those
environments and that's something that's
relatively easy to do where you don't
have to rely on something like docker so
if you're thinking about learning docker
just because it's the hip cool thing
that everybody's talking about and
you're just trying to write some code
and you're just learning and stuff like
that I would probably suggest that you
don't mess with it right now
there's nothing wrong with learning new
technology but if it's going to prevent
you from like you know taking three
steps forward where you're going to take
a half a step trying to mess with docker
and understand that I just think it's a
bad idea for any new be developers you
know at this at this moment but if you
have a multiple developer team I would
definitely look to use docker to try to
make those that landscape a little bit
easier to navigate all right guys let me
know we think and please check out the
new website hipster code let me know if
there's any improvements i can make i'm
also trying to i'm actually continuing
to build it up as I go here and please
subscribe the channel I appreciate
everybody and have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
