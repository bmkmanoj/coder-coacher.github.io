what we're going to be doing today is
installing a new theme for visual studio
instead of this boring white you know
white and blue and green I feel like
this you know just looking give you some
headaches and things and the best theme
out there i think is his son of obsidian
sigh called dark you want your text as
an orange and things like that so it's
definitely sweet it's kind of similar to
app thomas studios and seems to be kind
of an emerging trend so if you want to
go ahead and get back just go to a
studio sty and then just say son of
obsidian it should be the second listing
on your google search when you click on
that just download the scheme it's going
to save it to your downloads and then
once that's done all you got to do is go
into visual studio click on tools import
and export settings and then you're
going to want to select import selected
environment settings it's going to be on
export so make sure you select import
click Next and then just say no I just
want to import new settings that
override my current settings and then
you want to go ahead and just some it's
going to be in your downloads so I
already had it on here but I'll just go
ahead and click browse and then click
your downloads and actually two of them
here but go ahead and click finish
and it's going to take a few seconds
here
and it should start working any second
here at least we hope
so the weather's out weather outside is
pretty nice right now I meant yea yippie
up you push the weight but hopefully
it's installing fine and we're going to
dry run in just a few seconds
so hopefully it's not going to take as
long for you guys it's just that I got a
lot of stuff running in my computer
right now it's also taping to second two
separate things at the same time so
anyway you go ahead and close it now if
you don't notice it working right away
you're probably going to be a little bit
concerned but you're going to probably
want to go and restart visual studio I
hope that this joint takes effect this
is my website by the way
okay all right so it would appear that
the goddamn thing did not work so maybe
studio sky where we picked this up from
is actually just a big flat piece of
crap so let's go ahead and let me go
ahead and just see what's going on there
apologize for this studio sky is
supposed to have one that works
when all else fails you just hit hit up
Google and visual studio 2010
okay maybe this guy's got a better
version here because the studio side we
definitely did it the way you're
supposed to do it and it does not work
so it's normally not this difficult but
let's go ahead and extract this value
our desktop now that we have that lets
the exact same thing that we did before
go to tools import export settings we're
going to import and then no just
overwrite my current settings and then
little browse our desktop
and let's go ahead and see the last one
took what I think you know a lot longer
than what it should have at least I
think so so you know obviously it's a
piece of crap or something it's just not
working right so this one this one
should work
yep and it does work see it applied this
nice dark setting so our methods are
spelled out in this world actually it's
got different of different colors for
certain things or namespaces titles are
green and like our classes are blue and
things so you're going to actually
really like this when you start doing a
link like links are going to be like a
light blue color so this whole theme i
think kicks ass and thank you definitely
don't like it so sorry about the
inconvenience and hopefully if anybody
has made the same mistake as trying to
download that theme that doesn't work
then you know where to go to to get the
right thing so anyway thank you for
watching please subscribe and if you
have any any time or if you're
interested in crowdfunding i have a
website that i'm working on right here
it's called noob niche so hit me up on
that and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
