is I'm just gonna simply take a moment
to talk about what it's like to be a
programmer so a lot of you guys always
ask me that it's like what do you do day
to day what do you like so one of the
good things about being a programmer at
least in a lot of places that I've
worked at is that there's things like
autofocus anyway um so one of the things
that is uh that's interesting about
being a programmer is they your hours
can vary widely so I used to have a job
or had to be there at a specific time
and in most places you do still have to
be there at a specific time but with
programmers it's more about like what
you get done so like most of the places
I've ever worked it's like hey if you
want to come in at 9:00 and stay till
5:30 or 6:00 whatever the core hours are
for that place and then it's no problem
so you'd have people coming in as early
as like 6:00 and leaving out earlier you
know the people that have the larger
communities need to get out but that's
one of the best things I think about
being a programmer is the fact that you
do have very adjustable schedules
because it's all about getting something
done and not necessarily about being
available for a particular customer or
something like that now you still have
to be available but it's not nearly the
same thing as like being in customer
service we have to be answering the
phones and things like that so that's
just that's yeah it's kind of my my
thoughts on that so another thing about
being a programmer that that I think a
lot of people don't really understand
when they're first getting into it it's
like as you're learning how to program
you don't know to do right and like
you're just like man none of this stuff
makes me sense it and like as you start
doing it more and more you build more
projects like things start to connect
and they start to come together and you
build upon that every time but what's
interesting is like no matter if you're
a junior or like a senior you're always
gonna be asked to do stuff that you
don't know how to do and like the more
senior you are like the more I would say
large-scale that is of a task you know
for you can basically they put a lot on
your shoulders and things like that but
it's I think the interesting thing about
that is that there's not much of a
difference between me having a senior
developer title and then just me being
like a junior developer there's
differences and what you're responsible
for and what you're doing but the
mindset of oh I don't know what I'm
doing is always there kind of thing like
I need to figure out the best way to go
about this type of thing
I imagine the level of comfort that you
have when you don't know
it's probably better as you get older
and more experienced because you know
that you've been in that you've been
down this road a time or two and you're
going to end up you know figuring it out
one way or another so that's another big
factor of being a programmer another
good thing is that if you like companies
are starting to be more open to work
from home so I've worked for companies
that are very strict about like they
don't want working from home and then
there's other companies that are that
are much more open to it and I think
hopefully we're going to continue to go
down the path of being open to it maybe
not a hundred percent because it's very
difficult to be a hundred percent remote
because you can have a disconnect with
your team and things like that but but
there's a difference between being a
hundred percent remote and then working
from home a couple days a week you know
to alleviate the congestion on the
highways or whatever so that is a huge
benefit so for the companies that do
that just know that this programmer
right here I'm gonna be much more
inclined to work for you if you have
that type of policy then if you didn't
so that's my thoughts especially as I
get more senior and I have family and
you know you deal with a crisis on the
home front
by the way crisis on the home front one
of the worst things about being a
programmer so when your test would not
knowing how to do and you're also
having to deal with like a tremendous
amount of stress whether it's
health-related or family members or
something like that your job is much
more difficult than just going to work
and and carrying wood you know what I
mean like so I've done all kinds of
like Carpenters helper and things like
that and like you know most of those
jobs like they don't require a
tremendous amount of mental capacity so
it's like you can just kind of go in and
start just you know going through your
routine and kind of you know even in the
worst days and with the most stress and
everything you still I think are being
able to get into a rhythm with other
types of jobs now as a software
developer you can really things up
if you're not thinking correctly so you
know and that's just something that I
haven't had to deal with too much but it
is something that as I've gotten older
and I've had to deal with a few things
that it's like man that this isn't the
best profession if you have a stressful
home life you know demeanor if you have
a lot of stuff on your plate this
probably isn't the best profession
another downside is obviously you know
you have to learn all the time you
have to learn stuff you don't want to
learn you have to learn how to re
reinvent the wheel like every six months
to a year or something like that so you
know there is that
if you're good at something you're gonna
find that you kind of get pigeonholed
into that a lot so like you get labeled
as like the expert in that particular
field whether it's that technology or
you know UI in general or back-end or
databases or whatever like you're gonna
get like you're gonna get titles kind of
like all that is you know he's the guy
you go and talk to about that sort of
thing so in a way though kind of
pigeonholes you into being doing
something that you're comfortable with
and at the same time you have to be
careful because then you can end up
being you know if you get dated your
technology could end up you know not
being relevant anymore and if you're not
constantly learning then you're not
going to be staying up to date in this
industry and that is probably the worst
thing about being a programmer if you're
if you're a carpenter and like you've
studied you studied carbon trading
everything you're a master carpenter or
your master plumber or electrician or
something like that those standards and
everything have been have been
solidified over decades our programming
standards yes you can go back decades on
a lot of different standards and things
like that but we're constantly you know
reinventing that stuff so that is that
is an extreme challenge if you have like
I said a busy life or if you want to
have a big social life then a programmer
may not be the perfect job for you I've
seen so many marriages destroyed by
being you know by programmers because
they have to spend so much time studying
and things like that and the unfortunate
thing is you're not really getting paid
for a lot of that the other benefit of
being a programmer and the same token
though is that money one of the reasons
why we always try to learn that new
technology is we want to have that
competitive advantage against other
people because this is a very very
challenging job field like so it's also
global so you're competing with
programmers from around the world some
of the smartest people from all these
different countries and and you just
have to compete against that so there's
going to be a lot of demand there so a
lot of times you're your family and
things like that you know we'll end up
suffering because you have to end up
making sacrifices and things like that
and that's you know dog just chased a
cat up a tree that's not good
all right she got down anyway
so yeah that's really it so I'm probably
gonna touch upon this some more and more
but like this this wasn't a planned
video this is just me taking you know
what appears to be seven minutes at this
point just to kind of go in so it's not
really not even playing it out very well
but I think I'm gonna probably touch
upon this a lot because a lot of you
guys asked me what is it like being a
programmer man but like my day consists
of I go in I check my emails like I
don't have to answer the phone or talk
to people so I did most for the most
part like being a programmer is much
better than most jobs I've ever had in
fact really pretty much all jobs because
it pays well enough now if I was getting
paid $40,000 a year to be a programmer
compared to like you know something else
and that's probably a different story
but right now programmers are they're
highly paid and you know that makes the
job for the most part worthwhile but
getting back to my previous topic or my
point that was making just before I said
that is that you're always trying to
look for that competitive advantage and
if you're like an entrepreneurial type
of person like me you're always looking
at technology and how you can use that
to better yourself or how to make money
with it things like that and the thing
is is that like I I don't I don't know
the reason but I think there's so much
of this like Rockstar persona
that it's like we all want to be like
the next you know the next millionaire
guy that sold his project at Google or
Yahoo or something like that and like
next you know you're just you're on an
island somewhere and just you know but
that's not reality really it's not
reality for most of us so I would say
keep those thoughts in check as you're
like spending so much time away from
your friends family whatever just trying
to continue to stay up to date you know
just just be good at certain things and
always make sure that you are good at
certain things that are still in demand
so I'm gonna get off here because the
friggin sun's going down very quickly
