man I'm in my backyard here and like
during the summer months really late
spring summer months and like we got
Zika all throughout this joint just
kidding I don't know if they have Zika
but there's like there's always
mosquitos out here it's one of the pains
of being out of the woods I think I'm
but you know what I've been to Canada
and in other places and they deal with
the same so I'm not really sure you
can escape that and clearly South
America has mosquitoes where's all the
Zika stuff going on but there's one
flying around I carry that look at that
I can't see I'm sure like flying around
everywhere
just chilling even in the end of day
like I thought they were supposed to go
away when the Sun comes out but I guess
there's not enough Sun out here anyway
my quick shot on this video is uh
sometimes man I don't know if I see
myself being a developer at 50 and 60
years old based I was running in the
dirt again like she always does yes I
don't know if I consider myself being a
developer when I'm 50 years old it's not
that I can't do it but it's just that
like people's interests change man I was
in an industry one time where I was
doing it for like seven and a half years
I just wanted to get out of it like I
did not like it anymore
I ended up doing development which was
completely different and and I really
liked it so now I'm like seven years in
the development and I still really like
it I've had the most success in
development I went from being broke his
flock to like making a lot of money in a
period of a few years all through
programming and development and you know
through Drive and everything and and
what's good I guess depending on where
you live in the opportunities you have
is that you have all kinds of options to
try to do other things so like maybe one
day you don't want to be a programmer
anymore you can just do something else
but I don't think that the reason why I
don't want to do it is necessarily
anything to do
with age or anything because I think it
doesn't matter how old you are you can
do it but it's just that I suppose like
for me I may one day try to get into
like you know maybe management or even
just try to do something different like
being a programmer especially for a
software development company is just a
grind like it's always a grind there's
always some sort of time frame you're up
against it's one thing after another and
it's you know when you compare that to
other jobs it's it's a lot different
when it comes to theirs and mental
stresses of trying to make a deadline
and that's not something B and we're
going to exploit it anyway that's not
something you see I think in every
profession but I don't know man just
just might I was not trying to
discourage anybody out there anything
like that but like you know seven half
years in this business and like I feel
like I could you know do it for another
10 15 or so but then I'm going to be
trying to like you know I'm going to be
riding out into the sunset probably
trying to do something else and and what
that is I don't know it could be real
estate it could be some other side
business or something I mean I don't
know I mean I could end up I got all do
manual labor or anything but how I could
even be a full-time youtuber I don't
know but it wouldn't be wouldn't be a
bad gig I think to be teaching other
developers kind of like as you know in
some sense but maybe in a more
professional capacity I'd probably have
to have a degree depending on what you
know what I was what I was trying to do
but I don't know man I guess there's the
joys of life right I've had several
different careers now and seven years in
the IT gig has been fun and it's
definitely gonna be something I continue
to do for at least another decade or so
but you know from there from a
programmers perspective it depends on
like whether or not you're with a
software company a letter
anyway a lot of a lot of software
companies have like management
opportunities they have leadership
opportunities you may even be able to
slide into like an analyst role so maybe
one day you know you get caught you get
burned down on coding right happens to
people all the time because of the daily
grind you may have options of being able
to slide into like more of an analyst
business analyst somebody that gathers
requirements for the programmers you may
even decide you want to be QA although
QA is probably the most disrespected
divisions within IT at this point
because you know so much of it is
transferred overseas and and just people
a lot of times don't get the value that
they deserve when it comes to QA and
software testing and things like that a
lot of times it's on the back burner
because you're up against the demand and
everything and a time crunch but you
know that is not something I would have
any interest in doing but maybe even you
know starting my own business
consultancy things like that hell you
could even write a book Packt publishing
has reached out to me they don't care
that on the degree I've been in this
field for a long time I've been doing
tutorials for a long time they've been
used by computer science schools in
England and in even hearing things so
it's like you know who cares that
honours degree I mean it seems like I
could write my own book maybe even an
ebooks or something and try to teach
other people if I wanted to do that but
near sky's the limit I guess but the
thing is is I can tell you firsthand
that you know there is a difference
between working for a software
development company that has like you
know they're typically better run when
it comes to building software but at the
same time I would say the TV the grind
is a little bit more depending on you
know where you've worked because and
what do i what do i equate that to I
like waiting it - it's not really
equated but I'm comparing it to like
having a company that has the computer
science department but isn't necessarily
a software development company something
like a marketing agency or even you know
like a big company that has an IT
division like a Walmart or something
like that
you know they're into the business of
building software for their business but
they're not necessarily software
developers for other people's
consumption you know besides the cancer
for their own product so it's just my
thought so I think that you know there
is a difference I think it's harder
being in a software development capacity
it's something that I think people could
burn out a lot quicker on for those
reasons I would definitely recommend
people do as their degree so that they
could you know bounce into a management
or something else you know when the time
comes when the time fits for you know
when they need to break from from that
grind but yeah software development is
more of a pressure cooker situation and
then IT in a different environment you
know like I said through a business I've
had experience in a software development
company also with a business that has a
software or an IT department and clearly
the grinds with a software development
company has been much greater in my
opinion so for all your newbies that are
trying to get into the field you know
take that for what it's worth I mean
depending on you know what it is that
you're trying to do I think when you're
younger you don't have a family
you have much more time to devote for
learning and staying late and things
like that then you know being in a
software development company it's
probably going to be the best experience
for you because you're going to be an
excellent programmer but if that's not
you know exactly what you're looking for
then you know you may want to consider
more of a company with an IT department
so yeah all right guys let's my thoughts
man take care bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
