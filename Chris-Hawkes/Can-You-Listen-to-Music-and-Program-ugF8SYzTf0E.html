talking about whether or not you can
listen actually from let me turn off my
fan so I'm talking about whether or not
you cannot you can listen to music while
you're programming and that's something
that comes up a lot because a lot of
companies take this approach where it's
like you can't you can't listen to music
you can't listen audio book so you
shouldn't be listening to the radio even
if it's talk radio and things like that
because you know they think you're not
being productive and things like that so
this like so I'm going to give my
perspective on this I know other people
have talked about it like John time as I
was watching his video about it hehe
took an approach at least a couple years
ago I think it was that you know unless
it's like classical music you know
anything with lyrics is going to be
something that's going to be taking too
much attention away from what it is
you're doing so i have like I think a
different perspective on that so I just
want to give kind of and I guess an
unscientific example or evidence of you
know of what I think to be true and
honestly like I really don't know if
it's accurate or not but the thing is is
like if you are concentrating on
something that is very very difficult
there's no question that like the music
isn't really going to help you be able
to focus on something that is like
something that you're learning for the
first time something that like even yes
something that you said i would say
almost everything that you're learning
for the first time music probably not
going to be unless is very low in the
background and maybe a reading i was
like a textbook type of thing and taking
notes but if I mean if your brain is
drawn away towards those lyrics you know
that is like I guess that is like the
tipping point between okay that you know
then the music is clearly not helping
now sometimes though the music is like
you're just flowing with it and and I
really feel like it can be helpful it
can make it be you no more creative and
things like that and a lot of times
companies are looking for the most
creativity as if that they can get out
of their employees so it's like if music
which is one of the you know the
greatest artistic expressions to mankind
can influence other people and how it
influenced me to be a programmer then
you would think
it would be able to influence you know
their code and their creativity and
things like that so I'm just died like
I'm actually astounded at like a mankind
like it work we're capable of you know
such atrocities and manually if you look
you know hard enough or even not hard at
all you can see some of the worst and
society that seems like it you know
we're surrounded with like with the news
and the media and things like that but
then if you look at like I was in an art
museum in Richmond yesterday at the
Richmond museum of art or something
along those lines but it's been around
since like 1933 and I've been to the
National Gallery of Art in Washington DC
which is an amazing place but this place
in Richmond like I put it on the same
level as absolute phenomenal art museum
and I'm not like big into the arts and
stuff like that I'm more and like I
guess I'm I guess realism or something I
don't care leave another art terms but
i'm not into modern art for the most
part and I like art where like I can you
know where people can like basically
paint lifelike things to me that that's
why I'm not amazing some of the more
like you know sloppy looking things i
find the rule bit harder to kind of
understand why people like it so much
and then like van Gogh and you know van
Gogh's i think is very it is very good
too i can tell even though it's like not
really that realism art is still a very
very unique style so I feel like anyway
I'm not an artist but the whole thing is
that that museum and enrichment was
great but there were so many different
artifacts and things that were going
back all the way to like to know 480
we're like people were you know spending
this incredible amount of time sculpting
these sculptures and and creating
everything from like you know chest to
put in silver pieces and things like
that too it was just like it to me I
thought it amazing because it's like man
you know going all the way back there
people have artistic creativity and then
why'd you fast forward to today with the
internet with the iphone you know if you
look at companies like Apple and Google
I mean they're doing their own
creativity you know in this own modern
technological way and then it's not like
and it's all just you know it's this
progression it's amazing but it's all
art right it really is so 10 music help
you achieve the art of
programming and i think it's i think
it's split man I really did because this
is such a logical game that we play like
tonight I was just completely I was
jamming out to Mumford &amp;amp; Sons like I'm
letting a big Mumford &amp;amp; Sons guy like
really I'm not but for instance
yah
drinkin a
so if anybody knows Mumford &amp;amp; Sons you
clearly know that's like a popular
summit and be like I mean I'm like
jamming out I'm doing things but I'm not
learning as I'm going like I say some
time on autopilot and I'm able to use
the music to just completely just
started pumping up stuff like tonight I
was working on some reactive read that
stuff and then I'm doing a lot of you I
and I haven't been doing you I as far as
like CSS and just kind of styling and
coming up with my own thing and quite
some time I just haven't had that you
know that really I guess creative
passion to work on that sort of thing so
for me it feels like I don't need to
learn anything on this on autopilot some
music is just helping me go along now
you know that said like I was uh I was
listening to something that like I
haven't listened to in quite some time I
was my first explicit album and in high
school in fact i think it was ninth
grade i'm going to been in eighth grade
but it was the first explicit album that
I had ever purchased and it was wu-tang
36 chambers and I guess as I've gotten
to be you know enough parent and things
like that I you know I've just you know
fallen out of one with it but like as i
was thinking of the concept of okay just
musics help you have this you know this
creativity and like i was like thinking
for whatever reason i saw a billboard
like had Wutang 36 chambers one of the
best albums of all time really i think
it was like they rank it somewhere in
the top 50 of top albums of all time and
i love that album just because we know
what I when I was teenager like it got
me into kind of wrap and like you know
the Brooklyn style I got to Robin and
then also the fact that like you never
selling that album of the trumpeter car
and everything it wasn't like they had
all this like production value or
anything behind it they were just a
group of guys from New York City and
amanda de made him one of the most
popular albums of all time so that was
like thinking when I was tonight when I
was thinking about the subject I was
like well you know could music like that
also you know be the same thing
yeah one o'clock cattle overcoat so as
you can see there the music is a much
more how would you said it's like you
know some people would say it's like
violent assist its extreme we're like
you know there was like pushing the
boundaries of what you know what I guess
was you know hip-hop or rap at the time
I'm really I guess it really wasn't it
was just completely different it was it
was completely almost like show tunes
rap type of stuff but the question
really comes down to like can you can
you show without music is there a
difference between you know listening to
Wutang 36 chambers or something like
Mumford &amp;amp; Sons which is much more like I
guess laid-back or can you listen to
classical music and still be able to be
just as productive with me like
classical is is too boring like so if
I'm trying to be an expression
expressionist and trying to express my
inner creativity and things like that
music definitely helps me but classical
would probably bore me although I do
like classical you know I don't I don't
you know dis on that or anything like
that but I think that if I were going to
be listening to classical I might as
well be listening to like a there was
this one website i used to go to where
you could listen the cafe sound so it
sounded like you're in like the busiest
starbucks in the world and like you know
downtown manhattan there something like
that and for whatever reason like that
could actually draw the sound but the
reason why i was listening to that was
because I had a cubical across from this
lady for like six months who would chew
I like is like 11 in the afternoon she
would start chewing ice and she would do
it like literally in toasted last into
like to read something and it drove me
crazy like I'm trying to concentrate and
all I can hear is like crunching of ice
and I'm not one who can chew ice anyway
like I feel like it's bad for your teeth
and it like it's just it's like nails on
a chalkboard just because I can
picture the the cold ice just destroying
her teeth and it was just it was it was
a lot to deal with man so I have to
listen to music and I'd be like will you
know I can't I can't listen to you know
certain like you guys know I love
Bayside's alia Bhatt like there are
certain times where it's just like you
don't feel like listening to the same
old musically or you don't feel like
listening to music at all because you
have to concentrate on what you're doing
so you know being able to drown out
those annoying sounds with something
like you know a cafe environment is
something that is definitely helpful and
I definitely think that is something
that everybody can do as a programmer if
you're struggling to you know I guess
like if you struggle with background
noises from people that sit around you
or near urine and things like that so so
that's really much awesome a subject I
really think it goes both ways so if you
don't something creative and you're on
autopilot be definitely listen to music
it would probably help you if you're
learning something new for the first
time then you should go classical or
something some sort of drowning out just
like mellowing soothing type of music or
sound and this might even be what John
recommended honestly i watch this video
like at least a year ago and I don't
remember exactly a thoughts I just
remember that along the same lines I
think he said that if you're like
learning that you shouldn't be doing
that but it definitely gets in the way
but um I think also you know just having
it low sometimes we want to jam out
cichlidae you want the music up high and
and if you just kind of keep it very
very low in metal I think you can
probably listen to a lot of stuff that
you may even get in your way a little
bit you know like if it were louder like
you know try to get I guess draw your
attention away from what it is that
you're doing but programming is a lot
about trying to keep focused you know
you got to keep focused on because like
I'm trying to this and you're on steps a
and you have steps all the way through Z
you kind of kind of you have to remember
at least four or five steps ahead of you
know where you are to try three gravel
there's yeah basically to get to the end
to your your goal like it for me I you
know I can get easily distracted for
sure i can easily get distracted and
most of the time when i'm really on a
groove though it's because I'm like I'm
not distracted I'm rolling with the flow
and
I'm just I know exactly what I need to
do and just one step after another and
and there might be a time where I'll
pause for a second or two but now I'm
just real might back in it just like oh
yeah I'm now on this step and that's
that put I think that also comes with
time as well so anyway guys you guys
take care of man thanks for watching and
have a good day bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
