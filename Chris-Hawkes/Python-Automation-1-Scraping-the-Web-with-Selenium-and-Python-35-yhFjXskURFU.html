going to pick up we're going to start
moving a little bit quicker in this
tutorial series I feel like I've already
covered all the basics of three point
five and now we're ready to really start
you know getting into some how did we
build programs type of thing so I've
also changed my editor I'm not using
atom anymore person I just hate jumping
around between the editors you guys can
use whatever editor you want a few of
you have commented on why do I you know
use atom and then run Python from the
command line and I can install some tool
to get out and run for me and it just
for me it was just more of a headache
than I felt like dealing with just
because I'm already used to one editor
and I'm already in one particular editor
all the time so I'm just because I'm
using this particular editor here which
is visual studio doesn't mean you guys
have to use it
there is a community version that is
free if you want to use it I definitely
like it but it's not a requirement at
all so you can continue to use atom or
notepad plus plus or even a notepad if
you wanted to I don't care but with this
editor I'm going to be able to run the
program directly from the editor itself
and it will evaluate here such simple
print hello world and I change the font
green let me know if you guys hate that
font I was trying to get it to stand out
a little bit because I can't really make
the font any bigger than this and I'm
not sure how small that's going to
appear when you guys are viewing this on
youtube so if it's too small or if you
can't stand the color just let me know
and I'll try to get that changed so
where where I want to actually discuss
what we're going to do next here is I'm
we're going to look at Python has a
bunch of built in libraries and things
like that right and in the libraries
that Python has like you have like date
time right so if you wanted to use
actual dates you would actually need to
use the day time library so what you
have to do in Python is you have to
actually do something called an import
in Python makes you explicitly state
what you want to import so what this
means is that I need to actually
explicitly state what part of the
date/time library I'm looking for see
daytime and Python has like all these
different
is attached to it and what's interesting
is the day time module has a date time
object that you're going to be using to
actually get the current date so what I
mean by that is you have to actually
stay say from date time import date time
because this day time is actually
attached to this day time object which
is weird so if I wanted to print out
today's current date and I would say
date time which I'm actually using this
particular day time that I've imported
from this library and then I would say
dot now which is a method attached to
that and that will actually print out
the day and time in seconds and it's not
the prettiest more map you get like you
know all these milliseconds and
everything so it's very very accurate so
that is actually how you import an
actual object that you're going to be
using so this in this video isn't about
how do we learn all the different stuff
about day time there's a lot of
documentation on how to use date time
and I can actually just show it to you
guys here
there's the day time is going to be one
of the more confusing things that you're
going to deal with as a Python developer
at least starting out so like you'll see
like from time Delta well what the hell
does that mean so if you're counting out
like specific days and stuff than time
Delta becomes really important
especially when you know Saturdays fall
on different days of the week so I mean
different months have different amounts
of days and I'm in different countries
or even different you know as far as
what their calendars are and you know
time daylight-savings hours and all
stuff like time is a complicated thing
in every single language and it's no no
exception to Python so once again this
isn't about what is the day time object
this is strictly just about okay there's
a library out there that we need to use
how do we import it so that is actually
what we just did we imported the date
time object that we needed from the day
time library and we made use of that so
that being said let's go ahead and get
rid of what we have here we want to
actually build a real program just as an
example it's going to be somewhat like a
scraper type program and it's going to
use a
a library out there which is really
important for scraping in today's day
and age with browsers and stuff so it's
going to be called a selenium so we need
to pull up a command line so that we can
access our Python installation and you
should have Python installed from
previous videos if you're following
along if not just type Python just but
make sure you have it on your machine
and you can see that python 3 5 is my
default version so when I say pip
install pip install is actually
installed for you by default with python
3.5 you staff to install it in previous
versions by three five and three four I
believe actually come with it now so you
don't have to install it any more so
just simply saying pip install and then
whatever sort of module you're trying to
install which is in our case is selenium
just press ENTER and it's going to go
through the process it will reach across
the web and it's going to download
selenium and install it onto your
machine that way python can then use it
now in my particular case I already had
it installed but you're going to see
something where it actually like grabs a
lot more stuff and displays a lot more
data so let's go ahead and figure out
then go back to our program here and
we're going to make use of this new
selenium thing will be just installed so
we're going to use a piece of the
selenium library that we just installed
it's going to be called webdriver so
just like we did with daytime we're
going to say from selenium import
webdriver and webdriver
we're going to actually assign it as a
variable so we created a driver variable
and we're going to say it equals the
webdriver that we just installed but
then we're going to use something that
the webdriver has attached to it which
is called and did I spell this right
yeah that is spell read what the hell's
are complaining about me it shouldn't be
complaining there anyway so we're going
to save Firefox okay so we're going to
use the Firefox now let's go ahead and
give it a URL that we want to request so
we're going to get and I'm going to grab
my YouTube channel as an example so
inside of these double quotes we'll go
ahead and print the actual URL so it's a
full spelled out u RL where we want to
go to get the page and then that's it so
it's go ahead and execute this program
so the reason why this actually isn't
running is because I don't have Visual
Studio pointing to the right version of
Python it's actually looking for three
four instead of three five somebody just
fix that real quick hey guys sorry about
the delay so visual visual city of the
version I was using was not working with
the latest and greatest from Python so I
to get that updated so now it's working
so this will look a little bit
differently again but now when we go
ahead and we run this program you see I
don't have any import errors now since
I'm referencing the right version of
Python goddamnit what is this it's being
used by another process that sucks one
second
all right so that ran that time that
it's because I was just testing it out
and it actually ran in my Firefox
version was actually still running so we
had two conflicting versions but you can
see what happened here is we have the
program ran successfully and selenium
was used to actually pull up a Firefox
browser and then navigate to this page
based on the URL so if I wanted to go
ahead and like click a button or
something like that let me see something
here so what I'm going to do here is I'm
actually going to right click and I'm
going to inspect element on this why you
should learn Python programming and
we're going to go ahead and look at
really just this anchor tag and if I go
ahead and right-click and I say copy
XPath I can go back over to my program
and I can say driver dot find element by
XPath and now you can see that the
intellisense is working which is nice it
is a big XPath I've noticed that in big
XPath sometimes don't work and I want to
do single quotes since this is a double
quote here otherwise I have to escape
those double quotes and I don't like
doing that so I'm just going to keep
those as single quotes and that problem
will go away let me zoom out just a
little bit so that that um that might be
a little bit too long but let's go ahead
and see what happens here
so that's exactly what happened here we
have this thing this thing just tripped
up on this humongous XPath so let's do
something a little bit more simple this
is actually not the easiest site to
automate and scrape which is probably
one of the reasons why we're also having
an issue here siege so if I just back
all that out here what I can do is on
this is a XPath language which actually
takes a little bit of time to get the
hang of but it's basically just a way of
expressing things that can drill down
and find a particular element you're
looking for in an HTML page so like this
star means match any element this a
means match and anchor so that is a
simple link and then I'm putting in
square brackets a argument that says
that it should contain certain text so
that the actual anchor text itself
should contain like why you should learn
Python programming which is the name of
the title of that first video that I'm
trying to click that needs to be like
that all right and then on the end here
what we're going to do is also fire
another method that says click so what
we're telling the some selenium to do is
we're saying get this web page and then
read the web page inside that web page
find an actual Dom element which means
document object model and HTML it just
basically means giving me a section of
the page that matches this and then
click it which is going to be an anchor
tag so it should pull up the new video
or that first video that that shows up
on the channel so when we go ahead and
run this again you'll see that it'll
pull up the channel then click on that
first video
and there you go so you can see that it
went ahead and requested the page and
went to the first channel so if I wanted
to build like an automated program or
something like that I can build
something that automatically uploads or
you know like something has to be signed
in obviously but you know I could even
build something that sends an automatic
comment which I wouldn't suggest since
that's you know spamming and BOTS are
easily detected nowadays but um now you
can automate all kinds of useful tasks
that you always have to do manually I'm
using something like Python 3.5 and
selenium so I'm not going to get too
much into that because it's kind of its
own video and I actually have a lot of
videos if you guys are interested on
that subject as far as using Python and
selenium the times haven't changed that
much in regards to how that's done so
you can look at some of the older videos
I have which use like python t7 and you
can apply those same principles to
python 3.5 so that's about it guys I
appreciate you guys watching thanks for
subscribing if you did and if you didn't
please subscribe and I always appreciate
that so have a good day guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
