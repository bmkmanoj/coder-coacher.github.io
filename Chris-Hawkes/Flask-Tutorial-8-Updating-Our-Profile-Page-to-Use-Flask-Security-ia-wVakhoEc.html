the last video we looked at how to
implement flash security so we had
authentication already working and that
comes with login forms logout stuff like
that and that will handle session
management for us so what we want to do
is update the profile method to use
their new email which is basically the
user identifier within our user table
instead of usernames so we no longer
have user name it's just going to be
email so let's go ahead and update that
to use a new email object and everything
else should work the same so let's go
ahead and just test this out see if we
can get to the profile page and get the
same type of data out of our website we
will have a problem in the template
though because we do reference a
username feature or attribute that's not
there so let's just see if we can go to
the profile page first so and instead of
a test you need to actually send in the
name of the yeah so that's where it's
throwing in has no user name which we
knew that which I clearly should have
changed that to email and we're still
going to get a problem with the template
though so the template even though
there's no user name it just ignores it
as you can see but the results are the
same we're getting the email out of the
database and what other information is
in the database let's take a look so if
we go to a user and we view data the top
hundred role roles you can see that
there's an ID their password you
obviously wouldn't want to display the
password but
yeah that's kind of crappy we probably
could have a user name just extend the
user table if we wanted to but for right
now we'll just leave our profile page
just like this that's fine this is
coming straight from the database so
this this email address which is also
the user name so if we scroll to the top
of the website you can see in the last
video we actually we imported a login
required and that's part of last
security in order to use it what we
would do it's just a decorator like
we've seen with app dot route we would
just go ahead and place that underneath
the app dot route and just say login
required and now this is going to
restrict the profile page to only be
allowed to be seen by people that are
actually logged into the site so let's
go ahead and test and see if this thing
works
now one interesting thing to note is
that even though we restarted our server
flat security is actually because the
same browser session is open it
remembers that we're logged into the
site so we need to go ahead and say
forward slash log out and that'll take
us back to the home page here and then
if I try to go login again you should
see that we're not actually logged in
like all that information still
remembered because we told the browser
to remember it but we're completely
logged out now so now if I try to go to
profile and we'll pass in the same thing
that worked before we get redirected to
the login page saying that we're not
logged in please log in to access this
page which is what we want we don't want
people that aren't logged in to be able
to view their profile page so if I log
in I can now access the profile page in
fact the login was smart enough to know
that that was the page that was trying
to get to and it took me to that page
after it logged me in alright guys um so
just a few things to point out with
flash security you can see that it's
actually just storing the password in
plain text you typically never want to
do that in a production environment
people you know they look to websites to
secure their information so if your
database was ever exposed and they would
have just clear access to the the
passwords and I'm not sure if you recall
but at one point Sony got breached with
the ps3 and like they had credit card
information all that stuff and they
didn't even bother encrypting it they
took a lot of slack for that that's you
know really unexcusable nowadays flash
security actually does all the
encryption for you but it doesn't
actually handle the encryption algorithm
that it leaves that up to you and
there's several encryption algorithms
out there like decrypt and a few other
ones and we're not going to discuss that
in this tutorial but before we ever try
to deploy this app somewhere that's
something that will have to be revisited
so that way you're not storing plaintext
passwords that it's going to be this big
old like quit looking thing so just keep
that in mind before you guys try to
deploy something like this out there
like Heroku or where
you're gonna go to deploy this thing all
right guys thanks for watching and have
a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
