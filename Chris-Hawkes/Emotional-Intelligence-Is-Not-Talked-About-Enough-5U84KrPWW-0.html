looking at funny memes and then this
meme I'm trying to figure out what kind
of a computer programming slant I can
put on it and like I think we've all
been there to be honest like if you take
a moment to read this I think we've all
been there and it's not like I'm prone
to violence but I think every once in a
while you wake up and you're just like
man I wish some would you
know like I'm winning you know but
whatever like it is that you have in
your mind that you're not anyway so it's
like there was like this one time there
was a flight attendant that ended up
quitting her job and she like and now
it's like she was like basically she got
on the intercom and the airplane was
like this pulled the emergency
escape and then like it had like the
balloon like the slide that opened up so
that she could like slide down and leave
her job and never and this thing was on
the runway getting ready to take off
apparently so it was like all over the
news about quitting your draw a job in a
dramatic way this video is not about
that this video is actually about
keeping your emotions in check because
we have situations in life where like
you're gonna be challenged and and
you're gonna still have to go in you're
gonna have to work with other
professionals and you have to write code
you have the user in your mind when your
mind might be on the fact that like you
could have relatives in the hospital or
you could have all kinds of you know
there's there's so many different things
like your personal issues you could be
dealing with including your own health
or whatever and you're still gonna deal
with some snot-nosed about
like some library that they want to use
or like some you know some way that they
think something should happen and and
the thing is is like we all have our
outside problems and everything but then
we have to go in and we go into the
workplace but we have to be completely
professional we have to be respectful of
each other and one of the things though
in being respectful of each other
sometimes we don't seem to understand or
grasp the nature of what some people
might be dealing with some people might
be dealing with cancer some people might
be dealing with sick children or
divorces or whatever like people are
dealing with stuff that they completely
 them up mentally but then they
still have to go to work and like you
still have to be a productive member of
society and like that can be a real
challenge so emotional intelligence is
one of those things that is not talked
about enough in the workplace in fact
one of the best sellers right now for
business like self-help is emotional
intelligence 2.0 I bought that book and
I read most of it I like a lot of what
it talks about a lot of it is very
common-sense stuff that I feel like our
no but a lot of the studies though it
showed that people that had a very high
IQ were not more they were they were not
necessarily more successful
so people that scored high like
relatively high like even you know
mid-range like IQ test but had what was
considered to be high or strong
emotional intelligence they typically
fared better as like a business owner or
just you know as a higher producing
member of society and typically what I'm
talking about is like I'm from a
monetary perspective not necessarily
just because like some dudes got some
designer jeans on or some but so
life is gonna throw some stuff at you
every now and then here's another meme
that I think is pretty funny for when
life throws some stuff at you
everybody has definitely been here I
don't care if you've worked at a
restaurant or like where you're at
you've been at this o'clock
like yeah I mean there's and those are
always a good time especially when it's
like a group thing like I mean cuz like
solo you can be a this o'clock
almost every day probably by the time
you you know it comes time to roll out
but they're like I love when like you
have that group session of where it's
like just a multi-person effort of
this like that is always the
funnest thing I think like I've worked
at restaurants where it's just like we
just start closing things down like like
30 minutes before like you know the the
the place even closes we know and we're
gonna get customers and we're like
shutting stuff down and just like
leaving it to like you know leaving it
to chance that we're not gonna have to
saute up some mushrooms before we try to
like wash all the dishes put them away
and hope like that we don't to do it
again you know what I mean so it's like
little things like that I think I think
you know we've all we've all been there
like you know work is obviously
challenging and it's it's so it's so
weird because like life is where most of
your responsibilities lie right I mean
like like you work to provide a good
life for your family so it's just weird
because you obviously have to take care
of so much stuff at work and like you
spend more time with your work buddies
and people that you work with and even
your own family and and that's kind of
depressing in a way at least in most of
like it seems like in the industrialized
world and definitely in the United
States like people are spending more
time at work than they are with their
families but
be able to balance all that stuff dude
like certainly we've been at either one
of these two memes I thought both of
them were funny I think when you know it
when you're when life is like throwing
you a curveball and which it will happen
like the only thing you do is you take
it one day at a time one hour at a time
one breath at a time if it comes
necessary like you just you just you
have to break things down and you have
to maintain I think a schedule I think
having a calendar sometimes is
definitely helpful not just like an
electronic one too like I've found
lately that writing stuff down helps me
because my the amount of stuff that I'm
now responsible for is just it's
absolutely like mind-boggling the amount
of stuff that I have in my life that I
am responsible for when it comes all the
way from my mortgages and houses all the
way down to like pets you know what I
mean like there's so many different
things and then you have like you have
all you know the work/life balance and
like work work itself is just so much of
a stress and everything so yeah just you
break it down you take it one day at a
time
in my case like I can tell you that life
has thrown me a massive amount of
in the last six months like if like I've
never even told you guys there's a whole
world of Chris Hawkes that is outside of
YouTube a lot of people think that
YouTube is like my life and like
everything I say here is like how I talk
to my children and all this stuff and
it's like no not really like there's
like a YouTube Chris and then there's
like a Chris that actually the real
Chris that my co-workers work with and
that I play foosball with you know like
things like that so it's there's
definitely probably like YouTube I think
it gives me this audience and it seems
like sometimes this audience things
probably higher of me then maybe that
they should but I balance and deal with
the same amount of emotional
that everybody else does and like having
to go into work sometimes and like you
know there's certain times where like
you just don't want to talk to people
you still have to be professional the
best way to do it like I said you break
it down I have managed to do it and I'm
telling you if I could go into the
details of the amount of stress and
everything that I have in my life I
could tell you most of the people I've
ever talked to they look at my situation
they're like damn I feel sorry for you
like like people feel sorry for this
situation
and but then again it's it's kind of
absurd as well because it's like okay
I have a hundred thousand followers on
YouTube almost I make a lot of money out
of this career like I'm self-taught
didn't go to I think there's all this
 that I should be like grateful for
but I'm telling you even somebody in my
position that has a job that is doing
well for themselves you still have these
emotional stresses and everything you
have to deal with them and I think the
best way to do it is just break it down
step by step our by our and just know
that you know some of the stuff is just
normal really sorry like there is no
answer and I think that and knowing that
there is no answer to certain things
like if you have cancer or
something like that and and somebody
like and you have to go to work or like
you're trying to deal with it
like there's just no answer so like it's
just accepting the situation like this
there's no point in like pondering over
and you guys are asking if I have cancer
probably now and I don't I don't even
know I probably do and I don't know it
but anyway I have not been diagnosed
with cancer or any like that in
fact there's nothing wrong with me
health-wise but I just used that as an
example but the thing is is that you
will go to work and I've worked with
people that literally were dying of
cancer and they were still going to work
and like it's like whoa so just keep in
mind that people do deal with all kinds
of different things and we should all
just be as pleasant to each other as we
possibly can because you never know what
is going on with somebody's life and you
don't want to with the wrong person
like like one time well not really one
so let me give an example of driving a
driving as a good example of like I
don't try to beep at people and flick
people off I was in Philadelphia the
other day and this one dudes like coming
down the road there's nobody coming down
Market Street right in midtown
Philadelphia and this just
starts honking on his horn at these
pedestrians that were crossing over the
the the crosswalk and like there's
nobody on the road it's just this dude
he can easily slow down he's like a
block away and he's already starting to
like peep at these people in the
crosswalk and then he's like encroaching
a bottom and immediately I'm like
somebody should drag this
out of his car and beat his ass like he
needs to get his ass beat but like that
is not that's that's all emotional
 so you have to know that like
your emotional part of your brain is
going to
be your first reaction and then it's
your critical think thinking is in your
frontal cortex and that actually doesn't
perceive these thoughts and before
your emotional limbic system so there's
so much to learn there I really think
for you guys that want to you know
succeed and in the business and the
workplace and everything not just in
computer science but wherever you go
it's it's a good idea check out that
emotional intelligence 2.0 book I'll put
a link to the Amazon book and my
description tab below but just check
that out I really think that that is
something that is overlooked in the
business world and it's starting to be
like more more looked at now and I think
that if you guys start preparing for
that now you're going to be much better
leaders and managers and just much
better coworkers in general so thank you
