and hopefully you guys watch that but it
kind of just goes into what a type
system is and really it's something that
I think is glossed over when new
beginners start you know learning
programming and they don't really
realize that there's a lot of rules and
regulations that are put into how a
compiler compiles a program into actual
machine code to do what it is that you
want it to do and the type system allows
you know these rules and things to
handle that you know so basically it
says that when you create an object in
memory it's got to be assigned a type
and the type system that decides what
type that is and what is able to be done
with those types so if there's
conflicting types that are trying to be
added and smashed together it's going to
complain about it or it's gonna fail if
it's a weakly typed language or not fail
but it's going to try to do it
automatically if it's a weakly type
language like like Perl Python will
complain at runtime because it's
dynamically interpreting and then you
have a compiled program like c-sharp
where I would never even compile if you
had two different types that that we're
trying to be mashed together without
actually doing some sort of conversion
so those are really the difference is
dynamically strong type Python strong
type C sharp or weakly type like Perl so
then there's this thing that comes along
and a lot of people have questions with
with duck typing like what is duck
typing and an object Nouriel anguish is
essentially like if we look at Wikipedia
is that a definition that says in
computer programming with
object-oriented programming languages
duck typing is a layer of programming
language and design rules on top of
typing so it's built on top of typing
typing is concerned with assigning a
type to an object when duck typing is
concerned with establishing the
suitability of an object for some
purpose so in the normal typing system
let's just pretend that this is a string
right so we declared a string and the
string has a set of rules so when the
compiler runs into this it knows hey
that's a string I can't type you guys
know what I'm trying to do so it says
that's a string so it has the ability to
print two two
split it up into multiple strings or two
maybe cut off the last characters
slicing so it has all these built-in
abilities and the compiler knows how to
deal with it so remember how I said in
the previous video that if you tried to
add a string and an int it would
complain because they're they're two
different types and they can't be mashed
together the compiler knew that one
object was an engine one was a string
and dynamic duck typing it can look at
this object that say it's a duck and
it's gonna look at the actual methods
and properties on that object to see
whether or not it's actually suitable
for you know object execution so
basically it's gonna look at does this
thing walk yes it does it can walk does
it also eat bread like a duck if you
were to feed it bread and a some sort of
like domesticated central park setting
does it poop on the ground after it eats
the bread and make a mess in the park
and wherever sort of setting you are
where there's lots of ducks or geese and
if it does all of those things then it
must be a duck so it's done dynamically
meaning it's done out during the you
know the compilation the and during the
the you know the process of the
interpreter turning the actual code and
the machine code and instead of it
knowing in advance hey I'm dealing with
a string or something like that it's
actually just looking at the different
features does it walk does it eat bread
does it poop it must be a dog so it's
still somewhat of a cut like I think a
difficult concept to understand how all
that you know like plays into
programming but I can tell you that you
know Python is considered a doctype in
language so it's JavaScript I believe it
is javascript is as well actually I
should have looked that up I'm sorry I
know Python is a dynamic duck typing
language I'm pretty sure Papa JavaScript
is considered that as well
now in object-oriented languages a lot
of the times you try to do what duck
typing what duck typing does by using
like polymorphism and inheritance and
with dynamic duck typing it's actually
providing polymorphism to you but
without actually having to do the whole
inheritance
which you would have to do that in a non
duck typing language so it gives you a
lot of flexibility and freedom but you
know it's also considered you know
blasphemy to some other programmers like
in a you know fully object-oriented
sense that it doesn't allow duck typing
in strongly typed languages I think of
programmers from those backgrounds have
a harder time trying to I guess accept
those uh you know the the
characteristics of a duck type language
so to give one final example in actual
code if we look at this we can see that
a class you have a class defined as a
dock and it quacks and it has feathers
and then you have a person that also
quacks and has feathers so if we ran
this program a person could actually be
considered a duck and a person is a duck
because it does the exact same thing
that a duck does so if it walks like a
duck and it quacks like a duck and it
poops like a duck and it eats bread like
a duct and it must be a duck so
hopefully you guys can kind of wrap your
head around that and there's definitely
more examples and probably more of an
academic definition of duck typing than
my childish example but I felt like it
might kind of help clear things up in
case you guys are ever wondering and yes
this thing looks more like a goose but
yeah it is what it is all right guys
thanks for watching have a good night
