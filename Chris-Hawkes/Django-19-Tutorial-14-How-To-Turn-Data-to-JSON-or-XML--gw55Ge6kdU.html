want to show you in Django 1.9 the
easiest way to be able to take a query
set and a query set is data that Django
gets from your database and turns it
into a Django object which is really
just an iterable list of objects and it
is specific like I said to your data so
in this particular case I have a product
app and then I have a class named
product and it's a very simple model
just simply has a name and a description
so in my view is I have a query set
where I say product that objects not all
so it's gonna return a like I said a
list of query set objects all right so
the what we need to do Django with 1.9
and probably previous versions I think
going all the way back to a one-point
seven or so they have in the Django doc
or import serializers and the
serializers actually serialize a Django
query set from like XML or can it can
query it serializing into XML and really
serialize all that means is it says hey
take this you know Python Django query
set database object which is its own
type and turn it into a valid XML so
name name value and that's really all it
is so you have to kind of know about XML
and Jason and Jason is the JavaScript
object notation it's a JavaScript
equivalent of XML but it's faster it's
more widely used on the web nowadays but
ultimately these are languages so that
different systems different operating
systems different languages across the
country or the world can communicate
with one another using this common
exchange you know this contract and
that's basically what you can view it as
is a contract so each each person knows
how to read the contract because it's in
a certain it's written in a certain way
so that's all jason and XML or so anyway
the Django doc or imports serializers
and then we want to go ahead and just
use from Django HTTP import HTTP
response which is the plain
HTTP response object so similar to any
time you hit a server you're going to
get some sort of HTTP a response object
back instead of the other option when we
actually return like a template and all
that stuff we don't need to actually
return a template so we're just using
the bare-bones HT HTTP response so
here's the latest you have a query setup
we grab them all and then let's go ahead
and write query set equals and we're
going to use our serializers serialize
and then the first argument you pass is
the format you want so i'm gonna do
jason but you could do xml whatever sort
of format you want so here let's do
Jason first and then you need to
actually pass it the query set is the
second argument and then we're going to
return HTTP response the query set and
then you want to actually give it a
content type so to actually send back
the right header to the browser and
let's say application for slash Jason so
we're telling the client that makes this
request hey we're sending you back Jason
that's what this part does right here
so if i went over and i refresh this
here you can see that it is now
returning back this this json data so if
I copied this entire response and I put
it in something like JSON which can
verify my JSON data so here it is right
here and I click validate you can see
that it's a validation so it actually
serialized and did all this stuff for me
and that way my JavaScript client can
then read this very easily using
something like angular or react or
something along those lines now say I
wanted to do XML I could just easily say
XML here and its application Jason just
application XML then if I review the
page here you can see now it's in XML
format so you can see the two
differences there XML has a bit more
overhead than Jason and it's not quite
as easy to work with for a lot of these
these JavaScript clients that exist
nowadays the libraries like react
alright guys so that is the easiest way
to take JSON data from the database and
then turn it into Jason now the idea
behind something like this also is that
single page applications are getting
more and more popular so you could have
essentially just one page served up with
a bunch of different jason endpoints and
just have a bunch of jason data returned
back you had a bunch of different
endpoints you know you could pass in
data and get Jason back so the bottom
line you can do a lot of stuff without
with Jason and this is a simple way to
just go ahead and serialize it yourself
without actually having to worry about
using a full fledge like serialization
library like restful service library
like Django rest framework I'm not
knocking on jet and Django rest
framework I just think that it is quite
a bit to tackle especially for a
newcomer alright guys thanks for
watching and have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
