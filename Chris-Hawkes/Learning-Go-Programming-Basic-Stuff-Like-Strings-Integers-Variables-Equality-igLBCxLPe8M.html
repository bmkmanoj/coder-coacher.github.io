programming tutorial and the last video
what we did we install a light ide which
is a editor built directly for go and we
ran our first go program using the
editor which can build and run making
things a little bit easier we learned
about these import libraries and also
the importance of the main function
which is the starting function for any
sort of program and in this case a go
program so it makes use of this library
to just print out the hello world so in
this case or and there's this video what
I want to do is go ahead and make an
actual variable which is just going to
be a piece of memory that's gonna hold a
string so it'll be like a string like
this is my tutorial or something like
that so and go in order to do that we
need to go ahead and use the variable
keyword so we say variable and you'll
notice that the editor does give us a
little bit of suggestions which is good
so we'll say our for string equals and
then we have to say string I'm sorry
which is going to be a little bit
unusual so we have to say what it is
that it's going to be so it's a string
and then we say equals and then it'll
just be the literal string so this is a
literal sentence which is the same thing
as a string
I should put that all online so now
let's go ahead and output the actual
variable and you'll notice that this
also helps us so we can click on that
and I'm going to say by pressing ctrl s
and then do the build and run command
and what you've seen now is instead of
hello world like a strongly typed string
that never changes we actually said hey
do the same thing but this time print
out the actual variable so that's what a
variable is a variable ago is the
variable name meaning that I can vary so
I can change and things like that now
one of the things that kind of sucks is
that if you saw like when I went ahead
and press ENTER that you're gonna have
an error message here this isn't going
to compile if we try to run it you'll
get an error and the reason why is that
it doesn't know that this needs to be
continued or anything like that so it
needs to actually you need to I'm sorry
end the string by using another double
quote so you have a quote and star the
string and end of the string and then we
want to do the actual plus symbol which
means concatenation and programming and
then we're gonna do one single quote
down here and this will now compile and
work because we're basically saying take
this string will really take this string
and then add it so take this string and
then add this string and if we run the
code this will actually work see see it
works just fine
so you'll notice um you don't want to
have like a huge horizontal line of code
that way it becomes really difficult to
read so you want to keep things in
control and really you should probably
try to indent this which can end in just
fine using your editor if we run it once
again it'll be the same result so you
want to keep things as readable as
possible so I you know I don't want to
have any sort of code that runs off the
right-hand side where I have to scroll
horizontally that just sucks so anyway
that is how you can have a multi-line
string now if I want to have another
string I can do the same thing so I can
say very
this second string and then string
equals this is some other jank and then
what I can do is I can create a new
variable I really I don't even have to
do that I can just simply say our first
string plus this second string and if we
go ahead and run the code you can see
that it automatically concatenated the
two strings together to say this is some
other jank now I probably should add a
space here to make it a little bit more
readable and if I run that you can see
that it now is one big long sentence so
I could even create a new variable what
you say this is the third string string
equals our first string plus this is our
second string and then I would want to
instead of the concatenation down here
I'll just go ahead and output this is
the third string and then build and run
it and you can see that the same exact
output so what you have here is you have
three separate strings are all three
variables and you can add them by using
the plus operator alright so I'm gonna
go ahead and get rid of all this and
then get rid of our our function or a
method
I'm sorry variable that we no longer
need and I want to touch on another
important subject which is integers so
if we wanted to actually print an
integer to the screen we can go ahead
and run the program and you can see that
it'll print the number one and that is
not even a string it's actually an
integer so we can do basic addition so 1
plus 5 and then the result will be 6
and if we want to do multiplication
that's the star symbol so the result is
1 times 5 which is 5 and then if we
wanted to divide 5 divided by 1 the
answer is 5 so that's how you do
division and then let's go ahead and do
subtraction the answer is 4 so you can
see that's just basic addition
multiplication division just like any
other programming language alright so
now that we're jumping right through
this so this is all just standard stuff
so I mean it shouldn't be too difficult
like 5 minus 1 and all that
now just like every other programming
language you deal with true and false
and that's actually a very common thing
it seems like such a minor thing but
it's so important in programming with
ones and zeros I mean if something is
equal to this do this or do that you
know it's true and false is very very
important so to do something like that
with just a basic integer we could just
simply say 5 and then we're gonna say
equals 5 now notice that when we're
doing equality so we're trying to say
because we don't want to assign 5 so
anytime you're doing an equality check
you know is 5 equal to 5 which of course
it is you're going to use two equal
signs so we run this this is going to
result in something called a boolean
which means true and false so you can
see it's outputting true because 5 is
equal to 5 so if I said 5 equal to 4 we
know that that's going to result in
false and that's go figuring out that 5
the integer 5 is not equal to the
integer 4 now another interesting thing
to note which is going to end up
slipping you up is that we can't take an
integer and add it to a string so I
can't say 5 Plus this is a string it's
not going to compile
in a later video we'll end up getting
into how we can actually get that to
compile and get that to work but that
requires a library that we're not going
to be using for this introductory
tutorial the video that we're in right
now now one other thing I want to touch
upon is a floating-point number so if we
go ahead and say 5 divided by 1 we know
that's gonna result in like a huge
number which isn't a I'm sorry 1/5 I'm
sorry it's gonna result in a big number
which it actually gives us 0 and the
reason why is because we basically said
1 is an integer and 5 is an integer
which is a whole number and the division
of 1/5 results in point to zero so it's
actually not a whole number so that is
actually considered a different object
type and go and that is well it's like
that in any language actually but it's
called a floating-point number or a
decimal in certain languages depending
on what you're dealing with but
typically you're gonna get that referred
to as a floating-point meaning the the
dot so in order to get this to equate
the way we want to we want to say 1.0
and then 5.0 so if we do that and we run
this and you're gonna see the actual
right result because it was dealing with
the right values to try to to make that
that calculation so point two now we
could even we can go with something a
little bit more difficult like I'll just
say like that and let's run that and
you'll see the programs are completely
fast and crazy and you see this
humongous number that gets outputted
here so that's the beauty of programming
that's a floating-point number
all right now the final thing is when we
were doing the equation operator I
should have showed you that you can also
do that with a string so if we actually
had a variable string so we'll say
variable X string equals this MOU so and
then what I can do is I can say an X in
print line I'm saying X equal remember
it's two equal signs this mofo so this
should result in true because the string
matches X and you can see that it is
true so that you can do equation
operators on strings and go okay now
another thing too is we also have
greater than or less than which true and
false can do as well so let me just make
sure you guys understand that so 5 is
less than 10 which is true and 5 is
greater than 3 which is true and then 5
is less than 3 which is false so you can
do equations like that now a string
that's actually I don't even know what's
going to happen here but let's see if
variable X string equals test
and then we're gonna say x equals we'll
just say X is greater than test I'm just
trying to break it here so it actually
works so it's false let's see if x
equals test which actually a would equal
test obviously so X is less than test
it's also okay all right anyway I was
just curious to see what the language
would do so they're obviously the same
so they're not greater than or less than
but they're equal to now with an integer
what we can do is we can say 10 is less
than or equal to 10 so we're saying less
than with the less than sign and then
equal so this is this is actually going
to be true because it equals 10 and it
could be the same thing unless 10 is
less than a hundred or equal to a
hundred so this would result in false
I'm sorry it's it's true because less
than equates to true my bad and then
equal it doesn't equal 100 but because
this is true what we can do is actually
say if 10 is less than 100 which it is
and 10 is equal to 100
and it's false because 10 obviously
doesn't equal 100 so if we wanted to do
10 is equal that so this it's kind of
silly we're doing the same equation over
and over again but this double n sign
means that you can do two equations at
the same time so typically what you'd
have is you'd have two different numbers
so you'd say like something like 10 is
less than 20 so instead of saying equal
you would say less than so you can do
two equations to see whether or not it's
true or false and these don't have to be
straight integers they can be you know
variables or strings or whatever so
anyway that's how you can do a multiple
equality or comparison operator in the
same sentence or same execution using go
all right and then the final basic thing
in this programming tutorial series
before we move on we want to go into
comments so I can say this is a mofo
comment on multiple lines and you're
gonna see this comment a lot so in order
to close off the comment so you have
forward slash and then the star and then
you need to have star in there forward
slash and that actually closed off the
comments so this can be as long as you
want because you have those now if you
just wanted a single comment to say this
function does does this blah blah you
would do the forward slash forward slash
you'll notice that it doesn't carry on
to the second second line here so this
is just a single line comment so two
forward slashes for a single line
comment forward slash star for
multi-line comment and that's the same
way with a lot of languages too so let's
get rid of this and you'll notice that
this will compile just fine with my
multi-line comment that's closed off
properly so it doesn't actually do
anything but I could say
goddamnit did this execute and you can
see that it did okay so that's about it
for this tutorial video this is just
some basic string and integer and stuff
like that so I'm gonna get rid of this
and we'll get into some more stuff in
the next video alright guys thanks for
watching and please subscribe have a
good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
