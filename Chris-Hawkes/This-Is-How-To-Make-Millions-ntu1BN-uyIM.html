share this website this coin market cab
you guys are probably seen it before but
when I was talking about Bitcoin and
cryptocurrency the other day like people
were like I was talking about I missed
the boat on this so I understand I
missed the boat in the early sense I
guess on cryptocurrency and Bitcoin and
everything most people will tell you
though especially on that video like I
had all this uh all this response back
saying I haven't missed it and
everything and I think they're right I
was just talking to some guy that I met
the other day where he's like he's big
into the verge is what he's messing with
right now where the hell is that
yeah right here so you can see has up
13% today so he he was big into that and
um I mean this guy he works for the
federal government he works his
excessive phone and phone systems things
like that
and he knows several other people and
this is all kind of word like you know
just from him I'm taking his word for it
or whatever but he did show me like his
balance sheet he said that over an
initial investment of $4,000 and he's
already gained somewhere around 16,000
this year just kind of diversifying the
gains that he's made and then buying
other crypto currencies and everything
but I mean this guy and it seems like
everybody in the world is talking about
how they're gonna be Bitcoin
billionaires how they're gonna make all
kinds of money and people are making a
killing right now other people tell you
it's funny money and it's just people
it's a bubble you know doing doing you
know both bubbles doing what they do you
know like the housing market and
everything else I I don't I don't really
know yet the there was a website that is
this piece of shit right here called
Satoshi dice it looks really ugly but
the guy that bought this I believe it
was 2010 or 2012 probably 2012 actually
I think about the guy that bought it
though like he was one of the first ones
into cryptocurrency and he was I oh this
online gambling website and and he was a
he bought it because it was the first
website that actually used Bitcoin as
its currency and then he was able to
turn around and sell it for 12 and 1/2
million just two years later so he
bought a website for 250 bucks rescanned
it it still looks like shit and then he
sold it and he got
- twelve million dollars so that that's
the kind of like gimmick not really
gimmick I mean this isn't really a
gimmick I'll show you a gimmick in just
a second but this is more along the
lines of somebody that saw the writing
on the wall they jumped in at the right
time and for you know turn or fifty
blocks they were able to make 12 million
and that's pretty amazing once again you
have to be mindful of these
opportunities as they arise and and
sometimes these opportunities only
manifest themselves maybe once or twice
in our entire lifetime so we always have
to be on the lookout for them now with
with Bitcoin I mean that this is most
likely if what most of the high bid if
most of the hype is correct and this is
basically the biggest thing that we
could possibly see in our lifetimes
possibly now it could be as big as like
the Internet basically so that that's
kind of where you know what I think
that's that's kind of what we're looking
at so it is is this cryptocurrency is it
like some new wave of everything that
we're gonna rewrite our systems to take
cryptocurrency and everything and that
it's gonna be the preferred method of
payment and everything I'm not sure if
we'll see that or if governments will
get involved before that ever happens
the guy that created Bitcoin he wrote in
C++ and nobody knows who he is and he's
probably hiding because from what I
understand governments would want to
kill his ass
probably for what he's done because we
know that money runs the world greed and
everything is is just part of human
nature and you know money obviously they
you know say their money is root of all
evil but technically it's probably greed
because money isn't shit by itself it's
all about you know greed and what money
can buy you and even like the u.s.
dollar doesn't really have any sort of
there's no backing behind it anymore
there's no gold standard or anything
anymore so anyway just thought I
mentioned that note as far as a gimmick
website I can't believe this is still
around this is a penny bin you can see
the website doesn't look like it's they
might have shut it down completely
well damn now you can't see it
all right one second all right so we're
gonna go to this cubed which apparently
the the be the one I just showed you
that was actually like the first when I
was in this market and this was a years
and years ago that first saw about this
but this is something where like people
would just come up with all kinds of
crazy schemes and everything and and
what's going on here is you have bidding
that's going on between real users most
likely bots to who knows but if there
shouldn't be BOTS but you can't trust
any of this stuff really but the people
are every time that that price goes up a
penny somebody paid a dollar and they're
hoping to win the product for that price
but if you look at something like this
pots and pans probably at forty maybe a
hundred dollars set the companies
already made two hundred and five
dollars on it because every penny is
costing a dollar somebody paid a dollar
for that one penny that increases the
price so it keeps the price of the
product very low and then stupid people
bid their money away to get prices and
you know they might get lucky every now
and then and win a tablet for fifty
bucks when they've already spent you
know six hundred dollars on previous
stuff so real shitty thing and I really
think it takes advantage of you know
people that aren't very smart you know
that there's don't know any better and I
don't know if that's inappropriate or
not but like gambling is is it so it's
one thing to gamble I guess some people
really like it but when you're playing
like slots and stuff like those have
never excited me because it's just it's
chance I worked with a guy just have at
my previous job who worked on basically
rigging those those systems on an Indian
Reservation in Oklahoma so it the house
is made to win if I were going to be a
gambler I probably do table games but
I'm not a confident enough gambler and
I'm too much of a penny pincher to want
to lose money gambling so I just find it
to be kind of a waste of time but
there's a certain you know there's there
there's certain you know things that
they kind of prey upon you know people
that you may not know any better maybe
they get they probably get satisfaction
out of it but is it good for them
probably not like not if they're you
know gay like if I only had ten dollars
in my pocket man I'm not spending a
dollar on
on a lottery ticket I don't care if it's
worth six hundred million dollars so
that's all I got
then I'm gonna save that dollar I'm
gonna probably use it for gas or
something but anyway so yeah the whole
Bitcoin thing apparently this is going
to be the biggest thing of our
generation so anything that surrounds
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency or any of
that stuff at this point it's probably a
good idea to start getting involved in
that one way shape or form I'm like even
this website right here you can see that
the ads are being played on it this is
the only this the best website seen
that's doing the cryptocurrency market
cap well now Bloomberg is doing the same
thing so Bloomberg we're used to me just
the you know the the Nasdaq and the New
York Stock Exchange and all that stuff
that you know those you know we're
always on Bloomberg CNN things like that
but crypto currencies are now being
added to that mix because there's so
much money being poured into this now so
the opportunity is there in 2012 there
was an opportunity that I got involved
in that was for crowdfunding so the the
JOBS Act of 2012 was a real piece of
shit wasn't it wasn't designed to be a
piece of shit it just didn't it didn't
it didn't turn out to be anything like
what we thought it was gonna be but it
was called the JumpStart our business
startup act and this this Act was passed
back by Obama and it was under I think a
Republican Congress at the time but they
went ahead maybe they went ahead they
had they agreed so I had bipartisan
support meaning that both sides and both
the right and the left they agreed upon
this legislation they passed it but then
the the sec who is responsible for like
or the federal trade yeah Federal Trade
Commission on sec I believe they were
the ones who then dragged their feet on
the whole equity so that the the purpose
behind this is that at the time we were
seeing IndieGoGo Kickstarter and all
these other sites engage just springing
up out of nowhere and people were using
crowdfunding to pay for a successful
project so all kinds of successful
projects have been created on
Kickstarter besides Kickstarter right
now it's IndieGoGo and then just like
any sort of like victim fund and all
that stuff you know GoFundMe is now
a big big part of that but I was I was
thinking about getting involved and just
basically building content related
websites that were talking about
crowdfunding and I figured if I jumped
in in 2012 when this Act was just passed
that we were about to start seeing all
this at like and you know equity
crowdfunding and as far as I know we
haven't seen that so the issue at play
here is like say you had a website like
Kickstarter and you had this great idea
you're gonna be the first one to market
with it but with you know with something
like Kickstarter if you really want it
to be to the market first you want to
get the best developers to make sure
it's working right and all that stuff
you're gonna seek venture capital
funding you may get hundreds of millions
of dollars and in funding and things
like that but you're gonna get that
funding from established venture
capitalists investors people that are
already multimillionaires the IRS knows
about and things like that so they're
allowed to invest their their their
earned money and make even more money
like you look at a Peter Peter Thiel or
yeah Peter Thiel from Facebook he
invested the five hundred thousand in
Facebook when he was first getting
started
dude so you know he's filthy rich
because he's been involved in all kinds
of different startups and things like
that and he has that advantage now and
he had the advantage before because he
was allowed to invest in Facebook but
somebody like me I couldn't take ten
thousand of my own money and invest in
Facebook and get equity for it when they
were just getting started I would have
to be you know the actual venture
capitalist and things like that and and
that that makes things very very unfair
for the average person so it's like why
should we see all these gains go to
these initial investors who know it's a
good idea just like the general public
knows it's a fucking good idea why can't
they build it you know so this whole
2012 act was supposed to be able to to
solve that problem but it never did
because like I said as soon as it got
past the sec like dragged its feet on
allowing the actual the requirements to
be to be lessened and things like that
and it just kind of went nowhere as far
as I'm concerned I lost interest in
doing anything surrounding it there's
probably still maybe something I
wouldn't touch it at this point that was
five years ago already but that's uh
that's just kind of crazy like so I'm
always on the lookout for certain things
that I
be able to capitalize on and yeah and if
you're younger it's a little bit easier
I was gonna go into a little tangent
where it's like well shit once you're
older and you have kids and you're
dealing with marriages and all that
stuff like it becomes so much more
difficult to jump in and get involved in
something like this but a lot of you you
know you newbies and everything like
you're in your 20s you're still single
whatever you might have some opportunity
to hit the ground running I mean create
this first cryptocurrency market that
was monitoring the the funds and the
exchanges and everything like this
website I can guarantee is making Bank
right now I don't know what the traffic
is but I can I can imagine that with the
amount of speculation behind Bitcoin
everything and this being like the
number one result on Google you're
probably looking at millions of views
every month and and then ultimately this
website is probably worth millions of
dollars at this point so yeah absolutely
if I go to Alexa calm according to Alexa
now their numbers are bogus by the way
cuz if I put in my website and the
numbers just aren't accurate at all but
but they're relatively accurate within
like probably like a fifty percent error
rate which is extremely high but like
then like this being a global rank of
$1.99 it could be anywhere between the
top 500 probably hell even the top
thousand websites that's how it and
accurate I think that it Lexus data is
but I'm just trashing everything that I
seems like I did but but it's a friggin
fact I mean with Alexa here but it's
probably the best tool to figure out
approximately how so this website when I
said millions at this point it's
probably worth probably worth hundreds
of millions of dollars and that that's
what I'm talking about so if you would
have seen that shit and been like you
know what let me get be the first when
they get in exchange when you when it's
like one of the first websites that was
doing exchanges for PayPal not PayPal it
was uh it was it for Bitcoin they were
using PayPal to buy Bitcoin and this guy
made a website and one weekend because
the only other way that you could buy
cryptocurrency at the time you could
only buy during the day so during
certain hours like this you know there's
website or whatever business I was
running the website had to be open in
order for it to happen so he created
this
through paypal which is borderline
illegal at the time or at least against
the Terms of Service of PayPal but to be
able to sell that and do it 24/7 you
wrote the website in like one day and
then within a couple months he was
already the leading you know website for
buying and selling cryptocurrency and
there was other ones around at the time
there was really one one you know
clearing away leader at that point but
anyway I'm just kind of like just
another little little tidbit there so
you always got to be on the lookout for
where your opportunities are and try to
find them alright guys thanks for
