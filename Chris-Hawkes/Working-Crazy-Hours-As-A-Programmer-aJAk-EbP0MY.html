video I wanted to talk about working
crazy hours as a programmer so I've read
a lot of different horror stories and it
seems like it's actually more of the
norm unfortunately and it's not
everybody you talked to but I read a lot
on like a hacker news and read it in
other places and and a lot of people
report that I mean they're working
ridiculous hours as a programmer we're
talking you know 12 hour days sometimes
there's like you know stories as much as
16-hour work work days in five days a
week so people putting in 45 hours when
they're on salary for 40 hours a week or
in many places you know requiring that
you're there 60 hours a week and I think
a lot of that also you know plays into
why employers are trying to hire some of
the younger programmers out of college
some of the hungrier ones that don't
have families that don't have you know
these entire lives built up for
themselves yet but unfortunately if
they're working 60 hours a week you
would think that that is going to impede
in their life a little bit and I think
that that really sucks so I would say
from my own personal experience I don't
work 60 hours a week at a company and
you know the companies that I've worked
for it rarely requires that you have to
put in that type of time programmers
more than anything should be valued not
by how long they're actually sitting in
the office or how long you know their
logging hours for your client or
whatever it should be about the job that
they're actually getting done in some
cases programmers they can't get the job
done because there's some sort of
requirement or something that they're
waiting on but you know in an agile
methodology or even you know some of the
more traditional water flow of fall
approaches I mean you can still find
ways I've been able to determine whether
or not your employees or employees are
producing for you so I was actually
curious for any other programmers that
actually watch this video whether or not
you're putting in crazy hours like that
I think it's really interesting because
I sometimes get job offers from startups
and things like that and and to be quite
honest with you
at this stage in my life or at least
where I'm at right now I mean I happen
to be you know dealing with you know
just a lot of stuff day-to-day as a
parent you know as a business owner as a
employee as a student I have a lot of
stuff going on so I'm very comfortable
where I'm at and I love the company that
I work for and some of the job
opportunities that people reach out to
me you know for their first like you
know fledgling startups that are just
getting started that are completely
reliant upon venture capital funding a
lot of these places if I read about them
on like glass door or something like
that you know to that effect people you
know like I've read about certain
companies where it's like you know 50
hours is the norm at this place well you
know to me I find that to be bull crap
because if you're paying a salary you
know salaries should be based on what 40
hours a week right and if it's going to
be more than that there should be some
sort of overtime or something like that
but you can't just justify hey I'm
paying a software engineer a senior
developer you know for C sharp or
JavaScript or whatever i'm going to pay
him ninety thousand dollars a year and
even though that's not even the going
rate you know in washington DC but if
they pay a senior developer ninety
thousand dollars and then expect him to
work 45 or 50 hours a week you know
without any sort of perks or anything
like that I mean that just to me that
that's crazy that so it doesn't make any
sense and that's not even that bad
compared to what I've heard from a lot
of different companies that will ask you
to work 60 or more or that you know lay
off the bottom ten percent of their
workforce every year there's companies
that that I've heard about that do that
like so you know they'll constantly
raise the bar on what somebody needs to
accomplish in order to be able to you
know make ends meet at that company so
my question would be like why would
anybody want to work for a company like
that and I think more people should
probably step up and and you know refuse
to work under those conditions I mean
this isn't you know this isn't a
sweatshop and I've seen you know switch
sweatshops type environments and the IT
world i mean we're typically you know
how highly educated at least many of us
and then we're also you know very very
you know we're typically it
it's a smart field to be in right so
you're surrounded by smart people you
know these people can find work anywhere
doing pretty much anything a lot of stem
graduates don't even do programming
probably because they didn't like it
that much in the first place but they
shouldn't be treated like crap and I
mean working crazy hours night and day
that is just not something that appeals
to me at all one thing that that's been
happening a lot lately is like on this
channel I get all these like spammer
type companies that try to and they're
not all spammer type of companies but
there's companies and they're constantly
reaching out like hey why don't you you
know sign up to our network and all this
stuff and they're going to try to
promote my videos or do something like
that I mean I've read all about them and
for the most part you know they don't
offer any benefits whatsoever they're
just you know and they just try to sign
as many people as possible to try to
earn revenue from that that person's you
know YouTube stream and everything so I
get those all the time but even beyond
that what I'm seeing is like I've gotten
I've had companies reach out to me for
going like video tutorials on companies
like Linda calm and packt publishing
just recently Manning which you know
I've read a lot of different Manning
books and I've always found them to be
pretty reliable when it comes to
computer books and everything so in a
way I'm flattered that they would even
reach out to me and asked me to do a
video series for their platform but then
the thought crosses my mind that I do
this channel for fun and you know I
didn't think it would be as big as it as
it's got and it's not like I'm some
big-time you know person or anything I'm
not even trying to say that at all I'm
simply saying I'm proud of the fact that
I've almost gotten 20,000 subscribers
and I've had over a million views so to
me that is that's exceptional and I
really can't believe that that's
happened but that said when a company
like Manning reaches out to me and even
though you know I respect them as a
company everything and they want me to
do videos for them all of a sudden it
becomes work and it's not fun anymore
and I just don't want to do it even if I
could make money doing it and make more
money like I'm not even doing this for
the money I do just fine
with my setup like I'm not rich I'm not
even like wealthy I'm not even middle
class I wouldn't say but you know but
I'm happy doing what I'm doing I'm happy
with the fact that I don't have a
company that's forcing me to work 60
hours a week in order to make to make
ends meet her to justify my high salary
and if companies are truly out there
treating their employees like that I
think more people should stand up and
just you know say that they're not
willing to do it I mean I don't know
that's basically you know my thoughts on
the matter that I i I'm not looking for
additional work when I come home every
night I do these tutorials and I talk to
you guys because I enjoy doing it I like
reaching out to you guys the tutorials I
think are great because i'm learning and
in many cases as I'm you know teaching
and running through these tutorials and
I don't even get to do it as much as I'd
like to but the fact of the matter is
though as i'm doing it out of my own
free will and as soon as i get paid to
do it like all of a sudden you have all
this additional stress put on you you
have expectations that you have to meet
there's probably contracts and all this
other stuff and I just I'm just not
interested and I'm just not interested
in working for a start-up at this phase
in my life with you know young children
that I'm trying to to bring up and to be
there for I don't want to commute hours
of up north and everything so I don't
know I guess basically there i'm trying
to say that there are companies out
there that treat their employees
exceptionally well and the companies
that aren't i hope they learn a lesson
as soon as possible if you're trying to
justify 60-hour workweeks by putting in
like free snacks and all this other you
know garbage that's not going to cut it
how about family benefits like you know
health care retirement profit sharing
vacation and I'm not you know sick leave
like maybe even sick leave for your
children we know when they're sick
because a lot of people use that as
their own sick time and everything so I
understand that not all the smaller
company
can offer those types of benefits but
yeah I don't know I mean it just as soon
as I try to sign on to some tutorial for
some major publication like that I can
just tell it's just going to be work
that I'm not you know looking to do and
I think that everybody in this industry
you have to make sure you don't get
burned out and if you're working 60
hours a week constantly coding and
you're just getting thrown endless work
after endless work it's not going to be
good in the long term I mean I can't
imagine that ever being good for anybody
in the long term so we as an industry
shouldn't have to justify our salaries
by working such crazy amounts of hours
and you know so I guess you know if the
best and the brightest end up you know
so coming to that and ended up end up
you know giving in then it's going to
end up creating a problem I think for
the entire industry if it's not already
and it's probably not all companies that
do this but that's just my opinion on
the matter that I think it's probably
not a good trend and I think that any
company that expects you to work 60
hours a week is part of your salary
that's not yours that's not a salary
especially if you also have to factor
and commute and all that other stuff so
there are good companies out there and
there are bad companies and I would just
be very very cautious of the ones that
you try to sign on to and and who you
commit to alright guys thanks for
watching have a good night and by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
