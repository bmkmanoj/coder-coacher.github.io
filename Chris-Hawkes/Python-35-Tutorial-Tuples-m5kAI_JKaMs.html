the last video we talked about lifts and
why they're important and hopefully I
gave you guys some sort of good examples
of why you're going to be using lists a
lot whenever you're programming in
Python and we're going to go into
something and just kind of gloss over it
something you're not going to use as
much but you will see in the Python
language and the reason why it is
because they're faster but they're not
as flexible and that is something called
a tuple this is another value type we've
been talking about types a ton we're not
going to the index we're going to simply
say print the value type and you're
going to notice the only thing different
between what we have before and what we
have now is that these little brackets
and now you're going to see it gives the
name of this stupid word called the
tuple and I've always hated the name
tuple it's kind of growing on me I guess
after like four years of saying it but I
hated it for the longest time so I'm
wondering if you guys hate it to leave a
comment if you do if you're just getting
started in Python but anyway two tuples
are not very flexible in that once you
create a tuple they can't be they can't
be modified one of the things that we
haven't done yet is on is modify our
lists the lists are very flexible in
that you know we can add stuff to list
we can take stuff away from a list we
can change the values of individual
elements in that list and the list will
remain intact and the programming world
that's called we're saying that
something is mutable meaning that it can
be changed it can be modified if
something cannot be modified after its
created by the program that's called a
mutable and tuples are immutable and the
reason why they're faster is because
python doesn't have to dedicate memory
towards maintaining the current status
of a particular element inside of a
tuple because it can't ever be changed
so we can just pretty much say you know
this tuple when
what it is it's always going to be that
and we never have to do any additional
work to see whether or not it's changed
or done or you know has modified in any
sort of way because it never can once
it's created that's it the reason why I
do introduce it even though you're not
going to use it as much is because
you're going to see that like in Django
like if you start doing web development
in Python you're going to see Django
uses a lot of their list type structures
and they do them as tuples because if
they're not going to change that is the
right thing to do it you know any little
bit of memory that you can free up goes
a long way when you have millions of
concurrent users on a website like a you
know Django web framework or something
like that so it's the reason why we talk
about tuples here I'm just going to kind
of gloss over them for right now they're
just like list except just remember that
they cannot be changed once they've been
created</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
