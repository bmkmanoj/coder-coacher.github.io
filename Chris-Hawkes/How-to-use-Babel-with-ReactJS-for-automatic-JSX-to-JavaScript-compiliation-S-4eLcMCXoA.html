this video and what I want to do is take
a moment to show you how to set up an
automatic compiling process to turn your
JSX code to plain JavaScript so that you
don't have to do it manually and what we
use is a tool that's a JavaScript
compiler called Babel which uses the
latest standards in xmas crypt 6.0 which
is the new javascript standard among
other things and it has built-in JSX
support we'll take your JSX code and
automatically compile it to broken-down
JavaScript it just makes things a lot
simpler but what you need to do is you
have to actually put a watch either on a
directory or an individual file in this
video I'm going to show you how to do it
on an individual file instead of
watching the entire directory and I'm
using Windows but the process is going
to be similar on a Mac or on any sort of
Linux operating system you need to be
able to pull up your command prompt and
we're gonna be using NPM now if you
don't have MPM installed that is part of
the note process and it's pretty common
so you'll definitely want to get NPM
installed if you don't have it already
but just look for an NPM windows
installer or you can just install nodejs
which wouldn't have NPM built into it
alright so now the way of their command
prompt open what I want to do is
actually CD into the directory where I'm
gonna have my file being watched
so my project is located under this
folder and I have my JavaScript folder
inside the static so I'm gonna go into
that and you're gonna see that I have
this wizard JSX file which is actually
open in my sublime editor right here so
this is all JSX code so they can't
actually be used by the browser needs to
be broken down into plain JavaScript and
what we're gonna do is setup able to
watch this file which is located in this
directory right here and output a wizard
ans file every time this JSX file
changes so first things first let's go
ahead and install babel globally i
already have it installed but in order
to do that on your machine after you
have npm install you're gonna say npm
install then - g4 global and then we're
going to say babel
and it's gonna take a few minutes for
no.2 to install everything so you should
get a successful message here it might
take a little bit longer since I already
had this installed it'll probably take a
little bit longer for you all right so
after we've done that now let's go ahead
and we're gonna do a watch go ahead and
type babel first just to make sure that
it is installed so you can see that
babel is a keyboard that's being
recognized by Windows and if I went and
I said Babel and then - - help you can
see all the different commands that
babel allows now babel is a I wouldn't
say complicated but there's a lot to it
though we're not going to be talking
about in this video so we're just simply
using it for a transpiler service so
let's go ahead and say Babel I have a
knife and watch and then we're gonna
give it the name of the file so if you
remember it's wizard JSX and then we
want it in the output file so it's gonna
say out and I think it's um so - I fan
out and then - file I believe that's
right and then we're gonna give it the
name of the file that needs to spit out
so we're gonna say wizard J essence we
wanted to be playing JavaScript and if I
press ENTER it's just gonna hang there
for a bit now you'll notice in the
directory we don't have actually
automatically create a wizard J's file
for us so let's go ahead and just delete
that and you can see it automatically
created it again so let's go ahead and
so we're not going to delete it but
let's go ahead and open it we can see
that what it did is it took out I'm
sorry and took that JSX code and broke
it down and minimized it for us
automatically which is pretty cool
because it was it was a huge file and
you can see it's much smaller now since
it's all minimized and everything so
let's go ahead and make a change to that
file real quick and I'll just simply say
I'll put it to do in here and a comment
so if I click Save you're gonna see that
it's kind of annoying but in your
command prompt it's constantly saying
change wizard IJ SEC so you just have to
kind of minimize this and
worry about that but it is working
behind the scenes the way it's supposed
to so let's go ahead and open up the
directory and look for that command that
we just added here so let's go ahead and
say so we're gonna look for to do and
then you can see to do this is I'm sorry
I'm on the wrong screen so you can see
to do this is our example so you can see
that by us making a change this it
automatically created this wizard jas
file so it's already broken down
minimized javascript code so makes it a
lot easier to deal with and similar to
how I did the watch statement you can
actually do in actual directory so you
can watch the entire directory if you
want and to do that if I want to
terminate this I can say ctrl C and say
yes so if you wanted to do the output
directory you would actually just say
here
I think it's output directory output
file
oh that's out directory see so you would
just simply say outdoor and instead of
obviously I'm giving it a location of a
file which isn't gonna work it needs to
be a location of a folder instead of a
file but once again I'm not actually
doing that for this particular example I
just wanted to watch the one particular
file that I'm working on alright guys so
that's how you use babel with react for
JSX compilation alright guys thanks for
watching please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
