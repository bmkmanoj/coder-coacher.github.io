just want to you know and you could
probably skip over it but just for my
own understanding and hopefully for
maybe if anybody else finds this helpful
I'm gonna continue along with the pong
tutorial just to add like the ball and
all that crap so we can actually use
some of the graphics capabilities of
keavy and it clearly spells out the
tutorial already on the website so I'm
not sure how helpful it'll be but I
think it'll be helpful for me ultimately
when I try to build more apps we keep
you to be able to get an understanding
of what of what what they're doing here
with some of the graphics because to be
honest with you I wasn't even really
intending on using like graphics
capabilities of this mobile development
I just feel like it's kind of out of my
league but you know they make it easy
then you know maybe I could change my
mind on that sort of thing but anyway
let's go ahead and add the class and
we're gonna just copy all this stuff
from there tutorial so if we're adding a
class for the pong ball we're gonna put
it down here underneath our test widget
and then and then we just need to go
ahead and add the pong ball using the kV
language so we go back over to our test
kV file and outside of the test widget
we then described the pong ball let's
move back over to test app and you see
that we have some obviously we have the
velocity for x mean horizontal and then
Y for vertical numeric property method
that it's not doesn't look defined or
anything I guess maybe that's something
built in I'm not sure oh yeah you know
what look we have to import for that
numeric property method here to work we
need to go out and import that feature
from Kavita properties important America
property and the reference list property
we also need to import from Kitty dot
vector import vector vector is like a
mathematical interpretation of drawings
I guess from what I understand like
lines and stuff instead of using pixels
like vector art whatever I don't
to look it up it's it's more complicated
than just pixel art I guess all right so
um anyway we have this reference list
property which we just inherited and
it's sending in velocity X Loxy Y two
different variables that are defined
that equal a method with an argument of
0 now we need to add what we actually
already have that define move self self
top position and this is some math I'm
not sure what the hell that is plus self
deposition so it's doing some math for
the vertical position of the ball all
right all right so inside of our test
widget keep in mind I change the name of
my my class from actual pong game to
test widget so anyway that's great and
um copies the latest because there's
some improvements to our my canvas game
we actually just need to add the ball to
our actual test widget here
how I hear this palm bow all right let's
run this here I just want to see if this
thing will actually run if there's any
obvious errors so far it works there's
the ball that's pretty cool all right
let's keep moving on all right so now in
order for the ball to be able to move we
need to go to our test app that class
inside the build method we're gonna
before we actually return the game we
need to just so we're not making this
any more confusing than it needs to be I
want to change the name of this class to
actually what it's being called in the
tutorial so that I'm not confusing you
guys and I'm not confusing myself so
that returns pong game should change
that we need to go ahead and change in
our KB file this should say pong game
make sure that still runs
okay so that's the worst that way we're
on the same page now so inside of our
pong game we need to go ahead instead of
just passing we're gonna create a method
called defined update and then we need
to go ahead and pass in itself as the
first argument as well as DT not really
sure what that's gonna be
and then we're just gonna simply pass
okay and then inside our pong app which
is called test app because it wasn't
initially going to be a poem tutorial
but we call it test app we have our
build method and we're gonna say game
equals pong game kind of like what we're
doing here whenever we were just
returning it and then we need to go
ahead and say we're gonna add a method
called clock schedule which we might
have to do an import for this to work
but we'll see here in a moment but what
this does here in the tutorial is clock
scheduled intervals so it's doing 60
times a second I think I only say
yeah so it's 60 times per second so you
can increase that if you wanted it to be
even faster okay and then we returned
our game object before we were just
returning the actual name of our pong
method but we've done a little bit more
we got the pong game here and so instead
of just returning pong game we
instantiated game being equal to pong
game and then added some stuff to it I'm
using the game dot update not really
sure why that's necessary but anyway
we've returned the game object let's go
and run this real quick see if we have
anything going on
all right clock is not defined that's
actually what I was concerned about I
knew we were going to import some and
what we do to fix that is we're gonna
say from TV clock import goddammit
import clock so now we'll be able to use
that and let's go and run and just make
sure it's working all right cool so the
app still alright senesce for the pong
game class we need the box the ball to
be able to move so all this stuff is
gonna be replaced with this so we're
building a ball object passing an object
proper and object property method none
not sure if we're going to import
something there yeah we're gonna have to
import from Kiwi that properties imports
object property okay so we'll import
that and then we pass in no which is
kind of weird I'm not a hundred percent
sure what we're doing that yet and then
when we update self DT so football that
move bounced off top and bottom so if
it's less than zero so if all the way to
top you have zero a vertical position so
if it's less than zero it will start
start going back down which is what this
math does here and then obviously from
vertical it starts here so
well maybe I'm not really sure hmm I
will have to play with that I'm not a
hundred percent sure about that all
right so since in our waging here we
defined a ball which is um like a child
of this main widget we need to add it to
our KB file so under the pound game
let's go ahead and just just put it
right here why does it do that
I don't understand why it does that
that's my editor doing that but anyway
all right and then under the pong ball
we need to go ahead and add the ID and
such that and this should not be
indented all right so we added that to
our KB file all right let's go and run
the application again make sure we don't
have any problems up till now
which we mate might have something going
on oh I see what I did wrong okay let me
close this out in my kevie file added
this palm ball ID right here which
thought caused um total confusion I need
to actually add the pong ball to my game
so I should go here okay I don't need
this Center again I mean get rid of that
so I think this should work so we're
adding idea of palm ball which is here
to this so we're linking this to this by
this so let's try it
alright so we got it going again
all right good let's go back to our main
app file here so we need to add another
method now to the pong game class
because the ball needs to start moving
when the game has started so that's what
this method does serve ball and I'm just
gonna do a random I guess our velocity
of whether or not it goes to the left or
to the right and now in order for that
method to be called when the game is
started we actually need to go down to
where our game object is defined down
here in our test app and before the
clock interval thing let's just go ahead
and say game got served ball so it's
calling itself all right all right so
let's go ahead and run the application
again sombitch all right one second we
got a import random int
um random I don't even know where random
ink comes from or from random and poor
rand okay there
I just guessed on that I had no idea I
know that I've used it before I just
didn't I don't remember the library was
under all right its I got I kill this
thing all right sorry started awesome
that's pretty badass right there alright
so we need to build our paddles and all
that stuff so it's continuing along with
the demo all right so first things first
we're gonna go ahead and grab the entire
poem class or the poem paddle class from
just from the demo I'm going to just
paste that above our pong game class
we're also going to add an on touch move
method to our pong game class there's
our pong game class so go ahead and
paste that right here
and just like we did with the pong ball
we need to go ahead and go back to our
kv file and underneath the ball let's go
ahead and paste our pong paddle and then
also just like we did before we need to
add that now to we're add two of them
actually and we're gonna add those to
the hierarchy of our main root widget
which is pong game so under here under
palm ball it's been pasted that joint
and once you get my editor's all messed
up but all right so now we added two
pong paddles one player right one player
left and should be pretty good there
we're changing their initial positions
and I'm just sure it about finish
everything up so it's gonna run this
real quick
it's pretty cool
so we had our paddles but I completely
forgot the ability to be able to update
like actually being able to move the
paddle so we need to add a few things to
our update method here so under the ball
dot move let's add the player 1 player 2
is or bounces balls off the paddle also
in the update method we need to keep
track of when the ball goes past one of
the paddles on either side so let's see
here so we run a replace this bounce off
the left and right so there it can
actually go past and will keep track of
the score alright also in the pong game
we need to add the object properties for
both player 1 and player 2 underneath
the ball we need to add some more to the
bounce ball so we're gonna move
everything out of the bounce ball method
and just replace it with this we're also
gonna sub out the serve ball method
under the pong game class and it's
passing in the velocity has the argument
I'm setting the ball velocity as that
all right so we also need to go to our
KB file here and we're gonna add two
more labels for actual scores
so we have traditionally labels player
one scorer player to score and under
pong game we finally have to add our
player left and our player right and
we're gonna put that underneath our ball
object here once again pay no attention
to my editor being stupid okay alright
so now when we run it we should be able
to actually be able to move the paddles
and watch the ball so I can actually
move this paddle over that's pretty
awesome be like that like that like that
oh damn look at that now we do have a
bug here going on we have our zero that
doesn't seem to be disappearing because
you can see this guy's got one point now
he's got two but got a glitch so I gotta
figure out what's going on with that and
you can see the one zero still there but
anyway the game is working that's pretty
awesome and if we go over to our test
queue file we can clearly see where our
bug lies is because of this text zero
that obviously never changes we don't
even need this label anymore this was
just a an example when I'm first
starting to have zero zero on either
side and now we've replaced that with
these two labels that are dynamic and
changed as opposed changed when the
score of the game changes so let's run
this joint one more time now we should
have a proper working pound tutorial I
don't see one
I'm gonna get this guy get him a point
here bounced off the side get a point
boom oh whoa look at that
oh yeah look at that oh there's the
funnest game ever
 alright alright we're almost done
with this tutorial series or not serious
but video all right and the final thing
for this pong tutorial as far as the
game development itself it's obviously
I'm pretty limited and what it does but
it's also highly it's doing a lot of
crap for you and with all the graphics
and everything but I was good and add
one more thing so we'll say like if self
dot player 2 dot score equals 5 and we
can just go ahead and stop our apps will
say pretty much what we do down here
test app dot run we could say test app
stop so I'll do that here
and I'll copy this code here
instead of being equal we'll just say
greater than or equal
and change this to player one alright
let's go and run this one more time
so I'm gonna quickly try to build up to
five points here second third fourth
and it towards the fifth point it
doesn't update it that sucks but anyway
the application has stopped so that's
how we actually start and stop the
application which is pretty good all
right guys so we're gonna finish this
I'm gonna close off this tutorial video
and essentially we got the pong pong
tutorial working in less than 20 minutes
alright guys thanks for watching and
please subscribe have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
