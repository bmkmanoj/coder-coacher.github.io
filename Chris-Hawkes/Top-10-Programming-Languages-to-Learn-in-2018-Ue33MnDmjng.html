is for 2018 and yes I can see the future
but in in all seriousness I do put a lot
of effort into this list and trying to
figure out like what recommendations I
would make for the best language just to
learn for the future and and granted you
know we're three-quarters of the way
through the year it's not it's not
entirely over but things don't change
that quickly not some language isn't
going to spring up in the next four
months and oh yeah that's the new
and everybody's going to learn it it
doesn't work that way so it languages
that we're using day in and day out
they've been written decades ago most of
them have been written before you were
born probably so things do not change
that quickly but you know year year
things I think change enough for me to
be able to do a new video on the top
languages that I think you should learn
in 2018 and just a brief background I'm
a programmer have been doing this for
about eight years or so and I work
professionally in the industry obviously
I have a channel now we're close to
hundred thousand subscribers at this
point alright so getting started let's
go ahead and jump right into this
because I don't want to take too much of
your time
number ten on this list is typescript so
this brings static type checking to
JavaScript which is something that
javascript severely lacks now that can
also be considered as strength depending
on who you ask
or it can be considered the biggest
weakness and the biggest problem with
with JavaScript so typescript aims to
solve that issue by being a its own
programming language that compiles down
to two javascript is actually a pre
process a preprocessor for the
JavaScript language so you write in a
typescript static type checking safe
specific way and it will then you can
compile it to just regular raw
JavaScript that runs inside of a browser
but typescript is considered a
programming language the fact that it's
rivaling the the latest standards of
JavaScript and whether or not you should
choose to use something like babel or go
with something like typescript
you could write modern JavaScript be
with babel to compile it to older
versions if you need it if you need to
support older browsers or you can use
typescript so it's really two different
things if you want static type checking
with JavaScript you're going to use
something like slow
so otherwise you can use tight script
those are the two the two choices Aaron
for that reason typescript definitely
makes the top ten this year number nine
is Russ man this is an awesome this is
an awesome systems-level language that's
written by the mozilla developers this
is a relatively new language few years
old not widely used in the industry yet
but it's created by the guys that
originally wrote in firefox web-browser
they create a lot of the standards on
the web and they've been working at that
for decades now so the mozilla guys
definitely know what they're doing and
rust has a lot of potential to be a very
powerful language in the future
especially as it gets more and more
widely adopted number eight is java this
is one of the most widely used languages
on this list but i have it as number 8
because unless you want to be a java
developer like for me there's not a ton
of reasons to want to learn java to
learn it in 2018 but that said there are
plenty of java jobs out there there's
android development they use this java
and and it seems like the industry's
cooling down a little bit with java
dominating the jobs market we've seen a
lot of jobs start moving to different
stacks and things especially web servers
and things of that nature they don't all
need to be written in Java any more we
don't need you know we don't need a
fully object nor any language to do
everything that we need to do but that
said Java is still a very widely used
language especially in corporate
corporate United States or abroad as
well there there's definitely a lot of
opportunity in Java but it's not in my
opinion it's not my favorite language
that's for sure it was originally
developed by Sun Microsystems Sun
Microsystems was bought by Oracle so
network will actually controls
Java's destiny number seven is C++ so
there is no question that most games are
written in C++ most gaming engines
whether it's Unreal Engine or even some
of the physics engines that we're using
out there like the bullet physics engine
and things like that that's going to be
all written in C and C++ so this is a
language that
does not hold your hand this is a
difficult language to code in but it is
also very powerful it's like driving a
Corvette without brakes basically it
there is no do garbage collection you
have to do memory management you know
dealing with pointers and things like
that so not something that is very easy
or geared towards beginner developers
but if you can master C you can
certainly master any any programming
language on this list number six is
Swift so this is Apple's new language
it's replacing Objective C which was you
know apple's solution for really all of
Mike Rosario apples it was Apple
solutions all of their their their
software so if you're going to be an
apple developer you want to work for
Apple one day then Swift is definitely
the direction you want to go in you can
write iOS apps and everything within
with using Swift it's also a much easier
language to work with an objective-c
it's not necessarily going to completely
replace objective-c but for a lot of
basic programming tasks it's definitely
the go-to language in the Apple
ecosystem at this point number five is
PHP and this is actually high up on the
list a lot of people hate PHP because a
lot of beginners write in PHP and they
have security flaws with their code and
they don't really understand what
they're doing but they're still like a
majority of websites out there are
written on a PHP staff so that means
most websites that you visit you know
ROS websites in existence the majority
of them are using PHP over any other
language out there PHP has laravel code
ignitor things like that WordPress which
is very popular blog it's also written
using PHP there's a lot of jobs in PHP
and it may not be the most fantastic
type safe language to deal with it's a
scripting language so it's a big piece
of in certain areas and it's very
very helpful and beneficial and others
so definitely not a bad choice
especially if your market your your
geographic area has a lot of PHP
opportunities it's definitely a language
you should learn in 2018 number four
c-sharp c-sharp is still very popular
it's Microsoft's flagship language and
some language
I created a lot of people said they copy
off a Java back in the day but there's
quite a few differences now between
c-sharp and Java but they are both fully
object-oriented languages that are owned
by essentially large corporations and
used by you know fortune 500 companies
around the world so a lot of opportunity
just like with Java there's give me a
lot of opportunity with c-sharp the
reason why C sharp to me ranks a little
bit higher than Java is just because of
the things that Microsoft is doing
they've come out with some fantastic
products lately like Visual Studio code
they've they bought xamarin so you can
start doing mobile apps for writing
c-sharp things like that they've done a
lot of work with the Unity game engine
so you can write unity games with
c-sharp and the open source nature of
dotnet core has really you know it's
create it's created the ability to have
a c-sharp server on a Linux on a Linux
server so our c-sharp running on a linux
server in fact my buddy actually has a
c-sharp a c-sharp application on a
lenovo ssin droplet and i think he's
using ubuntu and he's using MongoDB with
dotnet course so that's something that
was not possible a few years ago but
with C sharps new direction or
Microsoft's new direction for C shots
are making it open source and
cross-platform and for that reason I
have C sharp ranked a lot higher than
Java
number 3 is Python is the most hot
language in IT schools and not just
 like beginner level courses and
things like that
I'm talking MIT Carnegie Mellon things
like that some major universities
Stanford and Python is being talked
because it's free it's open source and
you can get up and running with Python
very fast it's object oriented but at
the same time it can also be written and
just you know procedural procedural type
and it's it's got some some pretty
decent power it was actually Google's
first choice for their search engine so
for the longest time back in the 90s
early 2000s and even now Google has made
heavy use of Python and on top of that
if idiots use for web sites like
Instagram YouTube reddit Pinterest of
of other websites including my own
website hipster code so Python is
definitely a good language to learn it's
very widely
you know diverse the jobs exist all over
the place a lot of jobs in data science
data science so machine learning things
like that they're all using Python
number two is JavaScript this is the
only language that runs in the browser
so javascript is not going anywhere we
see many different stacks being written
now and node and between you know with
node combined with angular or react or
view you know the three I would say most
popular JavaScript client-side solutions
for you know really handling the entire
framework javascript is it's got a lot
of promise here I mean there's a lot of
promise with the language itself they've
made a lot of additions the es6 has
brought us things like lexical scoping
we have constants with the arrow
functions which binds our this context
just the decent amount of changes to the
JavaScript language the sense that runs
in a browser sometimes it's difficult
getting browsers to behave similarly but
for those reasons we have things like
jQuery and and Babel and things like
that that will handle those differences
for us so javascript you cannot go wrong
web development runs all the business
really at this point and in most
products are being written as you know
software as a service platform type of
thing and for that reason things have to
run at the browser and the only language
that runs the browser is javascript so
number one on this list is go man
this is made by the Google guys in fact
ken Thompson who actually helped Dennis
Ritchie develop see or at least worked
with Dennis Ritchie while he was
developing C at Bell Labs in the 1970s
he actually had part of this language
along with Rob Pike and a few other
geniuses over it at Google and golang
has a lot of potential man it is one of
the fastest growing languages out there
right now it's a systems level
language is built with concurrency in
mind and I say that with emphasis
because a lot of a lot of computers
these days have multicores our
processors aren't getting faster we're
just getting more cores so that means we
need parallelism and we need concurrency
and a lot of languages were developed
way before we had these multi-core
processors like that that was never even
a consideration when python was first
created or even c-sharp was first
created or anything and go like they
knew they saw the writing on the wall
the Google people they realized they
needed a verbose you know basic language
that can be very very powerful and B and
make it very easy for developers to
write concurrent applications so the
things you could run on multiple
different threads and things like that
and multiple different cores and if your
program is designed well enough and go
helps you do that as well as rust rust
also does a very good job at that then
your programs are just going to be much
more powerful written and go one of the
downsides to it is it's still relatively
new it's not going to hold your hands or
not there's not going to be as much
documentation or even as much of a
community as something like Python
there's not a huge you know there's not
a huge beginner environment and when
there's not a lot of beginners in a
language then that can sometimes be very
very difficult for newer developers to
get involved in just because you're
going to make new mistakes when you're
getting started with a new language and
you know the more people in the industry
the more people use in that language the
more likelihood people are gonna have
the same questions as you and there's
going to be newbies just like you and
things like that so it's not a good go
doesn't have noobs but there's going to
be some pretty hardcore systems level
programmers that know a lot about C++
and C and things like that and
understand go and the benefits that it
has and and and for from what I've seen
sometimes you know there's not that same
level of support let me help this you
know this newbie out and make sure you
understand the concepts and all this
stuff but all right guys and that's my
top 10 language let me know what you
think and have a good day bye hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in the Suevi course it's geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery nodejs react
angular how to use github so a lot of
the things that you're going to need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding bootcamp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
