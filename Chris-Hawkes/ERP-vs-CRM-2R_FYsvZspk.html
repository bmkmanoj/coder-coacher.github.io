won't find this video boring it's a
little bit more I would say boring
probably compared to a lot of the stuff
I talked talked about but we're looking
at the future of enterprise software and
I just wanted to get you guys his
opinion a lot of you guys are just now
getting into the market or maybe some of
you have already been in the market some
of you guys are in college so I just
wanted to kind of get your understanding
of where we are with like enterprise
level software at the moment so first
let's talk about back in the olden days
when computers just came around right
back in the really 70s and 80s a lot of
companies didn't even have computer
systems at that time or they were just
starting to get computer systems and
everything was like in-house the
mainframe you know humongous computers
that get brought in and I mean typically
they're working on terminals and things
and this was all before my time so I can
only imagine what it would have been
like but basically I'm assuming they're
like UNIX type systems where they're
just entering data into the command line
and you're interacting directly with the
mainframe through specific and you have
to be a hundred percent specific on how
to use it you know to get you know
certain data back and at that point it
was revolutionary because before I'm
assuming all the data was being stored
away in file cabinets and things of that
nature so there was really no any you
know quick access to real-time data
right so I you know in the 60s 70s
computer system started coming on board
and businesses started changing the way
that they did business because all of a
sudden they got real-time instant access
to all the system to all the systems and
all the data the data that they had
assuming that you know the the mainframe
system had the capability of delivering
the results that they needed and I'm
sure it was it was highly customized and
you know very specific about what it
could do but once again I'm kind of
speculating I'm not like some sort of
expert in this field or anything like
that so this videos about what is the
future of enterprise software so if we
fast-forward to the 1990s there's a
company called the Gartner group and
they kind of coined this term enterprise
resource planning which is it's
abbreviated as ERP
and in Europe he was basically systems
programs that were highly customized to
the company to be able to offer
real-time information and things like
Human Resources inventory management so
obviously there's a lot of different
benefits for having a computer system
trying to regulate your real-time data
number one the computer system if it's
coded the right way is not going to make
mistakes that human humans normally make
when they're dealing with files and like
real data and stuff being shuffled
around on their desks and you know I'll
call you later memos and stuff like that
so this became a multi-billion dollar
industry all through the nineties and
into the early 2000s now when we look at
enterprise software we're seeing that
ERP is now being replaced with companies
like salesforce.com but what these
companies are providing is no longer
called ERP it's something called
customer relationship management
what CRM does is it handles the
interaction with a customer and it's
supposed to make that better for any
sort of business that is providing the
CRM tool it's going to make the you know
the company that buys their product
operate more efficiently be able to stay
in contact with their customers much
more efficiently whether it's through
the use of social media or just you know
internet or video or YouTube whatever it
may be which is still somewhat social
media it handles that better so the
companies that I just mentioned like one
of the major ones is salesforce.com and
a lot of people they're like well what
the hell does Salesforce do it seems
like we hear about Salesforce so much at
least I do in the DC area and I still
didn't really understand you know what
it is that Salesforce does I mean it's
it's weird but I mean you know as I
mentioned before the ERP was a billion
dollar industry in the 90s and the early
2000s and it has given away to this new
CRM which is the abbreviation and it's a
company like Salesforce is considered a
crm company now back in the old days of
the ERP you would have to pay some sort
of an expensive you know IT company
that's going to bring in hundreds of
contractors and things like that they're
going to bring in those contractors and
they're gonna set up shop probably for a
year or two years they're gonna start
analyzing business requirements and
going through all these you know UML
diagrams of how the system is going to
run and all this stuff and they
completely customized it to the
companies you know capabilities that
they're liking or whatever it is that
the company is trying to do so you end
up getting this you know really awesome
system but it's firmly embedded in what
you do and completely unique to your to
your business model which is really good
but ultimately it cost a fortune we fast
forward to today and you can see
Salesforce which was founded in 1999 is
now pulling in revenue of over five
billion dollars so you can see that
their profits are still down but these
guys you know they're in the market
right now to grow and not really flex
their muscle as far as being able to
generate net income so guys really what
this brings up is what exactly does
Salesforce do well apparently if you buy
their product which I'm not a paying
customer but they they turn today they
turn around your ability to interact
with your customer in order to increase
sales and theirs well if we just look at
what they have right so they they
basically say that it's completely
customer focused to give you a complete
turnaround time for all your information
you don't have any hardware or no
software which means that this thing
exists in the cloud so instead of the
old system where you know all those
contractors had to come in and you had
to pay them hundreds of hours or
thousands of hours to develop a very
embedded complicated system completely
customizable to your business Salesforce
has been the first company to
revolutionize it and do it in the cloud
and basically say hey you don't need to
pay us to come into your business or
learn all of this stuff all you need to
do is pay for our cloud service which is
software as a service and you pay us a
monthly fee we give you access to our
systems and we secure your data for you
and we'll need you to understand you
know how our application works and how
you can use it to the best of your
ability so essentially what Salesforce
is saying is that you have to learn
their system so it's saying and without
having to completely create custom
systems instead you just buy a book and
learn how Salesforce works
hook up to their cloud service and then
start integrating with their their
platform the reason why a company like
Salesforce is so successful though is
that they were the first ones to be able
actually get a platform and that works
with a lot of customizability because
one of the things that would be
concerning is that you know the old way
of doing it everything is completely
customized to the business but with
Salesforce like how can you get a
platform that just kind of caters to any
sort of business that doesn't seem to
make any sense but what Salesforce is
able to pride themselves on is that if
you if you learn how to use it maybe you
go out and buy a book or something like
that they the the power is in your hands
so essentially it's like learning a
language like if you just skim the
surface learn a few words you might be
able to order some food online or you
know or through a drive-thru or
something like that but that's about
gonna be the extent of what you're gonna
get out of it however if you do spend a
lot of time learning how to integrate
this you know firmly with whatever sort
of product you're trying to sell
apparently it pays dividends and a must
I'm assuming because either you know
they're they're making five billion in
annual revenue I would imagine it's not
vaporware at this point and in case you
guys don't know what vaporware is
vaporware is a name for companies that
just tout new software that basically
say oh we're coming up with this new
software it's gonna do this this and
this and this and you know by the way go
ahead and start pre-ordering it and then
you know basically the software was
never created it didn't exist all this
stuff that they promised never came true
so now that is vaporware I'm assuming
that you know that's obviously not what
we're dealing with with Salesforce
they've been around for quite a while
now and more and more of the businesses
actually moving towards this this CRM
base model now as far as customizability
they also have this entire app exchange
thing so other companies are actually
starting to build products that are
built on top of Salesforce in order to
handle this this new industry so here's
just an example of some of the stuff
that they have going on they have this
entire app exchange where you can
actually in most of these apps are
actually built by other companies that
are integrating into sales forces system
to deliver you know specific results
like here's MailChimp MailChimp is like
you know a newsletter company where
their entire business model is about you
know how you embed you know like easy
signup forms for newsletters for whether
your blog or your website or something
like that well you know Salesforce if
you have a website that uses a male
tramp you can actually just use this
male
and that way you can use through
Salesforce you can manage your MailChimp
data through your Salesforce platform
without actually having to you know
login to MailChimp systems and stuff
like that to update you know that
particular thing so here's another one
with like you know Gmail so you can tie
in an entire business Gmail system into
your Salesforce app Salesforce is also
available on cell phones and you know
all kinds of different platforms so you
can start you know inter connecting your
company to get real-time data on sales
and things like that so obviously we're
seeing this entire new market and
enterprise level software where it's
like companies that used to thrive on
bringing in hardware and setting things
up like IBM last I read which was just a
few weeks ago maybe a couple months ago
iBM has received like something like
twelve or fifteen straight quarters of
declining revenue because a lot of their
you know their bread and butter and
mainframe enterprise systems are being
they're vanishing and they're vanishing
and making way for companies like Amazon
AWS and Microsoft Azure because these
you know these companies don't want to
have to pay for entire mainframe
software's they don't want to buy you
know fireproof rooms and stuff like that
and I'm assuming all this crazy stuff
that goes with having a you know a
server farm on your premises I mean then
you have to pay all the networking guys
it's much easier to not have to deal
with aging infrastructure and just
expect the company that you're paying
all this money to to be able to manage
all that for you
it doesn't necessarily mean that it's
without pitfalls it's actually part of
an expensive endeavor for smaller
companies getting off the ground to try
to pay a cloud provider and when they
could just hire one network
administrator and you know try to make
ends meet you know that way that's
always been kind of my mindset up and
you know until recently but you know
it's getting more and more difficult to
not use the cloud I mean and and just so
you guys know the cloud all it really
means is that you're just using somebody
else's computer so instead of you
maintaining your own computer you're
just using somebody else's maintained
computer and you're paying a price for
that but the benefits are obviously
extremely tremendous when it comes to
having to scale your business overnight
you know if you all of a sudden start
having an explosion of growth in China
and you're an American based company and
like I mean you need to have servers in
China to be able to handle that demand
and with a cloud-based system somebody
like Google or Amazon or Microsoft I
mean they're already in those markets
for you so you can just pay a little bit
of money scale up your system and next
thing you know you have a worldwide
application without a ton of network
latency as you know requests are pinging
across the entire globe so we're seeing
this this changing dynamic and we're
seeing more of this you know the CRM
based system and and really this is just
a thought of mine I'm not a hundred
percent sure but I would consider IBM's
new Watson product to be something very
similar to what Salesforce is doing
because well IBM Watson what they're
saying is they're saying hey look we
have artificial intelligence or at least
the closest thing to artificial
intelligence now these are the claims of
IBM I'm you know I can't comment on
whether or not it's good or not but what
we're seeing is that they're now you
know pushing this new product so instead
of the mainframe systems are saying hey
we have this new product where you start
interacting with you put Watson on your
machine and start interacting with the
Watson API Watson's gonna kind of learn
your business model even though we're
not in your business we don't do
healthcare or food or you know an
entertainment industry or something like
that we we just provide Watson and
Watson will learn for you Salesforce is
kind of the same way it's like you know
we don't do insurance and we don't do
banking we don't do all this other stuff
but we do have a platform that is
moldable enough to meet your needs so
unless companies can compete and offer a
very similar approach to what Salesforce
is doing which is very very difficult by
the way to build an app you know an
entire operating you know platform that
that is moldable to different industries
people are gonna have a you know I guess
I think small businesses gonna have a
real hard time trying to compete with
something that Salesforce is doing
eventually there's going to be more
monster competitors but I'm interested
about where where everything is going
here because ultimately if all companies
started using Salesforce what does that
mean
individuality as far as individuality is
concerned we've all seen in the
explosion of the project bootstrap which
was started Twitter bootstrap which was
started by the Twitter guys to be able
to be able to make a essentially a
moldable CSS style sheet and really and
almost like a way of it basically what
jQuery is the JavaScript bootstrap is to
CSS I mean they basically said hey we
have this way of it's not quite the same
but you guys hopefully get my drift the
the bootstrap way of doing things makes
it so much easier to build a customized
layout that also adheres and caters to
tablets and cell phones and with the
explosion of Twitter bootstrap almost
every site I've seen that uses Twitter
bootstrap looks very very similar I love
the you know the standard and I'm saying
this sarcastically but the standard I
got my logo on the top left a small menu
breaks down into a responsive navigation
on the mobile views and then it has the
as you scroll down you got you know
content centered div and then a hundred
percent with the content centered div
hundred percent width and it's like it's
not original at all anymore every
company's out there doing it but at the
same point everybody that is doing it
compared to the ones that aren't doing
it look a hundred percent more
professional so I think it says a lot
but eventually when everybody starts
doing that and everybody has a bootstrap
website and nobody ever deviates away
from it where does that leave us with
individuality I mean I would imagine
there's always going to be a market for
for good programmers to work for small
businesses to make revolutionary
technology but I think it's going to be
it almost seems like it's gonna be
harder as we move into the future when
companies like Salesforce they're gonna
you know dominate the way business is
done and I mean we've already seen that
with the cloud I mean I mean we're
seeing major cloud providers basically
you know dominating the way you know
websites scale and things so I mean I
could be wrong it's just I'm just really
curious to see where that's all going to
lead us with when I think of
evolutionary companies I think of like
Google right and their self-driving cars
or the way that they revolutionize
Google Maps like who's going to be the
company to revolutionize you know Google
Maps in the future and I just say Google
Maps is like a as an example but you
know Google did that whole Street View
thing when Joe when Google Maps came out
it was like slick right and it was all
JavaScript I'm really that was one of
the first all JavaScript websites that
we saw where it was just like wow this
thing is like this thing is so
responsive when I scrolling it's making
all these Ajax calls to update
geographic locations and then you start
clicking on roads and you see the Street
View I mean it was a revolutionary
product and it's made by some of the
best developers in the world that have a
lot of money to be able to you know to
create that type of thing and you know
maybe what we see is we see businesses
start using products like Salesforce or
similar products and being able to
devote more time and attention towards
research and development maybe we'll see
you know more technological advances in
the future or maybe we regress I don't
know the astronaut Buzz Aldrin I know
that he's expressed has discussed a lot
like where you had at the turn of the
century in the 1900s you know you had
Albert Einstein you know a general
theory of relativity that he released in
1915 and you know we started
understanding so much more about physics
in the quantum world and splitting the
atom and you know sending rockets into
space and satellites and Internet and
like you know all kinds of major major
advancements right and then it just
seemed like you know where we were
predicting you know 2001 a Space Odyssey
and we're just we're predicting all this
stuff to keep happening and instead over
the last you know 10 15 years we got
Facebook and we have Twitter and we have
bootstrap and we have Salesforce and you
know I just I mean what Google is doing
is pretty cool what Tesla is doing is
pretty cool but there's just not enough
companies and doing that cool stuff I
don't think it doesn't seem like it
anyway
I mean we're obviously making some
decent improvements and you know I guess
aerospace and defense but that's
generally not used for you know it'd be
really expanding human civilization not
that I know of anyway
so yeah I was just I was curious what
you guys thought about you know where
we're headed with enterprise software
IBM Watson Salesforce and you know just
seeing you know the explosion of cloud
providers so hopefully that means that
you know we can all continue to compete
as more and more larger conglomerates
start taking over the way business is
done and I'm sure it's always been that
way but anyway just my thoughts tonight
guys sorry if this videos boring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
