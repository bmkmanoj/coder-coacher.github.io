be talking about wicks wicks calm they
have a website available that allows you
to build and like full-featured websites
and everything that you can host
directly on their server so you know
what to actually configure anything Wix
has a product called Wix code which is
actually like an API that allows you to
write a bunch of custom JavaScript now
to basically change the way that their
their page to change the pages behavior
so it's actually taking and then the
concept of what Wix does which it
basically is a an online editor to
create websites including websites that
connect to databases and everything else
and that's what that's what Wix does but
it takes that one step further now by
allowing you to insert your own custom
JavaScript which gives these these
products much much greater power I think
so in order to get started with Wix code
all you have to do is sign up for a Wix
account so go to sign in and you can use
whatever obviously you guys not to sign
in go ahead and sign in and create your
account though once you're in you're
gonna get an option and be able to
choose different templates and things
like that in this particular case I just
grabbed you know some latest photos or
whatever and yeah I don't even like I
don't even know I'm sure anyway so the
this is the editor that is pulled up
here so you have all kinds of control
about the page you can change titling
things like that lots of stuff you can
end up you can just click on any one of
these elements on here using Wix now
this is all basic Wix product now what I
want to show you guys in this video that
was actually Wix code and this is a new
feature here it's a beta feature if you
go to tools and then click on developer
tools beta this is going to now open up
this properties panel and it's hidden
elements things so like if I take this
title here and I click on it and here's
like a custom function that I've added
but what I'm gonna do I have all these
different events that I can tap into so
like will say on Mouse into I'll go
ahead and create a custom function down
here we're just gonna log
hello world and this is probably very
small let me try to zoom this in yes
anyway you have this code here and I
actually added this before and what it
does is it's actually creating these
files for you and it's going to inject
it so when you go to if you want to see
this code in action what you're gonna do
is you're gonna preview the website and
then if I go over there and I highlight
and alright you can see as I'm mousing
into the title here you can see the
hello world is displaying in the console
so just like that with this editing tool
you now have the ability to add your own
custom JavaScript to change the the
entire behavior of the page and so
obviously you need a little bit more
functionality there like if we wanted to
with this new properties tab but
actually you're gonna be using that a
lot in conjunction with their their
editor down here and you can give it a
custom title like IDs and stuff like
that so I'll just say title alright and
then now if I wanted to go ahead and say
when we hover into this I'm gonna go
ahead and find my title and I'm gonna
use this this W object which allows me
to search for the ID of the element that
I'm looking for so I'm gonna be looking
for title which is the name that we just
gave it and then what I can do is I can
say dot HTML and then we can just
actually pass in like a string and we
can use the template syntax for
JavaScript so we'll just say h1
testing and there's alright so I'm using
the back tick there I'm not sure if you
guys can see that the back tick is the
new template syntax and es6 and
JavaScript that's know another thing I
should mention way the Wix code here you
can see that it's actually using the
latest standard of JavaScript so you can
use the SX right right this alright so
let's go ahead and preview the page all
right and then now we changed it and you
can see testing this mug so
unfortunately doesn't go back let me see
if I can do it better
without hovering into it all right here
we go all right now I'm gonna hover over
it it's gonna change the title boom
testing this mode all right all right so
let's look at another example here in
this example what we're gonna do is
we're gonna import code into the top of
our page here I'm gonna make this bigger
again all right so we're importing wix
location into this so now we can use the
Wix location to actually change the URL
so to do that I'm gonna replace this
content inside this function here
because we're gonna put everything just
for this demonstration
inside the hovering over the title I
just to make it easier and instead of
actually changing to a page on the
website we're gonna go to a completely
different website I just use this
website as an example so that I don't
ever have anybody while using my website
I just use my own not trying to promote
it or anything don't even care but let's
go ahead and navigate over that so we're
gonna preview this thing all right and
boom this link will only work on a
published site okay so anyway if you
wanted to see this thing redirect to
another page you'd have to actually see
it published unfortunately but that
would be how you actually redirect to a
different page so they you know even if
you wanted to have them click on
something and have it redirect so you
don't necessarily have to have an anchor
tag to redirect them somewhere you could
put a click event on a image and have
them redirect to a different website the
Wix code API is actually quite
sophisticated the this game is actually
created using Wix code in this
demonstration that they provided here so
there's quite a bit going on there
something you have to digest all that
because you'd have to be a pretty good
programmer to write all this stuff
obviously but that is how this this
chess game is actually functioning here
all right anyway yeah you can see I'm so
I mean the API itself is is quite
sophisticated the amount of control that
they give you and you're writing the
latest es6 and everything so it's it
should be pretty good as long as you're
up-to-date on your latest standards with
JavaScript also they have up-to-date
documentation on literally everything
that you would need to to build a pretty
sophisticated site like in this case
they have a fetch API that that they
have in Wix fetch but Wix fetch is
actually using the fetch specification
for making Ajax calls and in here you
can see that there it's it's a pretty
straightforward example it's using es6
promises to make sure everything is a
synchronous and and there's no you know
waiting around on calls and things like
that to return so you can make multiple
calls at once and there's fulfill the
promises as they're resolved and it
gives this demonstration so it's pretty
straightforward I'm not really gonna
demonstrate an ajax call or anything
like that but just wanted to give you as
the information here in the
documentation itself is just like it's
pretty easy to give examples on how to
make those Ajax calls to any sort of
service that you may end up wanting to
interface to another cool feature of the
editor here if I'm like writing code in
here and this is uh let's say it gets
all jacked up with a formatting the
indentation like I'm like Python and
things like that you know this could end
up happening where you got just stuff
all over the place you know so you can
end up having especially when you're
copying and pasting examples in here
you'll you'll find that a lot but it has
this little button right here which is
automatically gonna format and fix your
code you can see I did that for you it
also supports the shift in tab so that's
actually cool too so it's a pretty
sophisticated little text editor I think
inside the browser that they've created
over a Wix code alright let me also show
you guys something cool on the editor
here if you want to maximize it makes a
lot easier to deal with on the left hand
side you can see that we have these
these might be collapsed for you but you
can see there's two pages in my app
there's only home and blog we've been
working on home so far that's where our
header click function is and inside this
public folder you can actually add a new
javascript file so we're gonna call this
SJS and inside of here you can see that
it actually comes with a exported
function and this is using once again
the es6 module importing syntax which is
popular amongst you know like with web
pack and things like that so anyway at
cs6 way of exporting and importing
modules with javascript which is
brand-new support really but anyway here
says add function that it creates he
pass in two parameters and it's just
gonna add those two parameters so if you
pass it in two numbers it will add them
and and return that so let's go ahead
and figure out okay how do we use this
this test page here well you can in your
home page you can just import it I'm
using the es6 syntax and we're gonna
import the add method these curly braces
you know instead of importing everything
you're importing just the add method
from and then you have to give it the
location and this is where it's
confusing because you have to actually
say public folder so it's not really
confusing but if you don't know and you
don't know now you know though but
actually you don't really know because
this forward slash actually should not
be here we need to get rid of that
forward slash make sure you guys are
listening because it's not gonna work
I'll get rid of that forward slash
that's it just reference the public
folder directly all right so it's going
use that imported function that we just
added at the top so we're gonna say
console.log use the function passing to
arbitrary number is eight and three and
we're gonna get the result of twelve
right I'm just kidding I know how to
count it's gonna return eleven when we
console.log this thing so let's go ahead
and try to preview that we're gonna
click on the header and it's gonna
output eleven every time we click on it
all right now so that's how you actually
create your own separate JavaScript file
and then import it and using the just
typical es6 syntax once again
so one other thing i want to touch upon
on the wix location API is when we bring
this in this allows you to get like the
the actual URL the page that you're on
so phone there just console.log are you
know
and then we can say like wicks location
it gives you all this information here
so you can actually use a lot of this
stuff already so anyway let's just get
the base URL
all right you can see it's outputting
the base URL of the website but there's
other stuff that you can get here as
well like if you wanted to get the the
query strings a lot of times that's
you'll want people to pass you data so
you can actually get a query string data
from the users and everything and that's
how you would get it using the the API
there most of this stuff is really well
documented on the Wix code website so
I'll have the links in the description
tab below so you guys can check it out I
would definitely recommend this product
it's a highly tuned highly polished
product and thank you guys for watching
have a good day take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
