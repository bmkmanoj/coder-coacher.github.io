beginning JavaScript tutorial series for
hipster code comm and in this video what
we're going to talk about is why you
would use JavaScript as a programming
language where it's used who invented it
and why we use it so once we get past
all of that this is going to be a
beginning JavaScript series so you
should be able to just jump in with no
programming experience whatsoever and be
able to follow along no problem so to go
back into the history of the JavaScript
language it was originally invented just
to work inside of a browser so in case
you don't know what a browser is it's
Chrome or Firefox or Internet Explorer
and the new edge browser but they're
just browsers or actual software
applications that we use to bounce from
one web page to another javascript can
only be executed inside of that browser
it's considered to be a dynamically
interpreted object-oriented language so
that can be a little bit complicated
there it's also considered to be a
functional language it's one of the few
that's considered both functional and
dynamically interpreted also known as
duck types so there's a lot of very
confusing titles that is given to the
JavaScript language but one thing that
is for sure is that it's a very unique
language and it's the most important
language at this moment because it's so
widely used everything has moved away
from software applications to strictly
web-based applications web companies
like Salesforce you google with YouTube
and other major companies are actually
offering services that all exist on the
web so you have a login and a password
you log into some system you're
interacting with their system and it's
all being done through the web so that
requires web browsers and it requires
JavaScript another example is something
like Adobe with their Photoshop
Photoshop has been one of their biggest
software applications that they've had
not just Photoshop but illustrator and
all the other programs that come with
the Creative Suite catalog that's all
considered now
in there adobe cloud so it's all
software as-a-service so everything is
web-based and you have your
subscriptions and even though you're
going to download adobe to your machine
it's still now all being done through
the web so as of like CS 7 and beyond
it's all just cloud-based software as a
service and we're going to continue to
see things headed in that direction one
of the misconceptions that I've seen
recently is that JavaScript can run
outside of your your web browser but
it's actually not true JavaScript its
ability to be able to to change your
your file system files so basically
whether or not it can write files to
your machine or delete files from your
machine it actually doesn't have that
ability at all one of the confusing
points behind that though is that the
nodejs project gives the impression that
you can actually use javascript to have
that access to be able to write to files
to delete the files to create malicious
software we've recently seen some what's
called like encryption malware where
malware gets installed on my machine and
files and directories are encrypted and
you have to pay a ransom using like bit
the BitTorrent currency whatever that
stuff is I don't even use it but you
have to pay the ransom in order to
unlock your files and and some of the
new ransom malware that's out there
right now is actually written in
JavaScript or at least that's what they
say but it's really not it's written in
nodejs and nodejs is essentially it
opens up a JavaScript API so you can
write JavaScript code to interact to it
but note itself is not JavaScript so in
order for node to be able to do what it
does it has to be written in c and c++
binaries so you can see that node itself
is c and c++ which obviously has access
to all the file systems it's what makes
notes so fast and then you have this
javascript part that it mentions here so
you use javascript to interface to no
junior
but no js' itself is not JavaScript
JavaScript runs inside the browser and
if we have Chrome pulled up cromoz the
really the developer tool of choice I
would say among most web developers that
I've seen recently
it used to be Mozilla but chrome has now
stepped up their their dev tools that
are built into the Chrome browser so all
you need is to have Chrome on your
machine and you have access to all of
the greatest JavaScript debugging tools
that are out there if you're a Mozilla
person you can use Mozilla Mozilla has
Firebug and a few other tools that is
also built into their system and then
the new edge browser is trying to make
headway there but I don't recommend it
if you're serious about doing JavaScript
debugging in the browser in order to see
your dev tools you would want to have a
browser pulled up and if you hit the f12
button that will pull up your dev tools
or if you right click and say view page
source
I'm sorry not page source if you say
inspect just click the inspect button
that will also open up the dev tools you
can move your dev tools so that it's dot
like detached you could have it docked
at the bottom or you can have it docked
on the right-hand side by clicking on
these little 3d cons and saying where
you want to docked the elements panel
these are all going to be tabs but the
elements panel this is going to be
basically your source but the
interesting thing is it's the source
that exists inside the browser and this
source does not necessarily mean it's
going to match the page source if you
view the raw page source this raw page
source is what a which is what will be
returned to you if you were using
something to request this page that
wasn't a browser you would get all this
stuff but a lot of times this stuff
doesn't contain all the data that you're
looking for because it all exists inside
of a browser session well we'll look at
that more later on but you can think of
the elements page as the view source
although with a little bit of extra
content in there than what the normal
view source does the next icon is the
the console here this is really
important the console allows you to see
JavaScript errors as they're being
executed so if there's any sort of
the problem with your javascript code
compiling it's gonna throw out the error
in your console so usually whenever you
don't if your program is not doing what
you want it to do most likely you just
need to check your console because it's
going to tell you where you even went
wrong and where you know exactly what
line in the code file the problem
occurred at so and you can also write
code right into the console so this is a
a print well I actually will say the
alert so will say hello world and you
can type this right into the console and
when you run it you can see that the
alert box came up so you can execute
code and practice your JavaScript right
inside of a browser you don't need
anything else installed so why would you
want to learn JavaScript well javascript
is the most popular language for many
reasons but the main reason is because
we all use web browsers every day almost
every company we know of has a website
and that you can do things on the
website almost every bit of those
websites requires some sort of
JavaScript in order to work nowadays
where we used to have server-side
languages like PHP and Python and
c-sharp and other languages that ran on
the server because they were very good
at running on the server we now see
JavaScript running not just on the
server but also on the client so the
client means you like if you have a
browser opening you're viewing this web
page like to Wikipedia on this nodejs
page I'm the client the server sits on
so you know Wikipedia server wherever it
is and that's the server relationship so
the client server relationship is me as
the client with my browser say hey I'm
requesting this page the server says oh
he's requesting this page they pulled
whatever they need to from their
database and they send back the page to
the client the client then uses the
browser to be able to take all that HTML
and data and everything and it uses
JavaScript to just format the page for
us so that's the client-server language
and our relationship and that used to be
the way it was always done in the old
days and that you didn't have JavaScript
running on the server but now with the
advent of nodejs which once again isn't
really a job
for running on the server it's C and C++
with JavaScript that you use to write it
but you're seeing now JavaScript and
doing a lot more stuff in this client
browser so instead of just formatting
the data we now see entire JavaScript
libraries that are acting as if they are
the server and the client together we
see things like react j/s which is a
complicated data binding library which
can be used for single page apps where
you build components and the components
can communicate with the servers on
their own and it allows you to literally
have what appears to be a software
application inside of a browser and it
makes things a lot easier to deal with
you also have things like angularjs
which have occurred in angularjs is
giving the impression of you know a
multi-page application where it's really
just one single HTML page so
communication with the server is not
being done for every page that's being
requested sometimes it's just being done
for smaller bits of data so you're not
grabbing entire pages you're just
grabbing little pieces here and there
the TLB index which uses a lot of
different factors if you read their
website they'll show you all the
different factors but it's a ton of
different factors they use to try to
determine what are the most popular and
important languages of today and you can
see on here that we have Java C C++ C
sharp Python PHP and JavaScript so
JavaScript certainly a top 10 language
but many will agree that javascript in
many cases is not being used everywhere
it's not being used on the client end
server
although it can be and we're seeing it
happening more and more
but the javascript is used in
conjunction with every single piece of
web development out there so even this
ranking of seven is probably highly
underrated compared to how often it's
used and how important it is for any
sort of web developer to know how to
write JavaScript alright guys so that's
why you would want to learn JavaScript
it's a little bit about the history as
far as you know how it's being used and
how its usage has changed over time and
also how you can actually execute
JavaScript right in your browser without
having to download anything besides
Chrome
and in the next video we're gonna start
looking at the language itself alright
