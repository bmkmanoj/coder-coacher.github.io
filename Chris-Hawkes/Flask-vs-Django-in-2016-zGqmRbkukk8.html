video flask vs. Django and the reason
why I'm doing this video now is actually
I've done a tutorial series recently
where I've gotten into flasks quite a
bit not just with the tutorial series
itself but beyond that just because I'm
actually in the process of putting up a
few production websites that are going
to be using flasks and I really just
wanted to see what all the fuss was
about I mean flask has gotten a lot of
attention as of late with being the more
modern framework and in this video I
just want to kind of compare the two
from my perspective and I've actually
you know the programmer Senior
Programmer typically do c-sharp and
asp.net but I've been involved in Django
for the last five years so I'm
definitely a huge fan of Django just
recently got involved in flask so I
really feel like I have some perspective
on the two and I have production
websites in both of them so this
conversation takes place you know as of
2016 at the time of this video so
technologies and things change a lot so
the first things first thing first we
want to just look at what are these two
frameworks so flask is a micro web
framework written in Python and based on
the work zu toolkit and the ginger tea
template engine it is BSD license
license meaning that it is free to use
so any sort of company or private
individuals free to use flask to build
whatever sort of billion-dollar website
that they want to build so that's pretty
awesome and as far as flask is concerned
when it says that it's a micro web
application it means that it is you know
that is what it says it is it's a very
bare-bones application they don't give
you much to work with but it is fast and
it is you know yours to mold into
whatever you want it to be so Jango is
also free and open source web
application written in Python so both
frameworks are in on the Python
programming language and it has an MVC
architecture in which so does flask and
it is maintained at the Django Software
Foundation which is
a non-profit group which has quite a bit
of money nowadays due to a lot of
corporate backing so the bottom line
when you compare the two they're both
written on the Python programming
language and they're both free to use to
build whatever sort of website you want
to build a common thing that you want to
look at whenever you're comparing web
frameworks is you want to look at speed
and which ones are faster now the
problem with speed tests is that they
can all be taken with a grain of salt a
lot of the speed tests depend on the
actual hardware that is actually running
the tests it can sometimes depend on
network latency they can also depend on
whether or not the guy that's conducting
tests is running a bunch of applications
on his operating system at the time that
he's conducting the tests so you can
never be 100% sure when when somebody
says oh this is faster than this it's
sometimes it's the actual way that the
code is written that can also be the
problem however I think that most people
would not argue with the fact that flask
is quite a bit faster than Django just
because there's less going on with flask
as opposed to Django so if you look at
this speed test which this is the photo
of the credit this describing a github
page just about a different speed test
and I'm not sure what sort of agenda he
has maybe he has no agenda maybe he does
I don't know but this is a pretty
reputable I think speed test and from my
own observations I mean flask a is about
three times faster than Django so in
this case it's actually saying it's
quite a bit faster more like five times
faster but this is just you can see
requests per second 259 compared to
Django and Django is actually quite a
bit slower than a lot of these other
frameworks and the reason for that is
because Django is not a micro framework
it is a opinionated framework that has a
ton of stuff that it does for you out of
the box so when you compare you know
what are these two frameworks doing for
you Django is going to do a whole heck
of a lot more for you than flask for
starters like authentication
administration Django has an entire
built-in admin system that you can
actually manipulate all your database
objects when it comes to actually adding
users and managing roles and permissions
on stuff Django does all that for you
out of the box flask has none of that so
for a lot of newbies I just want to get
a web
out there or a lot of skill developers I
just want to get a website out there
quickly without having to write all that
stuff they you know sometimes see Django
as deep being the better option however
I will say that flask also has some
opinionated plugins that you can
actually just easily install into your
flask application like flask security
which is opinionated on how it handles
roles and permissions and stuff like
that
so as opinionated as that is I can say
that Django definitely has a step up on
flats when it comes to managing that
type of stuff because Django just works
for you out of the box flask security is
pretty cool but it still doesn't do
everything you needed to do like the
like what you have with Django coming
out of the box so another thing when you
look at the health of a framework you
might look at what kind of corporate
sponsors are actually backing the
project so Django has been around for
over 10 years now and they've grown
their huge corporation now your private
what they call a nonprofit but they have
a ton of corporate sponsors and there's
a ton of billion-dollar websites and you
know companies that rely upon Django and
Mozilla is just one of them and then you
also have all the actual web sites that
that use you know these Django framework
so companies like Microsoft and
Eventbrite I mean they've actually
sponsored Django cons and stuff like
that so Django definitely has flat feet
when it comes to corporate sponsors it's
not going anywhere there's so much money
that relies upon Django to work and
continue to work that you're not going
to see flask overtake Django anytime
soon now as far as flask corporate
sponsors I couldn't find any like so
there might be some I'm sure there are
some but there are definitely nothing
that I could find and they don't list
them on there they're flasks website
like Django does
Django also has Django Khan because
Django is so big they actually have a
conference that happens so it's at least
once a year maybe twice a year I believe
that it happened in Los Angeles and
lately it's been anything in Montreal
Canada but you know it's it's so popular
that they have their own conference you
know so
that's pretty cool flask doesn't have
one so flask ah nono flask on as far as
I'm aware so when we look at whether or
not major companies have actually taken
the plunge and dedicated themselves to a
certain piece of technology it's always
important to look at you know who is
backing who
so with flask even though they don't
have a ton of corporate sponsors flask
is actually the the core back-end for
Pinterest now Pinterest used to be on
Django and for the longest time I
doubted that Pinterest was you know
fastest growing website in the world but
back in 2014 they actually got off the
Django Sakon and built their own stack
but they built it on top of flask so
it's not like it's using you know what
flask has for ya the box they took flask
as a starting point and then made it
into their own thing and I've actually
made a video on this in the past you
shouldn't just look at these billion
dollar companies because a lot of people
are like oh well Facebook uses PHP and
and that means PHP is great and
Wikipedia uses it and blah blah well I
mean Twitter uses Ruby and all that
stuff but eventually these sites like
Twitter and Facebook they they're their
stack doesn't even remotely resemble any
sort of starting point that you would
have you know with some sort of PHP
framework or some Python framework or a
ruby framework they eventually have to
custom roll their own stuff they have so
much crap going on that they it just
it's not even in the same it's not even
the same discussion anymore but that
doesn't mean that it wasn't an important
point of them picking a framework and
then taking it and then starting with
that because in my opinion it doesn't
really matter once you get that big
you're going to be kind of writing your
own solution anyway so it doesn't matter
what sort of framework you're using at
that point the point is to try to get
your product out there get it done you
know as quickly and as fastly and as
reliably as possible and that's why you
use a framework and then if it does blow
up and it gets big you can have you know
$100,000 a year salary developers and
engineers working around the clock
trying to rewrite your app into
something that's a little bit more
suitable for your business model but
until you reach that point probably not
a whole lot of you know discussion and
time should be spent evaluating and
trying to future-proof something that
most likely will never happen so anyway
Pinterest uses it Twilio uses it in
reddit com now reddit calm doesn't use
it as like their full stack but they do
use flask for some of their back-end API
for django django definitely has flash
beat when it comes to large websites
using it 3 didn't - just name just a
couple just to be fair on both sides
in fact my link is messed up here I saw
it still points to flask but websites
that are using it Instagram huge website
discuss discuss at one point had scaled
to over like 1 billion monthly viewers
or users unique users every month and
they explain some of how they do that
with Django and they still use Django
and then Dropbox so Dropbox is a new
they hired the Python creator guido van
rossum to come over and help them but
Dropbox has been starting to use some of
the go programming language to try to do
some of their your heart
hardcore multi processor concurrency
programming that Python is just not 100%
well-suited for but they do still use
Django for their website at Dropbox when
it comes to a learning curve flask beats
Django by longshot there's no magic
involved meaning that a lot of the stuff
that Django does for you out of the box
you know there is I get ton of code
literally thousands upon thousands of
lines of code that's been written over
almost a decade that is doing all kinds
of stuff you have no idea of what it's
doing and how it works and how it's
doing it so flask has a little bit of
that just like any sort of decent sized
framework however it's not nearly as
much so when you're trying to actually
learn all the inner workings of your
website flask
beats Django by a longshot when it comes
to actually being able to understand
that stuff and mold your website into
your own vision if you've ever used node
flask is very similar to something like
Express j/s where expression a s is
written on node and it doesn't do a
whole lot for you so it leaves a lot of
that inflammation implementation up to
you which ultimately makes you much more
familiar familiar with your website so
it takes more time and there's pros and
cons to all of that so if time is of the
ergency then you know you don't want to
deal with that kind of stuff but if you
have a bit of time then it's always good
to learn the inner workings of your
framework because then one day something
is not going to work right and you're
probably going to know exactly
actually where that problem is if you
wrote most of that code yourself as
opposed to relying upon like a django
source code where like you have no idea
what's going on as far as future
proofing a lot of people won't know okay
if I learn this technology is there
going to be around for the next 5-10
years both ah well they both are going
to be around for a long time there's so
much stuff that's reliant upon Django
but as far as like you know the future
proof technology what we're seeing as
late as we're seeing these large web
frameworks like Ruby on Rails and
asp.net and Django we're seeing them
kind of being less and less important as
we move into the future because nowadays
it's all about you know client-side code
in JavaScript whether it's react or
angular or ember or backbone or knockout
or I can netlist a ton of these you know
JavaScript client-side frameworks that
are actually handling a lot of stuff
that the server used to handle like
routing authentication data binding
obviously all the data display that goes
on in the view so all that dynamic
behavior of being able to take data and
build and calculate a lot that's being
done in JavaScript now so the
server-side technology part of it is not
nearly as important so what people are
looking for is they're looking for a
very micro back-end server side stack
and then leave a lot of their
implementation up to like the view side
which is going to be using like I said
some sort of JavaScript framework so
we're library like react and ultimately
that is you know what they say the
future is going to be so even the latest
version of asp.net the the supposed open
open source and cross-platform version
of asp.net it's actually a very small
thing that they call asp.net core which
is a very small portion of what asp.net
is so you know even Microsoft you know
is close sources they've been in the
past I mean they're even trying to like
scale back the massiveness of their of
their dotnet stacks like asp.net so I'm
sure it's not something that they want
to do but it's something that is you
know being demanded for nowadays
another important thing when you're
looking at whether or not I'm going to
your Django or flask is you want to know
how much am I going to pay to host this
thing so the note is one of my favorite
companies that I've ever done business
with I've used them now for probably
three or four years maybe more they're
not shared hosting so you don't have a
bunch of you know applications being
slammed on a server and then it comes to
a grinding halt whenever you you know
you need it to work windowed guarantees
your resources it's a virtual private
host here you're guaranteed to have that
and it's not this you know platform as a
service provider like a juror or Heroku
or Amazon AWS or like a lot of other
major companies they charge a lot
because they do a lot of stuff they
build all these little you know GUI
tools where you can just select a few
dropdowns and all of a sudden your
server supposed to be working even
though there's still a huge learning
curve there they do a lot of that stuff
for you but they charge you for it too
so somebody like Linode or digitalocean
they basically say hey you give us ten
or twenty bucks a month you can go ahead
and just you know click all you got to
do is pick whatever sort of operating
system you want whether what you want
like CentOS or a bun - or something like
that and then ultimately it goes ahead
it sets up your server you log in to
your server and then you have to set up
everything like you're super users your
firewall rules on stuff and there's
plenty of tutorials out there but you're
going to pull your hair out at certain
points trying to figure out how to set
all that stuff up but ultimately if you
are successful in doing so you can you
know have a ton of traffic for a very
small amount of money so like this
twenty dollar month account just for
instance I had a movie website a couple
years ago that was getting over 250,000
hits when I was just on one website and
when I say hits I mean actual unique
visitors a month and I also had other
websites running on it and even with
that traffic it was a Content site you
know about movies and stuff like that
and even with all that traffic I only
exceeded like 10 percent of my available
resources so I mean this is a ton of
resources for the price and I've never
actually had a problem with like
stability or anything using OneNote so
whether you choose flask or Django
hosting options are going to be
plentiful so
one doesn't really beat the other so
that's really it on my presentation
between Jango and flask and um and just
recently I went ahead and I I'm doing
this flask tutorial because I wanted to
you know teach other people how to use
flask and I hadn't really been too
involved in flask but I went ahead and I
have this new post website that I've
owned for a long time and it used to
actually be like a just a general blog
but hasn't done anything for several
years and I still own the domain I could
have a discussion of why owning a domain
for a long time is important but this
video is not that reason but that said
that's why the name is what it is but I
went ahead and I just created this site
to try to just showcase some of these
tutorials that I put together you know
some of them aren't that great I don't
know I mean it is what it is I like
doing tutorials and you know they may
not be as good as like codecademy or you
know some of those other ones out there
maybe but i do focus on some of the
niche stuff i think that maybe other
people aren't focusing on and you know
ultimately i like to learn and and try
to help other people learn too so it is
what it is if you don't like it you know
i guess that's that's fine there's
nothing i can do about that but i do
like to put those up there and then i
have you know these are these vlogs is
what i call them so it's kind of what
I'm doing like right now where I can
compare two technologies and stuff like
that and I also have you know I have
some videos on here that aren't even
just you know my own videos videos that
I found to be very helpful from like
people that are in the industry that
kind of do the same thing that I'm doing
I mean I've done it before or longer
that you know than I have but like you
know this guy Eli the computer guy I'm
sure if anybody sure some of my viewers
have obviously watched them in his
videos as well but this is a good one
whether or not you have to be good at
math to do IT and I think it's funny
because it's spot-on I have a lot of
similarities with him in regards to math
but um yeah that that is what is so this
website here is using flask and it's you
know it's production on the node and I
don't know it's just it was a it was a
breeze to work with I mean honestly it's
just a simple website and very simple
functionality and everything but and
it's going to get I just actually put
that up this more
on the nodes so there's there's not a
whole lot to this website eventually
it'll grow but I just wanted to let you
guys know that if you're interested in
like doing the flax tutorial like the
same process that I made this website
with and hosted on the node is all going
to be covered in this tutorial series
and I only have ten videos right now the
videos are going to get a little bit
more complicated with like database
management like many to many
relationships like you can see I have a
tutorial and this tutorial actually has
that many to many relationship with
actual videos and I'll explain all of
that in the tutorial series and also
eventually how to deploy it Tula node
which can be a similar process if you
decided to host with a digitalocean as
well and that's about it guys so thanks
for watching this video let me know if
you have any questions let me know what
you think please please vote up and
subscribe if you would please I
appreciate it
and thank you for everybody who has
subscribed to my channel in the past and
continues to do so have a good night
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
