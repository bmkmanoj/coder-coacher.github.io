doing this series of once a month just
because it gets a lot of attention i
like talking about it's actually
something I've been interested in a long
time a lot of people tell you hey just
go out and learn any language you want
it doesn't matter which one but a lot of
people are still interested in you know
how are their language is stacking up
with some of the other ones what are the
trends what are people most excited
about so this is about what people are
most excited about I'm looking at a lot
of different factors in fact i'm gonna
try to automate this process but i'm
still trying to get it all situated into
my top 10 list maybe even the top 20
eventually but right now this is just 10
and my algorithms and things i'm still
working on here so i'll just continue to
try to to make the program a little bit
better so let's go ahead and start
looking at the list here number 10 is
the our language so are everybody's
talking about it statistical just
analysis it's big in the bioinformatics
field so python used to rule there but
our is really stepping up as being a
major language that's being used in labs
and things like that in the scientific
community mathematical calculations
things like that all that stuff that's
clearly over my head I don't do any of
that number 90 is Swift Apple's new
language so it's actually gaining more
and more steam people are pretty popular
or happy about it c-sharp is um is a
pretty big language obviously it's
microsoft's language it's it's it's the
language for so many developers in the
world out there that are just kind of
happy with their job and they have
plenty of work that they have with
enterprise systems I use C sharp and
Microsoft's technology stack to run
their day-to-day operations and they're
just content with it but overall there's
not a ton of C sharp projects on github
and other you know forums where the
c-sharp is discussed and things like
that so i would say that some of the
developers are not nearly as passionate
where as vocal as some of these other
languages objective c which is apple's
primary language that they've used for
quite some time swift is a relatively
new language for apple but objective-c
is definitely the language for the apple
ecosystem number six is Ruby Ruby on
Rails is still quite popular it's
actually in decline unfortunately for
Ruby fans but there's still quite a bit
of Ruby support in the
Ruby community is still relatively vocal
and very active in github in other
places number five is PHP PHP seven is a
brand new enhancement to PHP there's
object-oriented support a lot of people
are talking about laravel so they're
fanatics about laravel and PHP's future
and PHP is not going anywhere number for
C++ the primary language of games and a
lot of other stuff go away and C++ is
another language where people aren't
necessarily as vocal they've been doing
it for decades and they're just continue
to do it for more decades number three
is Python pythons community is very
active it's actually experiencing a huge
amount of growth in the industry overall
across all kinds of different areas but
python is definitely a very very strong
language strong crowd number two is
Jabba Jabba a lot of people are very
passionate about Java with so much stuff
runs on job it's unbelievable so job is
number two here number one is JavaScript
you guys know this from all the hipsters
out there that there are tons of
hipsters in the JavaScript community so
we're looking at things like typescript
ania babel acma scrip and the es6
standards and now there's even es7 and
some features being added on github
projects all over the place are now
being introduced into the language but
javascript definitely has probably the
most vocal and it's probably the most
chaotic development environment or
programming language environment of all
these languages by far in fact I don't
think we've ever really seen anything
like the JavaScript community in the IT
industry as a whole ever so I'm curious
to see where javascripts going to be in
five years but anything you learn you
know six months ago or a year ago in
javascript whether it's reactor angular
you're learning things over and over and
over again the wheel just keeps on
turnin and I'm not sure we're getting
anywhere but javascript is certainly a
popular language I like writing in
JavaScript I actually just recently
created my own node.js framework because
everybody else is going so why not me
but anyway that's the list guys for
September 2016 I'm going to
14 October of 2016 I'm gonna start
looking at a lot more data points but
for right now these are the most popular
languages in September of 2016 thanks
for watching guys please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
