real quick I just want to show you guys
how to fix this problem I've actually
had people reach out to me so I'm on
Windows 8.1 and I'm using Python 3.5 and
I'm trying to get spokes for us and
Postgres when you try to do a pip
install you need to have this psy CO PG
2 module in order for Postgres to be
able to install and unfortunately there
is no like pip install for that to work
so we need to do is you need to hit up
this extension right here and if you
just copy this this link up here then
you can have down here so I have 32-bit
version a version of Python so I need CP
stands for Python 35 so that's the file
I need so if I download that it's gonna
put that joint right here alright so
it's not going to open that since it's
Windows but you need to go to the
Downloads folder see it doesn't know to
open that so you need to go the
Downloads folder
I'm started a downloads and then I need
to find that site where is it
yeah there it is so this wheel file so
we're just gonna we're gonna cut it
minimize that and then I'm going to put
that you need to put it if you're
especially if you're using a virtual
environment like what I'm doing I have
this project I'm creating about heroin
usage in the United States so I have it
under my heroin project and then inside
heroin I'm actually not there inside my
virtual environment which I have right
here I'm gonna go and do Lib site
packages and then this is where I need
to actually paste it so I'm gonna paste
it now I need to open up a command
prompt so I don't remember how to open
it in that that folder so I'm going into
the environment folder and to live site
packages so I'm going in the same folder
where we pasted it and then I just need
to say pip and
stall and then I give it the full fully
spelled out file name so CEO psy CEO PG
2 - 2 . 6.1 - CP 35 - none - win32 WHL
alright so now that that went through
and installed in my virtual environment
location which is what I want to do so
if I go back into will go into my my
file what I was trying to run is a great
super user so whenever you do a new
Python setup you're using a Postgres or
whatever sort of database you you use
you set up your initial super user so
you use a Python manage that py create
super user alright now this is another
issue that it looks like we actually
need to run make migrations before we
can even create our super user which is
kind of lame so just if you run into
this problem as well say make migrations
and then just migrate all right that's
kind of lame you have to do that now
let's run the create super user again
and I'm gonna call this see you know
it's fine
all right so I went ahead and created
the superuser so if you guys ever want
to get set up with Postgres on a django
I'm using Django 13.4 sorry django 1.9
Python 3.5 windows 8.1
Postgres probably the latest version I
have no clue and and you have to
manually install that wheel file so if
that ever trips you guys up that's what
you need to do and just for shits and
giggles I date abase setup here in which
you guys can have my password that's
fine because there's just a test
database that only runs locally on my
machine so I don't care about releasing
that information but you can see here
that you just set the engine to Postgres
the name heroine is the name of the
database and then you have your user
whoever that is and Postgres is just the
standard user when you install Postgres
on your machine and then I have
testament III like I said just for the
private local database alright guys so
that's how you get the Postgres working
with django alright thanks for watching
