video we want to look at the Python
tools for Visual Studio code which is
actually not to be confused with Visual
Studio there was some confusion when
Visual Studio code came out because
Microsoft had announced that like people
associate a visual studio with like to
visual studio flagship integrated
development environment which literally
like does a ton of stuff for you but
that wasn't what was being released as
open source and cross-platform Visual
Studio code is so there you know there's
no longer really a confusion in that but
I think when things were first being
announced like at least a year ago or
more there was some confusion but here
is Visual Studio code and it's free to
download and once you run it then you
just have this so it's a bit it's a
bare-bones text editor so it's not
trying to do everything for you but it's
actually pretty good and it's getting
better with time when you have the the
project pulled up you're going to notice
this little weird icon if you hover over
it you can see extensions and it by
default it tries to pull like popular
extensions for you and we're gonna just
type in Python and these things change
constantly because they do get you know
updated and stuff like that so if you
want to inspect them or make this larger
you can now then one of the things too
is like I said the the community can
build these things so like you can see
like tae-bo I'm assuming I don't know if
you meant to do this or not but he says
like makes it easy to write codes in
Python so I think that's automatically a
red flag when somebody doesn't even
write proper English in the tool I mean
it's kind of concerning especially if it
comes to like documentation of how to
use it and stuff but we're gonna use
this one called by dawn and Jo main I
don't even know if I'm saying that right
but we're just gonna click install
another thing to that you want to look
at with these plugins as you can see
that this one probably should be on the
top cuz that's three hundred and
thirteen thousand downloads it has a
star rating of a 4.5 whereas this one
only has 30,000 downloads and then this
one would like I said the broken English
only has 7,000 downloads so it's pretty
interesting so we're gonna go ahead and
enable it so it needs to restart the
environment
all right so now that we have that
installed there's a few things that we
need to do whenever you're using Visual
Studio code you need to have some sort
of folder open so I'm assuming the
folder is gonna be whatever sort of
project root directory that you're
working on so you would actually go to
your just file menu here and we're gonna
say open folder and I'm gonna actually
put this in my visual I have a folder
here called Visual Studio code in my
projects directory so I'm just going to
open that and then if we click on the
the documents folder or the Explorer
show it has a little documents icon so
we'll click on that so this hasn't
opened yet I don't think
so obviously it is open to hive the
visual studio code here okay so we can
click on new document we're gonna create
a new Python file so we'll just call
this first example py and we're just
gonna do a simple print statement so
print hello world okay and now with the
file saved you're gonna know that we
need to press our control spacebar I
believe it should load the extensions
for future reference it might say
loading for a second but this should
actually show up a little we might yeah
there it goes so well damn that's not
actually doing exactly what I wanted to
do I was hoping that the the formatting
or the syntax would be a little bit
different with the colouring of it
because I thought the print would be
blue but apparently not okay so that's
not a big deal though now that we have
this one of the cool features of being
able to use Visual Studio code is to be
able to use the editor that comes with
it so or so the debugger so that you
know when you're actually evaluating
your code you don't want to do print
statements on stuff you can actually
just use a debugger to step through
things so in order to do that we need to
click on this little bug icon which is
the debug and when we click on it a few
things are going to happen number one if
you've never actually executed the
python extension tool before it's going
to probably create a Jason config file
for you and that may actually happen
when we try to run it for the first time
so let's go ahead and try to debug this
but before we do that I want to actually
hover to the left of the actual line
number where we have print hello world
and we're gonna see the little red dot
up here and we just want to click so
that we can place that breakpoint and
you can see it actually tells you that
you have a breakpoint set and this file
first example dot py so when we go to
run this we need the select the
environment that we're going to run it
in and we're going to select Python now
this is where the configuration gets set
up and it this is all the internal stuff
that needs to happen in order for your
your Python extension to work now
another thing that you need to
keep in mind is that this means that
python has to be installed in your
machine so if you guys have never
installed Python on like something like
Windows you need to go ahead and do that
there's installers out there I have
videos if you just search Google for
Chris Hawkes install Python there's
plenty of videos that I have on it and
other people I'm sure I've made other
videos too but Python has to be
installed on your machine in order for
this editor to actually work because
it's obviously using Python to execute
your file so go ahead and close the
launch Jason config file that's just
telling you that it's there and it
shouldn't pull up again the second time
around so we're gonna click play now
this time you're going to get the little
play icons at the top it's going to run
and now when it hits this yellow line it
means that it's using a debugger so
what's so cool about this is that you
can see everything attached to your
local your your well essentially this is
the global scope here of your your
program being executed so you can see
some of the you know built-in features
of you know the Python language itself
here so like you know the file and the
doc and all that stuff the doc string
but beyond that let's go ahead and just
press f10 you can see that there's a
debug console so you don't have to
actually execute your program outside of
visual studio code you can see that the
expected outcome is there so let's go
ahead and stop that real quick just
clicking the stop button and we're going
to do a couple things we'll say x equals
hello and then y equals world and then
we'll get rid of this print statement at
the top and we'll say print x plus y I
really feel like that should be blue but
apparently wants to have everything
white you could actually change the
syntax color by the way if you wanted to
but here's something that's gonna be
relatively cool let's go ahead and pray
so you know we'll just place a
breakpoint at the top and then we'll
step through it so when we go ahead and
run this again you don't get prompted
for the jason config the second time
around so that's pretty cool another
thing too is you can see that this is
you know this is the whole local scope
of your project so as we press f10 to go
to the next line you can now look at
this you can see X is now scoped out for
you can see X has a value of hello and
it's it's a string so you
copy the value or you can add it to a
watch see if X ever changes then you
have a watch or just you know monitoring
that to see you know when and if that
value of her changes but let's go ahead
and step down again by pressing f10 so
now we have y at the top so hello world
another thing too is when we hover over
the X in the actual project you can see
it tells you what the value is hello and
world so that becomes extremely helpful
when you have very very complex projects
and you're like what is you know what is
this string of args mean you know what
is you know what is inside this array
and all stuff a lot of times you know in
Python we don't have the tools that
something like c-sharp has but Microsoft
Visual Studio has done a pretty good job
I think with this product and to me it
to be honest it has me a little bit
excited about doing Python development
because I don't have to do it in the you
know be homuth that is Visual Studio I
can just do it in Visual Studio code
because I don't need half the features
in Visual Studio so that's I think it's
pretty sweet and obviously you can do
you know do more things with it so like
let's look at a list here I keep saying
farm so you see JavaScript and C sharp
lately will say my list equals XY and
we'll put some in sin there too okay now
if I want to I can just place a
breakpoint there and while this is
running I can now see that well it stops
the top products previous pre-plan on
the Y but um anyway we have my list
that's actually I don't know why it
stopped at the top there that's weird
but anyway my list you can look over
here you can see all the values that are
in here you can see how many elements
there are you could also just hover over
it you can see it all inside of there so
I think this is extremely helpful tool
guys in order to be able to write Python
and know a lot of you guys watching my
channel like Python development and I
really don't see why I would use atom
editor over Visual Studio code if these
if these
you know these tools exist I just kind
of liked the whole syntax I feel like it
it looks relatively clean and easy to
use so I'm just getting started in it
too so I can't really compare but I have
tried to deal with some of the atom
plugins and just haven't had a ton of
success and getting like the debuggers
working and all that stuff without a lot
of hassle but I really feel like this
particular tool works really well and at
least in regards to the Python language
plus you know the console the
familiarity as well you know I'm coming
from a visual studio environment so
there's that as well so I guess take my
advice with a grain of salt if I if you
really hate windows alright guys that's
it man have a good night let me know
what you think and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
