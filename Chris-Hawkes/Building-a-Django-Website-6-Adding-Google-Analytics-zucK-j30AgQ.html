Jenga website tutorial series anytime
you have a website in production you
want to be able to track what type of
traffic you're getting what countries
are they coming from what operating
systems are they using what type of
interaction are they doing on your site
and the best tool for that is Google
Analytics because it's free for a motive
for most small-time users basically
every small-time user is going to be a
free young Google Analytics so what you
want to be able to do is you need to set
up an account and login this one does
not have new music with it so these are
some other sites that I had owned in the
past and not really doing too much with
most of those or any of those really so
in order to create a new account for
Google Analytics go over here to your
admin and what we want to do is go down
to create new account and this will be
new music
just gonna change the timezone and all
that jump
all right and then you have to accept
their terms and conditions and it'll
give you this tracking script that you
need to add to your website so that
couldn't be any easier and where we want
to add that is to our base HTML page so
that way every page will have tracking
on it
and it just needs to go inside
your your head somewhere
and really I'd like to put it right
before the closing head tag that way
there's no slowdowns and loading your
HTML or JavaScript or anything like that
and then once that's in there I mean you
simply just have to upload your based on
HTML page when we go to our website now
you're gonna see that
you can now see that we have this script
it's a Google Analytics JavaScript
that's being linked and there's a lot of
code there don't try to understand that
but that's all Google's code to be able
to track and send updates to your Google
Analytics account and when you're there
you can see if I go back to home I'll
now have new music in the list and when
you just click on all website data its
gonna be 0 obviously because everything
started but I mean they have this
real-time feature where you can see that
I have a user on there from
Fredericksburg which is obviously me so
it's it's currently working just fine if
there was a new user popping up on your
website you would be able to see that
I'm just a quick over overview when you
go to audience just overview will give
you throughout the day how many visitors
you've had so that's pretty pretty good
an acquisition overview it'll tell you
how much are coming from social networks
from search engines stuff like that and
then finally in the behavior this is
where you can actually drill down and
figure out what pages of content are
they landing on so when you click on
site contact and content and click all
pages you can see nothing's being logged
right now but you'll be able to see like
ok band 1 is my most popular page or
something like that maybe that's a
Google Analytics in a nutshell I mean
it's a pretty complicated program you
can do a lot of sophisticated tracking
and setting goals and stuff like that so
it's probably good to try to get
acclimated with that I'm no expert in it
but I just know enough to be able to
figure out approximately what's going on
I mean up here also is one last tip is
like you can change it to just add a
last 7 days or whatever just to get a
more customized view of your traffic for
a particular time period alright so now
that Google Analytics is installed on
our machine let's go ahead and in this
tutorial series and the next one we're
going to go ahead and deal with jQuery
