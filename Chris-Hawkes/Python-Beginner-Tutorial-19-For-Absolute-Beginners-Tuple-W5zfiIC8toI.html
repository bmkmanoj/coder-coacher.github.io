actually look at a concept in Python
which is called the tuple and the tuple
is the exact same thing as a list and
that's the only way you need to view it
except for the fact that lists can be
changed so they can be added to and they
can be taken from and tuples cannot
tuples exist in Python because they take
up less memory because python doesn't
have to be worried about the values
changing once they're defined they are
called immutable and they never get
changed again so but it consumes less
resources that's why they exist and
that's the only reason why they exist
and let me give you an example we're
gonna say my fruits equals and tuples
are inside these curly braces and I can
say banana pear orange so with my fruits
I can loop over dang it ah shoot I can
loop over my fruits just like I did like
for fruit and my fruits print fruits I
could actually spell all right so I'm
looping through all this stuff and it's
gonna loop through every element inside
of here if I print and the type like
let's print and we've seen this before
this built-in type it gives us the kind
of type that fruits is so what is it is
it a string is it a numbers of the list
no it's a tuple tuples though they're
beneficial like I said because they take
up less resources the only problem is I
can't add to fruit once I define it it
has to create an entirely new tuple and
that's not very effective so if you feel
like the data is gonna change quite
often you would never use a tuple but if
you know that my fruits is always gonna
have three fruits and it's never gonna
change you might as well put it in a
tuple because it will be more performant
another thing about tuples that is nice
is that it can actually remove
duplicates using a built-in feature that
Python has so we're gonna say banana
pear orange apple and now watch what
happens if I say set which is a built in
keyword set and then we pass in my
fruits
and i'll say prince my fruits and i
don't want to print this loop here so
watch what happens here we have some
duplicates in here bananas to find twice
pears to find twice orange is to find
twice and when we run this we get this
tuple and it didn't actually work and
the reason why is because I need to
actually define a new I need to say my
fruits this is my my fruits equal set my
fruit so I'm actually redefining my
fruits and it's gonna create a new tuple
but it's going to remove the duplicates
now so watch what happens you can see
that it removed the duplicates I just
had to make sure the cassette actually
returns a new tuple another benefit is
that my fruits could actually be a list
and pretend we needed to have more
flexibility and I went ahead and I I'm
just gonna paste all this in here sorry
it needs to be surrounded by square
brackets and we know that my fruits is
now a list and let's just get rid of
this tuple up here now what happens if
we try to call set on my fruits and my
fruits is now listen is no longer a
tuple it still works so set actually
works with both a list and a tuple and
you're gonna see that use quite often
when when you run these things but
what's interesting though is set always
defines a tuple at all so you can pass
in a list or a tubule but it's going to
return a tuple which is sometimes not
what you want so let's go ahead and
print it tight and you can see if I do
this here twice
so that's really it guys that's all
there is with with tuples you're right
over get rid of get rid of so that's
really it guys that's all there is with
tuples and and the following videos
we're gonna get into some more
information hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding bootcamp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here and now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
