eight reasons to use nodejs and I could
have come up with ten or five but I
decided to go with eight because it's
really just stayed off the top of my
head without me having to do a bunch of
research and I've created some nodejs
frameworks and and I've worked with the
frameworks with many of them out there
like Express and and I've also hosted a
few nodejs websites so anyway I'm just
gonna go over the pros because people
have asked me like you know how do you
choose between node and Python and this
isn't really a comparison directly
between dota and Python but I'm just
gonna go ahead and list some of the
reasons why I would use no and why I
think it's a good choice alright so
number one it's really fast and when I
say that it means it's non-blocking so
what is non-blocking file reading and
writing is one of the things that
servers need to do really well and
that's something that no js' does just
about as well as anybody out there so it
when it comes to like being able to read
from a file system or a database and
then you know send that data back you're
not going to find a better technology
out there that does that so the chrome
I'm sorry the the chrome v8 JavaScript
engine was what doe jeaious was built
from and it's extremely fast if you look
at the core code that actually makes a
makes up the node.js framework you
actually look and you're looking at you
know more see a very low-level code
compared to a language like JavaScript
alright so it's used by many modern
companies so a lot of major companies
are using it but just to name a few you
have LinkedIn Walmart that's entire web
stack is built on node then PayPal uber
and Netflix so those are all major
companies that are scaling No - you know
astronomical proportions compared to
your your typical you know
run-of-the-mill website creator so one
language for the front end and the back
end so this might be the number one
reason why you would want to use node is
that you're going to be forced to write
JavaScript for your client side and
you're going to be probably using one of
the modern JavaScript libraries like you
know react or angular or ember or any of
the millions that it seems like we have
out there so that means you're gonna be
writing javascript already it's so much
easier not to have to write Python on
the backend or Java
c-sharp and then having to switch over
to JavaScript on the front end you can
write JavaScript because JavaScript is
how you interact with the you know in
JavaScript is the language that you you
is to actually write your no js' website
so even though you know Jaz we look at
it it's a technology it's the chrome v8
engine it's written in c javascript is
what you actually write so being able to
write javascript on both the front end
and the back end it goes a long way
especially when you know it really goes
hand-in-hand with use a react angular
and ember and all the other frameworks
out there so it's cross-platform and
this is a huge deal because if you're
going to run a node.js application
you're gonna have probably some people
that might need to run it on an ojs or
I'm sorry on a Linux web server or it
could be a Windows web server or even
you know running it on a Mac so the fact
that no J's can install in all those
machines whether you're running Linux or
Windows or Mac and you're going to be
able to run the application so you have
Microsoft and c-sharp you know moving
with they're not there dotnet core over
to a Linux based system so it works on
Linux because that was always a major
disadvantage for Microsoft and c-sharp
was that it didn't run on Linux and you
know nodejs doesn't have that problem
so it's a major major benefit so it has
a very active development community in
fact one of the most active development
communities out there if you look at the
amount of questions that have been asked
on not just JavaScript but also on no
js' it actually it definitely it
competes out there with with Python Ruby
c-sharp and Java so anybody that says
that that nodejs isn't an enterprise
language or enterprise technology at
this point is probably full of it it's
not new and hip so what do I mean by
that it's no longer a fad there's so
many fads that come and go in the
technology world like we don't know
where technology's headed any any given
month or a year we don't really know we
can't see that but the argument for a
long time was that nodejs was like you
know it wasn't going to be this this
all-encompassing thing that everybody
jumps on that was going to replace
Python and Ruby it's done that to some
extent but it's not going to completely
replace those technologies however I
think it's safe to say that no js' isn't
some sort of up-and-coming thing anymore
it's it's already it's km it's been it's
he
it's not going anywhere so the fact that
it's not new and hip is actually a good
thing so note is not a bloated framework
so what does that mean it means that it
does not come with the bells and
whistles of a full stack framework you
can't compare an ode to Python Django or
Python flask or Ruby on Rails it's
nothing like that it's it's a it's a web
server technology that you can then use
a bunch of different frameworks that
exist for nodejs
like Express or sales but the fact is is
that you don't if you don't need that
stuff and you just want a bare-bones
Web API like a lot of people tell you
that the go language and go lang is very
good at that and I'm sure it is but so
is no js' and nodejs has been around a
little bit longer and has a larger
community so you know depending on how
slim you need your server-side api to be
node can be as slim as you need it to be
it can be it's very very there's not
much to it really so you as you start
tacking on additional features like
templating and things like that that's
when things get a little bit more
bloated and slowed down but you know
note is it's a very bare-bones thing
that you get if you're gonna be building
just a web server from it so the future
is lean and what do I mean by that is
that JavaScript you know we've seen a
lot of confusion in the industry about
which frameworks and things like that
you should be using but the fact that
matter is one thing that is clear is
that we don't want bloated full stack
frame works because bloated full stack
frameworks are slow and they don't
they're not built with the modern-day
client-side library like react or
angular in mind and the thing is is that
you need your server to be lean and
efficient it needs to be serving JSON
data so that these newer client-side
libraries can then take it and build
your UI from it JavaScript now on the
front is handling routing and everything
else so really you need a lean mean
server-side setup and nodejs is probably
the best option out there if I compare
it to some of these other languages that
have been around the block for quite
some time if I compare like I would
choose nodejs over Python Python tornado
even though Python tornado is very good
that the documentation just isn't there
the community just isn't there Ruby on
Rails is way too bloated compared to
a server-side language server-side you
know stacked you can get set up with no
js' you know you're not gonna be able to
compare the speed between the two nodejs
is just gonna be much faster so the
future of web development I think rests
more with nodejs and it does with any of
the other older technologies that I just
mentioned but those are my top eight
reasons why you would want to use
node.js for your next project alright
guys let me know what you think make
sure you subscribe take care hey guys so
I just want to take a moment to give a
shout out to my sponsor dev mountain
coding boot camp make sure you guys
check out their website we've talked a
lot about whether or not the college
degree is worthwhile and people have
asked me that and you probably shouldn't
even be asking me that because I don't
know that anybody has the answer to that
but I can tell you that with the
technologies that are being taught in
school and typically you know for
$100,000 four-year universities you know
people are finding as they come out that
they're not really you know ready for
the IT world and that they're actually
learning a lot more from within the the
workforce and that's probably the case
with a lot of things but with IT it's
even more so because technology changes
so fast so with coding boot camps like
dev Mountains they teach you
technologies that you're gonna use right
away in the job force and the idea is to
get you into the industry as soon as
possible they're gonna use stuff that's
like that is being used everywhere even
things like jQuery where you might be
hearing you know a ton about this or
that or I mean they're gonna be teaching
a lot of this and that that is you know
of right now but also a lot of what is
being used in the workforce so they're
their entire goal is to get you into the
workforce as soon as you complete the
program so make sure you check out the
description links that I provide in
there for dev Mountain for all my videos
they have the links in the description
alright guys thanks for watching and
please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
