going to be talking about one of the
reasons why react and it's taught entire
like purpose and premise and everything
is failing to reach the potential that
at least I had envisioned you know that
it was trying to solve when it was you
know being released and touted as the
next best thing so react is all about
web components and web components the
reason why you want to use them is
because they should be completely
modular so you can take one component
and plug it into another app very
similar to like you know architectures
that go back to I'm a big fan of django
django you build apps and you could have
projects that have that consists of
different apps and you should try to
define those apps so that they're
plug-and-play that an app that works in
one project should be just be able to
work in another project if you build it
in enough and an encapsulated isolated
you know way now it's very easy to
integrate error to design it in a way
that it becomes reliant upon the actual
project so that when you try to plug it
in another project it doesn't work
because there are now dependencies that
you know maybe it might be dependencies
on an API that are specific to one
project and not another it could be your
third party tools that maybe it's using
that and then other projects not using
there's all kinds of different things
that could end up creating on that type
of a problem and it's very difficult to
truly build encapsulated modular
projects that can just literally
plug-and-play one of the my favorite
projects that goes back to like you know
photo viewers and like light boxes that
I've used on a lot of websites some
years ago is Magnifico pup so this is a
jQuery plug-in and you can see that you
know it's really pretty and everything
so this jQuery plug-in is essentially
drag-and-drop now it has its own
JavaScript file that you need it has
dependencies on the jQuery Apple jQuery
library and then you have to run some
execution code so you have to run you
know script and fire up whatever sort of
modal and then you know there's some
objects that you can set to change its
functionality and it just works like so
but the problem people had was that
they're like what
now I have to download you know this
javascript file and I have to make sure
I have jQuery in there and then I have
to run execution code wouldn't it be
better if I just had a module that I
could just you know drop right into the
application so Reax entire you know
mindset it seemed to me was that you can
build modular components that are just
literally going to be able to drop into
your application but where things never
seem to work out that way is that you
have plenty of projects out there there
that people are going where they're
building some react specific
functionality whether it's like
validation or paging or something like
that and they build it in a very generic
way so that other people can then
introduce that into their their code and
then they can override certain features
and things like that but from what I've
seen in the wild though it seems like so
many so many people so many
implementations of react are building it
in a way just like you know with the
Django apps and things like that work
literally these components cannot just
be dragged into another project these
components have a very very complicated
parental hierarchy of all kinds of you
know props and on change phones
functions and onblur functions and all
kinds of different functions that are
passed down through a parent-child
relationship you know and see ancestors
going all the way up to like you know
grand grandparents and then even further
beyond that so you I've seen a lot of
these components that are that are that
are built that way so you literally
can't take the component and then just
you know drag it into a side project to
run it and kind of see how it operates
because instead you end up having this
very very complicated hierarchy where
you have a component that relies upon
essentially half of your JavaScript
project and and then on top of that
relies upon a very sophisticated API
that you know the API needs to be up and
running or you need to have a mock API
so you basically have a situation where
these these plugins are these components
don't work and the entire premise of
behind react was that we were going to
have truly modular component based
systems and we don't so the shadow Dom
is something that
has was talked about a lot we're like
one of the problems with jQuery is some
of those plugins required CSS files and
they require other JavaScript files and
in this whole shadow Dom thing is that
you can embed your CSS and everything
within the component itself now react
you can do the same thing but once again
in most real-world applications you end
up building something so complex and so
unique to your own project that the code
reuse from these Mundy's components is
not nearly as much as as you would like
so that's one of the problems I see
because the in a perfect world all of
these components that were using are
being built in the wild by all these
different companies like like what we
saw with the jQuery plugins where you
had a lot of very talented people
building plugins and some of the plugins
were though I mean there was
definitely some headaches with with some
of the plugins out there but the react
world it you know it's it's I would say
it's you know that it has the potential
to do the same thing but I haven't
necessarily have not seen it so far what
I've seen mostly is that some people are
using certain components that are
written out therefore react and they're
having to either you know customize a
ton of its behavior or there then you
know maybe extending it to the point
where it doesn't you know resemble you
know what you have and you certainly
like in a lot of cases as far as I can
tell I haven't seen the jQuery type
plugins like those photo viewers and
react that that just work you know very
easily so that is one of the problems
and so then you know with with react and
why everybody jumped on it was because
they were like well reacts been doing it
since 2011 with Facebook so clearly they
have this right and and for the most
part they have you know one of the only
real implementations of a web component
based world and everybody kind of
envisions the web heading towards
including Google who during its you know
I think it was a google talk back in
like 2014-2015 might be 2015 this point
they were talking about polymer and
Google polymer is not a project that has
really taken off but it's a it's a
project that was using the shadow DOM
and it was
all about these components that all of
its dependencies are just all contained
within the component itself but once
again you suffer from the same thing
where it's it's hard to build a
component in a way that is just gonna
work for everybody's needs and and most
real-world situations like when you have
a bunch of components like you talk
about presentational versus staple
components within react so what that
means is that the state is the one that
maintains the calls to the AP is and
things like that and then the functional
components that don't need to have like
D and the specific functions that react
comes with like on component amount and
things like that that you don't need to
have if you don't need all that that
boilerplate or that excess code then you
can just have functional components
instead which are really just functions
that return JSX code so a lot of people
are building reusable components in that
sense so projects will have all kinds of
different functional components but the
problem with those functional components
is that they don't necessarily just work
with just any any old particular project
like most most code that you're writing
for any sort of whatever sort of thing
that you're working on is most likely
going to have enough now a difference is
that it's just not going to be able to
have some sort of dragonss or a perfect
world type scenario that I think
Facebook and Google and all these other
companies have been trying to solve and
instead we have a very you know
complicated component hierarchy where
components are relying upon more
dependencies and they were even back in
the days of jQuery and its plugins and
things like that so I don't necessarily
think that we've solved any major
problem yet the problem that we were
initially set out to solve when we were
coming up with these needs libraries to
do some of the things that you know that
they they're touted for being able to do
and you know angular also comes to mind
as far as projects and why these
projects can spin out of control with
complexity some of them is for some very
smart developers we go back a couple
years they would always in
was a lot of argument and a lot of
discussion going on with angular 1 which
was very highly adopted where it said
you know what the angular is great when
things you know are very you know to do
like to do list type apps but as soon as
you start really getting into some
complex functionality which is pretty
much every major enterprise application
out there angular starts to fall apart
like there there's so many angular
specific keywords and and and
terminology and just ways of doing
things the angular way that you end up
fighting the framework you realize you
get some sort of you know some weird
event bubbling or errors that are occur
like way down it within the stack
angular stack and and the same thing
happens with all these other libraries
as well but that was a major concern
even back then where I was like well as
soon as things get really complex
angular one starts to fall apart now
some people probably will disagree but
the fact that matter is we want to have
tools that allow us to work very easily
we don't need to have you know PhDs
having to write all of our systems
because they only want to understand
angularjs or anything like that so I
would argue from a business perspective
that we need tools that are easier to
work with and in some cases we're not
getting those we're getting things that
are much much more difficult to tie
together one of the problems as well
with these these modular components
especially with you know very complex
like I said parent-child relationships
going all the way up to their
grandchildren or even beyond that our
grandparents and beyond that is that you
have a lot of functionality that exists
and that really depends on a working API
so one of the most important things with
any sort of modern-day JavaScript app
you know development that a lot of
people fail to really implement well is
is is creating a mock API like your
entire your entire your your entire data
model should be mocked from from day one
and every piece of functionality you add
should have a corresponding mock API
that's easy to work with because the
last thing you need is to have an entire
you know a very complex parent a very
complex hierarchy of dependencies upon
an API that said that's working in order
for
everything to work because you know
obviously with JavaScript if you get a
certain piece of data that's not coming
down correctly or you have you know
functions that are strings or yeah then
you get you some some sort of there are
some problems like that of course we
have a react prompt types to prevent
some of that stuff but you can't you can
even override those but you can have
some some major issues and some
dependencies on api's and things to be
working in order for the application
that work and once again as far as I can
tell is so as soon as tools get really
really complex there is no real ability
to be able to just take a component and
then plug it into a separate project and
then have it work the exact same way
I've seen components that rely upon this
component and they rely upon this helper
and this this and this and this and this
and this and it's all being imported all
over the place I'm using the new
JavaScript es6 and built together my web
packs to the point where it's like damn
I need to bring down half the project
plus half the Internet via NPM to make
sure that this this damn thing works so
that is to me some of the problems with
taking tools like babel and then you
know splitting them up into all these
different babel promises and babel es7
features and yes six features to try to
limit the overall babel file size you're
now creating all these dependencies that
if you have code especially within some
of these functional components are these
stateful components that then rely upon
some of those imports you know from
third-party npm modules that also then
rely upon a million other things you're
creating a system that it's just a
complete clusterfuck I mean that's the
best way to describe it because we need
to be independent of all this stuff and
then to me I'd rather have I'd rather
download more than I need then to have
to download a ton of different
dependencies but that's kind of the
direction that everybody's going in
these days we're we're just we're we're
not yet we're getting the bare minimum
like you look at react and they spun off
to react Dom and all that stuff and I
can understand why they're doing that
but I don't know that like I don't know
that it makes things any easy
for what developers are really don't so
that is just one piece of I think the
complexity of modern-day web
applications and that isn't really
talked about when I say web development
is hard it has nothing to do with the
individual you know the individual code
files or how an arrow function works or
how the spread operator works I'm not
talking about that kind of stuff because
if if somebody thinks that that's the
only thing that that is the complexity
within web development they clearly
don't have enough experience in the real
world to know what it what it is and I'm
talking about when you're talking about
massive applications with massive
dependencies and and then having to run
it you know via all these different dev
tools that become absolutely imperative
to have running for you because
otherwise you're basically flying blind
and yeah so clearly if somebody thinks
that I'm just simply talking about some
of the fundamentals of the programming
language or library then then they're
completely misinterpreting what I'm
talking about but either way like I
would say I'm you know I'm not even
being negative or down or anything I'm
just simply saying that there was work
yet to be done I mean there is work to
be done on making things a little bit
easier to do I know of a manager that
they used to be a manager back in the
days of Perl you know he would tell me
the story about you know how like in
Perl you could write things in so many
different you could write things in
crazy-ass way it's just like JavaScript
where you could literally minify and put
everything on one line so that nobody
knows what the hell is going on and some
people did that for job security because
it made them look smarter than other
people and and in many cases like you
know it becomes a write only language
where you write it nobody knows what the
hell's going on with the code including
the person that wrote it you know given
enough time and and he would he would
fire people for doing that actually if
they did that you know more than it was
a couple of basically I think gave him
like one chance he was saying and then
he would fire people for doing that kind
of stuff because when you're working on
a team you want things to be as clear
and and as clear as possible and I've
always been a
opponent for verbosity over magic over
minified craziness you know I'd like I
would like every developer to have the
opportunity to understand what it is
that's going on with their code as
quickly as possible so in some ways you
could be like well it's you know it's
it's this minified thing above all they
should be able to figure it out well you
know in a perfect world they'd probably
show it maybe but if it's costing the
company money because somebody didn't
want to just you know spell something
out a little bit better than I think
that that's a problem but all right guys
that that's really it this videos
dragging on a bit so I'm gonna let you
guys go you guys take care and have a
good day bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
