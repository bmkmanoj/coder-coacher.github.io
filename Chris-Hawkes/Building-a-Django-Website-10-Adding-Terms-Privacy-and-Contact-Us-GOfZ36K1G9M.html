hey guys what's up so in this video and
we're gonna go ahead and make this it's
probably a little bit shorter than some
of the other ones but we need to have
some basic stuff that every website
should have and that is like a contact
us a Terms of Use in a privacy policy so
we're gonna go ahead and add that now
and I'm gonna provide some links to a
couple of websites that you should hit
up like there's this Terms of Service
website you can get a free Terms of
Service made and then there's a privacy
policy maker website which will do a
good job building a privacy policy for
you and based on your type of business
where you were actually running your
business or website you have to answer
the questions appropriately and it it
spits out all the you know legal
mumbo-jumbo that every website should
have you know as far as like you know
just typical legal protections for you
as a website owner and stuff like that
so it's good to you know kind of pour
over that it's a really important part
of any sort of website development that
you may be doing as a business and
website owner alright so a few things
here let's go ahead and we're gonna go
ahead and add the URLs so that they can
actually get to the privacy policy okay
so we're going to name this one
I'm actually just gonna name it I see
privacy I think yeah that's all I'm
gonna do and then we want to point to
our views dot privacy okay so we've done
that let's add a few more to hell this
one's gonna be contact for contact us
and then the last one is going to be
terms for terms of use and now that
we've done that let's go over to our
views and we'll add the definitions for
those three items so we have privacy
terms
and contact and now we have to go to our
templates here
and this is simply going to reside right
in our main templates page
I'm sure I'll even need to do all that I
can just say you should add a text file
actually make it privacy not HTML
terms HTML and then was it contact on
HTML alright so we've done all that and
just like with the index actually the
index we don't inherit from anything but
just like band will be inherit from our
master page we want to go ahead and do
that so I'm going to copy this now
so the title it'll be just simply new
music contact us and then here we'll say
h1 contact us and here we'll add more to
that later but for right now there's
gonna be specific to whatever company or
website you're using and let's copy this
as well do privacy policy okay and then
Terms of Use Terms of Use Terms of Use
and obviously down here you're gonna
want to paste in whatever HTML is given
to you by those services that I linked
to or if you want to use some other term
abuse or privacy policy that's
completely up to you I wouldn't really
be the one to advise you any any sort of
legal it can give you any legal advice
or anything on that matter so now that
we've done that let's go ahead and
upload everything to our server
and we should now be able to go to lay
contact and privacy and in terms or I
spell the right shoot terms okay
and now that we have those pages even
though there's really no content there
we want to go ahead and add those to the
base at HTML because those should be on
every single page and if you remember we
have our footer content down here and
the footer content can vary sometimes
but this is essentially always going to
be the same this list down here okay so
we'll say terms of use I'm gonna copy
this entire line will start with contact
it just seems it just seems appropriate
for some reason to have contact us first
and then we'll have our privacy policy
all right and now let's go ahead and
update our main dot CSS so that we can
account for the footer UL we may not
even need the UL here but we definitely
want the UL li to be display inline so
it's not display inline and we'll have a
margin right of 20 pixels really might
even want more than a day like 50 pixels
I guess I want this to be width:auto and
then margin:0 auto I'm hoping that will
Center it I'm not 100% sure I don't
remember a lot of this stuff it takes
tinkering with dot footer ula this is
our anchor tag that we're gonna be
styling I want text decoration to be a
nun
and then the color and we'll just make
it blue for right now I guess and I want
to change the hover state of this to
actually be text-decoration:underline
so let's go ahead not date that now
all right start a little margin of zero
Otto didn't seem to work let me see what
I got to do and it's because this width
is a hundred percent so let me think so
what we want to do actually is update
our CSS so they can be text-align:center
so we can get rid of this with the UL is
naturally a hundred percent in width so
the margin:0 auto doesn't do anything so
we can just say text-align:center now
another thing that we do want to do with
our footer is we want to give it a
position of relative and let's go and
get rid of this black background which
looks awful and with the position of our
UL we're going to position this thing
absolute
and then give it a bottom position of
like 10 pixels so what this does is it
basically says I'm on the footer I'm
always replaced 10 pixels from the
bottom so let's see how that works out
so now though because of the position of
absolute it actually took away my
hundred percent which so that sucks so
if I just said zero Auto still not gonna
work once I suppose I have to give it
width of 100 percent maybe and I would
probably do it so if I give it a width
of 100% now since its position absolute
and I kind of want to do that because
that way I can assure myself no matter
what footer content is there that this
joker is always gonna be on the bottom
10 pixels problem from the bottom so I
think it's it's alright to have a little
bit extra CSS here to make this thing
happen
alright let's go ahead an upload that
and take a look here alright so we ever
we have our common elements now that
connect to contact us Terms of Use
privacy policy all that stuff is now at
the bottom obviously there's not much
going on in this website yet but what we
want to do is we want to go ahead and
copy in that Terms of Use and the
privacy policy to those pages and update
that all right so I've now copied
everything in here from the privacy
policy generator that I had before
now Terms of Use is also in there so we
have all this you know like I said legal
stuff that can't really advise you on
it's a case-by-case basis and it depends
on what type of site that you have and
who it's catered towards which state
it's and stuff like that so we have this
terms of years now and then there's
simple contact us so I've updated that
just some very simple stuff for right
now and we'll probably try to expand on
that a little bit more later but every
website needs this this basic
information and one of the things I'm
gonna do is I do have a copyright
statement at the bottom of the page as
well so it's like an additional thing
that a lot of people don't do it's not
really necessary to actually have that
but you can if you if you want but just
so you guys are completely aware of
of what I'm working on everything on the
site I do plan on Who I am adding that
in fact I'll do it now so you guys
aren't surprised by anything that is in
this website until it's finished
all right so um the copyright statement
it's really up to up to you if you want
to do that but if you want you can just
some hit up my site here and copy
something similar to that if you feel
like it suits your needs
and we're almost done with this you know
add my in block down here okay
and then also for our base page we need
to add that new new link down here
all right so it's growing update this
stuff now
all right so we have the fourth notice
now the copyright oh and our URLs is not
updated okay we gonna go back there and
update that URLs and views file so now
we have the copyright infringement
notice all right guys so um this video
was a little bit longer than I
originally thought but there's a very
important process a very important step
in any sort of website creation that
especially if you're building from
scratch II do have some of the basic
elements that you need like the typical
footer links that every website should
have so please please subscribe please
vote on my video if you would if you
have any questions or anything just ask
that in the discussion below or feel
free to email me and I appreciate you
guys watching thank you
