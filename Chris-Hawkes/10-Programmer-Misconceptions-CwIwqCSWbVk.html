talking about 10 programmer
misconceptions that means what people
think about being a programmer versus
what it actually is like you'd be
surprised how often people view my job
in just ways that just isn't you know
isn't reality so anyway let's go ahead
and get into this list number 10 is a
programming requires a ton of math
that's like the most common
misconception is that everybody seems to
think they're like we're the ADIZ nerds
that wear these thick glasses and then
we know how to do all this advanced math
and shit but little do they know those
math problems have been solved back in
like the 50s and 60s and 70s and we're
using theories and things like that that
we're also invented from around the same
time and sometimes like you still have
theoretical computer scientists and
things that can have they come up with
different algorithms and things like
that but for the most part you know
we're not dealing with that stuff day to
day like whether it's cryptography or
something like that there's just there's
way more specialized smart people that
have been involved in that kind of stuff
that are it's been a lifetime and those
fields that date back decades so no
we're not sitting there crunching a
bunch of complex numbers now if you're a
game developer you're gonna have to deal
with a lot more you know algebra like
and probably calculus things like that
but for the most part like web
development
definitely not like definitely not and I
was gonna say I rarely even do a high
school level math and I've been in the
industry for now for quite some time so
every once a while deal with some some
complex math or something that will make
me think or scratch my head but it's
rare so you have to be really smart so
in addition to not being like a
mathematician you don't even have to
necessarily be a brainiac now I think
that there's a certain level of
smartness that it does take for a
programmer to be successful and like I
don't think you can be a complete
fucking idiot and like you know be a
good programmer you could probably still
like manage to get stuff done but like
before like at least from my perspective
it seems like like if I work in
construction or delivering pizzas versus
working in the IT field with a bunch of
computer scientists the computer
scientists tend to just be smarter
people they tend to
be better off financially obviously and
and not just because they make more just
because they make more sound decisions
like you know they they have a lot of
you basically you have intellectual
conversations and they flow much more
freely I think and certain you know
certain professions versus others and I
think computer science definitely has a
lot of smart people in it so you have to
have a degree to code well that's not
true a lot of programmers don't have a
degree some of the best successful most
successful people in IT actually dropped
out of college Larry Ellison Mark
Zuckerberg Bill Gates Steve Jobs I
always guys didn't finish but so you
don't have to have a degree to code nor
do you have to have a degree to be
successful in coding as like a business
owner or venture capitalist so no you
don't need that you can learn the code
in three months out you know boot camps
and things like that like the boot camp
that's sponsoring this video that that
is a highly specialized course to get
newbies in like at the ground level but
there's many people on the internet that
will actually tell you that they learn
how to code Python in three months and
this and that and other things they're
all full of shit like if you've only
been coding for three months you're
still a complete noob and that's just
that's just like it's it's just
laughable like as soon as you become a
senior you'll you'll know that how funny
it is if you if you thought you know how
to code up for three months I have to
read books to code now there's another
thing like a lot of people tell me what
books so I have to read and then they'll
try to like memorize like syntax page by
page so they're like spending more cut
like more time looking at the syntax
than like what the syntax is solving and
that was something that actually threw
me off I think quite a bit when I was
getting started like I would flip
through Perl books and I'd be like Ollie
and this is how you iterate in an array
and Perl or something like that
and I think that I grasped it until I'd
have to go and actually create an array
and iterate it for the you know for the
first time or even the fifth or the 20th
time that I was doing it and I'm like I
don't remember how to do that you know
so it's like you're not gonna grasp
things by looking at a book and trying
to like memorize it and stuff like that
the best way to do that is by simply
building stuff and
continuing to solve problems that you're
interested in solving so hey you like
music or something build some sort of
Python scraper that is going to go to a
website and grab that music for you
download it and put it into a folder you
know do something like that and that's
gonna teach you valuable lessons in
programming so programming is boring
this is kind of the same shit it's like
people that you know like you solve
problems that you're interested in
solving but you have to have interests
and almost every interest in the world
actually applies to IT like if you look
at Amazon they're buying up all kinds of
other stuff now they're getting into
health insurance they're getting in the
grocery stores like they're gonna get
into health care eventually the IT is
integrated into every facet of society
so it's like if there's something that
is of interest in society like
programming applies to that in one way
shape or form so you know find something
that you're interested in and it's not
gonna be boring you have to be a male
now this is something that you know is
being talked about a lot now with with
like gender equality and things like
that so typically this has been a
male-dominated industry it still is a
male-dominated industry probably 80 to
85 percent of all developers I've ever
seen her male but that is changing and
it's changing quite quite a bit so we're
seeing a lot more women go into the stem
field and they're also entering the
workforce I've seen it firsthand so I
think that that you know that is a
definite misconception like vir if
you're a girl definitely watch my
channel subscribe and become a
programmer you can't hang with other
programmers this is like one of my
favorite ones because like when I was
learning to be a programmer and I first
finally got that opportunity I thought I
was gonna be like with these
world-beating like developers that would
just make me look terrible and I just
wouldn't be able to hang or know what I
was doing I mean the funniest thing that
I found was that like there's so many
there's so many people out there that
like know less than what you know and
like they might get paid a lot more than
what you get paid and like essentially
we're all full of shit like that we're
gonna be asked to do things that we
don't know we're not comfortable with
and like everybody gets taxed without
whether you're a junior developer - a
senior developer like it's just how it
is
the next misconception is that you have
to work crazy hours now a lot of
programming
jobs like you were programming companies
they will overwork their employees but a
lot of places don't so I would say most
places don't because employees aren't
going to be putting up with that if
you're in a highly competitive field
that you're looking at work from home
like high salaries free food perks nice
offices like Fridays from home like
four-day work weeks there's all kinds of
different things that they're doing to
make to compete against each other for
the top-level talent so you know the
age-old argument that you're you know
you're burning the midnight oil all the
time as a programmer that does
definitely apply in the IT field but
it's not like it's like that every
single week or anything like that
because nobody would put up with that
we're all highly paid professionals and
like I said IT is in every facet of
society so we could just go to some
other you know competitor and things
like that and employees and employers
know that so it's definitely a lucrative
and good field to be in because of all
that competition and then the final one
is it's all about ones and zeros like
it's so funny how like I will meet
somebody tell them I'm a programmer and
they think all if you're just writing
these ones and zeros all day long it's
like my god like I would shoot myself in
the head with an ar-15 like if that were
the case okay I would but no nobody's
writing ones and zeros we're so far
removed from that you're writing you
know print and and you're using Python
or PHP but there's all these
higher-level languages where you're
using much more human readable syntax
it's not ones and zeroes it's not even
byte code all right guys that's all I
got thanks for watching have a good day
bye so this video was brought to you by
Deb mountain coding boot camp there are
eight boot camp that is based out of
Utah but they're also in Texas in
Arizona now and they have very good
reviews so make sure you guys check them
out the link is in the description tab
below they offer courses in web
development iOS development UX or user
experience design Quality Assurance and
just a few other ones in fact they're
even getting into Salesforce as well now
so they're continuing to adapt their
courses based on what the market needs
are and major companies are hiring some
of their alumni so make sure you guys
give them a look they have great reviews
and thanks for watching
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
