this video what we want to talk about is
functions and this is one of the most
important concepts that we've come along
so far I would say this and lists or
something that are two of the most
common things you're going to see in
Python functions allow you to identify
set as sections and blocks of code to
separate it out from the rest of your
script everything we've written so far
is all in one Python file and all of it
just gets executed just line by line
left to right top to bottom and it just
goes and a lot of times you do not want
your code to do that you don't have a
code that's just completely sequential
or you know vertically stacked and it
just runs that way so you need to break
it into separate sections you can do
separate files or you could do functions
within your file so we're going to look
at functions and what we do in order to
create a function and this is also
referred to as a method so in other
languages it's it's kind of once again
this is kind of one of these the
difference between a method and a
function even though you kind of use it
you hear the muezzin or changeably
sometimes but methods are typically
referred to as functions that are
attached to objects through classes so
python is an object-oriented you can
define classes will see that in future
videos and in inside of those classes
they have methods which are basically
functions but we call them methods
because they're attached to classes at
least that's my understanding and you
will hear them use interchangeably
though even in their own context but I
don't think it really matters because
they're essentially the same thing so
let's look at a function in Python and
we're going to say my add function okay
and then after the function we're going
to then do the colon and then anything
inside of here is the actual function
now one of the things I want to do first
is I want to just say pass and passes a
new keyword that just says hey if this
function is called just return and
that's that's really we could actually
just say continue as well continue is
another keyword but you know what for
right now we're just going to say pass
and this just means just move on what's
interesting about pass is like literally
nothing happens it's not ignored
like if you if you were to use the
comments we've seen in the past if we
made a comment we can do that and that
Python just ignores that altogether
because it's a comment pass is not
ignored it's still executed but doesn't
do anything and the reason why I'm
showing you guys here is because you
might see the passkey or even that you
probably like use it very often all
right so let's say this is a my add
function and I could say print hello
world down here I keep doing semicolons
because I'm used to other languages and
what I want to do is I'm gonna put a
breakpoint at both of these statements
at the pass and also at the print now
what's going to end up happening when we
run our code even though this is above
this print statement this is not going
to be executed because let's say it's a
function and we did not call the
function so let me show you so we'll hit
the breakpoint at the print statement
and you can see this was never called
even though it's on top so all the
programs we've written to date like I
said start from the top to the bottom
reading left to right like a book and at
least a book in the United States I
believe Japan or something they read the
other way I'm not sure I heard that
somewhere it's probably wrong but anyway
maybe when you guys can comment on that
so here is a let's go ahead and call the
function now so after this we're going
to actually say how do we call the
function all we have to do is type out
the function name and then do open and
close parentheses so the same way that
we're like print is a built-in function
with the same thing the parentheses and
we pass in data to it which is called
the argument this method that was our
function that we created once again I'm
using interchangeably has no data passed
in you can see there's there's nothing
passed in it's just going to return but
since we called it this code will now be
executed so let's see at what point does
it get executed so we run the code first
is this gets executed once again that
would make sense and then when we go
here you can see this output it to the
screen now we're calling this and now
the function gets called and we get our
pass statement and we return so that's
pretty sweet
now let's have something get done and
our function and we called it my add
function so let's go ahead and add
something and we could say for plus
for and I can you know I can say print
four plus four so now when we call this
you're going to see in our debug console
it prints out the value of four plus
four now that's not very helpful because
obviously I wouldn't need a function
just to print four plus four but what if
I simply said you know what first number
second number and I said print
four first number plus second number all
right now when we call this watch what
happens we get an actual error because
it said we're missing two required
positional arguments why is it required
because look we are referencing
arguments that are supposed to be passed
in but our function did not pass in any
values and we're trying to do it a
simple addition here so let's go ahead
and actually pass in two numbers so five
and five and the two arguments that
we're passing in need to be separated by
commas so now when we run this our print
statement in fact I can even put
actually I got execute already but I'll
put a breakpoint here you can see first
number is five that we passed in second
number is also five so it prints out 10
to the console down here now
one of the interesting things is that I
believe we could just pass in two
strings Python is a dynamically
interpreted language so I could say
Chris and then hogs and it actually
prints out Chris Hawkes now there's no
space there if I wanted a space I could
put one here I could put one there but
if I do this that prints out Chris
Hawkes as well so if you've ever come
from any different languages like a
strongly typed language like C++ or C
sharp this is going to blow your mind
because you're going to be like oh damn
this is the dynamic nature of Python
that I can have an add function and
since addition Plus string concatenation
which means combining two different
strings has the same plus operator even
though they do separate things a
different context if it's a number it
will add
as in the mathematical ad and if it's a
string it will actually concatenate two
strings together so that could throw you
through a loop and that actually brings
in the last video that we talked about
with comments where it's like you this
would be a good opportunity to say this
function adds two numbers and that way
somebody knows hey this is meant to be
used to add two numbers so don't put
don't put in strings add two numbers so
we'll do this five and two and now we'll
get seven so now we have we have much
more flexibility with our function here
we we can now pass in any two that we
want so that could be my add function we
could actually we could actually copy
this entire function here and put this
down here and we could say my multiply
function this could be like this and
we'll call them my multiplying out my
multiplier so it's going to be 5 times 2
which is 10 and you can see it does that
now you can even make it even more
dynamic by passing in a third argument
that just says we'll say my smart
function and then we're going to say
this is going to be math math operation
so I didn't give this any thought
whatsoever but we could then do an if
statement inside of our function and say
if math operation equals add we could
say print 9 say print first number plus
second number
alright then once again we could also
use from the past videos LF and we can
say if L if math operation equals
multiply and then we'll just print the
same statement down here except we need
to then change the actual operation to a
multiplication you can do this for
division subtraction all this other
stuff so you could have literally one
operation now this probably wouldn't be
a good practice but this is just an
example of making a function a little
bit more smart or dynamic or reusable
however there is a border there's a
point in programming where you if you
try to compact too much code into one
thing you try to make something too
magical you can then run into you could
run into problems so there's this fine
balance between hey maybe I should
separate these out into separate
mathematical operations and then other
people say you know what I think it
should just be one function and it
should all just be combined together and
that way let's get rid of this and we're
going to get rid of we're gonna get rid
of these two and now if I said add and
I'll put a break on the if statement so
now this gets run wait sorry we got to
change the name that's another name
error because this doesn't exist when
you say my smart function alright now we
run it alright so here we get to the
though you can see math operations add
so it says if add obviously we're adding
so now my smart function just did an ADD
but if we wanted to say multiply we pass
in that argument now another thing to
keep in mind is that obviously this
parameter and these are called
parameters by the way function
parameters this first parameter is
expected to be a number this is expected
to be a number and this is expected to
be a string if you pass a number here
you would break your code this is
another dynamic nature of Python where
it doesn't catch these types of things
in compilation but once they run
you get screwed so let's go ahead and
run this now we pass in a number for our
third argument where expects to have ad
actually no it's just going to run the
if the if statement so because AD eight
never is it never equates here then it
really wouldn't be a problem to add this
but you would get unexpected results
because you're like this function I
thought it was supposed to take a number
and you pass in a number and it doesn't
do anything and I mean the fact that
matter is you have to then that's where
you put in breakpoints you figure out
what the hell is going on like why isn't
this working
then you realize math operations in
eighth and doesn't equal ad you're like
oh okay I passed in the wrong data but
the dynamic nature of a Python the fact
that it's not statically typed it gives
you a lot of flexibility to do stuff
like like duck typing and things like
that so if it walks like a duck and
quacks like a duck it must be a duck and
you can get away with um it gives you
flexibility but not also it can also
hurt you as well especially with large
teams and millions of lines of code and
stuff like that alright guys so that is
it for functions in this code and thank
you for watching this tutorial and we'll
get get more stuff in the following
tutorials bye guys hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here and now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the Suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
