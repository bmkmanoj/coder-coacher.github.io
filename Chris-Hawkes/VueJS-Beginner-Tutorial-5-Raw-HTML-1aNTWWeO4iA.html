VJ s tutorial one of the things I wanted
to focus on real quick is just to let
you know that you can bind actual HTML
from within your model so you can have
your server pass down HTML characters
and then bind that HTML to your code and
if you've ever done reacting you know
it's kind of a pain in the ass because
you have to use this dangerously set
inner HTML and the reason why it's
called dangerously set for react is
because it is dangerous whenever you're
rendering HTML without without actually
trusting the data so you should never
render HTML that is given to you by a
user because that introduces cross-site
a cross-site scripting and all that is
is that if somebody was able to gain
access by just like filling out a form
on your website where you could put in a
script tag that does a JavaScript
redirect to their website or just some
you know malicious website they can if
you were to take that data and then just
render it as HTML on your website and
other people visit that that page then
it would redirect to this malicious site
so that's what cross-site scripting is
all about and it's it's dangerous but
there's many cases where like your your
you might be the only one storing HTML
HTML and if somebody gains access to
your database and you have bigger issues
and just cross-site scripting but if you
store that HTML maybe or even in a
separate file or some sort of trusted
location and not just some user input
you could do that so pretend this data
comes from some trusted some trusted
source so this is just an HTML anchor
tag and it goes to a website that I own
that way I don't anybody give me crap
about this tutorial but this this is
just it's actual raw HTML so how do you
do that if we were to say ban dot and I
called this just test for right now so
if I said ban dot test what happens
let's look at it you can see it actually
renders the escaped version of the HTML
so the actual text version it doesn't
get displayed as HTML so if you needed
it to be displayed as HTML you have to
do a separate step and it's actually
super simple compared to something like
react and that is you use three curl
races so by using three curly braces I
go back and now it's an actual HTML
anchor link and if I click on it it
works as HTML and takes you to this
website so that's pretty sweet it's very
simple short video but it is something
that I think people need to understand
and just look at the security
implications like I said of any time if
you plan on having somebody write in
HTML and you two redisplay that can be
very dangerous but if it's from trusted
sources this is something that is
perfectly acceptable all right guys
thanks for watching bye
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to become a
