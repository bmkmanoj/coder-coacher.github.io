gonna be taking a look at the strappy
framework this was actually recommended
by somebody else and thank you for the
recommendations I always like to look at
these new projects and a couple months
ago I actually tried to create my own
open source of nodejs framework which I
call base ijs which to be honest I don't
have a ton of time to devote to an
open-source project so it's probably
best that you know I maybe stay away
from that for the time being just
because you really have to have a lot of
commitment I used to in fact I'm friends
with on Facebook
Massimo deep here oh if that's even how
you say his name but he's a college
professor from the Chicago area I forget
what the Saint the st. Paul or the Paul
or some like that but he's a computer
science professor and he created the web
2 PI framework and I remember back in
the old days of messing with web 2 pi
and being involved in the community it
was really cool when there was only a
handful of developers that you know
around and they were very helpful but I
mean that dude was literally working
like night and day you know being a
professor during the day and then just
devoting a ton of time to his framework
and he still has the framework to the to
date and you know there's just not a
whole lot of money in it there's not a
whole lot of recognition all the hard
work that he's done you know some people
might even say well what the hell is web
2 pi at least in the corporate world so
it's not like everything you should do
it you should do it for the benefit and
the credit and everything but let's be
honest a lot of people do that's why
there's so many frameworks everywhere I
mean everybody wants to have their name
is the guy who created this or the girl
who created that you know it's like
anyway so that aside I want to look at
strappy because I didn't write all this
code and it looks like it's going to be
pretty cool the future of web
development is about having the slimmest
API possible basically your server
should be very very slim it should be
essentially delivering data in JSON
format and then the JSON gets picked up
by some people say JSON I hate that but
anyway sunny yeah Jason gets picked up
by your client-side tool whatever it's
going to be whether it's angular and/or
react or whatever you want but strappy
is supposed to be pretty minimalistic so
we're going to get started with just
actually creating a simple project in
here so this isn't really going to
follow the standard tutorial type system
because on my channel I do I only want
to post tutorials on the weekend but I
feel like a 1:1 video for just testing
something out doesn't count as a
tutorial although people can still use
it as that I'm gonna put this in my
projects directory so I'm going to
create a new folder which I'm gonna call
strappy so inside of strappy I can go
ahead and say CMD up here and it will
open up my command line and windows and
yes I use Windows not Linux I'm a.net
developer for the most part all right so
now we want to go ahead and create our
NPM inet config file and this is going
to be for our project and the reason why
I'm doing this is I actually I don't
want to install NPM modules globally
because that ends up polluting your
namespace and if you end up having
multiple projects that are referencing
you know global packages and you start
running into some problem so we're just
going to call this a strappy test
there'll be one a crappy test I don't
care about all this all right there we
go so now we have this package JSON file
so if we go ahead and we install strappy
and we just say save we can go ahead and
not install it globally because that's
not what I want to do is install strappy
- - save so this will now install
strappy locally to my project directory
here and it will also put the you know
the listing the dependency inside of our
package adjacent file that got created
another thing to you guys know I'm on a
Visual Studio code kick it's um and
honestly this was on Stack Overflow not
stack overflow but hacker news the other
day we're pretty much it was like a lot
of ranting or not ranting but a lot of
raving about Visual Studio code and how
it is an awesome - editor and I've been
saying that for a while now but it turns
out that a lot of people really do
prefer Visual Studio code over Adam I
know that I do and it's free it's open
source and it's not nearly as bloated as
something like Visual Studio so we'll
open folder and we're going to open up
the location to where we created the
strappy project
I'm getting way too many files and here
are folders and things in here all right
so now that we've opened up the folder
to that location I'm gonna zoom in so
you guys can see this a little better
really kick on click on package Jason
you can see that no we're not gonna
update we're gonna see that the package
Jason hasn't actually done anything yet
because it's still in selling stripe
he's strapped he's pretty big apparently
now while we're waiting for it to
install you can see strappy has a nice
boot strap themed website a lot of
people think that a project is awesome
just because as a good bootstrap site
but nowadays everybody's using the same
friggin template over and over again you
know full with alternating full with
some time you know content centered in
the middle it's all you know the same
type of thing they have up at the top
responsive view bootstrap has made web
development so much lazier it's
unbelievable
now they're not quite it's not quite the
same fold down so give them a little bit
of uniqueness there but anyway one of
the things that does annoy me a little
bit about something like this this
project here is Strappies actually run
by a company so and that's typically a
good thing because if a company's not
backing a project then sometimes it
never gets off the ground but if you
look at something like this it's talking
about strappy login link to the strappy
Studio we advise you to use our studio
to build api's why why are you advising
us to do that are you advising us to do
that because you want to make money off
the project probably so but meteor does
the same thing it's one of the reasons I
don't really mess with meteor all right
so it's finally installed so if I go
ahead and I just refreshed this package
Jason you're gonna see now that we have
the dependencies and it keeps track of
the version of straw B that you need to
use or that you installed so that's good
now one of the things that we're going
to need to do since we're using strappy
we need to go ahead and let me get rid
of that
quick we're gonna need to add strappy to
our scripts here since we're gonna be
running it from the MPM so it only runs
locally so we're gonna say strappy and
then we'll just say the same thing here
strappy make sure there's a comma there
so now we can run strappy should be just
fine so let's see if I can do that real
quick so I should be able to say strappy
new and then we're gonna say test
it would help if I had my head out of my
ass and I did this right so we need to
say NPM run scrappy and then we're going
to say new alright so by doing this this
way by and then you can use NPM to
actually run and it's only going to look
into the local locally stored node
modules folder which is where strappy
all this stuff is actually stuff that
strappy requires but it's going to look
inside there to install it so here we
have something going on where we already
have an issue all right so just to make
sure that there's no sort of issues
because I should just be able to say
strappy and then run the command line
tool but let's just try this real quick
just to make sure it's not an NPM thing
that I'm doing so I'm gonna say strappy
new and then we'll just say test strappy
and we'll call this start strapping so
you can give it any sort of script name
you want and we would run it the same
exact way so I'm gonna go ahead and just
say what I call it damn and I already
forget start strap you see I'm not that
smart guys NPM run start strappy so
that's actually going to run this whole
process where this should work the same
but once again I wanted to make sure
strapping new can only be called on an
empty
very interesting okay so I could then do
all right well let me see that's kind of
interesting
all right so let's go to make a new
folder that also means that my NPM thing
didn't work very well so let's just say
test which is a terrible name for this
but I'm gonna do the same thing with CD
into the test
oh damn what a piece of alright so
let's go ahead and since I'm not using
scrapping for anything else I'm gonna
install it globally and see if that
actually resolves anything because I
would think that would work but I don't
know let's go ahead and just install
globally then and you need to say -
hyphen G - install it globally alright
so that is now installed globally so I
should just be able to type strappy
without having to do anything and it
should just run you can see it's
obviously doing stuff so let's go ahead
and run
strappy new you know what I'm going to
go after the test here what is this
touch traffic folder what the hell is it
what the so this bitch made this
the first time around is that what
you're telling me so it worked it
working it just caught it caused some
sort of file issue is that what you're
telling me alright let's try this real
quick I'm gonna try - it doesn't matter
that we installed a little strappy new
mother
your new application mother F is ready
alright so obviously you should just
install strappy globally for whatever
reason whether it's file permissions or
something else because obviously the
test strappy did work the first time
around but then it threw that f OS our
FS which is the file system module for
nodejs which is probably a pretty big
deal I would imagine it was like halfway
through its process and it choked and we
would run into some serious if we
try to continue going down that path so
here it seems we have a working
application so that's cool
all right so now we should be able to
see D into mother F and then we can just
say strappy star
all right sweet so now it's running at
localhost one three three seven admin so
we can open up the browser note those
one three three code for for a message
not found okay but obviously the server
delivered that so that means the server
is running so that's beneficial so if I
want to kill the server I should be able
to press control C get out of that and
then I can also say scrappy start and
we're not started we're going to say
we're going to help to build it you know
to generate our first API so we'll say
API
Stryper generate API and we'll call this
just music I guess all right so now we
have this new API so let's go ahead and
so I don't really know what we're
supposed to do from here but let's just
try to say strappy start go back to the
website the admin probably has something
to do with oh look at that
damn look at that alright so that's
pretty sweet
I'm one of the things I love about the
Python Django so much how it even has
instructions look this is awesome
so that's what we did we generated an
API name and then if we wanted to give
it more instructions we could have
followed that path you can use the
strappy studio so that's probably why
they want you to register that and they
can probably make money somehow or show
their worth based on the amount of
people that are logged in please fill
out the form to create your first user
this will have root permission so I can
say admin
welcome to your admin so here's a hell
look there's the music wow this is
pretty damn nice actually so if I wanted
to create a new music thing I can say I
already has the date created by admin
that's me and in order to create fields
edit your API it got a models they get a
JSON file following and the models of
documentation so let's just go to create
oh and here like we created one oh but
we didn't set like any sort of names or
anything like that but if I were thou to
say how do I access this or they don't
even tell you how to hmm there's an
entire models documentation here so
obviously guys strappy looks pretty damn
sweet I mean I'm not going to continue
to go down this but this is just saying
just a basic review somebody recommended
that I check out strappy but this looks
pretty impressive I think the amount of
stuff that you have here there's
obviously a learning curve involved but
one of the reasons why I could never
really move away from Django is most
websites need to have some sort of
administration authentication piece and
having to you know customer all that
stuff is just kind of a frustrating
experience and if somebody can just get
some of that stuff going for you as long
as it's you know trust in everything
that you know this this is awesome that
I think this looks really good you guys
should check out strappy I would
definitely put it on a list of top you
know web frameworks that you would want
to learn and going into 2017 alright
guys thanks for watching have a good day
bye hey guys so a lot of you asked me
how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in the Suevi course it's geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery nodejs react
angular how to use github so a lot of
the things that you're going to need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be
you in this and this coding bootcamp and
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
