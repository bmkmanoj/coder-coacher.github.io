take a brief moment to show you guys
just a website that I created in about
two weeks time it's written in Python so
the entire back end is written using
Python so it's just one of the things
that you know I just wanted to show that
is possible if you follow along and the
video tutorials whether your needs are
scraping or web development I do would
kind of touch on a lot of different
things that you need in order to be able
to build a full-scale website so I am
going to be focusing more time on both
Django and also responsive web design
the new website that i've created using
python is called new movies.com so it's
still brand new but um this website
everything that I have here is all
written using Python so it's just you
know what is possible if you want to get
into Python web development now
obviously in order to style this this is
done using CSS so I'm going to be
creating this so that it literally
transforms into a mobile application
almost but without having to do a mobile
redirect literally the HTML and CSS you
see here will end up being converged
down into a nice easy responsive format
so that people on mobile devices can see
it but anyway I just want to take a
moment to showcase what is possible with
Python a lot of people say well Python
isn't a corporate language and this and
that and all that you know some of the
biggest and most heavily trafficked
websites out there inside you know the
top probably 100 there's a good majority
of those that are written in Python so
you know don't believe all that crap
that Python is in a good full-scale
programming language for a complicated
web site or blog so anyway it's just
something that like I said I just want
to touch on briefly just visit the
website check it out to see you know
what is possible here even my unique
rating algorithm is written in Python so
I don't rate these movies myself it's an
algorithm I created I feel like it's
pretty pretty accurate so far probably
does need to have a little bit of tweak
but
yeah the entire thing from my images to
the videos all that stuff is written
using Python so it's definitely a great
programming language it's one of the
reasons why I've done it in conjunction
with the c-sharp language so if there
was a personal favorite it would
definitely be Python but anyway thank
you for watching the videos I plan on
making some more in the future please
subscribe and hopefully you can check
out the movie website thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
