video I'm talking about progressive Web
Apps and why you should be learning them
in 2018 why they're the future so let's
just jump right in so they're great for
a mobile experience on the web that's
why we actually have this because back
in like 2012 we had this in this entire
conversation that we could turn html5
and web pages into a mobile type of
experience so everybody started talking
about responsive web design just
basically using CSS and HTML to give
alternative views of of your you know UX
presentation whatever your your UI is
for your your app and the problem we
found though is that the websites were
still very unresponsive
they were very slow and everything
because they're built for for regular
desktop computers through network
connections and things like that so the
simple fact is that after many years of
trying to get that right we still had
most people on their cell phones they
enjoyed and would rather be on a mobile
app than it would be on a webpage that
is deliver even with a mobile first
experience so that transition then is
something called accelerated mobile apps
and or I'm sorry accelerated mobile
pages EMPs and that was actually
something that was developed by Google
and Twitter to try to address the whole
network connectivity thing and I've
tried to do am PS on my website and you
just have to you have to design your
page in a specific way so you have like
an alternative view for the page for for
mobile users but then you can't link to
certain things like external stylesheets
external javascript files and there's
all these rules and everything and it
it's kind of a pain to deal with and
then your end user has somewhat of a you
know somewhat of a crappy experience on
this this this mobile first a MP type of
experience so I'm sure you guys have
seen it you see those articles that kind
of show up at the top of the Google
search in a horizontal fashion and a lot
of times you'll see like news articles
using the wrong images and stuff like
that it's because the developers of the
site did not set up the NP correctly and
Google still giving them credit and
registering it which they never did for
me anyway
so a progressive web app so they're fast
they're reliable they're engaging so
engaging because they really provide the
closest thing to a native
laughs experience inside the browser
they're reliable because they can
actually work outside of a network which
responsive web apps could never do that
but this has the ability using local
storage and in a different architecture
it allows for connectivity offline so
you actually end up installing your your
progressive web apps just like you do a
native app it's actually not just like
it's similar but it the end user it
looks very similar you still get an icon
on like your home screen of your of your
smartphone so I should also throw a
credit that the term progressive web app
or PWA for short was coined by Google
engineer Alex Russell in 2015 so again
the benefits of using an architecture in
building progressive web apps is that
they allow the web app to be installed
on the user's home screen you don't have
to deal with actually creating a web app
for iOS for Android for all the
different device types out there you're
building one app and you're able to
distribute it via a URL so a URL that
people download and once again they can
save it to their home screen it looks
very similar to a regular native mobile
app installed on their on their device
but at all it takes up much less space
for the end-user so that makes them
happy so again studies show that more
people use native apps on their cell
phone rather than a responsive website I
do that myself if I have an app in fact
if I'm using something like for instance
Priceline if I'm booking hotels and
things like that
I'm gonna use their their mobile app
even if they have a great user
experience on their on their website
it's just gonna be more performant to
use the mobile app even if it has
scale-back functionality and I think
that with progressive web apps we're
hoping to fill that void and actually
not have so much limited functionality
all right so here's three examples of
websites that are using the progressive
web app infrastructure so it looks very
similar to any other site but you'll see
like when you actually go to interact
with these web pages that the experience
is actually much much more fluid and
then the fact that it's built in with
HTML local storage and
a lot of the caching and everything is
just all built-in into the browser
technology for you it just it's a much
more fluid experience so if you go and
try some of these websites out it is
it's much more fluid so the reason why
it is more fluid as service workers
provide the magic service workers is a
type of web worker it's essentially a
JavaScript file that runs separately
from the main browser thread
intercepting network requests caching or
retrieving resources from the cache and
delivering push messages push messages
are the notifications that are going to
be able to get displayed from your your
progressive web app to the user's phone
so just like a native app can give you
notifications you can design your
progressive web app to do the same thing
so it's essentially an event-based
non-blocking architecture event based
similar to node not necessarily single
threaded like notice because you have
the serviceworker once again that
actually lives on a different thread
than the actual user interface so the
entire thing is fluid because it's
non-blocking it can take as many
requests as possible and you just it'll
still work through them as quickly as it
can but that non-blocking architecture
is really what makes the magic of
progressive web apps and that was all
designed by Google so similar to app
development we use the manifest.json
file so manifest.json is a new standard
for distribution of progressive web apps
and here you can define basic
functionality like the color of the
header bars setting your application
icons so if you've ever done I Oh s or
Android development it's very similar to
that and then the the big difference is
that because this is an HTML standard
and you go back it uses this new link
tag which is a link relation manifest
and then you just point to your
manifest.json file so that's pretty cool
all right so where to host progressive
web apps are just like any other website
so you can host it anywhere you can host
a regular site the only caveat is it has
to be served with HTTP traffic and HTTP
used to be somewhat difficult I think to
set up but let's encrypt has made that
so much easier it's free to use it's so
it like I use the node for hosting and I
set up let's encrypt in literally like
five minutes where I was spending hours
and and really I think multiple days
messing with Komodo
so I recommend let's encrypt if you want
to save some gray hair for sure all
right so our PWA is the future it's so
it's impossible to predict the future we
always talk about what the future is
gonna be and we act like oh yeah
accelerated mobile pages are the future
and no they're not hopefully because
they suck and then the thing is is like
progressive web apps are the closest
thing that we have to solving that gap
between native apps and mobile apps I
just said that all right so basically
native apps and then responsive web apps
so it was so basically it's it's the
bridge between the two and it's the
closest bridge that we've had and it's a
little bit easier to deal with than
other bridges that we've seen like a
patch of Cordova or like something like
react native this is gonna be a little
bit easier especially for newbies to hit
the ground running progressive web apps
are something I would actually recommend
my new users or anybody that's new to
program you could just jump right into
progressive web apps you might as well
start learning that and banking on that
being in the future and maybe that is
your your key into the industry you know
two years from now so what is the best
place to learn in my opinion I mean
there's gonna be courses out there on
different channels if you guys have
courses that's actually where I'd like
to reach out to you guys to try to put
more resources on this channel to point
to some of these resources not just for
me but for other people but the best
documentation I've seen is actually
Google's documentation
you know Lo and Bill is our surprise
surprise that's no surprise to anybody
they always have really good
documentation and there's actually an
entire project that you can download and
see the source code of and I have it
pulled up right here so inside of here
you can see that it actually has all the
different steps that it has for the the
demo so definitely walk through the demo
when you do that you're gonna end up
creating and this is that manifest.json
file you're gonna end up creating an app
that looks like this and this app it
doesn't look too spectacular some it
needs a logo and everything but the
fluid fluid nosov this is actually
incredibly incredibly awesome so let me
let me show you an example so if I want
to go ahead and add a new city and I'll
add
I wish Washington was here which is my
city sorry I don't have that but we'll
just do San Francisco okay so we pick
San Francisco we add it and now all of a
sudden boom
San Francisco is communicating with a
RESTful API and getting real-time
weather in San Francisco right now when
you shrink this stuff down you can see
that my I've noticed there's like a bug
on this right side like for whatever
reason like chrome is very very at least
on Windows 10 in Chrome seems very
finicky when it comes to resizing but
anyway you can see that the resizing it
works it's a very very very very
responsive I mean some of this like most
cell phones are not this in this narrow
but even if they were it still works and
you can see like more of like a tablet
type experience but the cool part is
watch what happens now when i refresh
the page it remembers San Francisco how
does it remember it remembers because if
we look it and we inspect let's take a
look here and by the way if you wanted
to shrink your page you just click on
this little cell phone thing and it
gives you the responsive view but then
you still have the full window view down
here so if I like if I go ahead and
click on this and I look at something
like application inside here you're
gonna see that there is some local local
storage in here so you can see here's
the local storage so if I went ahead and
let's just let's just we're gonna clear
all this local storage and then we
refresh it and now all of a sudden it
goes back to the default New York was
loaded by default it's actually part of
the source code so if I went in here and
I added Seattle you can see when we go
so now Seattle's in there and I'm gonna
click on this and click back in you can
see that Seattle's added to the local
storage so a lot of that local storage
is how we actually create the web app in
order to be something that still works
without a network connection now in this
particular case you still need a network
connection in order to link out to some
of this data but you could cache some of
the data once a day or something like
that and you know cache it to the users
users phone or phone so that way there
that when they go to check their app
they at least have data from you know
earlier that day cut type of thing
they don't necessarily have to connect
to the network if they if they don't
want to or if they if they can't so
anyway there's a there's a lot to cover
there so that's really all I have with
progressive web apps I would definitely
recommend you look at the Google's
official documentation build the website
that I just showed you first from there
I would probably maybe branch off and
start building your own thing that's
gonna be the best way to learn if you
wanna then also maybe check out some
other courses just feel free to leave
links to those courses I want to
evaluate them myself and see if they're
worthy to be put into the description
tab and then we'll go from there but
thanks guys
thank you for watching make sure you
subscribe vote up the video and share do
whatever you have to do or whatever you
can do that would be awesome but guys
thanks for watching have a good day
so this video was brought to you by a
dead mountain coding boot camp there are
a boot camp that is based out of Utah
but they're also in Texas in Arizona now
and they have very good reviews so make
sure you guys check them out the link is
in the description tab below they offer
courses in web development iOS
development UX or user experience design
Quality Assurance and just a few other
ones in fact they're even getting into
Salesforce as well now so they're
continuing to adapt their courses based
on what the market needs are and major
companies are hiring some of their
alumni so make sure you guys give them a
look they have great reviews and thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
