to show you how to use Python to do some
automated browser testing and we're
gonna be using selenium for that so
first things first you got to install
selenium on your machine go ahead and
open up a command prompt and use pip
install selenium you have to have Pippin
installed on your machine which is
something I touch upon in other videos
but I'm sure if you're using Python for
development you probably already have
that all right so now that we have
selenium installed let's go ahead and
create a file that we're going to use to
do this demonstration so it's a new file
I'm just going to call it selenium all
right from selenium import web driver
type driver equals web driver dot and
we'll use Firefox for this example
all right we can set the window size of
our browser so we'll set window size and
you don't have to actually set the the
size I'm not sure what the default is
but if you want to look that up I'm sure
there's some documentation of that
somewhere and that's really all I'm
gonna do here for this example and we
set this as a startup file and we'll go
ahead and run it
all right so you can see that selenium
is now installed and we went ahead and
pulled up the Google Chrome or not I'm
sorry Google Chrome but Google search
engine and I'm just to kind of touch on
this a little bit further let me just
show you how you interact with the page
I'm using Google Chrome let's go ahead
and pull up the Google search page okay
and I'm going to right click to inspect
element on this text box and just grab
the XPath and on my script here I'm
going to go ahead and create a element
variable equals driver get element right
it's our driver got find element by
XPath and then here we're just going to
paste the XPath that we got from Google
Chrome and now I'm just gonna add to the
element variable and we'll say send keys
now let's go ahead and see what that
does
you
all right so you can see that it entered
the testing text that we had told it to
enter finally I'm gonna see if we can
actually do the submission by saying
element dot send keys and then we're
going to say Keys dot enter and this has
to be capitalized and in order to do
that you have to actually import the
keys element so from selenium-webdriver
dot common dot keys import keys
okay what did I do wrong here one second
oh this is capitalized right here this
is not supposed to be capitalized all
right let's try that again kill this and
restart it
all right and you can see that it
pressed enter so it actually sent to
search query and we got the results here
in Google all right in the next video
I'm gonna show you guys something else
which is a headless browser and we can
use Python and selenium but instead of
actually pulling up the browser we can
use something called phantom JavaScript
which has a built in ghost driver and
ghost driver is basically like Google
Chrome's web driver but you don't
actually have to have Firefox or Chrome
or anything pulled up to be able to use
it so it actually speeds things up if
you absolutely have to do any sort of
screen testing and you need JavaScript
and to render and things like that or
you need to interact with the JavaScript
most of the time if you can't actually
do post parameters to bypass that type
of thing and you absolutely have to have
a browser session open then it's really
a good way to go if you want to see
what's going on I would say you know the
use Firefox but if speed is what you're
after that's what I'm going to touch on
in the next video
all right thanks guys bye
