from one of my viewers and he's asking
me how much do you think he's asked me
how much he's gonna make coming out of a
bootcamp and like what a developer
salary should be coming out of a
bootcamp and you know clearly you can't
answer that with just one specific
figure because every every different
geographic area has different living
expenses so the salary in San Francisco
is not gonna be the same thing as
something in the middle United States or
whatever so I would say honestly I'm
gonna take a moment to actually talk
about some of the issues when with the
boot camps because a lot of people have
asked me about that as you guys know my
previous sponsor Deb mountain they were
coding bootcamp so I have some
familiarity with them I would say and
you know I've seen obviously so many of
them pop up over the years and earlier
this year dev bootcamp announcing that
they were going out of business with you
in multiple locations and and being the
first one to really revolutionize and
kickstart this coding bootcamp industry
back in 2012 you know them also being
owned by a multi-million dollar company
that basically said hey we're you know
everything we're doing here is not a
sustainable business model we're just
gonna shut down that was really
concerning especially considering the
fact that the next bootcamp was the iron
yard to announce that they were gonna be
shutting down and then like a month
later I get a call from my previous
sponsor to have out and saying they're
pulling back from my budgeting issues
and things like that so we're seeing the
industry that was booming is really
starting to I would say not necessarily
shrink up but it's starting to solidify
and that naturally happens like when you
have new industries there's gonna be
massive amounts of companies and people
trying to invest time and effort into it
eventually there's gonna be like you
know this like I said solidifying and
you're gonna see larger companies kind
of take hold and I think that's what
we're in the process of seeing now but
the problem with boot camps that I see
is that they seem a lot of them are
seemed to advertise hey you can spend
$11,000
and go through this coding bootcamp and
we'll be able to get you a job and the
problem is is that if you're like a
truck driver or you're a plumber or
something like that and in both of those
jobs I did in my previous life if you
have no interest in coding and like if I
went immediately from a truck and just
jump into a coding boot camp I don't
think it's it's feasible for me to be
able to find a job within 12 or 16 weeks
I I just you know it's definitely not
sustainable the company that I end up
getting hired into there's just going to
be too much to learn too much I don't
know and it would be way too
overwhelming and I'd probably end up
getting fired very quickly even at the
beginning beginner level you know
developer salary so I've seen developer
boot camps provide success to real
people to real people I know in fact I
worked with a guy that was a meet on at
the iron yard and these these companies
have definitely had success but I think
the issue is that there there's just too
many people that have flooded these
programs that had no general like
interest in IT and programming before
joining and the ones that truly have
like long term success with boot camps
are probably the ones who actually took
an interest in programming before
somebody like you know prodded them are
some commercial flashed or other eyes
hey you can make 90,000 dollars a year
if you just you know take our course and
pay twelve thousand dollars and you know
16 weeks he definitely will have that
salary I don't know it's just not it's
not really feasible unfortunately but it
is like a great supplemental thing to
somebody who already has program
programming experience if you already
have an online portfolio and things you
can point to and say I went to a coding
boot camp I'm sure that all you know
that really helps and pads the resume
and things like that but for somebody
like with no general interest in IT just
to hop into a coding boot camp and
expect to be able to make 90,000 coming
right out of it it's just not reasonable
so there's been articles and everything
going back if you read like I was there
was a Bloomberg article about a year ago
that said if you want an IT job then
don't go to a coding boot camp and they
explained that talking to a lot of
hiring managers and things like that
these hiring managers were expecting a
mid-level programming town
to be coming out of the boot camps and
what they were finding is you know some
some very very very junior level
developers and and you know and I think
with companies like boot camp and things
they probably felt that it was
inappropriate for them to be taking
students that they knew probably weren't
gonna be able to succeed in the industry
and still taking that money from them
and it was probably borderline I'm not
sure if you would call that unethical
but if you knew that somebody was never
gonna be able to get a job as a
programmer still took you know twelve
thousand dollars from them it's feels
like robbery a little bit but I don't
know hopefully the boot camps do do me a
better screening and things like that
they shouldn't just try to promote this
like that anybody can be a coder and
things like that people should naturally
develop an interest in coding and and
that should probably develop over time
you know anywhere from months to years
probably before anybody's even ready for
a junior level talent at most positions
that I've seen anyway so in a way I
think some of these companies feel
guilty for being like front and center
when it comes to telling everybody in
the world that anybody can be a coder
and that you just have to join their
program and they'll make you into one
you know that you have to be a nerd at
heart or at least you know start to
develop those nerd tendencies and and
those curiosities I think have to come
from within and I think the fact that or
really when they don't it's just not
going to succeed and no matter how good
the developer boot camp is it's just not
going to work it's really not going to
work even with a four-year college
degree probably but at least you know at
least you learn a lot of skills in
college and things like that that would
also be able to transition into more
maybe an analyst business management
things like that that could still be
involved in IT and and not necessarily
be a coder but the thing is people
should at least enjoy to code if you
truly hate it or if you've never had any
sort of interest in it and just jump
into a boot camp probably not gonna work
alright guys thanks for watching have a
good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
