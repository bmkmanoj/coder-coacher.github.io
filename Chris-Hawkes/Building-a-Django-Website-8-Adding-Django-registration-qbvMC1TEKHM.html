and Jenga website tutorial series the
entire website is going to be centered
around basically music competitions and
things of that nature so what I need to
do is go ahead and add more to the base
that HTML page of every page inherits
from and we're gonna start with a simple
wrap her I'm sorry class equals wrapped
and our main content is going to sit
inside of that
okay and then outside of the rap we want
to have a footer
and then we'll have block content not
good we'll call it Flickr content
okay so we now have these two sections
of our website let's add class I'm sorry
the rap class two main CSS and I want to
say margin:0 auto so that it will be
centered in the middle of the screen we
want to give it a width I'm gonna give
it a width of 960 pixels so basically
your standard desktop support
and now with footer we're gonna do the
same thing in fact footer does not need
to exist outside of the wrap so I'm just
going to cut that and place this at the
bottom of the wrap and just for right
now so that we can see it let's give it
a height like 150 pixels in the
background color of black there's just
for testing purposes
now since there's not a whole lot in the
wrap there but let's go ahead and upload
that and see what we have
all right so you can see now that by
margin:0 auto it centers everything in
the middle of the screen this black
thing is the footer it's not really at
the bottom or anything but this is a
decent start to what we want to do okay
so let's go ahead and add more to the
header so going back here let's go back
to the base at HTML and at the top part
of the wrap we're gonna add a div class
was Hatter we're also going out of
didn't do class for the navigation
all right so now let's go ahead and
we're pretty much ready to start adding
authentication to our website and for
starters let's go ahead and go back to
our settings dot by file and down here
we're going to use the Django
registration so just simply type
registration there and you have to make
sure that it is installed so it's if it
is installed it you would just put
registration right there but let me see
if I can do a quick google search and
the link is actually right here so I'll
post that in the video this is the
Django registration that I'm currently
using which I mean we're going to also
add the ability to be able to log in to
the website via Facebook and Google as
well so a lot of people probably won't
use your standard registration but and
for the moment I do want to have an
alternate means of registration besides
just those two avenues that will add to
the website later on so if you go to
that that address that I'll provide in
the link below and install general
registration you'll be able to just put
registration here and it will work so
let's go ahead and do that now we'll
upload this and our server it's going to
the my pump project Python manage that
people is why I'm cdb okay so now we
have registration installed registration
needs a few things set up with it so
they will work right and for starters we
need some email stuff let's go ahead and
do that now
email use TLS equals true
and we're gonna say email host equals
smtp.gmail.com and email host user
equals I'll say official new music and
then email host password this is the
actual password for whatever email
address you have that you plan on
sending email from so I don't actually
have that even created at the moment so
it's not really going to work but you
would want to put in your user ID and
password there and then serve our email
address so we'll say official noob
musicom or will really just official new
music at gmail.com and then default from
email equals these are all settings by
the way for the jungle registration and
we'll say new music so these would be
specific to whatever sort of setup that
you have
right and the next thing we want to do
is we want to go down here and do
account activation because when Django
registration sends actual email to the
user to verify their email address
they'll have seven days to do so
otherwise it will actually it's not what
I want to do otherwise it will expire so
this is just simply an integer so seven
days it will expire and the link will be
no good any longer okay all right and
that should be about it for Django
registration now we need to go to our
urls file and add the appropriate urls
that general registration uses and we're
going to just copy this in here so
you'll want to copy the pause the video
and copy this in there
now another thing that Django
registration needs for every single one
of these URLs that are part of the
accounts like log in change your
password change for email stuff like
that they all require a template so I'll
try to provide the templates that I plan
on using for Django registration and
provide a link so you guys can download
that but we're going to put that in here
so we'll just say registration so we
have a templates folder now with our
registration templates that we'll end up
living in there all right so I actually
have for my new movies I have all of
these templates here that are used for
Django registration and I'm just going
to I'm going to download them into this
project and I'll try to provide a link
once we work this out and make sure that
they're working right so that way you
guys can download this folder and this
registration you know all these
templates just sit right in there like
that
so hopefully let's see how this is going
to end up working because since it's
used for another site you never know how
things will end up working out here so I
want to pull up some of this stuff so we
can see that the path is is all wrong
here so I need to change the path on all
of these files so I'll do that here now
all right so I went through and just um
changed all those paths so it finds the
right base page and there will be
probably a few more customizations that
need to occur but now that we've done
that let's go ahead and upload that to
the the file so I've uploaded the
templates and now we also need to upload
my project since we change the URLs file
and let's go ahead and visit the website
now and we want to go to like accounts
login I think it is okay so that is not
it um I think it might need to be
accounts
yeah counts login okay so let's see all
right so this is actually referencing a
it's an error message because of
something that we had for social octaves
we're going to add the ability to be
able to log in via Facebook and Google+
and that's what this is
right here and I can't find that stuff
so you see ya the social loss and stuff
right here we need to go ahead and
remove that for right now and probably
the next video we're gonna go ahead and
enable that feature but for right now I
want to at least get this working
alright so here it is so now we have an
actual so we'll just create a test user
actually I got a register when were
thinking I started got in register yeah
we have the same social loss problem let
me change that here for the register
page just register form okay
so I'll be uploaded templates and then
now go back to this and we'll create our
test user actually you know it
okay the reason why that happened is
because we actually don't have any sort
of email address updated so I need to
have actually create the email address
for the company account I'll do that now
I still went ahead and updated them and
try this again
all right so this time it actually
worked and I'm gonna go ahead and check
the email address all right and you can
see here inside my Gmail we now have an
email address with a link to go back to
new music with the account and like a
hash key that will expire in seven days
and that can be adjusted based on that
settings file that we did and then now
congratulations your account with new
boobies has been activated so in this
video we you know we created a complete
working email authentication like
authorization login stuff like that so
that's pretty cool in this next video we
want to go ahead and add the feature to
be able to log in with Facebook and
Google Google accounts alright guys
thanks for watching and please subscribe
and you know before long we'll have a
really you know hopefully awesome
working website alright see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
