from one of the viewers he says Chris
what are you usually used for making a
layout in styling of your projects pure
CSS or some kind of bootstrap so the
past like couple years I've only done
bootstrap it now and what's interesting
about that is that the past couple of
years I've done a lot more back in and I
would say more complex programming than
I did when I was first starting out so
when I was first starting out I was
basically programming to fill my needs
and whatever particular need that was
whether it's building a scripting you're
like a scraping application to collect
data or parse data there was a lot of
like you know obviously web framework
kind of scripting that I was doing but I
spent a lot of time years ago doing a
lot of CSS so I feel like I can compete
relatively well on like a CSS three
point O perspective where I understand a
lot about the styles and and I can I can
you know like i said i can get things
done relatively well like if you give me
an image i can make it into a real web
page and i've been able to do that for
at least well hell seven years probably
so bootstrap though makes it so much so
much easier the downside is that
everybody's website looks the same like
lo and behold I have a free bootstrap
theme that I actually started working
off of which is right here on start
bootstrap calm and I mean that's
actually what is you know the the
template you know that I started with
hipster code and obviously I paid for
some images and things so that could be
a little bit unique I have permission on
both the sandwich legally and basically
though this this entire site it took a
decent amount of custom javis not
JavaScript at CSS there's some
JavaScript manner to react as well but
you know there's some CSS and things
that I did to kind of scituate this
entire website but ultimately that was
done on a free theme now why would I do
a free theme if I know how to do CSS
well bootstrap saves so much time and
one of the things I've noticed that when
it comes to building a theme that you
could get for free like you know this or
even a paid theme like if you go to
something like template monster their
website they have a lot of different
templates in order to you a lot of them
are paid some of them are free I believe
but you you have all kinds of options
options so if you felt like too many
people are using the three option
there's
of options here to to try out and some
of them obviously or a little bit
expensive and others are cheaper but the
thing is is that the the entire layout
and organization of the project all the
CSS and things like that is actually
really well done you know I'll be like
obviously a very good UI developer had
created some of these projects and and
you can just kind of follow their lead
so that's one of the major benefits of
using these bootstrap themes now the
problem with bootstrap is that a lot of
these sites look exactly the same i mean
they all have this like you know this
typical start on the left hand side
navigation and then your collapsible nav
which works very well on a cell phone
and that's another that's another
nightmare that's not fun to deal with
but you know this whole responsive
aspect and everything that just works in
using media queries like that's a lot to
figure out like you have to be pretty
pretty good in order to write something
that works like that but you don't have
to be like an absolute expert in order
to adapt something that's already there
so you're going to have a much easier
time if you need to get a project off
the ground quickly hipster code in this
UI i probably created in a matter of
days i mean just getting all this worked
on it wasn't a big deal at all to to
plug and play a lot of this stuff it's
using a django back-end written in
python and definitely you know use that
use a theme i would say because you're
going to be hard pressed say if you
don't have at least five years of you i
experienced i would say in making some
of these these excellent Dean's maybe
maybe five years is a little bit
excessive but you know at least a few
years experience so when I was talking
about my unity game where I did a video
a couple days ago where I mentioned my
Union unity and like you know I now I
realize more than ever that as much as
I'd like to be an artist like a 3d
artist that I can do animations and
modeling the the thing is that it's much
easier for me to stick to the coding
side of things and just pay somebody you
know 10 or 15 bucks in order to use a
model that would have taken me two years
so it's the same thing with a template
you
be you know very very good at CSS but
unless you're really trying to be like
that UI designer type then it's probably
not your interest in order to learn ucss
upside and down so you're going to end
up getting better with it naturally as
you're adapting some of these themes but
to actually build the theme with the
organization the way that they do it it
takes a lot of practice so it's one of
those those areas where I'm like you
know I just pay the ten dollars or get a
free template and go from there now one
thing I did want to mention as well when
you're doing a CSS development it's it's
so much easier nowadays than it was when
I was first getting started like the
browser tools in chrome are absolutely
amazing where you know if I want to take
a color here and I don't I'm just doing
this on the fly but like here's my color
where's the color coming from my years
of color so i just i overwrote that but
if I said 333 and then I click on this
box you know I have this I this on the
fly thing where i can start
experimenting with the colors and then
watch the title change so hopefully you
guys can see the titling change there so
the browser gives you so much ability to
execute this is actually coming from my
amazon plugin it's not my own exception
being thrown there but you know the fact
that you can actually write JavaScript
right in here as a pretty amazing as
well you can do all kinds of stuff I
mean there's like that you can really do
all your debugging right inside the
browser and yeah these tools just didn't
exist when I was getting started so and
finally I'll just wrap it up with the
greatest benefit of bootstrap in my
opinion is that I don't have to deal
with media queries and things like that
there was a project that I had to work
on one time where I was jumping in the
media queries before there was a whole
lot of documentation this was pre
bootstrap so having to learn all that
stuff and get things situated right you
know finding the right breakpoints and
things like that that was a tremendous
amount of work and effort at the time
and it took a lot of you know research
and development of its
to get that done so if you can avoid
that nightmare than then you know it's
it's just it's going to save you so much
time in bootstrap does that for you so
you learn the bootstrap way if you can
get good enough with CSS you can really
deviate away from some of these themes
so it doesn't look like you're copying
everybody but other than that that's
really my thoughts on the subject so let
me know what you guys think if there's
any other projects you guys use I'm
always interested so thanks for watching
make sure you subscribe vote up the
video and thank you hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
wanna take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12 week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here and now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
