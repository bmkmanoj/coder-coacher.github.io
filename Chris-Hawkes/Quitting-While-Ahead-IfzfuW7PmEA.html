for all the well wishes on the video
about the haters I actually got like a
ton of comments from you guys I
appreciate that and this video I'm
talking about mark pilgrim and the
reason why I bring him up he's actually
the the world is just a very interesting
place mark pilgrim is actually one of
the better-known Python programmers in
fact when you install Python for the
longest time I think even still they
give a shout out to mark mark pilgrim
for the work that he did with the Python
community for a very long time and the
reason why he's number one he's the
author of several books so he's written
a lot of different books he worked at
Google at one point he even went to
Cornell and got into some legal trouble
with another colleague at the school
where they were they had unleashed a
virus and ended up getting in trouble
for that and you can see there's a new
york times article on that so he's
definitely a very good programmer really
good hacker he wrote a lot of the Python
books that I was actually reading when I
was first getting in the Python when I
first got started and in 2011 like he
literally he did something that they
call info suicide where you end up
deleting essentially all records of
yourself online so you know in this day
and age I mean we obviously have Twitter
accounts and Instagram and snapchat sand
and just you know the list goes on and
on but essentially he just he deleted
everything and it said it's very
interesting because we're so we're so
connected now through the internet the
other day I was watching an argument
that was being made where a lot of
people that are watching vlogs out there
of other people they don't understand
that people's lives aren't necessarily
you know the way the vlogs portray and
in my case for instance i mean people
probably think i have a great life but i
mean i have my own responsibilities i
have children I have a wife I you know
like I don't have like a ton of time to
to devote to you know is it I have a
certain amount of time that I have
available to me that I have to devote to
research to this channel to you know
staying relevant obviously you know I
have to put my employer first and
there's just there's some there's only
so much time that I have and but i also
don't have the luxury to just stop
working either now for whatever reason
and i'm not a hundred percent sure of
his financial status but you know i do
believe that mark pilgrim still works
out of or not works out of but lives in
north carolina but in 2011 like he
deleted everything so he was essentially
gone from the internet he used to have
free resources available so you could
read the dive in the Python books and in
fact some of those books i was reading
online that he had posted for free and
all those are gone apparently and they
actually have a status of 410 which
means it's not a 404 page not found or
500 server error or anything like that
it's literally like a deliberate 410
meaning this content is gone and it's
never going to come back so it's it's
extremely significant even people like
scott hanselman who's one of the most
him and jon skeet are probably two of
the biggest i would say people and maybe
Eric Lippert on the C sharp dotnet side
of the house and and even Scott
Hanselman who obviously is far removed
from like a Python type environment
because he's always been like a mr.
Microsoft kind of guy but even he
comments on his blog as of you know this
info suicide we just completely remove
all of your stuff and I mean but he
acknowledges what you know what an
impact that mark pilgrim had on the
community so I just even this hacker
news article if you guys want to take a
look at this I should link to all this
stuff here but it's it's funny that
they're just like all these people like
parently I don't know how true this is
but somebody actually called the police
to to you know how have them check into
why he just disappeared ever you know
from everything but it's like I said
it's it's a strange world that we live
in and and going back to the point that
I was trying to make with you know the
fact that vlogs aren't real life it's
not you know that's not really a lot of
people treat vlogs like a journal
and obviously when a millions of people
are listening to your thoughts you're
going to betray those thoughts in a way
that that you know that isn't offensive
or you know that maybe covers up the bad
you know so we all have skeletons in our
closet we all have things that were not
proud of and and we all have you know
upbringing maybe and even if even you
know opinions about things that we're
just not going to share that those
things are going to be private so just
keep that in mind when you guys are
watching you know vlogs and things like
that of other people including my own it
that nobody's lying lives are perfect
and we all have our struggles and
everything so I think people should know
that and also one of the in this might
sound strange or stupid or whatever but
some people were commenting you know on
that subject and saying that you know
this world that we live in that we're
not making real friends and things like
that that were that it's just not real
that you know that we're supposed to
actually get out and interact with
people and we are supposed to do that
but in this day and age the reason why
blogs are so I'm so popular even you
know what I'm talking about here is that
I'm like a real person you hear it in
the context of my own voice giving you
the message now now granted sometimes
when I'm skirting around issues and I'm
not trying to offend people and things
like that it's not exactly like you know
me having a few beers and getting
sloshed and just saying something
completely stupid you know I obviously
try not to do that so this is so the
interesting thing though is that the
people could say that you know the bonds
that you make with certain viewers or
that viewers make with vloggers and
things like that that it it isn't real
but in my opinion it is because I
consider a lot of my viewers that I talk
to you day in and day out now for really
years and even if they only check in
like once you know once a week or even
once a month or something like that it
almost feels like I've forged some sort
of friendship with these people but you
know that also said with 450,000 viewers
and
and granted not all of you guys are
subscribers that are viewing and things
like that but you know roughly 45,000
subscribers and and you know at least a
few thousand of them that are pretty
pretty pretty avid I guess about about
viewing the content there's no way you
could ever individually give people time
and attention you know that they deserve
so also keep that in mind like I
consider my viewers my friends and
things like that but once again the time
the things like that going back to what
I was originally saying there's only so
much that we can do you know we're real
people just like you guys and we have to
forge your own relationships and you
know it's just life is weird so I've
said before as well you know that you
know don't waste your time on figuring
out this like this language over that
you know try to find your passion and
continue to just you know build your
skills and not worry so much about what
everybody else is doing so anyway what
uh what Mark program did and you know
it's now it's you know going on six
years since he disappeared from the
internet like his stuff is completely
gone and it reminds me number one of one
of my biggest idols that I had growing
up and even now he's still one of my
biggest idols is Bill Watterson I I
think Bill Watterson the creator of the
you know calvin and hobbes comic i mean
calvin and hobbes like I took salsa and
the calvin hobbes characters actually
you know i wished i had an imaginary
friend like Hobbes because he was just
some so much of a companion and I feel
like I didn't really have that growing
up I didn't have any you know truly best
friends like like Calvin had with hobbes
and stuff like that and for whatever
reason I read this you know as a young
child and and read those books over and
over and over again so no matter how
tough my life was growing up and things
like that for some reason I just Co
Calvin and Hobbes helped me through all
that and and it was sad because in 2005
I am you know Bill Watterson basically
came out of hiding bill watterson was at
the top of his game and he had been
making bill calvin hobbes for 10 years
and in 1996 he decided to just end it I
mean he was only 36 years old and he
ended the entire strip after just doing
it for 10 years and literally changing
the face of comics and was really the
only remaining you know major like I
would say masterpiece comic maker
that even made people interested in
comics with in newspapers because i know
that when Bill Watterson left and he
left also at the same time as I Gary
Larson with the far side that comics
basically just died at that point I mean
to me comics were dead and and they've
never come back for me so I used to read
them and in fact I used to buy the
Sunday paper as a child would not even
having that much money just to read bill
watterson's you know Sunday paper
because I just like calvin hobbes that
much so it was sad though like you know
he in 1996 I'm still you know I'm in
high school at that point and and he
just he decides to walk away I remember
I was pretty devastated by it and I was
thinking damn you know he was you know
for the last 10 years of my life leading
up to that point which was a good
majority of it you know I i use calvin
hobbes to kind of get through my daily
routine in life and everything and it
meant a lot to me and and but i but i
respected his wishes to to do something
else and in 2005 he gave an article or
he gave an interview and he and this guy
like he never gives interviews he's
never like there's only a few pictures
of him on the web and things like that
and those go way back like nobody knows
what he looks like now in fact i'd even
know until this book came out the
washington post is mentioning and he did
an interview for that book but anyway
let me get to the point real quick 2005
he does an interview and he basically
says you know he didn't he basically
just ran out of ideas and that his ideas
basically dried up when the ink dried on
the paper you know what i mean like so
so the things that were coming out of
his mouth and the beautiful works of art
with his drawings and as his creativity
and things like that for him to just
basically say that you know for him it
ended when the when the ink tried but
for others like they took so much more
out of it and it really shaped their
lives and and and even now like i would
say bill watterson and his creations
shaped my life and in a pretty
significant way and in that interview
like he was kind of harsh i would say i
would say about about that and and i'm
not the only one who's like literally
been obsessed with calvin hobbes like i
mean he's got like millions of fans
were literally like devastated when he
stopped doing his work and then for him
to say that in 2005 I think you know was
a little bit harsh but then he gives us
interview here in 2015 and he he comes
out and says that yeah like that he's
basically that he's surprised that
adults have started reading this to
their children because I've done the
same and that the children have you know
a renewed interest in his work and that
these books are still in all the
bookstores and things like that and now
you just say it's just where it's very
interesting now to mark pilgrim as much
as I love you know python in the work
that he's done for Python like he's not
on I don't think the me he's not well
he's clearly not on the mainstream level
of Bill Watterson with calvin hobbes was
because he had a bill watterson calvin
hobbes i'm pretty sure it was a
worldwide thing like i know the comic
comic festival in france had bill
watterson they were giving him some sort
of honorary award and things like that
so clearly he you know he had an
influence over and europe as well but
even that like you know getting this
lifelong award one of the biggest
achievements and comics and he didn't
even he didn't even attend it and it
wasn't until this the book came out that
washington post was talking about that
he gave an interview in 2015 that i even
found out he had a daughter and like his
daughter is already a teenager and like
so he like you know people you know they
want their their privacy and like for
somebody like Bill Watterson he was
always a very shy kind of reclusive guy
to begin with but some people will say
he's crazy and things like that I
actually think it's quite the opposite i
think you know maybe bill watterson and
mark pilgrim have this thing figured out
where it's like you know Bill Watterson
didn't just delete all his stuff one of
the things that he was fighting against
was being able to control his works of
art he never licensed out his own
products like if like you see Snoopy and
everything Snoopy I mean was being used
by metlife insurance company as their
logo or mascot and and even beyond that
there's a you know there's theme parks
and things that use the Snoopy
characters and India so they've licensed
out those you know the stuffed animals
and all that stuff and even now you see
that Calvin and Hobbes could have done
the same and I mean some people were
estimating that
that he you know he basically turned
down about two hundred million dollars
to license out his products but to put
to him you know the every time in even
working with the newspaper companies and
with a McMillan or whatever the
publishing company that he worked with
you know even that he was relinquish in
control of his work and and he didn't
like it and I'm not sure that that mark
pilgrims in that same boat but clearly
mark pilgrim didn't want to be bothered
anymore he didn't want to be contacted
and he just basically you know went dark
and he obviously had the capabilities of
doing it and I guess I respect that I
respect it because I mean everybody
wants to go out on their own terms and
and I think it would be pretty hard to
do the thing that's that sad though I
think is that the work will die you know
I guess maybe not the books that he's
done but you know for all his thoughts
and everything that people might have
gotten inspiration from it's you know
it's all gone further this even reminds
me of a put a pile saying that he's
going to delete his channel out 50
million subscribers I swear to you I 50
million subs when we hit 50 million huge
landmark coming up
a huge deal I've never been done before
no one's even close I am deleting my
children it's time to keep now with
PewDiePie Italian how to say his name
right very correctly I said you know I
think 16 million dollars a year makes it
a little bit difficult but even he he is
you know he's expressed concern that his
social awareness and presence online and
things like that is fading and that he's
trying to go out on his own terms bill
watterson said it perfectly that like
you never want to be the last person at
the party and instead of being the last
person so instead of being the last
person out like he was the first person
out and you got to respect that in some
ways I think so alright guys that's
really all I got tonight make sure you
guys check out my sponsor there Deb
mountain coding boot camp and by the way
they have online I'm sorry on site
locations a lot of some of you guys were
actually asking whether or not it's
online it's actually on site so they're
based out of provo utah on dallas texas
now they do actually offer free in
assisted housing i believe so you have
to go check them out because i know it's
on first come first serve basis but like
this is like a fully immersive program
they don't guarantee that you're going
to be able to get a job but the idea is
that you know 12 to 16 week courses
where it's like literally coding 60 70
hours a week sometimes and in your
building real applications using things
like nodejs as a back-end and they're
dealing with love with a lot of
client-side frameworks that are popular
now which is react and angular and you
know the idea is that if that you'll be
able to get a job as like a junior
developer entry-level developer and
learn on the job because that's
typically where most people are going to
do all their learning anyway it's going
to be on the job but you know getting
that first opportunities the biggest
pain so that's what these courses are
geared towards so the description tab
below of this video has a link to dead
mountain coding boot camps to check
those guys out and once again guys thank
you for watching have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
