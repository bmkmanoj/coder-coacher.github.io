something experimental in this video I'm
trying to see if this request library
works for Python 3.5 it doesn't look
like they've updated their site to say
that it actually works with Python 3.5
which is a real problem I think if we
can't use it because if you're gonna
request a webpage or do any sort of HTML
kind of work you really want to use
requests if you can so let's go ahead
and just see if we actually have results
go ahead and open up a command prompt
you should be able to say either pip and
get something back or pip 3.5 I say 3.5
just because I have multiple versions
and I'm obviously 3.5 is finding the
right version for me but if you only
have one version of Python installed you
probably just have to say pip
so either pip or pip 3.5 whatever and we
want to say how do you install this
thing pip install request so this is how
we actually install a module and request
and we're going to see if this thing
actually works
so it installed it which is good now if
I go ahead and type Python on my command
prompt this can actually tell you which
version of Python you're running which
is helpful so let's go ahead and see if
we can say import request and that's a
good time if you don't get an error that
means it actually installs so that
that's a good sign this doesn't
necessarily mean it's gonna work but it
at least installed and knows where it is
so we can go ahead and continue with you
know this example here so let's go ahead
instead of trying to actually pass
insight let's go ahead and just instead
we're gonna do a simple example see you
know I really need to start creating
files for every example in case people
start asking me about this so we're
gonna say request example and really I'm
gonna change this folder name two
examples and I'm going to add new item
which is gonna be called read/write Wow
in fact I'm a positive video I do this
because what I'm doing is on in case you
guys need any of this code I can just
email it to you quickly all right so
here's our request page and let's go
ahead and the first thing we need to do
is we actually import requests now
request is gonna be an object it's
actually or a module whatever you want
to call it and Python in order to be
able to use it we have to actually
import it so that's what we're telling
Python Python is very explicit about
anything you want to use you need to
make sure it's imported so we're go
ahead and copy this statement down here
we could say request equals get double
you know this needs to be the fully
spelled out URL so I will say new movies
comm I always want to go after my own
site just for examples because that way
nobody can say I'm hitting up their site
let's go ahead and see if this works in
Python 3.5 so I'll be running the wrong
file
my bad one second so I'm gonna set this
as my startup file there we go and run
it
and just returns a response back which
it does by default which is good so in
the URL world you always have 200 which
which equals success 404 equals page not
found 500 means server error 301 means
redirects so those are all those
different codes that are coming back
this one says 200 so it was this
successful call out to new movie so if I
want to actually get the value so we
could say print our dot text I think
that's what it is
let's go ahead and press play so now you
can see all this was printed out to the
screen watch what this actually did it
actually reached out across the web
visited a website named new movies so I
went to this website and it pulled down
all the HTML code and then printed it
out
so everything that makes up this home
page here was grabbed and placed into
here so now like in previous files if I
actually wanted to say hey I want to
scrape this website blah blah blah I
could actually say you know create an
out file so I'll say out file equals
open and then give it the actual path to
our project so just like we did in the
last video I could say Python 35
tutorial web to scrape dot txt I could
save this entire HTML files a txt and
then want to write it so I need to say
write to it I could say append if I
wanted to but then if I ran this twice
I'd have to webpages stacked on top of
each other so typically if I'm going to
be storing a webpage HTML source for
scraping I'd probably just want to make
sure I overwrite whatever's there so
that's why we just want to do the are
statement or let me start a W statement
for right and if you guys don't know
what I'm talking about with how to write
a file I have a video on that just a few
videos before this one so you guys can
learn all about that let's go ahead and
run this joint
actually it's not gonna do a damn thing
it'll create the file I forgot
 it will it will create the web to
scrape file but there's nothing there
because we actually didn't print
anything so I need to say I'll file dot
write equals R dot txt and R is this
right here so this this object comes
back and let's go ahead and do a pause
the execution here so you guys can see
what's going on and we want to go ahead
and close the out file like I said so it
closes off that memory stream so let's
go ahead and stop this I'll rerun it and
now we pause at this point here so we've
already let's actually look at my video
here so we've already I went out to the
web we grabbed it so R if we hover over
that in my editor you can see it's a
response object and it actually contains
all this information all this
information is information that's you
know this all consists of the request
object that came back so you have this
raw response it looks like it can be
read in memory and chunked and all this
stuff and that's all just complicated
stuff we're not going to get into right
now but you can see the headers so with
requests I didn't even set headers and
stuff so but if you're like trying to
you know be all sly and stuff like that
you probably want to set your header so
it looks like you're coming from like a
Firefox browser or something like that
you'll want to um I don't know basically
you can do all kinds of shite with this
stuff so let's go ahead and um we're
gonna output step through go ahead and
close it I'll finish the execution and
now if I go over to the folder I can say
web scrape and it's stored all of this
text if I went ahead and I search for
the title you can see new movies out you
know at home so if I wanted to you know
start parsing through this information I
could do that I could start you know
grabbing data now something with new
movies in like a lot of modern sites
nowadays new movies although I don't
like tout it like hey look at my site
it's great in all this but I mean I
don't even have time to maintain this
website but what I did do is
like a lot of this information there's
not even movies because I don't even
have an update anymore but this thing
used to scroll but there's not even more
than five movies that I have in here I
just I don't maintain it at all but the
bottom line that I was trying to say is
that like even this scrolling
functionality this is all JavaScript so
none of that stuff exists inside the
HTML source and you're gonna find that
if you're trying to scrape the web a lot
of the data that you're looking for only
exists inside the browser and its uses
JavaScript to display it so there's
other means that you have to do to get
that data and that's why if you're gonna
be scraping the web Python requests is
the best way to go because this guy this
is some basic text grabbing here it's
something that you used to use different
libraries and older versions of Python
but requests will allow you to get JSON
data a lot easier and allow you to like
log into websites and stuff like that
but it takes a lot of fiddling around
and it really it's a tutorial series on
its own and I do have other videos so if
you just search Chris Hawkes
request or Python request um you should
see I have several videos out there that
show how to post JSON data read JSON
data and all kinds of stuff like that so
definitely check that out there's some
of my better videos I think as far as
how to do some more complicated stuff
but make sure you don't try to you know
run before you know how to crawl yet
because um some of this stuff is
complicated and you can't just you know
jump into it on day one so start off
small and then start working your way up
alright guys um so that's how we
actually request a web page with place
