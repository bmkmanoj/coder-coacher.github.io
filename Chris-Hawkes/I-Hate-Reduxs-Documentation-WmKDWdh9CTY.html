just wanted to take a moment to talk
about some of these blogs that i read
online which actually drive me crazy let
me start by saying that I am using Redux
for a project and for the record I don't
like redox I've used Redux quite a bit I
think it's an utter pile of to be
honest with you it hasn't grown on me
yet I'm sure it maybe it will actually I
probably always hate it I really do I
feel like redox makes everybody's life
more complicated where it's supposed to
make things easier it's supposed to
create this unified state and it's just
a whole bunch of onboarding to get
essentially nowhere in my opinion when
it came to just regular raw react and
and having react components handle state
and then maybe a little bit of state
management between components through
javascript events and things like that
no big deal everything worked fine it
was all great the boilerplate behind
redox is a mother effing nightmare and
it's just it to me it is like you know a
pinpoint example of why the JavaScript
community is falling apart at the seams
now redux is apparently not required for
react but everybody uses it with react
it's almost like a one in one
combination but redux can be used with
other projects the entire purpose of it
guys is that it's a a purely functional
state management system so instead of
individual components managing state on
their own you have this centralized
state in each component communicates
with the state and everything's just
supposed to work great but here's the
you know the first thing that I
absolutely hate about Redux is that here
is the usage with react and now at the
moment we have this this split basically
where it's like do you write your code
in es2015 which is the latest JavaScript
and use be able to compile it which
means do you use classes and the
constant keyword the arrow functions and
all this other stuff that es2015
supports but has to be compiled down
using Babel and web pack and all this
other the question is you know is
the documentation that you're looking
for is it es2015
specific and most likely is if you're
trying to be the latest and greatest but
you know the documentation for redox and
react is all over the place when it
comes to the older standards versus the
new and it's mostly older standards so
when you're trying to use a new it's
even more frustrating but here's the
usage with react guys and this is just
to get a simple to do application
working with react and redox and and
really the complication all lives I
think with just redux so I mean you're
installing this react Redux tool which
is an additional tool not just with
react or with rya redox those are two
separate things this is react redox an
entire project just so that the two can
intermingle together properly so then
you have what he's talking about with
presentational and container components
okay that is where you also lose me
because it's like god damn it this is
supposed to be an example we don't need
to worry about like presentational
versus container let's just focus on a
simple hello world let's get up and
running with a unified store so that
people can understand how this bitch
works before we start working you know
worrying about this opinionated
presentation versus going to me it's
like this obsessive compulsive disorder
with the author saying it you know this
is my preferred way of handling you a
unified state and then on top of that
you're going to use presentational and
container components because I know what
the I'm doing and all this other
 sorry I'm ranting because
tonight I'm just kind of irritated with
the entire process of of redox I think
the project sucks and it's and I know
there's a lot of hard work has gone into
it but oh man I mean it I liked old
school react better than this
and I know that Facebook hired this guy
now even with the flux architectural
pattern I found it to be better than
redox but anyway let's continue on so he
starts going into all this stuff and
he's talking about designing component
hierarchy which is you know obviously
very similar to what react would get
into but then you guys like all this
visible to do list filter link other
components implementing components here
is now he's talking about presentational
components and then we're talking about
this and here we're not even creating
like but we're not we're not creating
actual
classes from within reacts components so
he's just going into examples of how
he's breaking everything up into
individual files which is another
mistake i think i mean the initial
instructions should just simply be okay
get a store up and running get a
component showing on your actual app so
with this I mean there's just one
component after another that you have to
create and link them all together so
you're using imports and all this stuff
which means that you have to have some
sort of common J's loader so it's
assuming that you're going to be using
gulp or web pack or something that's
going to tie all this stuff together
because otherwise you're not going to
get everything running and then good
luck with that too because in addition
to all that crap i can tell you that
some of the stuff you're going to run
into you're going to need to have es2015
as a preset you're going to have react
as a preset you're going to tell it to
like do stuff like you know ignoring
your node modules taking a nap Jass and
outputting a bundle jas and that's just
some of the basics and obviously need to
have babel install because it's going to
be using babel to actually compile all
this stuff so then as we continue to
move on down the line you have you know
things that he's using here like here
he's using the Lena this lambda which is
um you're relatively new or really it's
a arrow function i'm sorry i consider it
to lambda but it's the arrow function
and then you know here this prop types
and stuff like that so this is uh this
is a different way of doing prop types
because then you know there's all this
this is the more boilerplate version but
then even before we get into a working
example they start shooting other
alternatives to how you can try to
solidify all this stuff another thing
too is they're talking about out at some
points are using constants where maybe
you know we don't need a constants or
even be able you know we don't even need
to talk about an actual constants
variable or even whether or not it
should be in its own file or a separate
file that's all stuff that like once
again this is just way too too much
documentation for a simple let me give
you an example of how all this stuff
ties together because I don't feel like
reading all this to be honest with
you but i guess i'm forced to as a
developer that's trying to get into this
and then for any newbies i mean
that's another it's just a daunting task
and here it's using the Kinect it's like
well what the hell is that connect oh
you have to import the the kinect up
here from react redox so it's a specific
thing well what the hell is it doing
okay map dispatch the props what is all
this stuff help or keywords I mean just
all opinionated all opinionated stuff in
my opinion I don't know man this this
this project I absolutely hate it and
once again I'm sure there's a ton of
hard work i'm sure the Creator is very
smart and all this stuff but you know
even this the you know the kinect
function the exporting default we're not
using es6 of classes and the examples
here and here's a using the Kinect but
it's using in a different way it's like
well why is he using in a different way
here and not the other way and then and
then you have also that the configuring
of your actual store which is the
goddamn gonna keep hitting the back one
you know the configuring of the store to
actually set up your your your unified
state and all this stuff and then here's
some other components and then passing
the store I think we looked at this
already but anyway guys I think this is
way too much crap that you have to jump
through in order to get a simple tight
you know just the simplest react Redux
application running I gotta deal with
all this horseshit I mean it's just it's
absolutely crazy and once again it's one
of the reasons why the JavaScript
community sucks right now because you're
going to have to learn redux everybody
thinks it's the hottest thing out there
right now and I even said it's one of
the top projects to learn in 2017 not
like I you know I'm not recommending it
I'm just recommending it as saying that
you know that's where the community is
headed everybody loves is purely
functional stuff and you know this
unidirectional data flow centralized
store blah blah blah anyway I'm going to
continue to try to get all this crap
working in my my Python tornado app and
and continuing to hate redox all right
guys talk to you later bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a 12
week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here and now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
