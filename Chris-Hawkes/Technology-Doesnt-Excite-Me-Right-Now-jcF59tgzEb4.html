be negative just a little bit and I know
that's not surprising to a lot of you
guys I can actually be a little bit of a
negative nancy at times and that's just
the way I am I actually feel like a more
of a realist but I'm definitely a
somewhat of a pessimist at times um but
one of the things that has just kind of
occurred to me and I think is just
temporary but like right now I am not
excited about technology night I don't
know that it's not programming it's not
like I'm not excited about programming
or whatever anything's changed like that
in fact I still enjoy programming but
I'm wondering like you know what is the
next thing that is going to excite me I
guess because for instance i recently I
went out and I bought a telescope that
doesn't have anything to do with
technology but when I was looking at the
telescope I was like you know what I can
buy like a 4k TV where i can buy this
tells but i was looking for something to
actually to have a hobby so i ended up
getting the telescope which is much
better than just sitting on my ass
watching TV but when i was looking at
like the 4k tvs and I'm thinking okay
just you know is my playstation 4 even
going to to work with this 4k TV and I
didn't even do enough research into it
because i wasn't going to buy it anyway
but you know as I look around I realized
that there's just not that much 4k
content and that's probably why 4k TVs
are relatively cheap but I mean 4k TVs
have not gotten me excited like HD like
I remember when I bought my first HD
flat screen TV it was a sony bravia it
was like two thousand eight so I
couldn't afford you know things even
back then and I remember I explores i
smelling eight hundred dollars on some
tax return money that I got that I ended
up using on that and I probably
shouldn't have but it was truly exciting
when I got the first flat screen because
like we was seeing something in 1080p
was just absolutely amazing when my
previous TV before that was a humongous
like philips TV that was a huge box had
the backside on it and the thing was a
monster i hated moving that thing but
you know the HDTV though was it was
something brand-new was like wow this is
crisp and when i plugged in my
playstation 3 the first
I bought a PlayStation 3 dad had me
excited I had built in blu ray when you
went had obviously 1080p capabilities
they had you know the Wi-Fi and all that
stuff so when I hope that thing to the
internet and i was playing call of duty
modern warfare like that was a
mind-blowing experience to me because
before that i wasn't really into this
online gaming so i understand people
were doing computer games online and
stuff like that but for me i wasn't
really doing anything online in fact the
first splurge into online gaming that I
was doing was probably playing this this
game called the ship which was like back
in like two thousand six or so so it was
like so even though online gaming was
you know around before that I wasn't
really doing it and I wasn't a huge
gamer even back then because I was just
working too much you know to be able to
play games very often but when i got
that playstation 3 and then I started
playing online like the whole thing I
was just like wow this is pretty amazing
and I started playing with my relatives
and you know and then we got the
headsets involved in even before I even
had the whole headsets involved like it
was just really awesome seeing you know
people that was playing with running
around on the screens because for me
like I remember my first game system
growing up in the 80s I had a calico
game system that played games like
pac-man and stuff like that and my
stepfather had it when he was a guess a
kid or something and he ended up giving
it to me but that was my first game
system that I had in my room we got a
Nintendo shortly after that and you know
I remember super mario 3 being big time
or you know playing late night with my
uncle Super Mario 2 and didn't like
Super Mario to very much they deviated
quite a bit from the whole Super Mario
one when they went to two and I mean it
was I did like it I guess but it was
just it was really different and but the
point I'm trying to make is that like
gaming got me excited again once i
started doing this whole online gaming I
was like wow there's there's this this
is awesome like I mean it
going to be big and to date it still is
but you know now I have a playstation 4
and it almost feels like like right now
there's not a whole lot of titles that
are coming out in fact I've heard more
about indie games than I've ever had in
my entire life and I have nothing
against indy games but some of these
indie games like aren't that good I mean
they remind me of games that I played
back in 28 he's like you know some of ya
some of these 80s games I guess people
like this whole nostalgia of feel to it
but I'm just wondering like you know
where is the creativity and the problem
with some of the gaming now is like you
have games that are spending more than
big blockbuster Hollywood movies be and
they're so damn expensive and if they
flop then your game companies can
literally go out of business like you
know even the game that was put out by
Rockstar called LA noire that studio
went out of business which was team bond
died and it's just surprisingly they
pour in so much resources and it takes
years to make this game and the game was
a hit and they still go out of business
and I think in a way like you've raised
the stakes so much that it's so much it
costs so much money to make a triple a
title that a lot of companies just don't
want to do it and then you look at
somebody like Minecraft where you have a
33 year old Swede programmer who becomes
a billionaire over you know this game
because it was fun like the game was
awesome this whole genre of survival is
still not even tapped into enough now so
it's just interesting because right now
technology doesn't have me excited I
have a Samsung s7 phone even when I
bought this phone here I just got it not
even that long ago and I bought the
phone because it was the latest woman
before that had two s5 wasn't in any
hurry to get in s6 and if the s8 comes
out I could give a crap I'm not buying
it maybe two or three years when like my
phone's paid off my contracts up or
whatever then I'll buy another phone but
I'm not in any hurry to go out and buy
another thousand-dollar phone I don't
need it what else oh yeah VR virtual
reality okay so i got this 100-dollar
Samsung VR headset which has the
Gilles technology but it's it's not very
good like it I'm stepping that it's it's
cool it's really cool with very gimmicky
or whatever and I look at it on my med
school but like honestly guys I've had
this thing for four months maybe and
I've used it maybe god damn it phone
keeps going off one second I've had it
for sorry I shouldn't say God either a
lot of people get upset about that um
but anyway I've had it for months and I
don't use it why don't why don't I use
it probably because it's not that it's
not that usable I mean the game is that
you get for pretty much suck I need to
go out and buy a bluetooth controller
for though because I would play
Minecraft but that would be pretty cool
but i'm not a huge gamer i don't have
enough time to actually play the games
uh like to play i do you play with my my
brother when I can so I'm excited for
the new battlefield that would be cool i
think but honestly that could be a
disappointment to because you can
clearly see that it's got some great
graphics and stuff like that but you
know if the mechanics like four for the
vehicles or anything like what it was
and the battlefront game it's going to
you know the the the vehicles in
battlefront were absolutely horrendous
the game looked great but it didn't have
nearly the replayability of something
like battlefield 4 so I'm hoping this
battlefield one yo is going to be going
to be cool because I do like the
destructive warfare and all that stuff I
used to be a call of duty guy but battle
battlefield I think definitely took over
once battlefield 4 came out like I was
hooked on the battlefield series so what
am I excited about Google is going to
announce something on October fourth and
I could really give a if it's a new
operating system or a new phone if it's
a new operating system i'm not going to
be switching from windows I not that i
know not I'm not that I can see
nonetheless maybe you know maybe three
to five years what else so it could be a
new phone but you know I don't I don't
need a new phone windows 7 was our
windows phone was a complete disaster I
don't think even with Google the fact
that they make better technology than
Microsoft I don't think it's going to be
it would have to be a pretty damn big
game changing phone and we've seen stuff
from google that has failed everybody
acts
Google's never created failures they
they create failures all the time look
at Google glass I mean they were talking
about google glass search sergey brin
was wearing it on his face and all of a
sudden nobody's talking about google
glass nobody gives a about it it
was it was twenty five hundred dollar
pair of glasses that invaded people's
privacy and made you look like a weirdo
but I don't know man i'm not trying to
splurge twenty five hundred dollars on a
product that's not not this whole the
reason why i'm about a fork a lie i
could buy the 4k TV now I mean you can
buy them for like five or six hundred
bucks the cheaper ones and but there's
no content so it's like why why am I
gonna do that I'll just stick with my
1080p for right now because it's good
enough what else oh yeah I mean like I
said there's really not much like I mean
if we're going to talk about languages
okay we're going to talk about react I'm
going to jump on the react bandwagon
I've been on the react bandwagon since
like 2014 and as I started maturing as a
senior developer I start to realize that
you know the shiniest tool isn't the
best best tool for the job not
necessarily sometimes it is sometimes it
isn't but you know it is it going to be
the newest version of Python like I like
Python 35 I mean I I guess they're
working on Python 36 but once again we
saw this big disconnect between people
getting off Python 2 to get on Python 3
the Python 3 transition from Python 2
has been a complete travesty I mean what
is a decade in the making now not as bad
as perl though pearl came out and talked
about a Perl 6 4 15 16 years and they
finally came out in December and still
nobody is using that now we can talk
about typescript like people may be
getting excited four types great because
because it brings a little bit more
sanity to JavaScript development but
then you know there there's still more
people probably using Babel and an MP
M&amp;amp;M pm's disaster in its own right so
what else do we have YouTube is exciting
if we talk about game-changing websites
websites that have changed my life
obviously i would i would say youtube
because i have this channel and but not
only that just the people that I'd
watched the fact I've
learn a lot of things on YouTube from
like how to fix my car to my garage lay
all kinds of different things I learned
on youtube from people like me that
teach other people how to do stuff that
they learn so i think you know YouTube
has made society a better place in a lot
of ways I look at facebook okay facebook
i give them credit because they were a
social networking company that did it
right but they're boring right i mean
the kids aren't even using facebook
anymore and i say kids i'm talking like
you know 10 to 18 i mean facebook is not
the cool place to be there on kik and
they're on other places they're not on
facebook so that's let's talk about the
latest social networking sites and stuff
like the instagrams and the snapshots of
the world not a bit really interests me
I mean they're okay but like they're not
it's just not the same exciting thing
okay tumblr tumblr oh my god that i
wouldn't yahoo bought tumblr i said that
is a big ass waste of money spent a
billion dollars on tumblr on it and when
their company is sinking financially and
they i don't know i think it was a
terrible move i thought was terrible
move at the time I don't think I've ever
blogged about it but it was certainly a
terrible move I think it obviously
didn't pay off for them so we going to
talk about like online e-commerce I mean
of who's doing it better than anybody
else tripAdvisor's a good side i do like
what tripadvisor's doing I mean I find I
find a lot of use at a tripadvisor if i
compare a tripadvisor to yelp
tripadvisor actually offers me a service
but it's not like I I get like super
excited about it you know not like when
myspace or facebook came out when
myspace and Facebook came out I was like
damn you know I'm getting set up on
facebook and I got friends like I was
excited about it but right now no like I
mean maybe it's because I'm a program
I'm just later but you know where are
these exciting sites i'm not going to
get on kik and start talking to a bunch
of strangers I don't have any need for
that I know a lot of pedophiles and
stuff like that go on that site in fact
I got some major issues we kick that I
plan on addressing in another video but
yeah i mean like so where are we at like
maybe SpaceX like the whole space travel
and stuff like that that's pretty cool i
like what NASA is doing with sending you
know like the Juno spacecraft and
everything that's pretty sweet
artificial intelligence might be cool
Internet of Things everybody wants talk
about Internet of Things guys why the
hell do you need youtube in your
refrigerator I mean I went to bestbuy
and there's this you know LCD screen on
the refrigerator that hooks up to your
Wi-Fi why why do I need to oh I can draw
a little note I'm like on my
refrigerator it's a cool feature if you
want to spend a thousand dollars extra
on a refrigerator for something you
don't need because I'll tell you what
you can go to Walmart and buy a
ten-dollar little nice little you know
magnetic thing that you can put on your
refrigerator and draw on that son of
bitch all day long except it doesn't
have a thousand-dollar LCD screen that's
going to cost a ton of money when it
breaks or I mean I mean probably people
wouldn't even get it replaced but
something like okay well I want to get
my my my refrigerator to start ordering
food for me when it starts running low
or something like that no thank you to
that because I mean we can't even get
our web security on under control yet I
mean every other day you're hearing
about some major breach of data and like
until people can get that under
control like I'm not trying to set up a
bunch of TV cameras around my house so
that people can hack in and start spying
on me already I mean I have a webcam and
the FBI director says that you should
put you know you should disconnect your
webcam because it can be it can be
hacked you could have your audio hack
you could have your emails hacked I mean
until they get more control over that
 why would I want my baby monitor or
my my house security or anything like
that hooked up to the Internet I
wouldn't I don't know guys like I'm
saying like so maybe you guys can fill
me in but right now I would say I'm not
excited about anything if Google get it
comes out with a new phone is it going
to be a new operating system for that
phone that's going to create a new app
craze that like we had with Android
because that was fun when that happened
I missed that bandwagon so I I didn't
get that chance to to jump on that whole
make an appt for all this different
crazy stuff but now that threshold has
been raised to a point i was talking
about this the other night work if you
don't have a really good app you might
as well not even bother because people
aren't going to buy it you know they're
not going to buy it that's another thing
to nobody pays for anything whether it's
whether you're trying to do a
certificate for a free course you're
offering online nobody pays for anything
in fact two out of three Millennials now
run ad blockers so that people like me
doing this or people that write and blog
on their websites and stuff like that
cannot make any revenue let alone major
companies that provide news data which
is all bias and for the most part anyway
depending on which sites are going to
but you know the people are struggling
to make money because nobody wants to
buy anything now another website though
that did actually i would say excite me
in some way i think zillow is a very
good site zillow does real estate right
like they're a very very efficient site
when it comes to shopping and that
actually is a game changer because
there's a lot of real estate agents and
things that people prove that they rely
on but zillow is actually doing away
with all of that like they you don't
even really need a real estate agent to
take you from house to house the house
because you have all that stuff now they
don't have everywhere every how it's not
like a you know some of the realtor's
with their back-end access to like the
MRI us database but zillow has most of
that stuff so that they can help you out
there we can talk about game development
with the unity or something but even
unity it's like you know it's got some
issues I mean people try to to make some
out and most of the games that give a
release for unity or pretty terrible
some are ok like seven days to die I
like that game although I got
ridiculously terrible reviews and it had
some major major bugs in it but some of
those bugs are funny and I actually had
a lot i got a kick out of playing that
with my my brother but you know i would
say for a time it was very exciting what
was going on with game engines unity
pressure on Unreal Engine to make their
stuff free and and n DS can now you know
make a full title game and then make
money on the back end if they made money
so you know that whole model but once
again it all boils down it's not like
unity or unreal wanted to do that they
did that because nobody wants to buy
anything so in me wait so where is
everything headed guys I mean software I
guess you can make software but even if
you were going to make like a cartoon
software or a new video editing software
something that the stakes are raised to
the point where like you as a single man
operation it's going to be difficult to
succeed there you could be a vlogger a
youtube vlogger but honestly everybody
and their mother is trying to do that
right now and people be like well Chris
why do you have an audience or what
about I actually don't know but I also
know that i started this almost four
years ago and people that are starting
it now having even more uphill battle
than they did you know obviously four
years ago and the people that started
four years before me those guys are all
way up above me and all that stuff and
probably always will be but you never
know where things are going to be headed
I mean now Facebook's talking about
doing videos and lowering away youtube
audience and from what I've seen a
facebook like I don't even like their
for their their entire user interface
and platform I think sucks compared to
YouTube even when it comes to uploading
videos and stuff like that like the
whole thing sucks and we talked about
this with facebook and idiocracy the
last time I checked my facebook wall I
I've never seen so much idiot nonsense
in my life like it was just one thing
after another of just people sharing
stuff they shouldn't share you know
sharing all these tongue links these
photos these means incorrect stats
incorrect quotes like it's just and
that's worth three billion dollars a
year like profit I mean Facebook's
making a ton of money but they're also
ruining their platform in the process I
think so yeah guys once again this is a
video man just to kind of be real I
don't think I'm being negative
gumby I'm real like where is the
excitement what is going to be the next
thing and I'm not saying don't be a
developer because what if anything it
means become a developer and work on the
next best thing you know may get us
excited on something I mean but right
now I'm not excited man there's no money
in content you can produce a content
really a website good luck making any
money with that Google Google controls
all the rules when it comes to whether
or not your website is going to be seen
or not you could spend millions on
advertising if you had that kind of
money to get your stuff out there but
short of that you play by the rules that
Google sets and it can sometimes take a
long time and sometimes no matter how
hard you try it doesn't really work so
you mean I've had all kinds of different
content related websites where I focus a
lot on writing and and things like that
and keeping it up-to-date and not not
one of those has even remotely come
close to paying off to even be remotely
close to being worthwhile and anyway
guys let me know man is there some
exciting stuff out there that I'm not
not seeing right now and I would
appreciate that and maybe I can make a
video on it all right got it thanks for
watching bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
