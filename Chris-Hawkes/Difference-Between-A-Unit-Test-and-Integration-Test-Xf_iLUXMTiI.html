respond to a few questions that I have
regarding unit tests I made a video the
other day which is unit testing with
mocha for beginners and I was trying to
give an idea on what it is you're gonna
see in the wild with a lot of this unit
testing stuff now most so unit tests by
definition it should be testing isolated
chunks of code so you never want to have
a unit test that relies on some sort of
service that you have to call so for
instance if I have a service that makes
a call to a back-end API and I expect
that if I pass Apple that I'm going to
get like let's just say apple tree back
and if I wrote a test around that then
the test itself would be it would have
to be reliant upon the fact that whoever
is executing the test on whatever PC
that it has firewall rules in place that
it could reach across the web and make
that API call that the API service
itself is up there's all kinds of things
that you have to then assume is in
working order in order for that unit
tests to pass so so unit tests aren't
actually written around that sort of
thing you know that instead you want to
think of your code as an encapsulated
which just means like a box 10 present
that has all of your logic inside of it
and by writing another you know unit
test for that that present where you're
testing all the assertions and all that
stuff of what that code should do then
that is you know by definition what a
unit test is so if you're testing though
downstream services which that could be
called you know a downstream service so
you're making an API call to some
service that exists or you know across
development teams and maybe across the
world who knows but that can be
considered like a downstream service
that you're interacting with and that
also should be tested but that's
actually tested and an integration test
and you know unfortunately no matter how
many integration tests you run you could
still run into problems because you know
some server factory that actually houses
all the code and the API itself goes
down because of a power outage or fire a
terrorist attack or who knows like you
know so those particular tests like
they're important to do to make sure
of your services are working together
they're actually not as important as
actually testing individual chunks of
logic which is what these unit tests are
written around so there have been times
especially in like you know when you
hear like terms like test-driven
development where literally the unit
test is written before any code is
written that's a pretty hardcore way of
going about coding but it can also it
really challenges you know what you
expect your code to do and it and it
helps you I think if you do that enough
to be able to write it that way but most
people don't don't write code that way
instead you know we're writing logic and
and sometimes our logic is is finicky
and under a time pressure and time
crunch and all that stuff and we're just
trying to get the damn thing to work and
then we're going to write unit tests
around you know that that crappy logic
and that's what you actually see a lot
of times but even still even if you did
a rush job and you didn't you know you
get to do it as well as you'd want a
unit test can still actually notify you
to potential problems that you didn't
see when you were writing the code so
there's been plenty of currencies of
that but then there's also been plenty
of occurrences of where I'm trying to
write unit tests to satisfy some you
know condition in order to get my code
checked in on a Friday afternoon that's
going to end up going into production
and the code itself is probably not as
great as what I want it to be and you
know unfortunately you know that's just
kind of the world that we live in like
yeah unit tests are important but at the
same time like you know unit testing can
I think be yeah I think it can be taken
to the extreme and that's something that
I've talked about in previous videos
where I say you know is a hundred
percent code coverage really necessary
in case you guys want to know what code
coverage is if a plus B can equal C then
you know that you just need to write a
test at a plus B we'll see but in most
realities you have if statements inside
there you'll say if a is less than B
then instead of equaling C it equals D
so now you have to write a test for that
and then you have to write a test for
your typical assertion that a plus B
equals C so that is like in a nutshell
kind of like you know the 100% code
coverage so you'd have two unit tests
one for each of those possible
outcomes now gets really difficult
when you have 15 possible outcomes
within a class or you know a few methods
and your writing unit tests around all
that stuff and then you end up spending
75 percent of your time writing unit
tests instead of actual code and all
that is well and good if the logic is
sound than the unit tests are written
around that logic is sound because the
benefit is that once the unit test is
written about it if somebody comes along
they should be able to read the unit
test and understand what the code is
doing or if they try to check in
something that's going to end up
breaking your code then the unit test
will notify you that somebody you know
created a problem and that's also that's
very very helpful but here's what
happens in the real world the real world
people write code and then they
write tests around the code so
that it passes and it looks like the
code is sound but really the code is
 and that's just the reality that we
live in so I'm not and I will never be
the one to tell you guys that like I can
just go in and like write perfect code
and other people write Shaco like okay
there are some people that write
code I've written code like
everybody does it I think on occasion
and like I don't want to be one of those
people that never you know that there's
like basically looked upon as as
somebody who doesn't make mistakes and
things like that so so don't get me
wrong but there is some garbage code out
there that have some garbage tests
written around it and people were making
jokes on this video that do you write
unit tests for the unit testing and you
probably should because honestly some of
the code is garbage like I've seen
people literally change their tests to
where like they run a test and they're
like oh that returns five why's
that returning five oh it I'm just
going to go ahead and assert that it
returns five and you know and and
they're probably being notified of the
problem you know that there's some sort
of problem but they don't have time or
that you know the patience to go through
and try to figure out why it is that it
didn't pass the first time I also made a
comment in this video if a test if I
write a bunch of tests and I run it and
they all just pass then my first
inclination is to say I just messed
something up or the tests aren't working
correctly that's just like maybe it's a
lack of confidence but it's also knowing
that you know typically when I'm writing
and I write Testament on that code that
my assumptions of what the code is doing
is not correct it's not a hundred
percent correct anyway so that's my
thoughts on it guys um you just make
sure you know that unit tests are about
isolated chunks of code that you're
testing your testing logic and that
logic shouldn't be determined on or
shouldn't have it's you know it's fail
or passed test based off of you know
anything that can end up breaking in the
wild which you know incurs includes like
you know API calls to downstream
services and things like that so you
know keep that in mind integration test
is testing those you know those into end
services to make sure that they all work
correctly and they mesh well that's why
you see a lot of QA departments that are
actually testing code and yeah so those
are basically the two terms that I'll
just focus on in this video but that is
something that definitely keep them
confused me when I was first getting
started and it's something after years
and years of working in the corporate
environment that is absolutely true
alright guys thanks for watching you
guys have a good day make sure you
subscribe and take care bye hey guys so
a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're gonna need to do as a developer
as soon as you start they're going to be
teaching you in this and this coding
bootcamp and the entire goal is to be
able to get you into the industry within
12 weeks so if you guys are interested
in learning more information about dev
mountain coding bootcamp just check out
the link in the description tab of this
video thank you for watching and have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
