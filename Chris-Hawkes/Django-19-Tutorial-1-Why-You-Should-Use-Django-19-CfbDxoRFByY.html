tutorial series is the first one I've
done in a little while so hopefully
we'll be able to get this thing going
what we're gonna be using is Django 1.9
which is the latest version of Django
out there right now and in order to get
Django running you actually have to have
Python installed so I'm gonna go ahead
and do that now we're gonna use the
latest version of Python and just a bit
of a background about Django in case you
have never used it before it's a great
web framework out that's available it's
open source meaning that it was actually
not owned by one it's not owned by one
particular company or anything like that
the Django Software Foundation is
basically an organization so it's a
non-profit and they control the
corporate direction of the Django
project and it's been around since about
2005 so the history of it is that it was
originally a newspaper company that was
building an online website for like you
know Washington Post at the site and
they originally created this django web
framework writing it out of the Python
programming language within a couple of
years they went ahead and they open
sourced it so they just turned the
project over to the community to
continue to build and advance it so
that's what we've seen since about 2000
I guess 7 or so I'm guessing on that
figure you if you're really that
interested go ahead and look it up but I
think it's approximately pretty close
there so once the open source community
took hold of it they really expanded it
over the years
Django's grown into quite a large web
framework so it compares to if you've
ever heard of other frameworks like Ruby
on Rails or asp.net so django is in the
same realm as both of those a reason why
you would want to use Django is that
there's a couple of really major
websites out there they're actually
written in Django one being
instagram.com their entire stack is
no next one would be Pinterest comm and
Pinterest is at one point they were the
fastest-growing website in the world so
their entire stack is Django if you've
ever seen discussed which is commonly on
like you know blogs and stuff like that
where you have commenting and everything
they they actually scaled over 7 billion
monthly views on a Django stack so you
know be that you know so it's saying
that there's criticisms out there people
are like well maybe I want to use Ruby
or I want to use node no it's faster or
ASP c-sharp pythons interpreted and
you'll hear all these different you know
catchphrases about why Python may not be
the best choice but the fact of the
matter is I have several videos on what
Python is one of the most popular
languages to learn in addition to that
if you look at like indeed.com trends
for Django jobs Django has been
exploding for quite some time rails is
gonna have it beat when it comes to
overall jobs but python is still on the
up-and-up when it comes to popularity if
you look at the actual growth figures
you can see the Django and blue here is
actually like exploding and growth
compared to to rail so rails is kind of
just you know they kind of peaked a few
years ago and Django is you know really
on the up and up so if you look at um
you know just Django by itself as far as
its growth um it continues to just kind
of skyrocket since it was open source
around 2008 now those are just a few of
the top sites that I mentioned that are
running a Django stack but there's
literally hundreds of them and some
major companies out there like National
Geographic the onion just a ton of
different Django sites out there so a
good reason to learn it is not just
because it's good for your project but
also because that if you're good enough
at it that there's a large community for
it and that there's also a lot of jobs
available for it and it's you know it
continues to see popularity increases I
just recently did a video where I
compared Django to note I spent a few
months building a node framework and I
basically came to the
that on a website that I'm trying to
create where I'm basically just trying
to display information from a database
there's absolutely absolutely no reason
why I would want to use node over django
Django has a built-in administration so
this is something that wouldn't come out
of the box with a node background or a
node a node framework the Django admin
is a pretty popular item it's actually
been since like 2006 included with
Django and it's it's it's a huge selling
point so ultimately I wish I had some I
can actually show you guys a website
that I have and this websites actually
gonna be taken down and redone but
here's this admin administration system
that I was telling you about where you
know you can actually monitor all of the
all of the items in your database so if
you look at something like this these
are all movies inside of a you know
movie database and when I go in here you
can see all kinds of information a lot
of it's missing like here's a movie that
I know I'd have a lot of information
about so you go in here and I you could
just visualize your data so you know
having an administration system is
extremely important one of the most
important things is that when you look
at like the users these are all
registered users of the site and certain
users have different privileges right so
you click on a user this person really
has no privileges but you can assign it
certain privileges and things like that
all of that works out of the box so
something like that is really invaluable
for what most websites need typically
you need to have something where you can
manage somebody's privileges and stuff
like that I spent several months as a
programmer for 5 years now with quite a
bit of JavaScript experience but I spent
several months writing a no js' website
where I was actually writing that
authentication code and all that stuff
eventually I got to the point I said
well what the hell am i doing why am I
gonna do that when I can just go with
Django so I'm going back to Django and
I'm
to build the website and this whole
tutorial series is around why you want
to use Django how to use it and we're
gonna start with a 1.9 and we're gonna
go from there
what the was that so anyway we're
gonna start with a 1.9 and work our way
up so this is the video of why you want
to get on django Django is awesome
framework and we're gonna get started so
I'm just continue to follow me in the
next video guys thanks for watching and
have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
