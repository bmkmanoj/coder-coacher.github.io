video what I want to do is um show you
guys about templates templates is what
works with Django projects so we can
display HTML and stuff like that for the
web pages that get requested so it's a
big part of what we're gonna do with
Django so what we want to do is go into
our project so like in my case I have a
movie death folder and then we have my
project and everything sits inside there
so inside the my project folder or
whatever you named your project we're
gonna create another folder and we'll
call it templates and then I'm gonna
create another folder called static and
then inside static I'm gonna create
three folders one for CSS one for
JavaScript which I'll call Jas and
another one for images right and then
we'll go back over here now a lot of
people asked how to override the Django
administration tag here within your
admin they won't even put it to their
website name or something just to make
it look a little bit more professional a
little bit more customized to their
needs in order to do that all we need to
do is go into well number one in our
settings file there's a templates
directory here so it's important that we
give it the path to where our templates
can be found in this case it's project
movie dev and then my project and then
templates so we're just giving it a path
to where the templates can be found now
if we want to override the text and the
Django admin since Django admin wraps up
with Django like it's all part of the
the Django installation we need to go to
where Django is installed in this case
if you've been following along we put
Django in our virtual and environment
which is under Python movies here so
wherever your virtual environment is you
want to go to that folder go to Lib site
packages in Django inside here you're
gonna go to contributes admin and then
go to base site and just copy this base
site HTML page now let's go back to the
project that we're working on a movie
dev my project templates now inside the
templates folder we're gonna create a
new folder called admin now inside admin
we're gonna go ahead and paste the base
layout page that we just copied from the
admin now what this is gonna do it's
actually gonna overwrite the the Django
admin page that is shipped with Django
by default so if this folder exists
within your templates Django knows to
use that particular page as opposed to
the one in that it shipped with so let's
go into our editor here and I'm gonna
refresh my folder layout and go into
your templates admin and your base site
and then this is where we can actually
change the site admin so we're gonna say
movie dev site admin and then movie
administration right now that we've done
that let's go ahead and refresh our
Django admin and you can see that the
changes have taken place so if we log
out go to log in again you see movie dev
administration it just looks cool it's
more like it's more like you know you
broke the code to do all this stuff that
ships with Django so it's pretty awesome
anyway I'm gonna wrap up this video here
with this templates discussion and we're
ready there to really move forward with
some of the views and things here pretty
soon so thank you for following along
and we're making good progress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
