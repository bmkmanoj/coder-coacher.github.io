I'm going to be doing videos probably
every every other day at least for a
couple weeks I just started this new job
in richmond virginia right now i'm in my
hometown of Fredericksburg Virginia and
you know I just want to make sure that
i'm giving it you know all the time and
attention that a new job deserves really
because there's a lot of responsibility
I've been with the same company for a
long time so now I'm with this new
companies there's a lot going on in my
life right now and I just feel like I
definitely can't do daily videos right
now so I just want to make sure you guys
are aware of the fact that I'll just be
going on probably every other day and a
lot of them will probably have to be
recorded on the weekend and then
released over the following week but
probably not for very long just for
right now and you know I definitely want
to stay connected with you guys so
thanks for watching thanks for
subscribing and you guys take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
