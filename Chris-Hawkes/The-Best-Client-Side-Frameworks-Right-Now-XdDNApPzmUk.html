talking about where we're at in these
front-end frameworks and what my
favorite ones are in 2018 and just for a
quick moment I need to mention my
sponsor for this so I wanted to take a
second to show you a new product that
template monster has and it's in a
school product that they're actually
using to train you how to use popular
open-source projects that they're
working with some of the projects
include Open Cart which is the PHP
ecommerce platform WordPress so they
have different courses on each one of
these technologies Joomla moto CMS and
then PrestaShop along with open cards so
those are the five five schools that
that template monster has just created
and released so if you guys could do me
a favor and go to the links in the
description tab below if you register as
a participant you're going to
automatically get five step-by-step
instruction emails every day sent to you
until you complete the course so make
sure you guys check out this new product
if you have any interest in wordpress
joomla moto CMS open car or PrestaShop
it's a great way to learn some
so why do I like react react I think it
has a very so reacts learning curve I
think is relatively high compared to
some of the other frameworks on here
especially the set up and that's
actually the biggest downside because
react uses something called JSX it's a
completely new syntax that you have to
learn which is like a cross between HTML
and JavaScript and that can really throw
people off I actually tried to learn it
on multiple occasions and I hated it so
much that I threw it away twice I was
just like I hate JSX I don't understand
why we're mixing HTML and JavaScript
into you know this mash of garbage but
anyway and it ended up growing on me
over time and I understood why the react
project was recommending JSX so anyway
but the learning curve there is is
pretty difficult so a lot of people are
like well I don't want to get involved
in react because of that the fact of the
matter is though react is a very it's an
exceptional project it's written by
Facebook it's open source it's now MIT
licensed it works very very well for
reusable components we've been talking
about going in the web components
direction for a long time where you
basically have HTML CSS JavaScript
isolated into a into an isolated
component which is very similar to like
what we had with jQuery plugins except
for the fact that you're not mixing in a
bunch of plugins and and all these like
script files in all this crap I'm mixing
it all together and hoping it works like
these self-contained components are
gonna be like they're gonna be
completely non reliant upon any other
part of the Dom and you should just be
able to drag them in and it should have
like a publicly exposed API well react
has been doing that for at least since
2011 with Facebook and it's the closest
thing we've had to a successful project
I think to building something that
really allows for reusable components as
easily as react does now again the
learning curve is a downside with reacts
is a functional programming language
written by a Harvard graduate
Evan completes key and elm is is a
project that has a ton of hype and it
can be considered a front-end language
but there is no like there's no
JavaScript or anything it actually it
compiles and renders HTML CSS and
JavaScript and everything for you the
examples of using it and unfortunately
are rather slim because everybody if
well for the language hype that Elm has
I don't understand why there's not more
examples of why this language is so
great the Elm is apparently if you write
it it has the ability to have very small
file sizes and also has no runtime
exceptions which could be great I guess
but like the thing is so you obviously
have to write your applications in a
functional way in an Elm way and I'm
just waiting for the community to kind
of build to pick up on that and just
kind of show me some examples of of why
we need to use Elm over something else
like I understand the benefits of it it
just seems like there's for all the hype
in the community we still don't have
enough examples this app is written in
elm right here and it's a very basic so
they give it on Elms website the built
with elm there's a few examples here Elm
is based off of the Haskell programming
language and like I said it's a
functional programming language so it's
a little bit more difficult than some
other traditional languages like
object-oriented languages or procedural
languages
another popular alternative angular has
much more real-world examples of some
pretty fantastic looking websites that
are built using it a much larger
community obviously than Elm but angular
definitely the community behind it has
shown that you can definitely scale with
angular you can use it for major
products even the federal government
here is using it
so one of the best alternatives to react
in the angular and the craziness of Elm
and all that stuff is actually view view
is very simplistic I love you because
just a simple file can be dropped into
my my template and I can start monkeying
around with views templating with its
view model data binding all that stuff
and like it just seems like it for me
the ease of getting into a view j/s
project is so much easier than having to
set up webpack babel and all the stuff
and es6 import like so all that can be
done obviously was view the same way can
be done with with react but the thing
was something like react is that the
overhead there is is quite complicated
for newbies and once you learn it it's
okay like I have a video I did a couple
weeks ago where I showed how to set up a
react project in three minutes a lot of
people didn't understand like the actual
HTML output and the complexities there
but it was mainly just a bunch of config
files in it was a working react.js
project that allowed for es6 imports and
also you know es6 compilation down to
older versions of javascript so I did
that in like three minutes but that took
you know a lot of time obviously to
figure out what do I need to install how
do I can set up my config and all that
stuff to get everything working together
and communicating together and these
days that's actually half the battle
being the developer is getting all these
different tools to communicate and work
with one another
that's more I think relevant now than
it's ever been and the computer
programming field so a sane alternative
is view Jas again it's so it's very
simplistic just easy to get started you
can drop a file into an HTML and start
plugging away like in this particular
example right here like seriously just
one file is included I can start
monkeying around with the code right
here no other setup is necessary it just
works
no no JSX compilations nothing like that
that you're gonna have and just just
once again you compare that to angular
or react or even Elm and you'll
understand what I'm talking about
another alternative is pre-act so if you
felt like reactive it's a little bit too
bloated and things like that then
pre-act isn't as an alternative for you
this is a project that seems beginning a
lot of steam but we have 18,000 stars so
it's a pretty healthy project a lot of
people involvement behind it and make
sure you guys check that out so if you
think that react is a little bit too
bloated then definitely that that's an
alternative
so while we're talking about
framework so you still have to mention
jQuery there there's so many websites
that are using jQuery and portions of it
like in this particular example this is
one of my favorite water are light boxes
for photo highlighting I just I just
love this theme it's better this
projects been around for several years
now and I just don't I still like it
it's it's pretty good now obviously this
is one particular thing it's not like
it's handling the entire view for you
but you can still use jQuery plugins
like this to handle your lightbox and
another one to handle your carousel
another one to to do all kinds of
different things you want it to do and
there's so much code written in jQuery
still so it's like it's a very
simplistic way I've been able to hide
and show and manipulate the Dom when you
have a lot of Dom manipulation it really
that's where it runs out if it's magic
and that's why we have tools like
knockout that came along which then
ended up transitioning into things like
react and angular and now view and and
then now you have like things like Elm
that are trying to solve the problems of
all of HTML javascript and CSS so that's
kind of where we're at but again you
still can't you can't gloss over jQuery
you could build some pretty phenomenal
websites with literally nothing other
than like bootstrap and jQuery that I've
seen it done I've done it in fact I
would recommend it for most websites
that don't need the complexity of react
and even pre-act or anything like that
so some other options for client-side
frameworks that are not as popular but
still have a pretty good following as
like mythril that's good irelia is a
project I got spun off of by one of
angular's top developers so but anyway
Brian is is another really popular one
because this is very simplistic very
small Google polymer I'm still waiting
to see whether or not this project is
going to take off I haven't seen much
adoption over this and they've been
talking about polymer now for a couple
of years and there's just isn't a huge
amount of adoption be stuff to mention
it another project is meteor so meteor
was gaining a lot of traction and a
couple years ago and it just seems like
lately I haven't heard a whole lot about
it but I don't work with meteor in any
sort of public or production capacity so
the final one I'll mention is ember
ember was a project it's another one
that's very similar that I feel like I
haven't heard as much about lately but
one thing I wanted to mention I'm not
gonna actually bring up full-stack
frameworks like asp.net obviously
there's a razor template engine that can
can handle your view and you can use
that over something like react or
angular if you wanted to but in this
video is not really about those those
full stack frameworks and while we're
talking about that we might as well
mention one of my favorite ones that
goes back for years which is pythons
Django so give it a quick shout out to
my Django peeps alright guys thank you
for watching and have a good day bye so
this video was brought to you by a dead
mountain coding boot camp there are a
boot camp that is based out of Utah but
they're also in Texas in Arizona now and
they have very good reviews so make sure
you guys check them out the link is in
the description tab below they offer
courses in web development iOS
development UX or user experience design
Quality Assurance and just a few other
ones in fact are even getting into
Salesforce as well now so they're
continuing to adapt their courses based
on what the market needs are and major
companies are hiring some of their
alumni so make sure you guys give them a
look they have great reviews and thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
