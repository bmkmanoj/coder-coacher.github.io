video in this beginning JavaScript
tutorial series for hipster code comm
and in the last video we looked at
statements expressions and operators and
for the most part we just need to focus
on the simple operators like
multiplication division subtraction and
other stuff so in this video let's go
ahead and look at the different variable
types that exists inside JavaScript
javascript is considered a dynamically
typed language because in some languages
it requires that you specifically state
ok this is the type that I'm going to be
using and you're like very clear about
laying it out and that's called a
statically typed language and JavaScript
is not a statically typed language it's
dynamically typed so there are variables
and the variable is a keyword within
JavaScript which just means declare a
variable which value can change but in
any programming language the type of
value is important because in order for
the program to know what it can do with
that variable it has to know what type
it belongs to types are things like
integers strings floating-point numbers
lists or arrays there's no list in
JavaScript but arrays and let's go ahead
and take a look here so if we say
variable x equals I am a string and
strings are in double quotes so this is
all one statement and you can see if I
say most a console dot log and you can
see that it prints out I am a string so
console dot log is also a very
convenient thing so instead of the
annoying alert pop-up message that we
use when we were doing alert hipster
code comm and the previous examples you
probably just want to use console dot
log in a lot of cases because console
dot log will give you a lot more
information about the object that you're
looking at so we'll get more into that
in a moment but for now X is a string so
how do we know let's say console log
type of and then we pass in
X you can see a return strength so
javascript knows that this is a string
the reason why it's a string is because
it's in double quotes we could also put
strings in single quotes so I could say
the same exact thing and by the way for
shorthand if you want to repeat anything
you've written into the console in the
past just use your up arrow and it will
start going through the statements that
we did but you could see if I do type of
X it's still a string so both single
quotes and double quotes can be used for
Strings now you're probably wondering
what a string is well string is just a
series of alphanumeric characters which
exist and they can be inside like entire
HTML pages can be a string an entire
novel can be a string or a single
sentence or just one single character
from the alphabet can be all considered
a string strings are important because
we obviously read text everywhere we go
so text is a very important thing now in
JavaScript everything is an object it's
an object-oriented language and we're
going to look at how complicated this
object hierarchy can be but for the most
part we just need to know that
everything in JavaScript is an actual
object so if I say console dot log X
this is just a simple value that gets
returned but things get a little bit
more complicated when we start looking
at like the X and we'll say proto so the
proto is these are two underscores in
front of the word proto and then 200
sors followed up and this actually will
return the parents objects prototype and
everything in javascript since it's an
object they always have a prototype that
the object was created from and this
will get more and more complex as we get
into the JavaScript language but for
right now just know that there is a
built-in type called string that exists
within JavaScript you remember how I was
saying it's important that JavaScript
knows what type it's dealing with
because there are certain things that it
can do with that type that it can't do
with other types so strings have things
like ends with or font color or all
these other things that you can see that
you can mess with because it's a string
but that does not exist if you're
dealing with a number so certain things
can be done with just strings and
certain things can be done with numbers
so let's look at if we were to change
the value of X and make it an integer so
now X is an integer or a number either
way but you can see that this number has
quite a bit a lot less stuff attached to
its prototype so there it can do not
nearly the amount of stuff that a string
can do but typically you need a string
to be able to do a lot of stuff because
integers are kind of cut and dry as to
what you need them to be but a string
can get much more complicated so you can
see that the different type matters so
what types exist in the JavaScript
language we've already looked at the
integer and/or number and we've looked
at the string if we look at the Mozilla
documentation on the JavaScript language
which is one of the best sources of
documentation for JavaScript out there
we can see that the way are called types
or data types and JavaScript there are
six of them and they're called
primitives so primitive means like I
always think of it like caveman like
primitive like you know early on and
says basically it means what came with
the language you can create your own
types and your own prototypes and and
those can all be touched upon in my
advanced JavaScript course we're not
going to touch on that in the beginning
JavaScript but what we need to know is
that there are six data types that are
considered primitives and it's a tough
word to swallow but you're going to hear
that especially when you start getting
into corporate JavaScript development
but primitives just means it came early
it was there it's already included in
the language so we can see a boolean and
let's look at the boolean we've already
looked at the number in the string but
let's look at the boolean a boolean is a
mathematical term but it also it means
true or false so in programming so many
things are based upon whether or not
something
true or is it false if it's this do this
if it's not do that so we see that a lot
with binary code and ones and zeros you
know if it's this do this and do that or
you know we see it with the
semiconductors with electronic you know
signals being passed through crystal
lattice set that consists of
semiconductors and our computer systems
and ultimately it boils down to logical
bullying's which means true or false 1
or 0 so if we said x equals true let's
print the the type of let's look at the
print of the proto so we can see it's a
boolean object okay so boolean has a few
functions that are attached on to it and
we'll get into functions later in the
next in one of the future videos but the
boolean is is is very important because
we can say x equals this you know x
equals hipster code and then if I said X
or let's just say if x equals sorry I
hook up there so if I said if x equals
hipster code you know what not if I'm
gonna say console dot log sorry console
dot log x equals hipster code so this
expression actually returned a true
value and true meaning it's a boolean
type in JavaScript one of the things I
want to mention also whenever you're
trying to equate is something equal to
something else you're going to use two
equal signs and that gets really
confusing sometimes because you're only
going to use one equal sign when you're
saying hey this needs to equal that but
if you're saying hey does this equal
that then you're going to see the double
equal sign what's even more confusing
than that and JavaScript is sometimes
you're going to see the triple equal
sign and the triple equal sign means not
only does your value equal that
pedestrian that does it does it equal it
100% basically so
in most Haitians are going to use the
double equal sign but you're going to
see the triple equal sign as well and
and the really the difference between
the two is that if you use a triple
equal sign it doesn't try to resolve the
type to make sure that you're not trying
to compare an integer to a string so
that doesn't get looked at it's simply
just looking at the value and whether or
not that value equals what it is that
you're trying to equate whether or not
it's equal to so there's a speed
performance and doing it that way but
don't worry about that when you're
beginning JavaScript but you will
sometimes see the double equal sign and
the triple equals sign and essentially
they are doing the same thing now
another interesting thing where the
JavaScript is that null is an actual
value type so if you said something
equals no then that is that is valid so
if I said variable x equals null I can
assign it a null value so if I say alert
X and you can see it's null it actually
has a value of null and null just means
empty or nothing or no lor void or mea
just but it's an actual type which is
weird so if I say console dot log type
of X you can see it's object is just a
standard object in JavaScript everything
ultimately comes from an object and when
we looked at the proto object that's
attached to all the variables that we
created before the proto said hey this
object that we're dealing with if it's a
string or a number or anything like that
where did it come from and we saw that
when we checked its proto we saw that it
came from the string object if we check
the prototype of the string object
eventually you're going to get all the
way up the chain to the topmost object
which isn't just a blank object in
JavaScript so everything is it's called
a object prototype and there's a
prototypical chain and JavaScript and
and ultimately as you go up that that
chain every object can essentially lead
back up
- and not just essentially but if
actually lead back up to that top level
object so you can think of everything in
JavaScript are objects they all derived
from objects derive mean like born from
so everything's born from this object
and so strings born from the object and
then variables are born like variables
that you create that our strings are
born from the string type object but if
you followed that that chain all the way
up to the top you would get to the
object which is where null resides now
another thing I want to mention if you
just type the actual variable inside and
you'll get the return value so you can
see the return value is null and if I
said like well we haven't really got
into if statements yet but let's go
ahead and just move along with our types
the next type is going to be very
interesting because in JavaScript you
can declare variables and not use them
so if I were to say a variable Y and
just that's it just end it so I didn't
even give it a value its value though
gets set as undefined because it said
hey you created this Y variable but we
know you're gonna sign some sort of
value to it eventually but for now here
you get this undefined value so let's
look at the let's look at the the type
of for Y right so let's say console.log
type of Y and you can see it's a number
so why is that and the reason for that
is because of JavaScript caching which
takes place and the browser by itself
you're gonna sometimes run into weird
issues where the browser cached
something and it causes problems so
there's things in JavaScript called
cache busting and that's all going to be
covered in the advanced JavaScript
portion of course as well but this is
actually just simply a virtual machine
bug inside of Chrome itself so like if
we were to have created a variable that
we've never used so if I said variable
never used and then did the same thing
instead of Y we'll say never used
you get the undefined being returned
instead of the number so craziness but
if you've ever if you run into any sort
of weirdness like that that is because
of the browser caching your JavaScript
for you chrome is a especially
aggressive kasher in order to try to you
know make its performance as sound as
possible all right let's just take a
look at the proto of the never-used
object which is undefined and the
undefined object has no proto because
the reason for that is because undefined
is just basically a blank spot in memory
of where a variable exists that has an
undefined value like it so there is no
value there once you have a value there
it's going to be an actual JavaScript
object and you should be able to follow
up its prototype chain but undefined is
just a type where either it equals null
or undefined and it just points to like
literally nothing so undefined is just a
placeholder temporarily until that
actual variable actually has an object
that it's pointing to in memory so we've
gotten into kind of a slippery slope
with some of the inner workings of
JavaScript like you run into the caching
bugs or you run into you know they're
complex prototype chains and I could say
that the prototype it's important that
you know that everything in JavaScript
is an object there are placeholders for
where there's no values that exist for
variables and there's a lot of weirdness
that we're going to get into with
JavaScript but if you can grasp some of
this stuff and really just put it on the
back burner for right now because it's
not going to affect you for the most
part when you're just getting started in
JavaScript but if you truly want to
understand how this language works then
it's stuff that you do need to know
about so I feel like it's it's at least
important that it's mentioned in a
beginner level series even though we
don't and we're not going to spend a
whole lot of time doing things messing
with it but in JavaScript you can
actually inherit from objects using its
prototypical chain and you can attach
things to the prototype so you can even
extend the prototype of the built-in
what we call primitive
objects that come with JavaScript you
can change the behavior of how
JavaScript works at its core which is
dangerous probably but at the same time
if you know what you're doing it can be
used for your benefit JavaScript as
we're gonna see and more advanced
courses is not a it's not a class-based
language there are no classes in
JavaScript so even though it's
object-oriented there are ways that you
have to use different language
constructs in order to for it to behave
like it's an object wearing a
class-based language like C sharp or
Python or or Java so it's a very unique
language and it and it's at least
important that you know about
prototypical inheritance and and what an
object is in JavaScript and the
different types so in the next video
though let's look at some of the basic
logical operators alright thanks for
