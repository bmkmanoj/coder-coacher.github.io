getting started with pug tutorial series
for hipster code calm and in case you
guys haven't heard but the Pug template
engine that is used for nodejs and also
in other places is actually formally
known as Jade
so Jade's project changed over to poke
and you know it's basically the cute
looking pug dog but ultimately what it
is is a template engine that makes
writing HTML a lot easier so to get
started I have a basic node Express Jas
app and if you check out the beginning
node tutorial series on hipster cocom
you can see from the first video how we
got to this point where we have just a
basic application running we have the
pug View engine already set up and we
have a views folder which actually has
all of the Pug files that we need
there's an index file here and you can
see from our app that index is being
served here we have a title and a
message being passed back to the pug
template and you can see that they're
being used here so the first things
first when getting started with pug is
that if you want to specify a doctype
you just have to simply say doctype if
we go and we look at the code that is
running and I say inspect you can see
that the doctype HTML was added at the
top now you probably wondered okay is
doctype necessary with html5 it's
actually an optional thing with html5 so
it doesn't hurt to have it there but you
definitely need it for earlier versions
earlier browsers if you're trying to go
backwards with support we've already
looked at the title which exists inside
the head so the title is being set from
a variable pass to the template but I
could also just simply give it a bunch
of gibberish if I wanted to so if I gave
it a bunch of gibberish you can see that
it's going to throw an error message
the reason why it throws an error
message is because this title needs to
be in string format so if we wrapped it
in double quotes it would not throw the
error message so let's put some double
quotes on this so if we surround that
with double quotes and we refresh it
works just fine now you can see it
changes the title up here if we view
inside the head you can see the title is
given right there so that's how we
change the title tag we already see the
h1 tag is just simply saying h1 equals
and then the message since we're using
nodejs the message is being passed here
so this is why it displays this is a
temp message if we want to do a
paragraph tag this is a paragraph tag
so you can see that this now shows up
inside of a paragraph in our body so it
automatically surrounds us with the
opening and closing tags required for
HTML elements all right the next thing
we want to look at in the Pug library is
how do we do anchor tags anchor tags are
links in HTML and we use it like this so
a href and then we give it the actual
path to where we want the file to be
open so let's say hipster code comm and
then the next argument after that is you
just simply and say this is the link
text so you can see this is the link
text if we click on it it takes us to
hipster code calm
now one thing you'll notice is that if
we look at the HTML the way this is
structure the a is not wrapped inside
with P well it's like well what if I
wanted to put my anchor inside of a
paragraph tag you could easily do that
by just simply indenting inside the P
and now when we look at this there's one
p and there's an anchor embedded inside
the P tag so in order to embed items
inside of other items you just simply
indent that's all you have to do now
here's another example let's use the
list item so you l is unordered list so
Li and we'll just say first element Li
second element nice third
now this does the unordered list with
the list item elements so when we look
at this you can see there in bullet
points which is standard li element and
you can even embed this inside of a P
tag which I'm not even sure to be honest
with you if that's valid HTML or not
it's really not it tries to put it
inside the P tag but it's it's
definitely not valid HTML now if you
just want a simple div tag that's you're
going to see a lot of that so our simple
div tag and then we can put the UI or
the UL right inside there make sure we
indent it now you can see we have a div
tag with our UL elements inside of it
alright so now let's look at form
elements inside of the pub template
engine so all we have to do is just say
input name equals our name second
argument is going to be its type which
stands for text this is actually a
default by the way so third one would be
ID our ID
and you can see that we have an input so
how do we put a placeholder in there we
can just say just like we did everywhere
else placeholder equals our placeholder
all right now that uses the html5
placeholder so you can see it has our ID
and everything else now how do we put a
label for that because obviously input
elements constantly have labels so we'll
say label and the argument here is going
to say for and we give it the name of
the label that we're looking for so it's
going to be our ID so label for our ID
and yeah that's really it now we need to
give it the the text so this is the
label text is the next argument for
labels and you can see when we look at
this that you can see the label is for
our ID so that's how you do labels and
inputs and inputs have different types
so this is just simply the text type but
we could actually change this from text
we could just say password
and when we type you can see the dots
which is the standard password
all right the next example with poke is
we want to look at some of our tables so
let's go ahead and say table and then
we'll have a table row table rows
contain table data elements so we can
say label 4 in fact we only have to give
it a label we'll just say label name and
then we'll do also another data element
here we'll do a input name equals name
ID equals name
so let's just we'll stick it to that but
we look at this now we now have a table
format and we could have multiple rows
if we wanted to just by simply saying
giving another TR with embedded T DS
this is a label another name TD their
input
so you guys get the point so if we want
to do any sort of table element you can
do that so now there's tea tables
stacked on each other and they're
perfectly formatted all right the next
tag we want to look at with pogue is the
format or the form tag so let's go ahead
and inside of our label here that we
created let's go and just put our form
here so we'll say form method equals
host so obviously forms can either post
or get and then we can give it an action
and this is actually where the method
should be posting to so we'll just put
our you know just either forward slash
the root domain since we're not going to
really be posting this but form elements
should also have a submit so we need to
actually put our input down here and
we're going to say type equals submit
and then we can also give it a value
which is going to be the value that
shows up inside the button and we'll
just say our value
all right so if we look at this input
element we can now see that we have it
wrapped inside of a form and we also
have the employ type submit' and that's
why the button is here if we submit it
it will try to submit the actual form to
the URL that we specified and this is
all just standard HTML all right the
next thing we want to do is we want to
look at how to link to external style
sheets so in my public folder here I
have CSS main CSS and since I'm using
nodejs
it actually is going to point to the
static URL so I'll give an example
alright so inside of our head we want to
do our actual link so we're going to say
link relation equals stylesheet now keep
in mind this can be either single or
double quotes it really just depends on
you href is going to be the actual
static CSS main dot CSS so if everything
goes well it should actually change our
h1 message to make it read since I have
one color in here to change the h1 to
red and if we refresh our page you can
see that Jade is now pointing to our
static CSS file and it's now changing
our our tag to red alright now in the
same way that we referenced the CSS file
we can also do the same thing with a
JavaScript file let me add a new
directory here called Jas for JavaScript
and then inside
Jas we're going to add a new just main
J's file so this is just going to be an
alert statement hello hipster code and
hug and this will just fire immediately
so if I go to the index hug and just
like I did with link I'm going to copy
this entire thing and I'm going to
change this to script
and remove the relation because that
doesn't matter but I do need to change
this also the source I probably didn't
need to copy any of that but anyway and
now we're just going to reference the
what do we call it main yes right so now
when this loads it's going to do an
alert message hello hipster code and pug
so that's how you reference external
javascript pages using the pub template
engine alright the final thing i want to
touch on within our pug tutorial is a
relatively common thing which extends
layouts and that's a really important
thing so let's go ahead and in our view
we're going to create a new file we're
going to call this layout dot pug
alright and in the index we want to go
ahead and just copy this entire thing
I'm going to control X and I'm going to
paste it inside the layout so we know
the layout has all of this stuff now I
want to go ahead and just the form part
I want to get rid of the form part and I
want to say block content
okay and then in the new index page we
want to say extends layout and then we
also want to say block content and then
inside the block content I'm going to
paste what we had and make sure it's
indented and if we refresh the page now
the reason for this error is because the
index project or the I'm sorry the Jade
project is being updated to the pub
project and you can see by default with
the expression AS engine even though
we're using pug that there's a bug in
the tutorial where it says hey we're
looking for layout Jade which doesn't
exist so I need to actually specify
layout pub and this is probably only
going to be a temporary thing but it's
because the projects in the middle of
the transition so if I say extends pug
though we get the output that we want
so hello hipster the script file and now
look at this the form element that we
embedded shows up but now we can use
template inheritance just by using the
extends keyboard so this extends filled
in all this layout stuff and where we
set block content all it focused on for
the index page was just this piece so
you can use template inheritance to
prevent any sort of duplication of your
templates all over the place so that's a
pretty cool feature guys the pub
template engine is cutting edge bleeding
edge and this is how to use it if you
guys have any further questions feel
free to leave a comment also check out
hipster code comm for more tutorials on
everything from Django Python JavaScript
node whatever it is that you're looking
for there's probably a tutorial for it
so thanks guys and have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
