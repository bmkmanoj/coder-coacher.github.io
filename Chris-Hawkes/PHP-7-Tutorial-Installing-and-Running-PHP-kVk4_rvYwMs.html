tutorial from hipster code calm and what
we're looking at is PHP a programming
language that gave rise during the early
really the late 90s and early 2000s and
it was a replacement for what was then a
very popular language which was Perl
held together using CGI scripts and PHP
it was very similar to Perl but it gave
much more credence to just you know the
web platform so since that time we've
seen a tremendous amount of websites
created in PHP and a lot of those
websites are still being run today in
addition to the older sites PHP is still
used by a lot of developers to be able
to build a quick website that is hosted
on any sort of Linux or Windows
environment and it's also very cheap in
many cases to host a PHP website there's
many reasons to learn PHP or why you
would want to learn it like I said
before with a lot of websites out there
that are powered by PHP it becomes a
requirement that you understand how it
works in order to be able to adapt
certain websites like there are a lot of
e-commerce platforms that are very
popular for smaller mom-and-pop shops or
even big shops for that matter but
there's a lot of e-commerce platforms
like magenta PrestaShop opencart and
they're all written in PHP so it takes
PHP knowledge in order to be able to
adapt those to truly mold it to the
company that you're trying to build in
addition to that it's also the language
of choice or the language powering a lot
of major websites like any sort of
WordPress blog which there are literally
millions of blogs that are run on the
WordPress platform
there's also Wikipedia comm is a top ten
website when it comes to traffic and
that is written using PHP so in order to
get PHP running on our system we're
going to be using this this product
called exam or exam
but basically it comes with a lot of
information that you need really a lot
of stuff that you need in order to be
able to use PHP on your system so I'm
going to
using Windows it doesn't matter if
you're on Linux or Mac you can just
download the Installer but we definitely
want to use amp because it's going to
change it's going to save us from a lot
of hassle all right so we're going to
run through with the setup here just go
ahead and have all this default
information already checked and I
already have FileZilla installed so I
don't actually want that so assuming you
don't already have it installed just go
ahead and make sure that's checked all
right so now that's installed look go
ahead and just start the control panel
and you'll see down on the right-hand
side you can't say it on my screen but
on the bottom right-hand corner of your
if you're using Windows you'll be able
to see that there is now an amp control
icon so you can click on that so once
your panel opens up you'll see that it
installed a bunch of stuff for you like
Apache my sequel FileZilla all this
stuff just go I didn't start the Apache
server because that's actually what
you're going to need in order to be able
to to actually run a PHP server so if
you guys get this error message that
Apache shut down unexpectedly it's most
likely because something is listening on
port 80 and that's actually a common
issue so what you would want to do is go
into config and go to at HTTP D config
this is going to pull up they can config
file and in here look just go ahead and
search for the number 80 so you can see
it says listen 80 and that actually
means port 80 so we're actually going to
tell it to listen on port 9000 I believe
I already have something listening to
8080 as well so anyway let's go ahead
and save this here and see if that
starts or resolves our issue so now you
can see that it's not being blocked from
whatever was listening on port 80 before
and you just have to say allow access if
you're on Windows and now that that's
green the Apache
servers actually running on your Windows
machine alright so because that's green
let's go ahead and open up a browser and
we should just be able to put in our
localhost address and actually what I
end up having is I have is listening to
my local host address so if I
specifically give it the port that I had
given port 9000 because that's what I
told Apache to listen on you can see
exam is actually running so this is a
working HTTP server that's now listening
on that port that we specified in the
config file alright so in order to
actually create our first file to test
out our PHP installation we need to go
to our C Drive and we're gonna have a
folder down here called zamp and that's
where is anthon stalled and then inside
here we need to go to htdocs and this is
actually the default page that was being
displayed when we visited our localhost
address so in our htdocs folder we can
actually create a new folder which we
will call this PHP tutorial actually
we'll just call it a tutorial and now we
need an editor in order to be able to
create files so I'm actually going to
use the free atom editor and atom is
spelled 80 om so I definitely suggest
that you guys check it out it's
completely free to use and it's
relatively easy to work on so here's my
little atom icon and I'll double click
on that
so within atom I'm going to say open
folder and we'll go all the way to the C
Drive
zamp htdocs tutorial and we'll select
that for our folder and now we can use a
simple atom text editor in order to
create files like our PHP file that
we're going to need so I'm going to
create a new file
I'm gonna call it test dot PHP
all right so PHP is a mixed match of
actually putting your programming logic
and code inside the template of the page
itself which is relatively interesting
so here let's go ahead and create our
actual simple HTML page and this is just
normal HTML markup so we have our head
and then we're gonna have our body tag
and all tags always have to have an end
tag when you're dealing with HTML and
then simply in our body tag we're
actually going to put inside an h1 which
is our title tag or header we're gonna
actually put a certain syntax that PHP
is going to use to decipher that it is
PHP code and that's what we do we
actually do a less than sign and then
the question mark followed by PHP and
that's going to be our opening PHP
brackets so anything inside of those
brackets is going to be executed via the
PHP programming language so to close
that off we actually have the question
mark followed by the greater than sign
so inside of here we can use the
statement echo which is simply it's like
the print statement and other languages
or console.writeline every language is
different Python or I'm sorry PHP is
echo so we'll say hello PHP tutorial and
then we want to go ahead and save this
file let's go to our localhost address
that we were just at so it's localhost
and then we changed it to listen to port
9000 and now instead of this dashboard
we can change this to go to the tutorial
folder that we just created and you can
see it actually lists using PHP it's
actually listing or I'm sorry this is
actually using Apache but it's listing
all the files there so if we click on
test you can see that the code is
actually showing up so that's a PHP file
being executed and you can see that it
simply has
just the HTML output you do not see the
PHP brackets and code inside an actual
exported HTML page that is provided by
PHP alright guys so that's how we
install PHP and get started with our
simple tutorial so in the following
videos we'll get a little bit further
into how the PHP language works thank
you for watching please subscribe and
please vote up the video thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
