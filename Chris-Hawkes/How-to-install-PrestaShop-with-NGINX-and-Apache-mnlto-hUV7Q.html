I'm going to go ahead and show you guys
how to use a prestashop prestashop is a
PHP ecommerce platform similar to like
paid products like Shopify or any of
those other products but sometimes if
you feel like you have to know how it's
a lot easier to just go ahead and manage
your own shop because you're not to be
paying that monthly cloud cost of using
another proprietary software so
prestashop is really one of the best
i've used opencart before I've actually
never used prestashop apparently they're
doing pretty good and this day and age
so we're going to go ahead and and
install prestashop so what we want to do
is go ahead and we want to go ahead and
I'm going to put my this email address
and just quickly I just say download now
all right and it's going to take a few
seconds here so I'll pause the video
alright so once that's done downloading
we need to go ahead and extract it and
what we have here is I am my project
directory I have a project on our folder
named Tara and that's where actually I'm
going to put my prestashop so let's go
ahead and distract what we have here to
that folder wherever you plan on storing
your files locally and I'm going to be
putting this obviously on a server but
I'd like to have you know backup copy on
my local hard drive as well for local
development things like that so it's go
ahead and select that folder and extract
the zip directory to that alright guys
so now you need to have something called
filezilla in order to be able to
communicate with your server i'm
actually hosting with one node the node
is definitely one of the best companies
out there i mean they're they're great
as far as a VPS i mean there's so much
better than shared hosting or any of
those other major players but I've
definitely I mean I've posted with
several different companies including
cloud providers and window it is by far
the best company I've ever done business
ways so I would definitely recommend
them but when you have an account set up
you have to actually manage your VPS and
it's a big complicated thing so
that being said wherever you're actually
hosting your applications you want to go
ahead and upload the prestashop to that
so i actually have all these files here
from a previous project i was using with
this domain name and i'm going to end up
removing all of that I so after that's
deleted we want to take all these files
that is inside the actual prestashop
location and we want to upload them to
the folder in question where our project
is going to be housed on our Linux set
up all right so just make sure all these
files are selected and we're just going
to upload
hey guys all right so after I've
uploaded all those files I need to
change my file and etc engine X sites
enabled assuming that you're using
engine X because what I do it on engine
X's I look for static content like
images CSS files things like that and I
listen on port 80 so that engine X can
handle that since it doesn't much faster
than something like a patch you would do
it any other traffic that does not meet
the criteria of a static file would then
get passed on to actually know what this
is going to be a sink here alright so
I'm actually since this is actually an
ideal setup for a django installation
that i have in since we're using PHP and
completely different setup i'm going to
go ahead and just replace all this so
it's a little bit easier for django
since i can actually just put on my
static folders and our static files in
one folder and just say engine xserve
that folder and everything else go to
apache but since with a prestashop like
everything is in the same folder so i
can't really do that anyway I found this
documentation online that we can go
ahead and use this for our sites enabled
in engine X and we're going to be
listening we need to get the IP name or
number from our web host so we're going
to change a few things starting with the
IP address
and we'll listen on port 80 so I believe
it will just work if we just simply say
listen on port 80 in fact we don't even
need a call and we can just say 80 like
that now down here we want to put the
actual name of our domain without the
WWE so Tara all calm and then with the
WWE rid of this French stuff whatever
the hell that is down here we're also
going to say the name of our domain
ok and this specifically says what file
types at once engine X to handle now we
need to give it the root directory where
the file is located so I'm not sure if
you guys saw but when we uploaded on
press the shop we uploaded it to a home
and then my username web apps and then
we called it Tara so we're going to
upload it there
okay now everything else is saying pass
it on support 80 but we actually want to
pass it to port 80 I don't really like
this I'm going to UM hdb forward slash
I'll just a local host localhost
and instead of this proxy config setting
I'm going to just say engine X proxy
params and I don't need the forward
slash
alright that should be pretty good there
alright so now in order to save it we're
going to say control x save it
and you know what I'm going to go back
into that file real quick
I want to make a copy of this that way I
can go over to sites available paste a
copy of the dares of sudo nano Tara
out.com so i'll delete all that and then
just right-click the pace what we had

 Windows
alright so patient we got there
also looks like we're missing a bracket
add that last bracket to we have to make
sure it's over in the other spot yes sir
I just forgot to copy it all right I'm
so now that we've done that we need to
go ahead and say sudo service restart or
reload actually reload engine X then
that didn't work at all all right so do
the pseudo et Cie inet d engine X space
restart or reload I so reloaded now it's
going to restart so it seemed to have
restarted successfully with a new
virtual host now we need to go to our
patchy virtual host so that we can
handle the traffic that's being
forwarded by engine X and we're going to
sites available first sudo nano terracom
so this thing says it's listening on
port 8000 which ends and X is forwarding
it to that we need to change the web
apps directory so that points to the
right store name
I don't need this whiskey alias whiskey
Elias is being used for I don't need the
error logs either
this was once again for a django setup
get rid of this put in the right
directory I just may not work but we're
going to try it anyway actually want to
copy this file so i can replace sites
enabled with it so I'll CD into sites
and able then to tear out i'm going to
delete all this crap and we're going to
right-click oh god dammit son-of-a-bitch
so i should be able going to eat ET see
patchy two sites available Tara out calm
highlight all of this
control C control x to get out of that
will go back into Tara out here Tara out
com right click to paste it good control
x to save press y enter to save it now
we're going to try to reload in Apache
and see if that works so we'll say
pseudo ford / gtc inet d /a patch to
space reload reload it ok and restart
seem to restart ok now let's go to the
the actual domain where the website is
supposed to be
alright so if you guys were into this
problem on a Linux set up there saying
that prestashop doesn't have permission
the right to these files and which
it needs to do so we need to change the
settings on the folder and hopefully we
need to make it recursive so let's go
back into our linux shell and we're
going to CD over to the directory where
the files are sitting so it's going here
home see space chrs ops 5 c's of chrs
folks see space web apps go in here and
we're going to CD into Tara where our
file is sitting in fact I want to go out
don't you want to go into Tara now we
need to go ahead and change our
permissions and if you notice correctly
on the pressed installation here and
when it gave us the permissions problem
it says that it needs to have a WWF in
data is the user on this on that it
needs to have permission so I need to
say this folder has that that permission
so what we want to do then is we need to
go to let me see we need to go to that
web app alright so we're going to say
see sudo chgrp space WWF and data and
then we're just going to give it the
name of the folder cetera and then we're
going to sudo chmod change mod G + RW
excess and then we're going to do once
again Tara and that should be good
enough so let's go ahead and see if
presta is now ok with that whilst i
refresh these settings
alright so I'm refreshing its thinking
again hopefully it's going through the
process oh hell alright so that didn't
work as well as i was hoping so what we
have to do is we have to actually do
that process for every every day i'm one
of these so before that you say exactly
the pseudo the www data and then we're
going to start giving it all these
folders that I needs permission from so
it's a two-step process the ww data
thing first and then also the g + RW
excess so do that for all of them like
I'm doing now it's probably the safest
way inside is blindly giving permission
to all of these folders or whatever so
so I could take that long we'll just do
that right now no big deal so send mails
off they're modules
modules modules
alright dumb wonder if I could just do
it for themes will see it themes as a
problem and let's say translations
translations
okay almost done upload upload
download download I just run these
refresh real quick see if we have a
problem translations I still going to
try something else here because it's not
working for some of these directories I
guess that need to have all right so
instead of just changed my let's do
capital r ug + RW and then cash I stuff
I do that is I get rid of the cash
problem alright I look this up so we're
going to do a different command here
we're going to do this sudo chown
capital R and then we're just going to
change the names of the folders because
hopefully you're already added to the
WWF and data user group if you aren't
that is kind of up and you're
going to look at a tutorial bay it's not
hard to add yourself to that group but
you need to be your whatever username
you're using for your pseudo you need to
have that so anyway
hopefully one more and we're done
there's one of the things coming from
like a windows development environment I
mean I like the directory permissions
and things like that on on Linux
compared to windows like I just find it
to be so confusing like the different
levels of passwords and different codes
and to give different authorization
drives me crazy I see here we're going
to create our shop name so i'll call
this tara out name of the website main
activity there's going to be like a
software type thing her name is for
shoes accessories services contents
probably services let's see all right
baby his personal care computer oh no
here it is computer hardware and
software time zone eastern chris hall
alright and now we want to have a
password and stuff so pause this for a
second while I while I entered that it
alright so here you won't go ahead and
use a database that you have in your my
sequel setup alright so I have a
database name called Terra so want to go
and give your root login so that's the
user name for my sequel when you set up
my sequel you have to give a username so
you want to put that here and then you
also have to provide a password which
you've done that when you set up my
sequel alright then once you do that
it'll go through this process of where
it's setting up the database tables and
everything for you automatically I know
it also wants you to go ahead and delete
the install folder once you've done
you're done with the install so go back
over to your filezilla set up and inside
your folder on the server side give an
install directory you want to go ahead
and delete that so once we've deleted
that we can go ahead and take a look at
our storefront so here's our storefront
that's pretty pretty sweet and a lot of
stuff when you change obviously and then
when we login you can go ahead and start
updating stuff and there's plenty of
tutorials available online about how to
do that so if you guys were able to get
through this 20-minute video I praise
you because this was a little bit
difficult I think for somebody that
doesn't have any IT experience and I've
actually set up a few of these servers
before and every time I feel like it's a
big pain in the ass but on anyway guys
thanks for watching you have a good day
