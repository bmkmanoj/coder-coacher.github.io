video I'm talking about the Silicon
Valley dream and I remember hearing a
story a couple years ago about a company
named zero cater and actually the reason
why I even first heard of this company
was that they had reached out to me at
least somebody had reached out to me
from the company and most likely was you
know just the typical run-of-the-mill
type of you know inquiry but they had
asked me if I was interested in working
for them because of some of the Django
work that I was doing I believe they
were running a Django stack at that
point in doing angular and this was 2014
so I was one of the first ones and I was
putting out videos on Django and angular
together and I guess that caught their
attention they probably thought it was
much better than I really was because I
was really not too experienced in you
know Django or angular because they were
both relatively new at least angular was
and I don't like jump through hoops even
to get it working in my tutorial but
they so they reached out and I was like
looking in I was kind of intrigued with
this company because I was IO so it's
this young twentysomething who ended up
leaving his hometown and moving like
across the country to Silicon Valley in
order to start up our company he didn't
know what he wanted to start and that's
what actually I jumped out at me the
most like he had no clue what he
actually wanted to create he just knew
he wanted to be an entrepreneur and that
he wanted to be you know he wanted to
start as a startup in Silicon Valley so
like who doesn't right I mean we hear
about Zuckerberg or you know the guys
from Google who were going to Stanford
at the time that they discovered the
search engine you look at companies like
Apple's out in that area now obviously
Facebook moved from Harvard out to Palo
Alto and now they're at Menlo Park but I
mean everybody's out there that was in
the tech you know eBay Oracle Adobe
anyway I could go on forever but the
point is is that this kid decided to go
out there and then ended up deciding hey
I want to get into this catering
business and the catering industry is
roughly according to some analysts
estimates are like 20 billion dollar a
year industry and I'm yeah I guess that
sounds about right to me probably I mean
with as many people in the United States
and that's I believe figures just
pertaining to the United States so
a lot of you know he saw a potential
opportunity there so he ends up you know
pitching his idea to venture capitalists
and grana this was in 2009 so he was
able to land a couple million dollars in
venture capital funding just initially
you get the company off the ground
without really any experience any
business experience I don't even think
the kid went to college I'd have to look
that up but he got the money and venture
capital money was flowing freely at that
time this was you know at the heat of
the Great Recession you know as we're
coming out of it there was a lot of you
know government spending grants and the
stock market was booming in things so
just it was a good time to invest and
get money and if we forward in fast
forward to today it seems like you know
it's drying up we've been hearing a lot
especially at the beginning of this year
that Silicon Valley was you know going
in full layoff mode and things like that
but that talk has actually started to
quiet down a little bit and while I've
noticed that some salaries have gone
down even on the East Coast and some of
that probably has to do was with the
immuno the layoffs on the west coast the
the complete bubble bursting never
happened the way that people were
describing it so there has been some
cutbacks but basically the real estate
in Silicon Valley and the areas out
there in San Francisco have not been
overly affected from what I've read as
well as the you know the hiring and the
companies is not overly affected either
but now there are some people that are
being affected like if this zero cater
kid would try to go out to Silicon
Valley right now I would be willing to
bet that he probably wouldn't be able to
land the money however this story goes
on because he was able to get the money
and you know they have a pretty you know
decent web presence and things like that
and their entire gig is that they are
they will bring food to you and they
cater to businesses so they want you
know high density high density urban
areas where there's like large
businesses and a lot of people in a
relatively short geographic area and the
entire thing is that you're gonna call
zero cater and say you know I have this
many people I'm gonna order this this
and this and and they're gonna make it
happen for you so if you think about how
much money is spent by businesses trying
to bring food into their industry
even if it's not even just an event but
people have to eat everyday so you pick
people they end up you know they go out
for their lunch breaks and things like
that if they you know spend more than
their hour you're losing money there as
a business most larger businesses will
actually have some sort of cafeteria or
food available on-site and it's not just
for the convenience of the employee it's
actually to save money and making sure
that you're having you know your your
resources on-site you know people will
eat at their desks and things like that
I'm not sure that that's really a
benefit behind it but the thing is is
it's both a convenience and it's also a
benefit for businesses so if they're
able to cut down on you know the hassle
of trying to do catering for special
events or just you know simply feeding
their associates then you know something
like zero cater definitely makes sense
now one of the perks of a lot of tech
startups that I've read about even here
in Virginia and around the DC area is
that they offer like free lunch Fridays
and things like that so it's apparently
a big deal to a lot of Millennials I I
think that's pretty cool but it depends
on what they're asking you to do it I
mean I like to have my lunch break in
order to be able to walk around try to
recharge my batteries so I can think you
know some some people think that it's
okay just to you know sit through their
lunch and I don't know it's just
unhealthy you know what I mean if you're
sitting down all day long it's not just
unhealthy mentally but it's unhealthy
physically but that's a different
discussion so anyway zero cater they've
been around since 2009 they just
recently a couple of months ago got
their second injection of funding and it
was around 4 million so to date they've
only raised about 6 million dollars
which means that they're operating
relatively lean for a company that has
roughly 120 employees now they're based
out in San Francisco so one of the main
questions I posed to you guys and really
I have my own opinion on the matter
obviously I'm doing a video on it but
I'm wondering how much of this Silicon
Valley dream is really relevant to today
I understand that there's gonna be so
many people that go out to Silicon
Valley chasing their dreams and from
what I understand it's not nearly the
way that it's perceived in the books and
the movies and the TV show on HBO it is
a absolute mother to try to get out
there and make something of yourself
one of my buddies too actually flew out
to San Francisco
- actually he went to a major event
where like Angie from Angie's List was
there and things like that and he was at
this major event and he was saying that
there was like literally like homeless
like hipsters like asking them for money
hitting him up for money non-stop as he
walks down the streets of San Francisco
so I'm not sure if that if a lot of that
is just you know the hippie culture or
whatever it is but you know I'm assuming
the weather makes it easier for people
to live off the streets out there or
maybe it's just like people that have
literally gone to Silicon Valley just
looking to make connections you know
because they've heard so much about it
we've seen this with with movie stars to
an extent one of the the larger movie
stars of today and this reminds me as
well you know in even though it's in San
Francisco is obviously the northern
state of of California but on the
southern end you have Los Angeles and
there are actors that go out to Los
Angeles that are like literally starving
but Amy Adams here is one of the the
actresses that comes to mind for me when
it like she ends up she's living out of
like Minnesota I believe at the time but
she's like doing singing and dancing at
basically dinner theaters and somebody
discovers her and she ends up landing
this role in this drop-dead gorgeous
which was like apparently it's a very
small parents I believe but then one of
her co-workers on the set was like
trying to convince her to go out to LA
she ends up going out to LA but then
can't find any work for like years and I
think she was on a few sitcoms and
things like that but now she's one of
the largest actresses in Hollywood she's
she's been nominated for several Oscar
Awards and things like that
and it does actually work out for people
in LA sometimes but it's like the same
type of mentality it's like let me drop
everything I'm doing going out to
California and just hoping that I can
make it rich but the thing is is the
vast majority of people never actually
end up you know coming to that
realization and they end up most likely
going back home with their tails between
their legs you know hopefully hopefully
that's you know otherwise they go out
there and they they die in some hole
somewhere but anyway the in the
situation with zero cater I think is
interesting I never really got back to
him cuz I had no interest in moving the
sand
sisqó the real estate out there is just
absolutely ridiculous in fact a lot of
areas even outside of LA is just like
really there's a lot of shit holes out
outside of LA that are affordable and I
just I have no interest in that I in
fact I like living in Virginia where I'm
at because Virginia for the most part is
like you know we have Four Seasons so it
snows in the winter you get the fall in
the autumn and everything you know the
leaves falling in the autumn leaves
changing there's a lot of history around
here so I don't know I just like I like
Virginia I would possibly consider maybe
Texas or something like that or maybe a
southern state I mean San Francisco
would be pretty cool if I can afford it
but I don't know man the whole thing is
that like with zero cater and like I'm
like oh yeah I can make you know a
hundred thousand dollars a year or
something out and in Silicon Valley well
that's nothing out there so then I found
that interesting now another thing with
zero cater is a day of like a ton of
competition now so just some of them
that are coming out this mobi did a dish
I noticed is out that they do the same
type of thing GrubHub is not necessarily
the same thing but it's like somewhat in
the same ballpark
you have cater to me eat club easy cater
anyway there's all kinds of competition
now so that's one thing that I've
noticed with Silicon Valley if you have
an idea and you go to pitch that idea
man the reason why they they need all
that venture capital funding is because
they're trying to they're trying to get
out there first before anybody else
because otherwise people are just going
to be all up in your lunch
no pun intended trying to eat your lunch
you know they're they're trying to take
away your idea with more funding maybe
with better code and that's going to be
the case anywhere you go and that's one
of the benefits I think of being a
program or one of the positives is that
there are situations where you've had
single developers that have bootstrap
their projects and have become insanely
rich and one of the guys that comes to
mind is the guy who created minecraft
now
granted he's not he's not like you know
he's on he's a one-off exception
basically he's not and he's not your
typical run-of-the-mill developer but he
is somebody that obviously has achieved
tremendous success on an indie game that
he developed by himself at the same time
zero cater came out actually which was
2009
god I hate popup ads but anyway this is
this Forbes article here where the
minecraft billionaire Markus Persson
from Sweden buys a 70 million seventy
million dollar Beverly Hills home I mean
this thing has like an M&amp;amp;M candy shop in
it it's got garage that's underneath the
house like where you can park his
Lamborghinis and stuff like that this
pole overlooks all of Beverly Hills in
downtown Los Angeles and like I mean the
real estate is absolutely ridiculous 70
million dollars is a lot even by Beverly
Hills standards and you know it's
clearly one particular developer who I
think at the age of he was like 33 or 34
he was able to do that so another
company with major success was indeed
calm this was actually started by a
couple of guys and ended up selling for
a billion dollars so the website is very
very basic looks like it was started
back in like 1998 but indeed.com has
become one of the larger job sites and i
believe it was based out of Austin or at
least her out of Austin now but the the
point is is that he was able to
bootstrap his own project meaning you
don't have to borrow a borrow and sell
your soul for venture capital funding
because that's the thing if you have an
idea and you're just trying to pitch it
and you do get money for from venture
capitalists you're going to have to sell
a piece of your company and give up
control things like that in order to get
that money in many cases it's good
because they you know they'll be able to
help you along and get you in touch with
the right connections but if you're a
single bootstrap developer like you
don't really want to rely on that so how
can we succeed without that type of
stuff the only way that I can give my
advice on the matter is like I can
simply say API is restful api is are
more important now than they've ever
been obviously data communication
between servers is extremely important
so in order in order for me to be able
to build the next cutting-edge snapchat
type thing it's going to mean that I
need to be able to have all kinds of
number one you'd have to be in the cloud
most likely in order
the scale to that type of tremendous
traffic but even before all that like I
mean it's it's about api's it's about
hooking into and tapping into companies
that already are paying the heavy burden
of being able to do it better than you
and either that or you're completely
lucky I would say in something like
indeed I mean I'm sure it was a
tremendous amount of work but I'm not
sure how indeed is so successful I mean
they that site is still lacking you know
I've said many times that we need to
have a better jobs website out there but
the point is though is that companies
they do things well if it's Google you
know their map system they do it well so
if you're going to be basing anything on
geography and mapping and directions and
things like that you're you're gonna
have a hard time as a single developer
and doing it better than something like
that Google can do it however there's no
reason why you can't get a Google API
account start learning how to use their
API and create a new unique product that
you know granite is reliant upon their
API but Google is not going anywhere and
you're allowed to scale up you know a
tremendous amount of traffic with them
for a pretty small fee so a lot of
companies are like that in fact one time
I decided to get into ticket sales and I
talked to one of the creators of a
eventful the company and I was hoping
that since I was like literally not
asking for anything in return that if I
use their API that I would end up giving
them traffic and things like that
however because I was such a small fry
they were like yeah you can use our API
but we're gonna charge you for it so
that kind of sucked to me at the time I
took this approach and I was like man
screw that I'm not gonna do that but did
the project well I wasn't serious enough
about it I didn't have any sort of
business plan or any way to make money
but I end up end up not doing that in
fact I'm gonna save the rest of this for
another video that I because I have a
lot to talk about in regards to this I
believe but anyway guys let me know what
you think and the Silicon Valley dream I
would definitely think twice before you
just drop everything you're doing trying
to go out there especially right now I
would be looking for more of a bootstrap
way I've been able to get your business
off the ground
alright guys thanks for watching have a
good night bye hey guys so I've talked
about this a lot
Deb mountain coding boot camp they are
my sponsor they're one of the reasons
why I'm able to do these videos and they
offer a 12-week intensive course that
teaches you the technologies of the here
and now they're gonna focus on a lot of
things that are actually being used and
websites things like jQuery and they're
gonna be using stacks like nodejs
that's what week intensive course is to
try to get people in the job market so
that is their entire focus we've all
we've talked a lot about on this channel
whether or not a college degree is worth
it
I'm not the one to be able to answer
that question for you I absolutely think
that college degrees are great
especially in computer science I never
want to convince somebody to say that
they shouldn't do that
you know obviously schools like Stanford
and MIT I'm you know I'm an envy of all
those graduates however there is you
know the bulk of developers that don't
necessarily need to be the MIT graduates
to actually have success in the
programming world I think I speak
relatively well for for that type of
person and with coding boot camps we're
seeing them you know try to offer more
skills more modern-day skills because a
lot of times when you're going to a
computer science course and a major
university you're learning technology
that's already outdated by the time
you're learning it with Deb mountain and
coding boot camps like what Deb Mountain
offers they're focusing on really what
is hot right now so and they also focus
on a relatively you know a small set of
skills in order to make sure that they
are teaching you what you need to know
in order to be productive in a in a
workplace environment so make sure you
guys do me a favor do yourself a favor
check out the link and that in the
description tab below for more on Deb
mountain coding boot camp thanks guys
