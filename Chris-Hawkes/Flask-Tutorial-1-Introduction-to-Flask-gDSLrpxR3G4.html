doing a new tutorial series on flasks
using Python 3.5 and we're going to be
using the latest version of flask which
supposedly supports Python 3.5 at the
time of this video which is good so
that's a relatively new development
Falasca has been in production for a
couple years it's a really highly touted
framework probably second to django for
the Python community it's very
minimalistic so it's not opinionated at
all and as far as how you handle your
business you're kind of left to your own
devices on what you want to do it would
be similar to something like node and
Express I would say where there's just
not a whole lot given to you out of the
box and a lot of people like that
because then they can you know build
their project to suit their specific
needs in the past I used to tout that um
like like Pinterest was built on top of
Django but then eventually they kind of
outgrew Django which is to be expected
for a site of that that size and then
they went over to flask and they they
kind of use flask as a starting point
and then they created their own custom
API built on top of flask so you can
actually you know mold it to really suit
whatever sort of need you have so a lot
of people like that about flask and
you're going to end up writing more code
initially than something like Django but
you'll also you know be very intimate
with how that code works and everything
so the experience there is priceless now
what you're going to need in order to be
able to get this tutorial going you need
to have Python installed I'm using
Python 3.5 I'm using a Windows
environment but you can be on Linux or
Macs and Mac it doesn't matter and as
far as my Windows environment allowed
people are like why aren't you on Linux
if you're using Python well I do a lot
of c-sharp development and I'm stuck
with Windows and you know honestly all
my games and apps run on Windows so I'm
not you know I can't not use Windows I
typically host my applications I want a
Linux environment and that's probably
what I'll look to do with the flask
project also I want to be able to post
this code on github so that way you guys
can just download this especially once
it's a finished project and then if you
have questions with you know what this
code is doing you should be able to go
back through the tutorial videos and get
up to speed on how you know we got to
that end point
so now once you have Python 3.5
installed you're probably going to need
some sort of editor to write your code
in I use Visual Studio that's not
mandatory but Visual Studio has a free
Community Edition and then you can also
download like Python tools for Visual
Studio a lot of people use pycharm
but you can use whatever you want it
doesn't matter I'm going to be using
Visual Studio and another another thing
too is um we're going to put the project
and our I'm going to put it in the
projects folder of my computer so let me
go ahead and um well we'll go ahead and
get started in the next video as far as
how to create our directory structure
but that's really all that needs to be
said at this point I might write a post
post Isana github I'm going to be using
Python 3.5 whatever using latest version
of flask and you need to use an editor
one way or another alright guys thanks
for watching have a good day
