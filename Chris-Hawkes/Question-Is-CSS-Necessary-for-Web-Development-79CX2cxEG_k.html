today I'm responding to a question that
I have from a viewer and he says I have
a question I think a lot of web I think
a lot of web developer newbies or even
some of the more experienced developers
wonder about should I be a web developer
if I hate CSS I like web development I'm
fine with HTML and JavaScript both
server-side and client-side
and I enjoy developing in them but as I
take a shot at developing my own web
applications my hatred for CSS grows I
just can't figure it out it's clunky
hardly makes any sense
most of the time it seems that the only
way around it's bullcrap is a series of
hacks and band-aids from Stack Overflow
of course you can use a framework like
bootstrap but even then and that is
bloated and there are many ways of doing
the same simple thing to send taxes
garbage I love designing a website and a
photo editor but implementing that
design and CSS feels like the design is
committing suicide I do not want to be a
developer for any platform if I cannot
independently develop on that platform
that is to say I do not want to hire a
CSS designer for a server-side project
web app I am working on or a side
project web app time working on sorry I
would much rather developer a different
platform like WPF or Android both of
which have a DND
ecosystem I could still use my back-end
skills anyway for those platforms it
would just change in the front-end so
what do you think should I continue with
web development or flee for another
platform as quickly as possible so I can
say the other day I was working in the
framework that I created which I called
a base ijs which is another terrible
note from nodejs framework out there in
fact it's like half finished it was just
a weekend project that I never I've
never done anything with but anyway I
still think for you know simple markup
websites it'll be my platform of choice
just because I don't know because I
created it maybe but either way the
projects here on github and I just went
to I was so I was working in this thing
and I have the entire website set up and
I have my API I even went through all
the hassle of setting up redox and react
and a video I posted yesterday where I
was ranting on that stuff yesterday I
went through all that effort and
everything but then I was finally
getting into the actual design and I you
to actually write up all my mocks and
everything in Photoshop or illustrator
the Adobe products and I still recommend
that you do that but and what is
interesting is nowadays I don't actually
do that I use those programs but I don't
actually use them for designing website
so I'll start just you know coding but
most of the time at least over the last
couple years I've simply taken a
bootstrap theme downloaded it and then
started like you know removing the
excess stuff that I don't need and and
just basically using that so I haven't
really designed anything for a very long
time at least a couple years but the
other night when I was trying to design
this music website because I think you
know I have this vision I'm listening to
music I'm motivating I'm trying to make
this site and I just realized how much I
have all I also don't enjoy doing CSS
like it's not it's not a whole lot of
fun although I do understand it and one
of the reasons why I understand it is
because I did start off with the whole
template hangout and an illustrator and
then one of the first things I moved to
was doing CSS by the time I landed a
corporate gig doing CSS I I was a much
better CSS developer than the senior
developers that I was working with that
got paid a whole lot more than I did
now granted they weren't you know
considered web designers or whatever I I
had a programmer title but I was mostly
doing HTML Javascript and CSS it was
transitioning into the c-sharp role that
I think was one of the biggest
challenges and also you know an
impressive feat but you know learning
any other stuff is very very difficult
but I I did the same thing as you like I
was doing hacks back then I didn't have
bootstrap themes and stuff like that so
the web templates that you had available
were much much more bloated you had all
kinds of different people doing CSS and
all kinds of different ways I'm you
still do but it seemed like the web
templates back then we're much much more
difficult to deal with in the modern day
bootstrap themes but then again I also
have much more knowledge than I did back
then so maybe I'm just looking at it
wrong now this book this latest one I
know came out in 2013 but I'm pretty
sure there was a one word there was a
version before this that I had because
this would have been before 2013 for
sure I've been a professional developer
you
before 2013 so when I was learning on my
own it was this missing manual book that
actually was what finally got things to
click I started understanding that if I
created a parent div container and I set
it to be positioned relatively and then
any sort of absolutely positioned
element inside of it I could then get
you know the proper spacing your left
200 top 200 you know margins padding's
and so once I started to notice things
started clicking I started realizing I
didn't even need to set all that stuff
like that all the time I start
understanding how the clearers work you
know clearing and floats and things like
that and and and those things were
extreme hats oh is it extreme hassle
just to get a footer to sit on the
bottom of the page or to get a column to
grow exponentially on the left hand side
without you know causing the right-hand
side to collapse underneath and stuff
like that
those things were a major major headache
and people can say that they're easy but
I know firsthand that a lot of web
developers who get paid a lot of money
don't know about CSS and it really
does handicap them at times so I would
recommend that people learn CSS in fact
one of the I was one of the few people
when bootstrap was getting so popular
because people are like oh just go to
bootstrap and I was one of them once you
said hey look at all the bootstrap
things they all look the same I still
say that everybody's got a bootstrap
site and it always looks the same
there's always the small logo on the top
left-hand corner with the collapsible
navigation there's always the humungous
like primary header and then alternating
400% with items that you know typically
change the background color of large
images but basically nobody's got any
sort of you know creativity anymore
everybody's just relying on bootstrap to
do everything for them and then you know
but the thing is is that the bootstrap
themes are so much easier than actually
drawing out your entire website so am I
saying draw your entire website probably
not because these designers that are
doing the bootstrap themes are going to
do a better job than you and it would
take you years to get that good but I do
think you should spend some time with a
book like this where you understand you
know make sure you understand the floats
and everything very very well and you
know what you're doing when you're
clearing also you need to understand the
difference between
absolutely relatively positioning and
not just simply based on definition but
you should be able to take an image and
make a website from it that's I think
into any web developers should be able
to do that and typically I can do that
like I can do that I know I can do that
I can do you can give me a photo of
anything and I can make that into a
website and I'm not gonna chop it up or
anything like that I'm not gonna do some
of those old-school hacks that they used
to do with database tables or HTML
tables but um I was so like I personally
would probably I think I'd be in the
minority of developers to say that
senior developers should understand CSS
to a pretty significant degree but then
again there's the whole lesson sass
craze that everybody was talking about
and I don't like either one of those
because I feel like those are
abstracting away some of the concepts of
CSS that I already understand in CSS so
I don't need something like less and
sass and I understand it has variables
and certain benefits there but I just
felt like why should I have to download
Ruby to run compass to compile my staffs
to CSS when I know that I could have
just created that compiled sass on my
own
I don't know so my opinion is no you
don't have to learn it because I've seen
firsthand that quite a bit of people in
the industry and don't understand CSS
very well and they're constantly going
the Stack Overflow and they're
constantly hacking some you know
terrible solution to fix their their
visual problems they're doing inline
styles and JavaScript includes and stuff
to try to hack positioning and things
like that after pages load and I've seen
some terrible things in the field
because they didn't have a basic
knowledge of CSS so definitely get some
sort of base there and and just take
your time with it because you could
probably be a senior developer and any
one of those things and not have to deal
with CSS but as much as CSS can be
boring and frustrating and slow-paced
you know my rant video yesterday about
JavaScript remains the same like CSS and
those days are much less hassle than
dealing well the modern-day JavaScript
stuff so when you talk about should I go
to two zamel and use something like WPF
or something else like I
right now like I feel like my next
project whatever it's gonna be you know
if it's gonna be xamarin I just want to
do something besides JavaScript and web
development right now I want to do
something like maybe even golang I want
to just do something a little bit
different I might get into some like
machine learning with Python just
something to kind of I guess reenergized
those old old feelings that that I seem
to like not have you know based on
dealing with the latest versions of
JavaScript and all the many libraries
that are included with that so anyway
that's my that's my opinion on the
matter definitely learn CSS at least
enough to have a decent amount of
knowledge to to understand you're
definitely gonna want to understand the
Box model most web development companies
are going to ask you about the box model
that you understand what padding does
what margins don't do absolute
positioning floats things like that also
there's a certain hierarchy so you need
to know you know how CSS can cascade
like there's tags like important and
things like that that can override
typically you don't want to use those
but yeah all right well yeah thanks for
guys thanks for the question guys thanks
