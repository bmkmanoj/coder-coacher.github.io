I'm went on a little bit of a hiatus on
this biatch but we're back on the Python
3.5 tutorial I don't even remember where
I left off actually I do just because of
the videos so what we want to do is talk
about logical operators in Python
logical operators essentially you can
think of them as if some condition has
met do this so if my name is Chris speak
you know if I'm not Kristen then don't
speak you know I mean that's that's a
logical operator so you have these
conditions in any sort of Python or I'm
sorry any sort of programming language
that you have to code for so we're going
to go ahead and look at that in Python
specifically Python 3.5 and in my editor
here I'm just creating a Python file and
we'll just call this if else dot py and
there's just an empty file so it's not
doing anything and let's go ahead and
just we'll create a variable named
person and it equals Chris and then a
logical operator and python it's very
very easy all you gotta say is if and
then we can just reference our variable
here so person equals and then we'll say
Chris :
and then we'll just say print whoa
mother-effer
I'm gonna do the semicolons a lot
because I've been doing a lot of
JavaScript lately so here is a you know
if person equals Chris and keep in mind
that we have two equals because we're
not if we had one we would be assigning
person Chris which wouldn't even work in
an if statement but just keep that in
mind whenever you're equated something
equal to something else you're gonna be
using two equal signs in a row using
Python alright so in this particular
case when we run the program we're
actually going to get this to say who
mother-effer which I meant to say whoa
but we'll go with that
so let me set this up as my start up
file so if I run this from my editor
and um you guys can run this any way you
want I'm using Visual Studio a lot of
people don't use Visual Studio but you
can see that whom other effort did
actually display because the condition
was met now if we said Bob and we run
this program it's not going to do
anything because this line would execute
in fact I can put a breakpoint here to
show you guys and when we go ahead and
run this we're gonna say if person if I
highlight person person equals Chris
because we assigned it the value of
Chris so when it says is it equal to Bob
it doesn't do anything so it just simply
ignores this next statement it moves on
so the program executes top to bottom
left to right so the best thing to do is
you know if it's not equal to two Bob
then we want to actually have an else
condition so we just say else : and then
we'll just say print this mother-effer
does not equal Bob who are you alright
so if we run this now and we have our
break point person equals Chris so
that's not going to match so if I jump
down it's going to hit the else
condition and then it's going to simply
print out to the console so if I
continue the program you can see that
the else condition was met now with
python there is no switch statement
which is in like C or JavaScript and
c-sharp a lot of other languages so if
you want to have multiple conditions to
look for you're just simply going to do
if and python has this really weird way
of doing it compared to other languages
as they say l if and then you're going
to say your next condition person equals
Chris
Frank we're now doing this so if we want
to connect have like we could have
thousands of L if I'll live I'll live do
that do this do that and in this
particular case we're gonna hit this
second line and it's gonna print this
statement so we're doing this we're now
doing this now I'm going to show you
guys on one other example on this video
is we want to have one more elevation
here we're going to say a person equals
so we're gonna hit this line and we're
gonna exit the actual actual alright now
what I want to show you guys is that if
I went ahead and I change this to mug so
that we're gonna hit this condition here
and it'll equal true this condition and
everything else is not going to be
evaluated in Python so if you ever
wanted to check for multiple conditions
something like this wouldn't work so
just keep in mind when we run this this
D but this this break point will never
be here at lunch so you can see we're
Exynos logical statements just so you
know how this works when this equalled
this the if statement was met this was
printed and it just exit out of this
entire if statement so this is this can
all be thought of as one expression and
that's what they call like a algorithm
type of thing like a series of code
that's all kind of doing one particular
thing it's called an expression so this
can be considered one expression anytime
you have an if l if/elif/else or if-else
or just an if statement it's all one one
expression so it's important just so you
know that you know if the first thing
that equals it will never hit these or
even try to hit those it'll just
completely exit out alright guys so
that's how we're going to end this video
here for if and else if and all that
junk in Python 3.5 alright guys thanks
