video 3 of this tutorial series and over
I'm gonna be looking at here is I'm how
to actually do static content and in
static content I mean by CSS JavaScript
images and what I've done is I've added
this folder here called public to my
project here where I have CSS fonts
images in j/s and under normal
circumstances what you want to do is you
want to have this public folder
delivered by something that's better fit
for handling CSS and images and things
like that so you really want like a
server like nginx or whatever server you
want but you want that to actually
render that that type of content now
Express has a built-in ability to be
able to render that static content if
you want but you typically only want to
do that for development so what I want
here I want to actually be able to pass
in an argument to start my application
and development mode and have Express
deliver the static content but if it's
not started in development mode that I
want it to be able to just be able to be
handled by nginx so an example of that
is I have this website that we're
building here and it's actually already
in a public environment and I want to be
able to use the same code line and just
upload it to the server and not have to
worry about you're changing a bunch of
configuration files and stuff like that
so in order to get around this issue I
want to be able to pass in an argument
to start the application and development
mode so there's a built-in ability to do
that with Express on j/s by using
process start Arg V which stands for arc
value and what we're going to be looking
at is the second argument is the first
argument that gets passed in is going to
be actually starts counting at 0 so the
first is 0 which would be node and the
second one would be the application
which is 1 and then the third is going
to be we're going to be looking for a
dev keyword so if we see that dev key
word we're gonna be using expresses
ability to deliver static content
so all that being said this should just
go ahead and be able to deliver the
static content or a public directory so
let's go ahead and um we're gonna add a
temporary CSS file and we're just gonna
call this main dot CSS and inside main
dot CSS we're gonna add a style for h1
and we're just going to do color red so
that way we can see if it's working or
not and if you remember from the
previous video we do have an h1 that is
being delivered by our server here so if
we inspect you can see it's an h1 so
when we get the CSS attached to this we
should be able to see that that font
turn red so let's go over to the layout
where we're going to end up including
this CSS file and under the title here
I'm just going to go ahead and paste in
this code right here and change the name
of it and we're gonna reference the main
dot CSS so you can see that the actual
HR up here is public CSS main dot CSS
which is located over here so if I
restarted this server we now want to
restart it and pass in and the argument
dev so it'll start it in dev mode and
have Express render the the CSS for us
so now we get this error message because
we're using path and path is actually a
require that we need to add to the app
dot J's file so let's go ahead and do
that now and I'm not sure if this is a
built-in thing with with express or not
or if we have to install it but we're
gonna find out here anytime you try to
reference something that isn't found it
means you need to do the npm install so
it's good and see if this is part of
react and that's what I figured it was
that path is required so we're using
this this path this path module so that
we can route the static files
appropriately
now it's go ahead and look and see if
we're getting that in our source file it
looks like I need to clear the cache or
something here all right there it goes
all right guys so um you can see now
that we have this CSS and the good the
reason why it's a good way of doing this
is like I said I can just I can just
send this code right up to my server and
if I don't start it in dev mode then
it's it the public folder can be
delivered by nginx and it would it would
just work alright guys so that's how we
include CSS into our node and react
project alright thanks for watching
