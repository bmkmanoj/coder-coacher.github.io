learning Python and this is for absolute
beginners my name's Chris Hawkes I've
done Python tutorials now for several
years many of them neither okay I guess
but this one I want to make sure that I
make this as easy as possible for
beginners that are starting out just a
quick background I actually I'm
self-taught developer so I never went to
school for this stuff I actually learned
everything the hard way I'm not the
smartest guy in the room I never will be
and if I can learn something like this I
really feel like anybody can pythons not
gonna be easy no programming language is
going to be easy when you're first
starting out
so whatever first language you choose
it's going to be difficult but as long
as you stick to it and you have
determination you're going to be able to
persevere now you're going to ask
yourself do I want to learn Python do I
want to learn Ruby or many of the other
many languages out there just stick with
Python Python is my recommendation as a
first language
I'm a senior c-sharp programmer but I
also do a ton of JavaScript and I write
a lot of Python still I've always said
that Python is the best first language I
have videos on the matter of why you
should learn Python programming so the
long story short Python can be both
procedural and object-oriented and none
of those terms mean anything to you as a
new programmer but don't worry about it
the point is python is used in stuff
like you two
it's used for web sites like Instagram
and it's even used for some gaming but a
lot of times it's considered like a
systems programming language and once
again that's another term that you don't
really need to be familiar with but what
it is is it's just writing little
scripts and Python and we'll talk about
what a script is in a moment that runs
on your computer or a server or wherever
and it just does something so it might
go into a directory of files and start
looking through each one of those files
looking for every occurrence of the word
Chris and if it occurs in there it might
delete the file so basically if you were
trying to hide from the IRS and you're
trying to look for financial documents
that you want to get rid of or if you're
Hillary Clinton and you're trying to
delete your email server or whatever it
may be Python would be great a great
tool for something like that so that
said in order for Python to be able to
work you need to have a computer you're
going to need an Internet
and you're going to need to write your
code into something so first things
first we need to actually download
Python we want to download the latest
version so Python three point five point
two and then just immediately open it
once we download it I'm on a Windows
machine but it shouldn't matter too much
what machine you're using Python is one
of the great things about Python as well
is that it does work on Mac Linux and
Windows now you can see that it says
that I already have Python installed so
you're not going to you're probably not
going to get this message if you don't
have Python installed already but I do
but either way I'm going to go ahead and
upgrade so we'll see the the setup
process go through here
all right so after that was done that
took a long time and we can now close it
so one of the things that this really
trips up people that are just getting
started with programming in general
because it's something weird that you
have to do one sec I'm going to pause my
scan because I know it's going to slow
things down one of the weird things you
have to do is you have to actually add
Python to your command line now some of
the Python versions they don't
automatically do it and what do I mean
by that let's go ahead and open up a
command prompt so if you go into cortana
here like I'm on Windows 10 if I type
CMD I can open up the command terminal
this is the old-school ms-dos so if you
go back to like the days when I was in
like third grade
installing Leisure Suit Larry on my
laptop my black and white laptop then I
would use Doss that everything Windows
wasn't even a thing back then I'm not
even that old by the way I'm only 34 but
that was that was the day for sure so if
I type in Python just simply Python and
press ENTER I should have this
interactive prompt thing pull up and in
here I can actually type Python you can
see that it's not an actual character
but if that does not happen what that
what that means is that you need to add
Python to your path so how do you do
that you need to go to the command or
the control panel alright so inside the
control panel you're going to click on
system and security then click on system
which I can make this bigger on the
left-hand side you're going to see
advanced system settings you're going to
click on that then you're going to go
down to this box it says environment
variables and click on that now you need
to look at your path and it's going to
be under system variables right here and
if you click on the path you say edit
you need to have a listing here for
python so somewhere in here is going to
be the directory where python is
installed now it could be in one other
spot besides this too but I believe it
is I thought it would be here if not if
it's not here then it's actually going
to be in your path and your your user
variable so if I edit that and you can
see that's where python is so this is
where it's pointing to the directory
where python got installed by the
which is in my AppData local programs
Python Python 35 so what happens is when
something's added to your path windows
knows how to actually open Python
because it looks through all your path
settings for any sort of matching
executable file and executable is just a
program so long story short you need to
add Python to your path if it's not
working if it if you if it is working
then you're just gonna be able to type
Python into the command prompt and
everything is good so let's go ahead and
do that one more time so we should just
be able to say Python and then I'll make
this a little bit bigger alright so
inside here one of the cool features of
python is that it actually comes with
this thing which they call the
command-line interpreter or they call it
a dynamic interpreter you can call it
whatever the hell you want but you can
type actual Python coding here but it's
not very valuable in the sense that
you're never going to be able to write
like large or complex programs in fact
you're hardly ever going to use this
thing I never use it
most of your code is going to be written
in a actual text editor that we're going
to see here in just a moment but if I
were to say print hello world and this
is going to be our first Python
execution so print and then inside these
parentheses you have these double quotes
and all it does is it actually executes
right then and there so you actually
created a Python program by simply
saying print hello world and you can see
the output got created now one of the
things I want to show you because code
is not anything special it's just a a
like Python itself is just a language
that was made up from another
programming language called the C
programming language but Python was
built on top of C and they created all
these keywords in Python and say hey if
you type this keyboard it means do this
and do that so we know that programs all
boil down the ones and zeros but the
good news is is that as a programmer as
a Python programmer
or any other language for that matter
for most of the major languages you're
not to be writing ones and zeros you're
not even going to be writing machine
code you don't even have the right
compilers Python has all that stuff for
you so you just have to write code in a
Python specific way and it will work now
here's an example of one thing I want to
show you all your Windows software has a
notepad file and the notepad file allows
you to just write any sort of file that
you want so I could write that same code
and say print hello world and that was
the exact same code that we put in a
console but what the difference would be
in order to actually execute this with
your Python interpreter so that Python
can say hey print oh that means
something and it would then you know
print this to the screen you would want
to go ahead and save the file as and
we'll just put this on our C Drive I'll
put it in my projects directory and I'm
just going to say test and what you want
to do is actually instead of it wants
windows wants to save it as a text
document but you're going to do the
drop-down and say all files that way you
can give this a file extension and
that's just the last few characters so
like a text file is dot txt and a jpg is
a dot jpg yeah so there's all these
different file types and python has its
own file type and it's called it ends
with a py short for Python and a lot of
people call it like test pipe I or
whatever but you hear that's why you
hear the word PI all the time but anyway
if maybe you divert it at all your life
I don't don't but you're going to use
that as your file extension so test op
high we're going to save it it looks
like I already have a test op PI that's
weird
but anyway let's go ahead and open up
the command prompt to that directory so
I put it in my C projects directory and
then it's down here at the bottom I
think yeah tests top PI so if I were to
say tests top PI what happens nothing
happens because Windows didn't know how
to execute it so it actually pulled up
all this stuff and says hey we think you
want to use Python don't worry about any
of that stuff what you're going to want
to do if you wanted to run that test
file as a Python program you would just
simply say Python first
and then the name of the file and now
obviously you have to make sure you're
in the directory where the file is
currently located otherwise pythons not
going to know we're test up py is but
since I'm saying Python run test py and
I'm in the right directory it's going to
be able to run that and there it is so
python is a dynamically interpreted
language so a long story short it's
simple as hell to write Python code the
way we just showed you how to do it you
didn't even need anything besides
installing Python and a text editor and
you wrote code and actually executed it
this this code could do a lot more than
what we've seen make your right web
pages it could scrape the web it could
hack stuff it could build video games
they could do whatever you want it to do
but the way that I just showed you how
to do it here isn't feasible what we
need is a text editor we need something
in order to be able to write our code in
and the best tool for the job that I
think right now and it's completely free
is Visual Studio code this is actually
created by Microsoft and it's it's
really a fantastic project so it just
came out recently but it allows you you
can see it has Python in here but it
allows us to have much better coloring
and formatting for our Python programs
so when we're writing our code it's much
more readable another great thing is
that we can actually put little
breakpoints inside here which is what
this little red dot is and that break
point will allow the program when we say
python run this the script it'll stop
right in the middle there and you can
inspect your little names and stuff and
see what's going on as the program is
running and tell it okay execute the
next statement execute the next
statement you can just step through your
code file line by line which is a very
very important feature so what you want
to do is make sure you install this so
you're going to download for Windows and
install it once it's installed in my
case I already have it installed I'm
going to go ahead and run it
all right so now it's actually opening
up a project that I have from earlier so
I'm actually going to create a new
project for our tutorial and we're going
to call this Python for beginners so I'm
going to select that is my folder and
you're going to see in Visual Studio
code there's not a whole lot going on
here but that's because our directory
has no files in it but we're going to
add files now one of the things you may
see is this extensions and this is
actually something that I need you to do
you're going to click on this extensions
button and you want to actually search
for Python so you already have it
installed and you can see there's
multiple versions installed but you want
to make sure you pick the dawn and Jo
main version so you can see there's
actually an update to this I need to go
ahead and update but yours is going to
say install make sure you install the
right one don't install this other crap
down here make sure it's done and JMA
and it should be at the time of this
video 3.2.1 version so once you update
an extension or install a new extension
you're probably going to restart Visual
Studio code you can see that it actually
says looks like it's going to update
probably more than one proud oh sorry
project but we're going to restart this
this this program another thing too is
if you ever get involved in like github
and stuff like that
then this is also it makes it very
seamless in order to have a project
within github
alright so that went ahead and installed
and it restarts it should open back up
in the folder that you were opening last
and it looks like that did work and
let's go ahead and create our first
Python program in an actual text editor
so I'm going to click on this little new
file icon I can make this bigger
actually so this new file icon I'll
click on that let me close it alright
now we just need to name our file so
we'll say first file py
okay and now we say print hello all
right so now we need to actually say we
want to debug this but how do we do it
we go to this little debugger a little
bug icon we're going to click on that
and we're going to click on play and
since there's nothing by default with
this the first time you should see this
Python option so you want to click
Python and this is actually going to
create something for you and they call
it the like Project Jason or launch
Jason file don't mess with it just go
ahead and close that out but you do need
that in your directory so if I go over
to the directory icon you're going to
see that the vs code adds some stuff in
here like that launch jason file
jason is a java script format for
basically transporting data so you don't
to worry about any of that but Visual
Studio code needs it in order for your
your editor to work so let's go back
over the debugger thingy and now that we
have python selected and it created the
vs code for us and stuff we should be
able to click play and actually execute
this code and you're going to see it
actually pops up these little icons and
these icons allow you to you know step
through your entire line line by line so
if I said play you can see here's the
console it actually displays right out
to the bottom there now say if I had
multiple statements I can say just real
quick we're not going to look at
variables or anything but I'm going to
create something called a variable this
is a variable we're going to look into
this stuff in more in different videos
but I just want to show you an example
where I can say you know instead of
print hello world we're going to print
the value of this variable which is this
is a variable but I want to put a little
breakpoint here so if I hover to the
left of the number and I click I can
place this breakpoint and now if I click
play I want to show you the beauty of
the editor because this is going to
actually help you learn how to program
and stuff like that so here it hits this
first line I can tell it to actually go
I could step over that line go to the
next line and on the left hand side you
can see it shows the variables in this
panel and you can bring some of this
stuff down you can see X's
giving you gives you the value there but
say you had like 500 variables you would
be able to see all those variables in
here and you would be able to see line
by line how those variables are changing
you can even add a watch like if you
didn't want to look through a list of a
bunch of different variables you can say
you know what just add this to watch so
that way I can see X changing another
thing too is I can hover over the actual
X and you can see the value of it now
obviously this isn't that helpful
because you're like well clearly I see
that X is a sign there but stuff gets
changed all the time and you're in your
program and things can be changing your
variables all over the place they could
be in other files it could be you know
some sort of network error you never
know but as you're stepping through the
program to be able to see in real time
okay that's the value of this you know
this value X is very very helpful
because things do change because like I
said say here's print X and let's just
say I said you know what now x equals
this sucks
somebody changed my value all right so
now X is that and I can see okay print X
and we'll do that instead of the break
point here we're going to put the break
point down here and then I'll click play
and now I'm just going to stop at the
first line again we'll continue to go
line by line but you can see if I hover
over X it says X is still this is a
variable and you can see that this got
printed this is a variable but then this
is where X gets changed so say I'll step
over that and now pretend I haven't even
gotten to this point yet but I can hover
over X I could say oh wait that's not
this is a variable and you can see the
watch also you know lets you know that
things have changed as well so one of
the the key features as you start
getting into very very complex cover you
start having thousands of lines all over
the place you absolutely need a debugger
and a text editor and the best thing
about visual studio code is it's
absolutely free a lot of people will
tell you use pycharm a lot of the
tutorials that you're going to find on
other websites and other tutorial
youtube tutorials and aren't as good as
mine they're going to have you do all
kinds of other stuff but I think this is
a fresh new look at Python so I'm
excited to build this series let me know
you guys
thank and let me know if you have any
problems feel free to leave a
description make sure you subscribe to
the channel and I appreciate you guys
watching have a good night we'll get
into more Python in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
