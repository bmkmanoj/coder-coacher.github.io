just want to touch on block chains for
beginners and block chain is a term that
we've heard a lot about and just getting
a basic understanding of how it works
you can actually create your own private
block chain pretty easily but if you're
trying to build like the next Bitcoin
then you probably need to think twice
because it's actually quite a bit of
effort and everything involved in it in
the distributed system like that but
let's go ahead and talk about what
blockchain is alright so what is a
blockchain it's just a financial ledger
which is a list of transactions so just
like you go and check your bank account
you have a list of transactions in a
ledger so just like with banks like
Ledger's don't ever have like deleted
rows so if there's a an error you have
like a credit where you were supposed to
maybe not have the right credit like
they don't they don't ever remove those
transactions they just add new rows to
that ledger to make up for the
difference to to correct the error
things like that so it's similar to why
banks and financial institutions have to
be so so secure with their monitoring
and their reporting the same thing
applies to the blockchain technology
that all transactions are always going
to have a place in the database and
there's never going to be transactions
that are removed and if that ever
happens and there's major problems and
that's actually happened and different
blockchains before but they've been
managed to to solve those problems so
blockchain is a ledger written using
software a bitcoin was written in C++ by
Satoshi Nakamoto I think or something
like that yeah Satoshi Nakamoto but we
don't know who actually created Bitcoin
we know it was written in C++ alright so
blockchain uses hash cryptography
functions for security this is something
I would never be able to teach you about
I don't know about these are these are
geniuses from decades ago that have come
up with our standards in cryptography
and and it's just something that I know
I will never be on par with but
ultimately they are values that are that
are encrypted so you're taking strings
of data and you're encrypting it and you
get this large like hash key and in
order to decrypt the hash key you have
to know the key so the blockchain
technology managed
all of that and it it creates a record
like I said for every single transaction
all of it is encrypted using the sha-256
algorithm and if anybody tries to change
or modify any of the ledgers it's going
to modify the algorithm and because it's
a distributed system the system is smart
enough to know that if somebody tries to
like insert records that are modifying
existing values from within the
blockchain that the blockchain would
become invalidated and it wouldn't work
and that has to be resolved so it's
built in a way that through its
distributed system you'd have to have
access to almost all of it in order to
be able to to get away with invalidating
it and that's next to impossible with
distributed systems now such as Bitcoin
it's so widely dispersed out into the
world where so many different people
have the data on their software or on
their computers on their phones and on
their work servers and it's just
everywhere and like all that data is all
synchronized and it works together and
it and because the algorithms that are
used like it all has to jive and if it
doesn't then it becomes invalidated so
I'm keeping it honest so block chains
require a ridiculous amount of
sophistication to ensure that the
ledgers are synchronized across
distributed systems I did a video on
firebase and firebase as a product by
Google and it has this ability to tap
into Google's cloud structure you know
they're distributed network of servers
and and block chains have to have the
same thing there well there was a time
where the Bitcoin blockchain most of the
servers everything that housed it was
was relatively in one centralized area
so you want to make sure that all these
uh these this distributed system is
built in a way that is very fast and
it's very as close to real time as
possible so every new row of data needs
to be you know validated for proper
storage and also to make sure that
there's no there's no tampering that's
been done so in the early days of
Bitcoin I didn't want to mention that
the entire blockchain history had to be
downloaded to a user system in order to
validate the blockchain in order to be
able to use it and these days that's not
require require because of this
systems would be next to impossible the
amount the sheer amount of data for all
these transactions that have occurred
like that it would be very very it was
it was very large of a file even back in
like 2010 so it would be just
astronomical now with you know 2% of the
you know the world's energy being used
for for Bitcoin mining
I'm not Bitcoin mining but
cryptocurrency mining so there's no
central database there is no central
repository there's nothing there's no
there's no Satoshi Nakamoto he doesn't
have a server in his house or anything
all this stuff is all distributed
throughout different server farms
different end users that have downloaded
software and have interacted with the
software on their computers so the
difference between like Google and their
network you know they control their
network they control their servers and
everything there is no organization like
Google that manages Bitcoin there is an
organization that helps I that work on
the code and work on their web sites for
promoting awareness and things like that
but nobody nobody owns this all this
data it's actually a shared distributed
database so what is hashing hashing is
the the the way it's a standard of
encrypting and the encrypting is using a
sha-256 which is secure hashing
algorithm get if you guys have ever used
version control and get get uses the
sha-2 algorithm and the sha-2 algorithm
was considered to be very very secure
for the longest time but Google threw
some massive processing which took like
many years and it would have taken
something like I don't know I think with
something like thousands of years or
something like that but thousands of
years working like tirelessly trying to
compare like different documents but
they finally found a flaw and the sha-2
algorithm where they knew they could
discover it eventually it took forever
but with the shot two algorithm they
were finally able to have two different
values that had the same hash key I mean
that invalidates everything so people
were freaking out about Bitcoin right
now Shafi 256 is way way more secure
than Shah - and another thing Bitcoin
uses the sha-256 standard so are they
secure all these block chains -
and it really just depends it depends on
how distributed the blockchain
technology is like obviously Bitcoin is
very very secure at this point there's
so many different users using it so the
more users you have the more secure the
algorithm and the blockchain becomes and
it makes it much more difficult to
modify and get away with it
so it depends on the underlying
architecture of the distributed database
systems because obviously if you had if
you're not downloading the entire ledger
history then there's always the ability
there's always the potential that
distributed systems could somehow foul
up and hopefully not like I'm not
claiming that I know how or anything but
like you would think that distributed
database architecture still is at the
mercy of obviously technical hiccups and
things like that so if servers go down
or you're not able to evaluate your
blockchain technology so if you consider
that to be unsecure then you know
basically not maybe not having access to
your money at all times or maybe not
having immediate real-time access to
transactions that you've made things
like that so I think those are some of
the challenges and some people would
find that to be a little bit too
nerve-racking so block chains are also
at risk of large government's getting
involved in regulation monitoring and
basically bringing them down we see
block chains get attacked by governments
like South Korea and China and like it
sends the cryptocurrency markets just
tumbling so yeah it is it secure like
the algorithm and the distributed nature
of it is actually relatively secure but
they're still technical and you know
greedy organization type of things that
could get in the way of of whether or
not these things are truly like secure
as a like a business model or something
that you want to you know devote your
life to what are the best programming
language for what language is for
blockchain
I put C++ number one because it was
written C++ was used for writing Bitcoin
Ripple I believe aetherium as well
golang Java go Lang's very good because
of it's a concurrency Java has a lot of
big data features and everything so
that's going to be a good option Python
is probably not really too much
belonging on this list but it does
actually have the ability to work with a
lot of the api's for
the different blockchain technologies
out there so a lot of a lot of api's
that are created always have a way to
interface the Python language because
there's so many different users and then
rust is just a really good fast
systems-level language so if you were
gonna create your own blockchain
technology I would probably go with
something like rust or golang maybe C++
those would be my top three and that's
really it alright guys thanks for
watching make sure you subscribe and
have a good day
my so this video was brought to you by a
dead mountain coding boot camp they're a
boot camp that is based out of Utah but
they're also in Texas in Arizona now and
they have very good reviews so make sure
you guys check them out the link is in
the description tab below they offer
courses in web development iOS
development UX or user experience design
Quality Assurance and just a few other
ones in fact they're even getting into
Salesforce as well now so they're
continuing to adapt their courses based
on what the market needs are and major
companies are hiring some of their
alumni so make sure you guys give them a
look they have great reviews and thanks
