a second in this video to touch on
another problem that you're going to run
into a lot when you're scraping and you
get these you know large list with
duplicated content and stuff like that
and you don't need the duplicated
content and this is just a quick example
list that I have here where I have the
name David mentioned three times and you
know if this was like a movie title or a
date or something a little bit more
specific than it would probably probably
be closer to a real-world problem but I
wanted to explain how before and one of
the last videos when we compare two
pulls to list I showed you how you could
get like you could identify a list item
that you didn't want and remove it but
that could be time-consuming if you're
like trying to get rid of all your
duplicates and that's you know that's
your problem so I wanted to give you a
quick example and how you can kind of
just rip every duplicate out of a list
and in order to do that it's um it's
actually a short amount of time needed
to do it so all I got to do is just say
Lister actually no I can just say list
and I can say set and then within set
I'll do Lister actually you just say
lifts or equals lifts so I'm assigned
I'm giving a list or a new value I'm
changing it and then running the set
method upon it but keeping it a list as
opposed to turning it into a set there's
a difference between the two but by
setting it I feed it my list my list on
there I have here so by doing that I can
say for I and Lister French so we go to
our program here you can see that it
took out all the duplicated example took
out all the duplicate David's we had
three of them there and now we only have
one I'm just like we want it now one
catch though with using the set function
here
is that if you do that it doesn't keep
the order of the list so if you notice
here shit heavy now is in front of John
when it wasn't like that before so it
really has no regard for the order of
the list when it creates the new list so
just keep that in mind if you're trying
to if that's something that could affect
you but I just wanted it like I said
give you a quick example on how to get
rid of all duplicates in a list and
that's it alright thanks for watching
guys things in a rate comment subscribe
hopefully and thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
