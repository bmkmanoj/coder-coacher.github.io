explain in this video now that we've
created our first project which was
ghost python hopefully you've created
your own project name but we want to go
ahead and i just want to explain this
little thing here this is where you can
actually clone the project and what it
does is it downloads the entire project
as it exists on github so when your
cloning you're getting the latest
version of that project on github
alright so we've successfully cloned the
project I know when you click on
repositories over here you can see that
the only repository we have is right
here now we can go ahead and open this
up and you'll be able to see that the
only thing we have in it right now is
actually our read me that we generated
when we created the project so there's
nothing there but let's go back to this
main screen i want to show you that get
downloaded it to this local project to
file that i have air in my documents on
your github now i actually want to move
that so i'm going to show you how to do
that so if you're using windows we can
go ahead and go into our documents on
the github it's going to remove the
ghost python project i like to put
everything that i'm working on in my
projects directory under my c drive and
i'm going to do the same thing here i'm
going to paste that
all right now we go ahead and we try to
run this this should end up giving us an
error message and should actually do it
now see a repository not found let's go
ahead and just say find it now see it's
looking for it where it originally
assigned it here so what we want to do
is go ahead and give it a new location
so give it the location wherever you
moved it and you can see that it's once
again found so that's how I'm assuming
that your github is also going to be
downloading these are these it will be
creating these repositories in the same
location if you're using Windows 7 so
you can go ahead and change it just like
I showed you all right so I wanted to
show you guys I'm actually using visual
studio 2013 for my project or as my
integrated development environment and
in here the 2013 i think is awesome
because it used to just have team
explorer which is microsoft some
solution for like github and 2013
actually comes with git installed so I
created a new project that I called
ghost ghost Python so I'm going to go to
open that so you just want to create
some sort of Python project or whatever
project you plan on creating in github
and just open open that in your
integrated development environment
and mine is located in my projects
directory
alright so my project all it does is it
just prints hello world and Python now
if you haven't already what you want to
do is go over here to your team explorer
window it should if you're using visual
studio it will default to your solution
Explorer where your files are located
you want to click team explorer and then
there's this little button here which is
how you connect to your team project so
you can either do it through team
foundation server or if you look down
here you'll be able to see your git
repository so if you want to go ahead
and clone a repository that's where you
would do it here now I actually don't
need to do that because I've already
done it and I've already cloned it and
it's ghost Python sitting right here so
I don't need to do that so once you've
cloned the repository in your IDE you
can come over here let's just add
another line here we'll say print this
is ghost Python and we'll save that and
if we go over to if you're using visual
studio if not you need to get some sort
of integrated development environment
there are certain there's some free ones
out there visual studio has a free
version this is the actual ultimate
edition so you may not have all the
features of this one but you can look
into using like the visual studio
express komodo is a pretty good one you
could always go with something like
eclipse maybe but I definitely like
visual studio I've been using it now for
about a year and I think it's the best
one out there anyway so what we want to
do is click on this team explore over
here and then click on our changes
folder now there's a commit button here
no we can't do anything with that until
we actually write a comment about the
changes that we've made so we'll just
say this is
our first commit and you see now we're
allowed to commit to our repository so
it says that I created it locally sync
to Sarah share your changes with the
server all right so now that we've done
that we're ready to go ahead and and
share this so go ahead and hit the sync
button and you see we've got a
successful message alright so now that
we've pushed up our changes to the
server let's go ahead and go back to our
github application and I'm going to
double click on my name over here
actually I'm going to waste your time by
double clicking on my name what I
actually want to do is double click on
my project and you can see two minutes
ago this is our first commit so it
actually before we just had the initial
read me and now when you look at the
file you can see that we pushed up a
solution file which is a visual studio
solution file probably not necessary to
push that up but I am running my project
out of visual studio so unfortunately
that is going to be needed at the moment
I'm here is the one Python file that we
have including the print line that we
just added and then this is just the
Python project file so not another
visual studio file to help with we're
running the Python project anyway so
that is how you commit your change to
your repository and thank you for
watching please subscribe have a good
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
