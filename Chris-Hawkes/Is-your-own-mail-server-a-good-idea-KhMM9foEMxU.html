alright so I spent several hours tonight
trying to set up a mail server on a
Linlin node a bun to 12 point O 4 server
so just want to tell you complete pain
in the ass right in question was hosted
woodland node which is a good how a
cloud hosting company for just Linux so
no no windows or anything like that
so I'm just see Nolan Odom when you buy
the product and you just get a virtual
machine that you have to actually setup
yourself and you have the option of
being able to set up your mail server
and it's really involved because um long
story short you have to actually set up
a mail server yourself or there are
other options out there and I'm curious
what you guys do if you ever run into
this situation not basically I'm here
tonight to advise you that it's just
best to go with Google Apps which is
what I ended up doing unless you really
want to go through the frustration but I
can tell you on a site that I'm going to
end up setting up for credit card
payment so I'm gonna go with this Google
Apps here and it's only like five bucks
a month for one account but you can get
Google and it comes with like their
their Docs and their Excel spreadsheets
and stuff it's not called Excel but
whatever sort of spreadsheet document
they have that competes with Microsoft
Excel and word not stuff so Google gives
you all that crap and gives you a ton of
gmail and storage non-stop for only 5
bucks and it's per user so if you have
multiple users for your business you'll
end up having to get you know multiple
$5 accounts but the best part here is
that you get your custom email so
instead of having to set up a mail
server where it's admin at your domain
com Google will just set that up for you
and here's the bitch of it is that I
went through the process of actually
setting up the server for the node which
was called in Enochs or wait what the
hell was it call I can't think
yeah I couldn't remember what his
collars actually excellent I spent
several hours on it tonight but it was
excellent for that I ended up installing
so everything worked fine after
installing it and then having to set up
all the configs and stuff like that and
I ran into some issues where like the
mail server was running on a pork where
it was port 25 and it was saying
important 25 was in use and it turns out
it had nothing to do with port 25 being
and used the reason why the server
wasn't starting is because the the
person's server that I was working with
had a log file from a previous mail
server installation that the new Exim
four was trying to use to log in the
error it turns out it couldn't even
access that particular log so i all i
had to do was delete it but once again
it was just a pain to get all that up
and running and then after all that you
know the mail server is finally sending
mail properly and all that crap and then
it works on like juno and yahoo but
Google automatically sends the mail to
spam and the reason why is because
Google has this trust Authority ranking
where they are basically monitoring
every sort of bulk email transmission
out there so if you're trying to send
mail to a mail list or something like
that
you're gonna have to build trust with
Gmail first which is a I mean it
shouldn't be a hope you have to jump
through but there's so many spammers in
the world that it's made it a
requirement where Google basically has
to trust you before they'll allow your
mail to go through to the users inbox so
a long story short Google Apps and it's
almost like entrapment really where
they're like making you go back to use
their product it seems like I wonder if
there could be a case made for that but
I doubt it either way Google has a good
product with the Google Apps it's only
five dollars a month and I don't have to
deal with any of that headache and
there's a site that I'm actually working
on which I'm going to be integrating
with some credit card payments now which
is Intel for one one here and I'm gonna
go in to hopefully be able to do a
tutorial and actually how I get stripe
and all that crap set up here to use
with Intel forum one so I'm hoping that
we'll go through ok but we'll see
so anyway guys that's what this video
was about which is just basically if you
have your own serving or you're
considering setting up a mail server
that you're going to run into some
headaches probably and that there is
this product out there for only five
bucks a month if that's of interest to
you guys in my case I set up the mail
server just fine but it still didn't
work because of Google's trusting
bullcrap all right guys thanks for
watching and have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
