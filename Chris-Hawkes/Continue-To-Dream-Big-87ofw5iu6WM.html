video because i just watched another
video from another guy that does a video
similar to mine and I got a little
irritated with what he had to say and
that um he was basically uh the way I
took it was that he was kind of trashing
on people's dreams he was saying that
that one of his video Watchers had sent
in a question saying that you know how
do they find the perfect idea or and
what do they do if they you know
actually have the perfect programming
idea and and the guy was basically
laughing and saying that there is no
such thing as a perfect idea and
programming because everybody's already
done it so he completely discredited
what this person you know might have
been thinking about doing which is a
very unfortunate and I really wanted to
you know tell my users because I I now
have you know quite a few people that
watch the videos and I'm very thankful
for that and a few of you people arguing
videos for different reasons I talked to
a guy that was actually watching some of
my django videos and you know he
actually decided to become a programmer
and start building websites because he
wanted to help out his country now and
he lived in Kenya and I found that to be
you know really awesome I found another
guy that is legally blind who reached
out to me and was asking me about
programming advice and you know and the
fact that he's legally blind it wasn't
stopping him from trying to be a
programmer and somebody could have
easily come along and said hey that's a
stupid idea don't try to do that you're
wasting your time and I just feel like
there's just there's people out there
you know maybe they're not trying to be
evil but you know that's it's basically
just it's just hate and it's it's
fearmongering it's just you know
belittling people and new even if that's
not their intention you know it can have
detrimental effects to somebody that
might be just trying to get along or get
started in this industry so the bottom I
don't ever let anybody tell you you
can't do anything because that's just
 now one of the things I'll tell
you from personal experience and that's
that when I was getting started I
thought that I could you know basically
build the next
smoker or you know whatever I just
basically thought I could build whatever
and I think that's right because it was
also driving factor to learn but and one
of the things that you know in hindsight
i would say that there's nothing you
can't do but you should possibly try to
evaluate the scope of what you're trying
to do before you put too much emotional
investment in it because let me give an
example say i wanted to start an uber
competitor right so uber is out there
they're in the news everywhere they have
an evaluation right now somewhere around
100 billion or so people have poured
billions of dollars of funds into that
company in order to build this new way
of doing business in the taxi service
system I start off in a few cities and
now it's you know it's going worldwide
and taxi drivers hate it because
obviously it you know changes the way
that they're doing business it's like
the automobile that came along and did
away with the horse carriage and
eventually we might have you know
self-driving cars which could do away
with you know regular human driving car
so anything that disrupts an industry
like that is obviously going to it's
going to cause a lot of you know anxiety
and angst among amongst people that are
reliant upon that industry that's being
upended and it's also going to cause a
lot of you know excitement among among
people who think oh that's just some
simple idea you know I can come up with
the uber idea and next thing you know I
I have a billion dollars like Mark
Zuckerberg and Facebook who basically
built an online yearbook so the the
thing is is that you know those
successes sometimes it's about who you
know and and and sometimes your project
scope of your project and what you're
trying to do just might be too large and
that and that would be the only thing
that I would just try to advise against
before you go head over heels into your
latest programming venture but never
believe you know somebody who says your
idea is not unique renea you're not
going to be able to do a unique enough
twists on that idea you know in order to
be a pain and the competitors set aside
so you know maybe you like music maybe
you like you know e-cigarettes or maybe
you like something else that's weird you
know it
and not saying that's weird actually but
e-cigarettes is kind of weird to me
actually but um yes a for like
ecigarettes is really like a niche in
the street is probably there's probably
some competition there but if you're
passionate about it you're probably
going to fit right in and do a niche
like that but say you like music right
and a lot of people like music and
there's already a ton of music sites out
there there's no reason why you still
can't build a music blog if you're
passionate about it and you're
passionate about giving a unique user
experience that there might be a million
other people doing it but if you can do
it better you know then you know by all
means go ahead and do it and don't let
anybody tell you that you can so you
know that's really all I wanted to say
tonight is just that you know I'm really
grateful for the people that reached out
to me a lot of people are very helpful
some of you guys are trolls I'll admit
some people have really nasty things to
say about not just me but other people
and it's just amazing the you know the
hate that goes around this world
sometimes and I'm just basically don't
don't don't give in to that and don't
give up and I mean if you're if you're
good enough and you try hard enough here
you're going to you're going to find
some sort of success somewhere along the
way and an example for me personally is
that I wanted to build this music
website to get and that's what got me
started in the programming and I thought
okay I'll build something like myspace
and it's going to be better it's going
to promote bands and I was going to have
like this whole medieval type you know
feel to the entire website and I just
thought that you know the experience
alone would be unique enough to be able
to propel me ahead of other competitors
but I was dreaming big at that point
because I didn't even really know how to
program so that was my main problem is
that I couldn't even get my unique idea
off the ground because I didn't know
enough about what I was doing in order
to do it however I taught myself enough
to be able to land a full-time
programming gig which I'm still doing
now and I'm still learning and I have
enough skills now where i could probably
implement that original idea it's just I
still have a time constraint and in
order to be able to get something like
that off the ground but just because
there's a million people out there doing
it doing music websites and just because
somebody says that hey I might
I'm making money with it or you know
you're never going to compete with MTV
or myspace or Spotify or whatever it is
that you know that's hot at the moment
well you know you know so be it I mean
I'm not saying that I should go out and
build the next spot by Spotify had a lot
of money and millions of dollars and
obviously there's tons of costs and
music licensing and stuff like that but
there's no reason why I can't you know
maybe do a unique spin on how I display
data or how I write my data or you know
how I create user interfaces that users
might be able to like in order to be
able to share to like to and and do
things like that so don't let anybody
tell you that you can't do something
have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
