bit under the weather I wanted to follow
up on a video that I did a couple of
days ago about why you would use medium
and a lot of people were like well the
medium you know provides this format
where you can get this you know this
nice pretty professional look and things
like that so if you don't know a whole
lot about web design and development
it's hard for you to be able to
replicate what you what you know medium
is providing you as a UI but one of the
products that came to mind actually just
recently is this quilt they just
recently released their first like
production version of this thing and if
you've ever tried to do like those uh
WYSIWYG editors online you've seen
things like tiny mice and tiny mice like
T iny MCE I believe and basically it's
like you know a text editor like word
you know Microsoft Word is a software
application that's a text editor it's
built for print so you can like write
novels and PDFs and stuff and Microsoft
Word but it's not really made for the
web so quill is trying to fill that gap
it's basically trying to be a Microsoft
Word type of thing but built for the web
so that means embeddable YouTube videos
tweets you know my frames and things
like that so this in a way is actually
another another competitor to medium
because mediums I hey will provide you
all these tools but then you're going to
be developing all your content on our
platform where you could have instead
like a PHP website or a Django I'm sorry
Python or Java or any other programming
language or node and you could actually
just install quill and have the cool API
and you could write your blogs and quill
and actually use quill to actually
display those blogs and and you get the
same results so like I mean it's also it
works across across platforms and stuff
like that so it's it's mobile mobile
first so not just for the web but also
for mobile web you know for cell phones
and things like that
and it looks like it's relatively easy
to install so I haven't actually tried
to set this up but um you know after I
finished the the Python video I'll try
to get into it but yeah so I mean I
definitely I'm interested in actually
implementing this on some of my site so
if I want to write some vlogs and
things like that let's say it'd be a lot
easier to use a product like this but um
I just thought I'd also mention it and
even in the documentation it shows you
like basically what they do to go
through and replicate what medium is
providing within their editor so one of
the biggest features of this though is
that you can customize it so if you do
know a little bit about code you can
actually customize this to make it a lot
more unique to your particular site so
if you have a widget in a particular way
that you're like displaying your photos
or you know YouTube videos or tweets and
things like that you can you can
customize this thing all the way down
but if you don't know how to code then
you can just simply include the it's
like a JavaScript plug-in basically and
and then you can fire way you don't have
to be an editor or a coder to be able to
work with it but yeah this so this is
just a side-by-side comparison of you
know their editor compared to medium so
in a way this is bad news for medium
because you know there's downsides to
medium and the plus sides are being
replicated by a project here like quill
JFS where before quill there's tiny mice
and tiny mice wasn't bad and I don't
even know if it's pronounced tiny mice
but that's the way I've read it and it
wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't as
fluid and nice looking as quill here so
anyway guys I thought I'd share that
with you and once again I'm still under
the weather so like I don't really feel
like I'm in a frame of mind to be doing
any tutorials tonight so thanks for
watching guys have a good day
