this video what we want to look at is
the new spread operator in es6 and it's
actually used and come in two different
ways like you're gonna look at like
there's this object D structuring where
you see the spread operator kind of
being explained and and described and
then there's just the simpler ways which
let's focus on the simple way first so
if I were to have an array where I said
very little bands equals I'll just name
two bands so Silverstein and let's just
say like alright so those are two bands
in an eternal ray now what if I wanted
to actually insert another array well I
can do that through this new spread
operator so if I said they're variable
awesome bands equals and then I'll just
put in here base side and Senses Fail so
here's two more items in an array I can
use this spread operator to actually say
dot dot dot and then awesome band so
let's go ahead and console dot log and
and another thing to that I want to
focus on real quick is when we're doing
our babel compile if we throw in another
argument after bundled ijs where we say
- W
it stands for watch that wait on to keep
running babel every time you make a
change this will constantly listen for
changes and output the file so we don't
do listen or keep doing that over and
over again so let's go ahead and open up
our browser and you can see inside here
we have you know the array where we use
the spread operator to insert another
list of items so if you see the
difference here like if I were to go you
know what let me just say instead of
using the spread operator I'm just gonna
say awesome bands so we'll save it real
quick let's look at the difference that
gets outputted and you can see what we
have here is we have two two strings and
then we have an array inside the array
so that's why the spread operators a
little bit cooler so I can actually
converge to arrays you know
easily you could also pass them in as
arguments as well so like if I if it was
like a function variable band function
equals function and then I'm gonna say
arms and for barbell X equal you know
and others do okay we'll just do a
simple for variable actually which bar X
equal zero X is less than arms length X
plus plus so we're looping over all the
arguments we're just going times without
log X all right so what we're doing I
was just gonna look through all the
arguments that are passed into this
function and console logs the specific
argument that is being iterated so now
if I wanted to call fan function I could
do that and then I could pass in dot dot
dot awesome bands and you know each one
of these arguments are passed in to the
arms but what's going to be interesting
watch what happens when we execute this
you can see it takes in the first
argument which was Bayside which is
awesome man but then it iterates each
letter and the string for only Bayside
so it's like well why didn't that work
well what I could do is I need to say
you know what I'm passing in a spread
argument to this function so that's
different so you pass in the spread and
you tell the function to be expected
expecting this the spread operator so
now it'll iterate through the two bands
that you gave it so I mean technically
yeah is it that big of a deal for
something like this because you're like
well you know obviously I could have
just said arms and and not done it as a
spread operator and got you'd get the
same result doing it this way as well
but you know the point of the the point
of it is is that the spread operator is
also used in something called object
destructuring so let me give you an
example of that so if we were to say VAR
a B and then rest so we're declaring
those and we're going to say
a the rest equals and then one two three
four five six seven eight nine alright
so now we have this this this assignment
that's occurring and what's going to end
up happening is a and B is going to be a
sign the the first two values here but
we actually need to use the rest
assignment and because we're using the
structuring assignment and we're
actually using we're assigning all these
values at the same time we need to wrap
them in the square brackets so we're
saying a is going to equal 1 B is going
to equal 2 and the rest using the spread
or object a structuring argument is
going to get the rest of these values so
let's go ahead and say console dot log a
console dot log B and then console dot
log rest right
all right and there you see one two and
then the rest of the operator so that's
called object II structuring we're
taking an object of work where we're
making a difference and also just to
make sure that you're aware you don't
have to use the rest for that to work
that way you could even do it like this
variable a B and this would work the
same way a and B would be assigned those
two value C so you can do it that way
just find this that's no problem you can
see it one two so just so you guys are
clear the spread operator when I was
giving this demonstration is more along
the lines of object of structuring
whereas you know the object of
structuring is kind of this new feature
where you can you can do things by
changing the way objects are outputted
during assignment so in this particular
case we just want to focus on the spread
operator though and and I think that we
covered it pretty well in this video so
I'm gonna go ahead and end it here make
sure you guys subscribe vote up and
thank you bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
