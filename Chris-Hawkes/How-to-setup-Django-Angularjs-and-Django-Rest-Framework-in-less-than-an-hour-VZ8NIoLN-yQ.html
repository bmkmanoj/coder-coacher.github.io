we're going to be talking about is how
to get angularjs working with a django
application and what i'm going to be
doing is i'm actually developing
something that is in production right
now and bringing in angular to take over
some of the server side responsibilities
to move it to the client side so the
website in question here is called new
movies comm and currently this
particular example is not in production
right here but on this application is
available online and this is the typical
movie page of the application and all
this data is coming from the database
and what I want to do is I want annular
to be able to deliver this for me so
that being said what you need is you
need to have Django installed and Django
if you don't know is a web framework for
Python it's definitely the best
framework out there and the Python
language and it's a good competitor for
Ruby on Rails and also for asp.net so I
would say Django ASP and Ruby on Rails
probably the three top frameworks out
there and you can see on Django disgust
Instagram Mozilla Pinterest on sites
like the onion and NPR like count of big
sites use triangle in fact I think more
large sites use Django than Ruby on
Rails but anyway so I can definitely
scale what we need though in order for
angular to be able to work right angular
is a JavaScript framework and it's
supposed to take a lot of the
responsibilities of the server to
deliver data and things to and from a
database whatever it it has a lot of the
client-side handle making those requests
and things like that a lot of it's done
is synchronously using Ajax so that it's
sending a request to your server or even
just manipulating the Dom which is the
document object model which really just
means how everything is situated on your
HTML page angular makes it a breeze to
be able to hide and show certain things
display data upon certain things and
really when it does need to communicate
with the database to save something
you're going to want to do that
and API so you want to have an API on
your Django application to expose
certain things like updating a movie or
deleting a movie or whatever and it's
all just HTTP calls to your restful
service and that call will consist of
like Jason which is stands for
JavaScript object notation and Jason is
just so it's an easier version of XML
basically so it's structured data that
is very suited for the web very low
footprint so all right that being said
in order to get a restful api on your
django application there's two options
there's django tasty pie and then
there's Django rest framework the Django
rest framework I started off with tasty
pie Ashley loved it I found it was a lot
easier than rest framework but Django
rest framework has definitely arisen as
being like really the only option that
anybody should be going with at this
point for any sort of Django application
Django tasty pie is about to be it's
going to have some some compatibility
problems here as Django moves into the
future especially for three-point or
Python 3.0 so with Django it doesn't
matter if you're on Windows or Linux
since this is a production environment
I'm going to be using my Linux shell
through putty since I'm on a Windows but
either way whatever your command line is
whether it's Windows or Linux I'm what
we need to do is go ahead and I'm just
pip install and it's going to be a
Django rest framework one word
all right and you're going to see it
actually do a lot more than what mine
just David mines already installed now
that we've done that we need to go over
to our settings file of our Django
application and I have that pulled up
here I'll go ahead and zoom in a little
bit so you guys can see a little bit
better alright I'm so tasty pie is
currently installed I'm actually going
to be removing that sorry tasty pie and
we're going to be using a rest framework
so let's go ahead and add that to our
installed apps and that's what this is
here install the apps these are all
different apps that new movies currently
uses and we're going to say what the
hell is it called alright just simply
called a rest underscore framework
alright so we'll add that over alright
so now that we've installed that I'm
going to go ahead and go back over to my
my shell and we want to do Python manage
that py and sync EB hopefully I don't
run any problems since I just removed
tasty pie from the application and since
this is in production let's go ahead and
just make sure we didn't blow up
anything and we did no module name API
that's because of the tasty pie
reference all right one second
you
all right so I'm to give you guys an
idea on what this site looks like I'm
going to go back here alright so this is
like I said an existing website right
now not a ton of traffic I'm gonna be
redesigning it really trying to do a lot
of work to it I think to try to expand
on you know my skills and stuff like
that so I think there'll be a lot of
improvements and down the road but
anyway just give you an idea on what
we're going to be implementing angular
into we're going to start with the
actual movie object and the movie is its
own app so there's a movie app and a
movie app would consist of something
like this where when you go to the movie
this particular movie page is not in
production right now if you actually go
to the site you're going to see
something that looks different but this
is the direction that I'll be taking the
website going forward but you can see
there's like reviews here there's a
trailer image got rating system all that
stuff you've got all the different star
objects and all this stuff is based off
of the movie app itself so that's what
we're going to implement angular into so
to give you an idea on what the model
looks like the model is a relatively big
bastard as you can see we have star we
have stars which is a many many
relationship to different stars like
stars is its own object where like you
have information in regards to all this
stuff symbolizes something within new
movies and what we need this to be
though is we need to be able to
communicate with this via an API and
that's where Django rest framework is
going to come in all right so to get
that started let's go ahead and go to
our our thing in this is called on my
project and we want to go over to where
we have like our settings file and
everything which you can see is here
settings URLs views this is all for the
main app let's go ahead and add a new
file I'm using Visual Studio try to
disregard that it's weird house don't
have to do this but I'm just set up a
new Python file we're going to call this
serializers
py just like that and now first things
first me to say from rest framework I'm
going to go ahead and zoom in on this
come on
and once I can import serializers right
so from rest frame working import
serializers and we're going to say from
movie dot models because remember this
is the movie app and this is going to be
whatever app you need to build angular
for so I'm sorry to angle about rest
framework on so we're doing dealing with
the models we're going to say import
model uh movie which is the name of the
model class then we say from Django dot
can trim off that models import user and
that is the standard out of the box um
user table that Django comes for
authentication and things and we're
going to build a class and we're going
to call this movie serializer and then
we pass in serializers dot hyperlinks
model serializer
and we had a internal class class Mehta
and we're going to say model equals
movie and we're going to say fields
equals and these are all the fields that
you want to expose so for right now
we'll say title ID we're going to want
to do a lot but for right now I'm going
to do this I'm just going to do some
simple stuff right now all right so next
thing we want to do let's go over to the
movie project or app within our project
and in our view is there let's go ahead
and add some views for our API and we're
going to have to import a bunch of crap
so we're going to say from Django
shortcuts import render to response and
we also want to probably anything I
don't even know that I need that
actually sorry we probably going to need
that but I will leave it there in case
we bring in any other views so let's go
ahead and create a view set view for the
movie API so we're going to call this
movie view set and we pass in view set
stock Model View sir
and then here we're going to just say
query set equals movie objects dot all
and we'll give it a serializer class
serialize their class equals a movie
serializer which we just defined okay
and since we're going to be referencing
that we obviously need to import that so
we have to say from serialized actually
we should say from project serializers
yeah whatever your project name is I'm
just safe from that that serializer is
import and then movie serializer just so
you guys can see this now another thing
too is that when this thing since it's
in production I don't want it to be I
don't want people to be able to edit
stuff so what we want to do is we want
to add a permission on this this view
set here so that only a super user or at
least the owner of the object in
question so if I've created a movie
object and I would be the only one to be
able to edit that so just some for right
now until I get my authentication
figured out I'm just going to make sure
that only I have access to that so let's
create a permission class and we're
going to say equals here this is where
you just pass in a custom permission
class and right now we have a creative
one but we're just going to say is owner
or read-only and that is just a tuple so
let's go ahead and I'm real quick on
let's finish this off and then we'll go
ahead and create this class that doesn't
exist yet so down here we want to say
define pre save we're overriding the
save method self dot object we'll say
object dot owner equals
so for that request out user so
basically any time a new movie is added
by a user what we're doing is we're
assigning the objects owner as the
current user this needs to be spelled
right as the current logged in user so
that way only they will be able to edit
any sort of new movies that are added so
while we're in here we need to go ahead
and create another Python file for other
permissions that we just referenced and
we'll just call it permissions that py
and we need to go ahead and import from
rest framework import permissions and
then we create the class that we
referenced a second ago and we'll say is
is owner or read-only and we pass in
permissions base permission
let's create a method that has object
permission self request view object if
request method and permission not safe
methods and what this does is it just
verifies whether or not the person has
permission to do something with that
object and basically what this does
right here is it saying that if it's a
get request and get requests are fine
you don't to be authenticated
obviously you can't update anything with
a get request so it just returns true
and then we're going to say so if
doesn't return true then we say return
object owner equals request that user I
so only the user is going to the user
that created the object will be able to
actually edit it otherwise they can just
view it alright let's go back over to
our view real quick and we need to
import this is owned or read-only
otherwise that will fail so we'll say
from my project actually we just say
from permissions import and this
now one of the things that I do want to
fix now is that we have serializers in
our root directory and I want to remove
that and I want to put it in the app
that it pertains to so I'm putting it in
the movie app
all right so that's now in there I need
to fix the import then from permissions
or from the view actually let me say
from from serializers import movie
serializer I just want to keep
everything confined to this app alright
so now it's time to go ahead and move on
to the URLs of the movie app which there
isn't even one right now so let's go
ahead and create that so it's just a
standard URLs that py file and some
standard things from Jango dot config
URLs import star from rest framework and
port routers from movie dot or more like
from moving important reviews that
should work alright and then we're going
to say router equals routers dot default
router and then we're going to say
router dot Register and here we're going
to give a regular expression like we
normally do with our with our URLs in
Python and Django so we're going to say
movie and then we'll save use dot movie
view set
alright now it's going to define the URL
pattern so URL patterns equals patterns
will see URL our API forward slash and
then we just say include router dot URLs
close off alright that looks good there
I can guarantee there's gonna be some
errors when I put this in production and
just a second here and we'll figure
those out hopefully you guys can follow
along with this I would say this is
probably I mean this is more moderate to
more advanced level of programming and
Django and particular and certainly
requires some sort of knowledge of
Django rest framework which I'm not an
expert in that I've hardly used it at
all so it's definitely learning
experience but we'll get this thing
working all right so now that is the
moment of truth I'm going to go ahead
and try to upload all of this to the
server and see how much crash is on all
right so I've uploaded that to my server
I'm going to see like I said I have no
confidence that this thing's going to
work so there's no compilation error
which is good it doesn't mean that means
that we haven't completely effed
something up all right now we need to go
over to I think it's movie and an API
right that's not right you know what I
wasn't even using I have to update my
regular URLs file because I wasn't even
using a URLs for that app so the
production's application doesn't know
about it so let me show you here
the damage down here alright so we need
to add and clue
we're going to include movie moves we
got URLs alright so here's the first
error it says view sets is not defined
and views line so if I pull up view sets
actually no it just needs to be imported
so we're going to say from some rest
framework goddamnit rest framework
import view sets
let me see if this makes any difference
all right so now we get a new error
movie is not too fine I thought I
imported that but I guess it's not
finding it so let's take a look at that
it's in the movie and view set yeah that
would definitely be a problem here you
can see that it's referencing the movie
class and we haven't imported it so we
need to say from movie Thursday from
models import movie that should work all
right so let's try that again
god dammit
that's a misspelling pattern this is
what happens when you freeform type
stuff all right so we got a patterns
lent URLs on eight none of this stuff is
a big deal just all typical stuff
anytime you're developing especially
when you're writing stuff out so
patterns typos good upload go back to it
refresh all right we have the API
alright so the API is working we got no
style though that's weird
typically if you run into this problem
you probably want to do a collect static
so that's we're going to go ahead and
try to do that real quick permission
issue if you're on Linux you want to a
sudo command when you do that so python
managed not py collect static this type
yes so copied copied some static files
and this mother F and still not working
all right so I have I have some sort of
a messed up setting with my situation on
the static files I don't know why that's
not working but all I need to do since
is Linux I can make a static link or
symbolic link from the Django rest
framework where it's installed where the
CSS files are current
I'm sitting oh shit so there would be a
problem there so we just say static and
then rest framework maybe alright this
should definitely work alright so rest
framework alright good
alright so booyah there we go I don't
know why I just said booyah guys sorry
about that anyway so now we have a
static CSS everything working here all
right so when we look at this thing we
got options we got over here we can say
let's look at some Jason and you go to
do movies on API now if I want to say
like movie one and movie not Fallon
let's find a movie that does exist what
movie was this movie 108
okay it has an attribute owner that is
actually our permission coming in and
screwing with us right now but let me go
ahead and make an adjustment to that so
actually don't want to make adjustment
to that right now just because this is
in production if you go over here you
can switch between the API and Jace and
I'm going to put Jason and you can see
it just formats Jason on the end and by
doing so we can do a get which is what
we're going to okay there we go
alright so it needs me because it's in
the movie application and our API is a
URL within the movie within the project
and then we have the actual movie object
name followed by the actual ID of the
movie entry and you can see that we're
getting three results back we're getting
the title the ID and the image and the
reason why we're getting that back is
because of how we define how we define
that so if we go back over to our movie
object over here and we look at our
serializers we can see they were only
returning the title the ID the image and
you would just add each element that you
do want to return for that so for right
now though since we do have a basic set
up now where we can retrieve stuff via
JSON calls and via restful api we just
kind of want to leave Django rest
framework there and now move on to the
angular aspect all right let's go back
over to our application one of the
things we need to do to our urls file is
we want to go ahead and give it a base
URL so when we go to that URL that URL
will serve as like the single page app
that angular is I mean it's all about
having a single page do all your routing
and all that crap without having to have
a bunch of different URLs and stuff like
that so it's good and defined that now
and this is just going to be we're going
to call this movie
and we'll say movie dot view index and
now that we've done that let's go ahead
and move over to the view so we can add
that and above the class here let's go
ahead and define that index it's just a
simple request on just like Django
always does I'm going to say render to
response this is what we actually are
going to use that render to response
that we brought in before now we need to
point to the template where this thing
is going to exist so you should have
some sort of template so some sort of
template directory I have it sitting in
my static and templates and what we're
going to do is we're actually going to
create a new folder for that now I'm
going to call this movie - it's kind of
like the entire update so let's say
movie - and we'll just call this movie
dot HTML and then request context
request now we also need to import the
request context so let's say from Django
template import request context ok so
now that we've done that what we need to
do is go ahead and create an index file
inside our movie - folder another lean
index but just so web page we're going
to call this movie as you can see we
reference it here and what I'm going to
do is I actually have a web page that
follows the design that I was showing
you guys earlier for the site that I'm
currently in the process of redoing and
just so you know what I'm talking about
it's this page here so like the CSS -
kind of layout and everything is going
to be the direction that I take this and
wizard without angular I'm not 100% sure
yet but um you know this point we're
looking
implementing angular for this page so I
don't want to bore you with writing all
of that template code and everything so
I'm just going to paste all that in here
but all this is is just a Django
template and due to my editor I have to
do I have to do a weird save here
because it does this signature thing on
it and it messes up in Chrome I just had
to do this real quick alright now first
things first we're going to create a app
and our project for angular so we're
going to start moving into angular
specific stuff and the name of our app
is going to be called just movie app so
in order to get an angular app to work
not just Django but anywhere you have to
actually specify it so we need to go
ahead and do that now in our HTML tag
make sure it's not the doctype but the
actual HTML tag we're going to go ahead
and say ng - app equals movie app ok
alright now that we've done that let's
go ahead and we need to download angular
so just go here we're going to download
make note of the version that we're
grabbing we're grabbing one 2.26 and i'm
going to grab the uncompressed version
that way it's easier to debug it you
might get this heart it could harm your
computer don't worry about it just
JavaScript just go ahead and grab that
we're going to open it
contents are going to look like this
just go ahead and copy all that content
and inside the folder where we're
developing I'm going to be putting the
JavaScript files that we're going to be
developing in and a J's folder under
movie 2 because this is a rewrite for me
so I'm going to go and create a new
JavaScript file in this JavaScript movie
2 folder and I'll call this angular and
we want to make sure we call it the same
version so one to one 2.26 as overton
was
you got one 2.26 so make it make sure we
make note of that so we'll add that now
god damnit this should be Jas
alright so it's an angular file we'll
paste all that angular code in there and
save it now with angular to work you
also need to have the route angular
route to download from so let's go ahead
and grab that and that's so that they
don't handle client-side routing so what
you want to do is just click on this
previous versions and go down to one two
to six and open that folder and look for
angular route and we're going to copy
this and let's create another JavaScript
file angular and we'll plot route and
give it the version 12.2 6j s and then
here we're going to and paste all that
now it's important that we go ahead and
bring that into our Django template so
we're going to reference angular first
okay
you
and then we'll say angular routes so
make sure we bring in both angular and
angular route now we're going to go
ahead and create a folder that angular
needs which is going to be called it's
another JavaScript file it's going to be
called app J s and app j s is where
we're going to actually define that
movie app that we just added to our
Django templates we'll say variable
movie app equals angular module not
modules that's gotten me before god damn
it and no wonder because it
automatically does it thanks to my
editor okay that's why anyway that
thing's bitten me a couple times so
movie app is the first argument and then
we're going to pass in a list of ng
route and we're going to say movie
controllers go ahead and close that off
now under a movie app we're going to add
a config so movie app config and we're
going to say route provider and on the
next line we'll say function then we
pass in the route provider then we say
route provider again and then we say dot
and then just do a new line under that
and we say when and now we're creating
URLs like you see with Django so we're
going to identify a URL just like the
Django URL so we're going to say movie
forward slash colon and then we'll say
movie ID
I open and close brace now let's give a
template URL and this is going to be an
actual path to where it can find the URL
on your website so it's new movies comp
which less static je s and then we call
this movie 2 and then we're going to
create a folder inside movie 2 called
parcels and we're going to create a HTML
page named movie detail HTML now we
assign it to a controller controller
equals movie controller let's close that
off and then this is all one line here
right now in order for routes to work
with Django we need to add another thing
to our movie app and we're going to say
a movie app that config again and Django
has the built in CSR protection for
cross-site forgery protection and it
will reject and get and post requests to
your restful service without that token
being a passed along with the request so
that's what we're going to do right now
is we're going to set this up so that
every request that is made it takes the
token from the browser session and
passes that along with the the restful
request so it won't be rejected by
Django and here this we're going to do
is HTTP provider defaults dot xsrf
cookie name equals a CSRF token and
that's the cookie name that Django
always passes in its own sessions HTTP
provider dot defaults and then this one
is xsrf header name
equals x CSRF token
alright so that'll take care of a lot of
headaches that's a big gotcha when
you're dealing with Django and angular
alright so now that we've identified our
app let's go ahead and add it to our
movie folder so we don't forget to do
that so we're going to copy this line
here just paste it and then remove the
angular stuff we're going to say app J s
okay now let's go ahead and create a new
JavaScript file which is going to be our
controller file and this is going to
handle routing for us so new JavaScript
file we'll call this controllers dot J s
and here we're going to define movie
controllers equals angular dot module
and this is going to type modules even
though I don't want it to hit movie
controllers pass in an empty list I'm
going to close that statement off now we
need to identify the API call for movie
details so we can return the movie image
and things that we did earlier in this
video so let's go ahead and do that now
we're going to say movie controllers dot
controllers and we'll call this band
rock band
I'm sorry movie detail controller
here we're going to pass in a list it so
it's scoped route params and HTTP
in this next line we're going to say
function and the arguments are scope
route params and HTTP and the next line
we say HTTP GET and this is going to be
the actual URL to where I can find that
your adjacent restful service in this
case since it's a movie detail we want
it to go to the API where it can
actually get information from the movie
so we'll say WWE movies comm forward
slash movie forward slash API forward
slash movie again
another forward slash and then here
we're going to use our route params I'm
actually need to concatenate those so
make sure it's a plus sign there and
we're going to say route params dot
movie ID plus and then forward slash
question mark format equals jason then
we need to say dot success which is a
callback function in JavaScript and what
this is it's a callback that just simply
passes back data from the API call and
that data is going to be assigned to the
scope dot movie and we're going to say
it equals data and this movie app thing
got concatenated I did not want that so
scope dot movie equals data so what this
does is any call made to this is AB and
it's a movie detail so you movie detail
if it's movie 108 route params iMovie ID
is going to be 108 right and it goes to
this API and onsuccess so if it gets a
200 back from a restful service that 200
success is going to pass back the data
from the restful service which is Jason
and it's going to assign it to an
angular movie scope object where it does
that here hopefully this will make more
sense to both you and I later on as we
get more comfortable with angular but
this is all and
stuff and everybody wants to live in the
world of single page apps and all that
shit so that's what this is all about
javascript everything I guess anyway so
that's what that does alright so before
we forget we want to make sure that we
go ahead and we add that to our movie
HTML Django template page so this is
going to be controllers J s right now if
you notice in our in our app here we are
referencing a movie to forward slash
partials movie detail HTML so when you
go ahead and add that now so here's our
movie to folder we're going to add an
additional folder for partials where we
can add the partial view that angular is
going to render when a request is made
for a specific movie so let's add an
HTML page we're just going to call this
movie detail like we've already
specified there and I want to get rid of
all this crap and I want to just say h1
equals movie title and then we're going
to pass back an image so we're going to
grab an image tag and we'll say image
source equals movie URL or an I'm sorry
image and then I want to give it width
of 300 and a height of 400 for right now
and that's really all we're going to
deal with on this template this partial
view now in order for that partial view
to work we need to go back to our movie
Django template and below all this stuff
down here I'm going to go ahead and you
have to identify where do you want the
partial view to be displayed within the
master template which is what this movie
HTML page is it's essentially you can
considered a master template so that
being said I want to place it inside of
this div tag here so that it'll be it
should be centered in the screen if
everything goes well so we need to say
give ng - view and that's it it's all I
got to do right now all this stuff needs
to be loaded to the server which I'm
going to do right now so if we look at
this here this is what we got is our
page now when you go to let's just go to
new movies con figure out kind of recap
what we did
currently newbies comm has a movie if I
go to a movie one one eight you get
there's a woman 9 this one doesn't have
an image ok there we go I see you get
this this page this is um this is the
normal Django rendering before I ever
got started if you actually go to this
page you're going to see something
different there's a redesign it's not in
effect yet but this is normally what you
get now what we did though is that if we
go to forward slash movie and then
forward slash movie we are going to get
to our Django not without the four slash
I'm sorry just a forward slash and now
you're going to the single page app and
this is displaying that template that I
showed you that I copied over it's
displaying this template and it's
displaying it's adding the movie app and
all that stuff so if angular likes what
we have so far we shouldn't get any
complaints in the browser and that's
what I want to check for right now so if
you're using Chrome you can just right
click and say inspect element and then
go over to the console and I got a
couple of 404 is not found but those are
for images as part of the UI that I'm
not worried about so there's no Django
specific puking going on or angular
specific puking going on which is good
so this is um
Django now serving an angular page now
what we're going to do in order to query
our restful service using angular
routing system we need to make sure that
after the movie there is a pound sign
and then forward slash and we're going
to say movie and let's go ahead and try
to find that enchanted movie by doing
forward slash one-one-nine so from
within the single page app it's going to
do handle the routing based on this part
right here
and it worked so you can see that
because if we go back to what we did on
this long-ass video originally we ended
up we ended up passing back specific
data right god I got so much stuff
pulled up now no it wasn't that it was
in our serializers that we decided okay
we're going to pass back a title and ID
which really isn't going to be necessary
for UI perspective or at least for a
presentation anyway and then the image
so those are the only three things I'm
bringing back so that's why this
displays in this way but this is using
angular to do it so I think 108 was a
chipmunk movie so yeah you see that so
that's um there's another one too so
it's actually using angular on a Django
application communicating with a django
restful service built with the Django
rest framework and this really just
touches the surface of angular but at
least it gives you an idea on the
initial headache just to kind of get a
Sango server stack set up to work with
angular and the Django rest framework so
there's a ton of information and a lot
of tinkering and things that you can do
with you know just rest framework or
with angular so I'm not going to be
getting into that in this particular
video this was just how to get over the
hump and getting angular to work with
Django alright guys I appreciate if you
stuck it out with me and I apologize for
any sort of errors or mistakes that were
made along the way this is what I would
consider a pretty complex subject I do
c-sharp development at work and this is
just as hard as anything that or at
least you know just the unfamiliar
nature of it makes it difficult but all
that stuff it gets easier with time and
I think Django is a perfect perfect
candidate for hosting angular
applications and single page apps and
things so anyway guys feel free to leave
a comment
please rate comment subscribe and I'll
try to get back to you guys we have
errors and things or if you need help
with your project alright thanks for
watching bye
