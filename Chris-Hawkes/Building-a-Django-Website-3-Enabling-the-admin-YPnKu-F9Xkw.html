this new tutorial series we just got
done with actually setting up our django
application getting it on the server
even saw some stuff of a standard um you
know server setup type stuff with the
whiskey file and now we're going to be
moving on to actually enabling our
database so we're using my sequel and
once again you have to have that
installed on your system if you're
developing locally so that you can have
a root user and a login password so you
need to add that to your settings file
and I can't show you mine just even
though I plan on changing after the
series I can't just have people you know
there's people here that would just log
in and probably delete my database or
something but I don't I can't give you
the username and password for that but
go ahead and set that up put that in
settings file up at the top just like we
had gone over in the last video and once
you're able to do that we want to go
back to our little command prompt inside
Linux or if this is in Windows wherever
it is you wanna go ahead and go into
your my project folder and here we want
to say python and python needs to be on
your command prompt so when i type
python python pulls up because linux
knows where python lives and how to
handle that so go ahead and say python
manage dot py sy n c DB alright what the
frig is this
huh okay one second okay the reason why
this is is in our manage that py file
I'm gonna go ahead and just I'll put
this inside the the notes and the the
bottom of the video here but what I have
is I have this little piece of code here
and I'm basically just saying import
settings because the settings is going
to be in the same directory because I
changed things around a bit because like
I said I like to have since my project
is name of our application
I want the sub modules of my project to
be you know in their own directories
inside of my project so basically all
this all these files and stuff is
pertaining to the what I call like the
outer main project of my my project so
hopefully this code right here will be
able to allow manage that people I to be
able to find the settings file which it
needs and like I said I'll make sure I
copy this into the notes
that way you guys have that if you want
to have a similar setup alright so now
that we've done that let me go ahead and
upload that
all right let's go back to the command
prompt see if we can try this again
uh okay one second it's because I put in
the wrong password in my settings file
okay so I just went ahead and updated
the settings file here I don't have to
upload my server or settings file okay
now we've done that so when you do the
Python manage that py sync DB that's why
in c DB the first time you do it when
you're setting up brand new database on
installation django is going to go
through this process of creating a super
user so you just want to go ahead and
say yes to create that you can leave it
blank for right now I'm gonna leave my
email address blank and then you want to
give it a password and now once that's
done you'll now have database stuff over
here on the left so you have all this
all these tables that Django builds
automatically for like the auth and
groups and stuff like that so it saves a
lot of hassle there now that we've done
that let's go ahead and enable the
Django admin so to do that we need to go
to our urls file and we need to
uncomment these two lines here and I
also want to do something while I'm in
here as well I want to go and remove
this and just change this with this
because what ends up happening is with
what we had there before if you're in a
server environment
Apaches gonna complain about the way
that was importing and it lot writes to
a log file every time a request is made
so your log files can get huge if you
have a production website so by taking
that out I try to keep that down a
little bit so you then uncomment this
line to enable the admin and we need to
go back to our settings file go to our
installed apps and we want to uncomment
down here to install the Django admin
let's upload everything and go back to
this and now the Django admin
should be installed so if we go over
here and type admin you can see that we
have a login now what we need to do is
we need to actually fix the fact that we
don't have any CSS showing up for our
admin so what we want to do it without
FileZilla pulled up in fact let's go to
our actual editor instead and go over to
my project and it's going to be inside
static let's create a folder for admin
now the admin contents we need to go
ahead and grab from Django itself and
one of the easiest ways is simply if you
had like a Django set up here let me
show you like if I have a Python
installed
I have lived cite packages
hell I just realized I don't even have
Django installed in this machine since I
don't run Django locally well anyway you
should be able to find in your live site
packages and there's an admin and you
when you find the admin and Tiger Django
installation you can just copy that
admin all the contents and just place it
right in your static so that way all
those static CSS and everything that the
Django admin needs will be there so I'm
just going to find Django on my server
here and it's located in I think let me
see
it's a contributor Django can't ribbon
really all this stuff in admin here
going to static and then admin
so on Linux um in order for me to be
able to solve this problem and you
create a directory called admin and then
when I met my command prompt I want to
go ahead and find that directory and
then once inside here we need to create
a a it's like a static link so let me do
my sudo Oh Ellen it's a symbolic link to
where Django is installed so we want to
basically connect that admin file where
Django is installed to where our admin
folder currently sits
hell that didn't work so let me go ahead
and get rid of that all right damn it
this thing I don't do this very often so
I always forget how it works
so I don't know this is starting to piss
me off just trying to create a symbolic
link to where this thing is located but
my Django is spelled like this Django 1
point 5 point 4 py 2 point 7 dot egg and
inside of here I have so here I have
Django
and Trev admin static admin
alright enough of the nonsense when all
else fails just go to where Django is
installed and my static and my admin
here fact I might get rid of admin and
on the right here this is where Django
is installed and all this mess no
instead of creating this symbolic link I
just want to download the entire admin
to my local setup here so there's gonna
take just a little bit alright so that
is done downloading there so now let's
go back to
sorry I got a mess going on here alright
so we now have I have this empty admin
file let me just get rid of that I'll
refresh this okay and we are now
some now music static and our admin
folders here and it's got all this crap
that we just downloaded and put it in
there locally now we just need to upload
that to the server so after that it
still doesn't work and let's just view
the page source see written here and see
what's going on so we know that looking
for static admin and admin CSS base so
there's no file there and it probably is
we got rid of one of these admins no
that's not there
looking at the settings URL I can see
here that I got confused and got these
two mixed up so let's go ahead and
reverse the DS and try to upload that
again this is the the hell of being a
web developer and once again I've
mentioned this before this is the
hardest part just getting the damn thing
set up on a server and getting it
working that's gonna be a challenge and
things are all jacked up here and I'm
not a hundred percent sure why but I
mean it seems like the CSS files and
everything that it needs should be
inside
it should be like inside this folder
right here which it's not for some
unknown effed-up reason so if I actually
physically drag those in there does it
do anything
all right so I don't deal with this
enough to really figure out what they're
with the hell but I'm gonna include this
directory as a zipped up file if I if I
can
I might have to point it somewhere I'd
like to add that to the YouTube tutorial
I don't remember what I did but honestly
like I have another working site where
my admin looks like this and simply as
CSS image jeaious and has this other
stuff in here and and this certainly
wasn't what was in the Django
installation so you know I could keep
bumbling around like an idiot but that's
ultimately what is in my admin file here
so wherever the hell this is located in
this particular area with the CSS image
the management template tags all that
stuff that needs to be in the admin
folder and our static folder so static
admin that stuff if I can zip this up
and put it in as a file with the YouTube
video I'll do that or try to upload it
somewhere so you guys have it and you
can just copy it in there anyway sorry
about that a little bit of a detour so
go ahead and um log in with your
username and password now you would set
up and putting your settings and once
you're in you'll be able to see this
Django administration which is really a
cool feature you have your users and
really the sister sites um go ahead and
change your sites while we're in here
click on this and name this whatever
your website is called and won't save
that our scenario your admin is enabled
and that like I said I apologize took a
little bit longer than what I was hoping
and and I haven't touched it and
probably a year and a half maybe longer
and it almost seems like every time I
deal with Django that I have a hard time
getting in the damn admin to work right
but it's probably just me but anyway
thank you guys for watching in the next
video we'll get into some more stuff all
right talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
