have my face ijs framework that i
created a few months back and it's a no
jos web framework that i was trying to
make and it uses a templating language
called nunchucks which is very similar
to the Django templating engine that has
come to know and really love over the
years so no Jas is obviously a really
great news you frameworks but on says it
looks like I made this back about six
months ago originally I haven't done
anything with it recently but tonight i
went ahead and i implemented a
command-line interface i just wanted to
show you how i went about it and how
it's relatively easy i didn't think it
was going to be as easy as it as it was
but one of the problems with this
framework is jet without the command
line interface for somebody to be able
to create an example project i made it
so that you had to invoke node modules
and all this stuff or incall it called
its admin file explicitly but ultimately
that's what a command-line interface
file is for and just a quick brief
history in case a lot you guys don't
know the reason why I am a programmer is
because of and it's long story i talked
about a lot but it's because of my
favorite band bayside
sorry my base side and those guys like I
ended up going to a concert in 2009 I
decided I want to build a website fast
forward to today I'm a senior programmer
and I've been a senior programmer for a
long time now I have this open source
framework now the framework itself is
not named after the band directly
because it's actually named after my dog
and you guys know that I have a dog
named Bayside who is named after the
band so anyway that is kind of the story
of the framework name somebody had asked
me if I actually named the framework
after my dog in it and the answer to
that question is yes this you know this
framework is named after my dog who was
named after the band all right throw
that out of the way that's obviously the
most important thing that was on
everybody's mind I'm sure it was on
nobody's mind but anyway what I ended up
doing to get this working here is the
basic project i'm actually developing in
Visual Studio code and it's all just
know Jay us and you can see here that
here's my package.json and just by
simply saying okay look I managed to the
bend now to say okay Bayside is the name
of the command line interface you know
so when you invoke the command line
interface you're going to be calling it
based I so when I say face I don't want
to say like base i create project or
face i do this or do that or whatever
but you can see that by saying Ben and
then giving it the name of the J's file
here's my CLI AS VAL now this is kind of
an ugly beasts but this is basically
just something that that creates a basic
working project so that way you CSS and
all that stuff is already rendered and
set up even for production it's you know
it's just all set up as a box and I'll
show you in a second because I'm trying
to make this as easy as possible and you
can see it just simply looked at the
command line interface just looking at
the arc valves patch passed into the
create project when it's called its
vinaigrette an interesting broke all
this stuff using the fs module to create
everything you need in here is like more
of the court based ijo stuff also all
the code is available on github here and
i have my instructions here so let's go
ahead and follow the instructions for a
moment I have a folder that I call test
Bayside here and it's an empty folder I
have it pulled up and
Visual Studio code right here so what I
would do is that we open up the command
line to where we have this folder you
can see us here there's nothing in it
and I would just simply create my my new
job is for projects to use NPM and knit
and we'll just call this test all right
and now that we have this on a file we
can go ahead and say NPM install base
side now by default when you NPM install
something it's going to install it in a
node modules folder unless you
explicitly tell it hyphen G to tell it
to install in your global node modules
folder but that's typically a bad idea
you don't want to install node modules
globally all over the place because then
you could end up getting into clashing
modules and things like that so you can
see when i installed it it automatically
installed locally to this node module
folder so now if I open up my project
and I look inside node modules you can
see bayside is in here and based on
itself has a nice amount of dependency
if you see a lot of this stuff was
installed some of it is just no GF stuff
but other things are because of the
dependencies that this project is self
has so you can see down here this is
where the bin CLI is you can see the
actual application it runs in each three
dependencies and as a few deb
dependencies for local testing and
things like that but the point is is
that you can see this bayside CLI and i
suppose i should have showed you let's
switch back to the other this is the
actual bayside source code that I'm
developing locally if I show you the bay
side of the CLI GS file you can see this
shebang line which is known as the
shebang line this is actually basically
the meat and potatoes which I hate that
terminology but it's it's the core of
how this this command line were actually
works because by using this if I go back
to my project where I installed base
side and I look inside the bend you can
see bayside has now been added to the
bend and there's two different files
this is more of the unix based system
and then
there's also Bayside that CMD which is
for windows-based stuff so Windows is
going to end up using this one and a
linux and all the other stuff uses this
but I didn't have to create this simply
telling my note project that i have this
been created all this for me I just need
to have the semantic command-line
interface file in order to have to
happen that was easy part that I didn't
think would be that easy so now is that
that is installed the next thing you
would have to do is just simply say oh
you have to add it to your script so
that way let me go ahead and pull my
project so here's our test base side
project I'm i go to my package.json and
you need to tell the NPM scripts where
based I can be found so all you have to
do is just give the argument Bayside it
could be any arguing you wanted to call
but it's actually as long as this value
equals Bayside it's going to find the
Bayside command line interface tool and
then use that to invoke whatever sort of
argument you pass to it so if I were to
say now that that's been added I could
say mtm run and bayside and that I send
my argument my first arguments create
project which is the standard create
project it's all documented on github
and then I'll just say the name of my
projects app so this will go and it will
create that that standard bayside apps
to your base side app was created now
all I need to do is just run the bayside
app so i'll say note app because app is
the name of the project file you can see
servers listening on port 3000 so now if
I pull this up and I go to my local ho
ho and port 3000 you can see the bayside
app is running when we view the page
source it's a very simple HTML that's
actually displayed out but you know the
thing is is that by default it looked
for static content within this static
folder so it knows how to actually
render that if I had a static image I
could also do the same thing inside of
here but now that that is all running
it's actually you know simple for me to
go ahead and go into my project and I
can go into my templates and I can
actually change this around one of the
things that I am working on is
just uh well here's the title right
let's look at at digest because we're
using nunchucks you can see title gets
passed down so if we were to go back to
where this is running you can see it has
home as the title and the reason why is
because we're passing Titletown as an
argument to our index template so let's
go in here and then once again you can
just start editing this template so I
wanted to give people the basics of
being able to quickly have a templating
language and system that is running
along with static apps you don't have to
do anything with like adding additional
arguments for static you know just go
ahead and make sure your static content
is it within your static folder is
essentially a public static folder so in
ejs files or anything should all be in
there and whether it's react angular
whatever else you just put it inside
there and then you go from from there
now where is base ideas going to go in
the future I'm actually going to
integrate MongoDB probably some other
relational database options as well for
like things like secretly using sequel
eyes for my sequel and postgres and
that's that's probably you know the
extent of what I'm going to do in fact
I'll probably end up adding more to the
command line interface so that you know
create projects going to create like a
basic project and I might even have
create an angular or create react or
something like that and I suppose at
that point I started going down this
kind of rabbit hole where I'm trying to
end up replicating what is already out
there that doesn't work very well which
is on can't even think of the name of
the project but it basically damn like
it was made by uh one of the top
developers at Google actually but it
seems like I always have a product can't
remember the name of that thing anyway
it was a price it's just a project that
spends up new new projects thread on the
top of my head and I can't think of it
but basically spit out all kinds of
different projects based on you know
what you're trying to build a django out
or angular whatever the only issue that
i have with projects like that they try
to do too much magic for you is that you
have no idea what the hell is going on
with your app is there's too much stuff
that's generated for you what base ijs
right now is jen
writing for people is actually very very
simple you could go in and look at it
and and for a static based content it
called a website that doesn't need to
have a database it is this would be
super simple and it doesn't need to be
any more complicated now a lot of people
do have database needs and they're going
to have authentication needs and maybe
even admin needs and stuff like that so
as I introduce more of that
functionality that is probably going to
be something where I would then make
sure that I don't I don't complicate and
over bloat the project if that makes any
sense I'll probably just have different
types of projects at the command line
interface outputs which take into
consideration those those types of
things that way i don't really ignore
the primary reason why I even created
this thing in the first place was just
to be as simple as I possibly could with
getting a basic static website up and
running using nodejs and at the same
time not using one of those static web
site generators that just aren't very
good I don't I want people to have the
control over their own templates and
their data that they pass to those
templates and you know they should also
have control over there static content
and things like that so some of those
static site generators I'm just not a
big fan of at all and I don't want this
to be that either so all right guys
that's really all I got tonight let me
know what you think and make sure you
subscribe thanks for watching and have a
good day and good night bye hey guys so
a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intent of course that focuses
on the technologies of the here and now
for web development some of the things
that are actually teaching in the suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and the
coding boot camp and the entire goal is
to be able to get you into the industry
within 12 weeks so if you guys are
interested in learning more information
about deb mell
encoding boot camp just check out the
link in the description tab of this
video thank you for watching and have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
