video we're going to be looking at
classes in Python and this is where
stuff gets a little bit hairy man in
programing pythons class-based
programming is not necessarily the same
as other object-oriented languages
Python is considered object-oriented
it's not completely object-oriented
we've seen the we can write code that
has nothing to do with classes and
objects and things like that
but let's go ahead and define you know
what is a class and a class and python
is simply a set of blueprints so if
you're an architect and you're designing
a new building you're going to have on
your little rolled out paper your
blueprints of how that building is
constructed that is your class it's just
simply instructions to say hey when I
build this building these are the
instructions that you follow to build it
the actual what is considered the
concrete implementation of a class which
all it means is stamping out a new
object based on those blueprints is the
actual class object so that's where it
gets into this object-oriented
programming
objects are supposed to be these
isolated sections of code and you're
supposed to just be able to plug in
objects and objects should communicate
with one another and they shouldn't be
interfering with what each other are
doing in a truly object-oriented nicely
designed program so these blueprints
though is where we start and that's
actually where we're going to create our
class and Python so python has a simple
class keyword and then out after the
class is going to be the class name now
the class name and python typically
follows a a pascal casing function name
naming convention so if i were going to
say a person person should be
capitalized if person had to Nate if it
had if I two words I said like person
should um my name is in person serial
whatever I United this dumb name but
basically you would capitalize each each
word and you're in your class now in
classes there are no parentheses after
them so we just simply say person and
then colon and then down here this is
where we can actually have a class
method and once again them class method
is
basically a function that we discovered
in the previous video to this but when
they're attached to classes I consider
them class class methods but they could
also be considered class functions as
well what if that's where you really
want the column but proper terminology
should be method so let's go ahead and
create a class method we're going to say
define print name and here's an
interesting thing that we're going to
end up coming in a comment that's going
to come into play here number one I like
to define this as you know just this
underscore I think that's more Python
convention based but some people might
some people might do this because that's
the way they like to do it some people
might do camel casing which is like that
but typically Roxie on Python I would
just stick with the underscores for now
but depending on whatever sort of Python
group you're working with they might
tell you to do something differently but
this is how I would define my class
method and then inside of here the
interesting thing is that we're going to
have to reference a value which is
called self and this is something that
doesn't make any sense to anybody when
you're first getting involved in this
and even after like two years you're
still going to be like I still don't
understand why the hell we have to do
that but self is actually representing
the object that is being stamped out
from your blueprints so this is simply a
rolled up piece of paper giving
instructions this is a method here but
this right here this self is the actual
object that got constructed from the
class oh my goodness that is a lot to
swallow but let's just say right now
we're going to say print press pause I
feel like I'm fooling myself or
something I'm not trying to be full of
myself by like printing my name but that
is my name
so you guys got to say it just say it
over and over again so I can hear it I'm
just kidding no that it's not like that
it's just simply that that is my name
and when you guys are following along
you probably use your own name so here
let's go ahead and create our object
from the blue
so how do we do that we're going to say
Chris equals person open and close
parentheses that's simply it Chris is
now an object that got stamped out from
the blueprints that is person so if I
say Chris dot print name I would call it
as a function because it's just it's a
class method it's basically a function
attached to my class and I call it that
way by using this dot notation so Chris
is referencing this method that's how
you call it and all this stuff is just
encapsulated which means like sealed
into like a pill that is a plastic pill
that holds all the medicine inside it's
all just encapsulated inside this person
and all your function could even be in a
separate file and we can import as we've
seen so let's go ahead and put a
breakpoint here and run our file and
also by the way I'm working out of this
second file I created out in one of the
previous videos to this one so now when
we look at Chris you can see Chris and
there's this weird if we hover over it
says main dot person see look object at
blah blah blah what is this garbage this
is actually pythons memory locator or a
pointer this is the this is the object
and this is the place in memory where
Python can find the object that got
stamped out from the blueprints that is
person so every time you create a new
object you're going to have a different
you're going to have a different memory
location right here so now if we
highlight over Chris you can see it's
person object so let's let's go ahead
and put a breakpoint on person watch
what happens when we press play it hits
this defined print this print name and
it's going to print out Chris Hawkes now
but look at itself and does this look
familiar self its self is the object in
memory so if I hover over it it keeps
disappearing but you can see that is the
same object so self got assigned the
object that got created that's weird but
that is the reason why you need to
reference self it's in
and we're going to see a demonstration
also why self needs to be there now you
can see a prince Chris Hawkes so if we
wanted to define a name to the person we
could say we could say I'm going to do
this that long roundabout way so you can
see a reason why something exists here
in just a moment we're going to say a
sign name because they so and inside
some of this we're going to say self dot
name equals Chris Hawkes
now in print name we can instead of
printing out Chris Hawkes so we're going
to say prints self dot name so now if I
do this we need to actually call a sign
name before we try to call print name
because it has to assign the value to
name before we try to actually call it
otherwise we're going to end up getting
an error so let's go ahead and we're
going to put breakpoints right there and
we'll press play so now a sign name gets
called first and it just simply takes
self dot name and it attaches it to this
this object so if we looked at this
object and that its name Chris we could
see name there's now this name value
under there and it's assigned the name
is just a variable it has the Chris
Hawkes value so now when we say print
you're going to now see self dot name is
Chris Hawks and it just it prints out
Chris Hawk so that is not the way that
you would normally do this and the
reason why is because it's not very
flexible why would you create a generic
person which could represent Chris Hawks
or it could represent whoever's watching
this video it could represent any person
on the world but I just went ahead and
hard-coded the name Chris Hawks to it it
makes the code very unusable and
unfriendly to share and stuff like that
so what you would do instead you would
reference a constructor class method
called the I knit I knit method
and Python and it's a really weird thing
but it says define and this is double
underscore so underscore is basically
where we do the - except you're going to
press shift and does this underscore you
need two of them you're going to say I
knit and then inside here we're going to
say self and now we're going to say name
and then inside this I knit this is
where we're going to actually define
self name so we're going to say we're
going to say it self dot name equals
name so now what is this I knit doing we
no longer have to actually we no longer
have to actually pass this value we
could we could actually pass it from
within person and we could say person
and then we'll say Chris Hawkes in fact
I'll do proper capitalization Chris
Hawkes so now when I create my person
object name Chris I'm passing in its
name and it's going to return the value
so when I say Chris dot print name call
it as a function and we press play let's
go ahead and take a look here and you
know I want to put a breakpoint right
here on the eye net so what happens I
Nick got called here's the object in
memory here's the name so how did name
get passed in well it got passed in
right here why didn't I have to pass
himself just because you don't self is
always there in class self is the object
in memory that got stamped out from the
blueprints so you don't have to say self
in here in fact if you pass self self is
going to be assigned to the name
parameter so don't do that
but I created a class and I gave a
unique value and it got assigned to name
we then attach it to our object under
name and then we can reference it
throughout our object now so I don't
have to say self assign or anything like
that it got called automatically when
python created a new object so i didn't
have to say call i knit or any of this
other crap and most of the time you're
going to actually say there's going to
be all kinds of stuff that you can do
here
our height and now this person could say
self dot hair color equals color self
dot height equals height and now I can
actually pass in more things so I'll say
Brown and then my height is about six
one that could be a string or I could
even say yeah I'll just do string make
it easier so my height is six one and
now if I said print name and we could
even create a new function that says to
find prints height and run the reference
self dot height and then we could say
print hair color hair color all right so
now if I want to say Chris print will
say hair color and then we'll even go
down here actually we'll do all three
hair color height and name right go all
right so let's go ahead and run these
named color is not to find wise color
Dantan oh wait
oh because ya see you guys probably
noticed that all right no problem that's
because we try to reference color
instead of hair color color would be
racist a string object is not callable
where are we
says line 20 here's
all right yeah sorry guys I'm being
being stupid right now this is print
hair color print height and print name
and by the way it's good when we run
into these error messages but it tells
you right there it says line 20 string
object is not callable it didn't know
what you were trying to do because we
didn't actually say the function or the
class method name correctly now if I run
this it prints out all those stats so
now we have this class and this class
could exist in its own file but it's
much more flexible to be able to work
with any person that you want you could
have thousands or millions of persons
stamped out this could be an employed
database that exists for other employees
in your company and you know it's just
that this is this is object and writing
programming guys this is all about
creating these blueprints and then
constructing and interacting with them
in a certain way and obviously your
functions can do more complex things you
could you could have in your functions
another value like so if I were to say
print name another value except my name
plus another value so you could it and
then call Chris dot print name and then
pass in another value or I'll just say
this is some more proud and you can see
when it calls print name we'll put a
breakpoint right here so when we call
print name you can see another value got
passed in so it's going to take its name
Chris Hawkes and then add this value put
into the screen and it's all down here
so you have all kinds of flexibility in
order to be able to you know to do stuff
so this is I think this is a good
demonstration guys so let me know what
you think please subscribe to this
tutorial series or actually my channel
and please up vote if you guys have any
questions just reach out thanks bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention
dev mountain coding bootcamp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the Suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
