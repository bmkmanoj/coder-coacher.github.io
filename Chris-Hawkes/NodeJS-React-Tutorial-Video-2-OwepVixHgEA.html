the last video when we ended it I said
that we're gonna be setting up our
static files I'm actually saying screw
that for right now what we want to do is
we're gonna be using the react JSX
template engine and there's a project
called express react views which
actually takes our JSX code on the
server side and it compiles it down to
regular JavaScript and it looks like you
know a regular HTML page so the benefit
of doing that is that search engines
like Google can come along and see our
content so if you have content that can
just be generated on the server it's
fast it's reliable and it can be indexed
by search engines and it's not all you
know changing javascript files which can
cause some issues so in order to use
this project we're going to go ahead and
set up a few things so number one and
we're gonna go ahead and and copy some
site and we want to put that actually
around what we're setting in this port
name that should be fine so I'm gonna
copy and paste this code I don't want to
screw it up and now what we have here me
zoom out is we're adding this section
right here and we're saying that we're
setting up a few engine and the view
engine would Express or there's like 20
different options you can do you can
read shade mustache you can use whatever
you want in our case we're gonna be
using JSX because JSX is react and react
is cool hip thing nowadays and it's fast
since it's just awesome so what we're
doing here is first we're saying app dot
set and we're giving it a views and
we're telling where to find the views of
our project so we're saying it's gonna
be this Durr name is actually the root
directory of our project and then we're
saying that it's going to be in a views
folder of our root directory so you can
see we don't have a views folder so
let's go ahead and add that now so we're
gonna right click and add a views folder
and now inside of our views folder
that's actually where our templates are
gonna be so let's go ahead and create
our first JSX file using the react
framework which is really awesome we're
going to say index JSX
so we have this index i JS X file
our views which was cool let's go back
over to the app.js file we're gonna need
to install this project here this module
using NPM let's kill the server by
pressing ctrl C and we're going to use
the NPM install let me just paste that
project name Express react view is I'm
we're gonna do - - save again so it'll
add it to our config file that we talked
about in our last video so it's going to
go through it's going to install
everything that expressed react views
needs and once it's done we should get a
success message but while we're waiting
for that let's go ahead and minimize
this and in the views folder let's go
ahead and create our first our first our
first view
so what we're gonna do in the view
folder let's go into index at the top we
need to make use of our react so we're
gonna say react equals require react and
then we're gonna say variable actually
we're not gonna have a default layout
for right now let's go and create our
component let's just say variable index
component equals react dot create class
and if you've ever used react before
this is just standard react stuff that
we're writing right now so when is it
returned or a render function and then
here we actually give it a return
statement so return and for right now
let's go ahead and just give it a div
and then we'll put an A this was built
using using react so react on the server
side is gonna actually transfer this JSX
code to standard HTML and it's gonna
look like it was just a regular template
so basically you're using react is a
template language and because you're
actually rendering a JavaScript template
on the server that's actually called
isomorphic JavaScript which is another
hip term these days if you want to be a
cool hip you know dork anyway let's go
ahead and do the final module that
exports because I've said anytime you
want to actually have a module you need
to actually do that and then we're gonna
say index component so we're making and
we're exporting this index component
we're also going to need to install
react because we don't have that
installed and we would get a message
saying that and don't worry about these
dependencies is actually saying react
isn't installed so it's it's fine let's
go ahead and install that now so we're
gonna say npm install let's get rid of
this and we're going to say react and
then - - save
all right so let's but we did a lot of
work here so let's hope that everything
is working as planned so we're gonna
save this and now we need to go over to
our routes folder over here making use
and we were just sending back this
static response to our react our HR
we're sending back static response we
don't want to do that anymore we need to
be a little bit more explicit that we're
using the we're gonna be looking for a
view so by doing that what we're going
to do instead of a resource send we're
gonna say resource dot render this
editor is pissing me off alright so now
we're gonna say index and we're making
use by index it's going to look inside
of our views folder and it's gonna look
for an index I JSX that's just how this
magic works and now for right now I want
to send back an empty javascript object
and we'll get into that more in just a
moment but just follow this verbatim if
you would please alright so now that
we've done that let's go ahead and see
if this thing even compiles so go ahead
and node API so it looks like we do have
a problem here can I find module react
Dom server and what the fook I so
appears there's actually something new
this error here is because the react Dom
was taken out of the reactor library
apparently because they were trying to
loosen it up so let's go ahead and just
see if we can install the react Dom and
then - I even save and see if that will
work I'm not sure if it'll work or not
all right good so that was just a
situation where it used to be in react
and no longer is in react so just go
ahead and do that extra thing now that
we got this joint running let's see if
we can reference the chase X or if it
blows up or not so all right yep so this
was built using reacts now the cool
thing is if we go ahead and right-click
can we say view source no I understood a
search I meant to inspect element or you
know I can just let this anyway
guys so this is this is actually being
rendered on the server so it's not some
sort of you know the browser or the
search engine requests the page and then
the server passes down a bunch of
JavaScript that ends up having to be
executed on the client-side this was
executed on the server side and the
result was HTML passed down from the
server so it's it it's a more
traditional approach but it is fast so
that's what's really cool about it
anyway guys so let's go ahead and make
another adjustment to our application
here because what we want to do we don't
want every view of our application
having to like render the entire HTML
structure so we're going to do is make
use of a like a layout page and if
you've ever done web development the
past you know that like pretty much
every web framework out there from
django rails or asp you have ability to
do a layout and you can do the same
thing with react as a view engine and
that's what we're gonna do right now so
let's create this um this layout folder
and we're gonna create basically just a
master JSX folder JSX file so we'll say
a master JSX
and then inside this master is gonna be
like the main structure of our
application so like we did before let's
go ahead and at the top say require
react and then down here we're gonna go
ahead and create the master layout let's
close this off
okay so this is where we're actually
going to have the entire structure of
our application delivered in a render
statement so we'll say render so the
entire HTML structure should be put
inside of here and just for right now
let's go ahead and just keep things as
simple as we possibly can
I'm gonna paste this from another file
I'm gonna get rid of this meta that I
don't need and then we're gonna go ahead
and close off the head give it a body in
the body and the HTML and then we need
to put the HTML at the top
if we want to do proper indenting we
should probably do that
and down here in the body where we
actually want the the page that inherits
from this to pick up so we actually want
to say this and make sure it's in curly
braces just like this it'll say this
stop promise our children and this is a
more react specific but you'll see why
this is necessary in just a moment
alright this master file looks pretty
good let's make sure that we're actually
exporting it so go all the way down here
and we'll say module that exports master
layout and now in the index we want to
make use of this master layout that we
just created so let's go ahead and we
will say at the top of the file we're
gonna give it a default layout so let's
go ahead and say variable default layout
and it equals require and we're going to
tell it where the mass the layout file
exists will say forward slash layout and
then master and I think yeah I just call
it master so you don't to say JSX or
anything I'm just a master and now in
order to be able to use the default
layout we need to inside of the return
statement we're gonna be saying return
the default layout that we're actually
importing at the top there and let's
pass in the argument that we're going to
be making use of in the title so we'll
say this dot Propst name and then
it's go ahead and go down here and we're
gonna close off the default layout so
let's close that am I saying default
layout so we've closed off this
statement and now we're we said in
default layout this stop props not
children it's actually gonna render
anything in between these two tags so
that that's why it's so awesome that's
why it was so important that we did that
so now that we've done that we've made
use of this this default layout but we
have this this stop props name that's
being used and there's nothing being
passed but what we can do we can go back
over to the index Jason where I said we
were passing in an empty object and this
is where we can give it a argument where
we could say holy crap and we'll make it
this is awesome so we're passing down
this statement as a name it's being sent
to the master view and the master view
is making use of it right here so this
not props our name so now if I went
ahead and I went back over I have to
restart my server in fact I probably
will let me go ahead and restart the
server we're going to run it we made a
lot of changes here so let's see if we
run into an error or not render is not
defined so this is just a simple JSX
problem so let's go back over and check
this out
yeah that was just a typo where I said
render render spine here but this needs
to say return so that was a JSX
compilation problem so let's go ahead
and restart the server it's working now
we go over to this file here we look and
you can see this was built using react
so now if we go ahead and we we
right-click and this thing's not what
review source control you allows you to
view source so you can see what's being
passed down and this is actually making
use of that HTML default template and
then you can see the title being passed
down which you can also do see the title
in the tab and that's where we're making
use to that variable in that object that
we're passing down to the the master
layout and just so you guys know if you
wanted to use that inside of a page that
is inheriting from that you can do that
as well if you want but we'll get into
that in another video
but for right now you can see that's how
we're passing down a variable from the
view and into the parent and then the
page is making use of a master layout
and then putting this you know
additional information so that way most
of your HTML source can exist inside the
default layout and then this page can
make use of it alright guys so that's
that's all in video 2 and in additional
videos we're going to get into how we do
HTML and CSS and stuff like that using
Express and react alright guys thanks
