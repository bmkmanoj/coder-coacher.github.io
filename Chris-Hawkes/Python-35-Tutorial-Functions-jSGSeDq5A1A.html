video we're gonna be looking at is
functions in Python Python can be
thought of as an object-oriented
language when it wants to be other times
it's just a dynamically interpreted
language that doesn't have to be built
off of objects and classes and we'll get
into that and a little bit but if
somebody said Python was a strictly
object-oriented language they would be
an idiot because it's not strictly
object-oriented you can do
object-oriented programming in Python
and it's not nearly as crazy as trying
to do object in programming and
something like Perl which completely
isn't made for python kind of finds a
balance in between something like Perl
and something like you know Java or C
sharp so in c-sharp or Java everything
has to be objects and classes and you
have like these modifiers and all this
 you have to deal with in Python
you don't have to deal with any of that
we're gonna get into object-oriented
stuff in a moment but in this particular
video we're going to be looking at a
particular part that will kind of apply
to object-oriented programming but it
doesn't necessarily mean the same thing
for this particular video so we're gonna
be looking at what are called functions
and Python a function can be thought of
as a reusable chunk of code right so you
can define what you want that code to do
and you can define a data that gets
passed into that function so that it can
actually perform something on that data
that's typically what you do you you
define a function pass some data and the
data gets interpreted and then return
back to you in some sort of format that
you're looking for so when we get into
object-oriented programming a function
is the same damn thing as a method the
only difference is is that a method is
attached to an object and in this video
we're going to be just looking at the
gist a function that doesn't have to be
attached to an object therefore you
don't have to create the object to use
you know this block of code a function
can just exist inside of your page so in
order to create a function all we have
to do is just say define and then we can
just name it whatever you want
and I believe typically in Python world
people typically write a function like
that which i think is um I don't know
it's kind of ugly I guess so now the
editor is going to indent your line so
everything always has to remain indented
you're gonna have an indentation after
this function and whatever goes on
inside of here is gonna be executed
whenever you call this function so let's
just do a simple print statement and
we'll say we called a function and we'll
get out of this and so now that that's
been defined what I can do it down here
is I can just simply say our function
and just call that like this so if I
went ahead and I ran this program we
call the function so what happened was I
put a breakpoint here this gets executed
first this is just being defined and
what that means is that they when the
program is is compiling this is gonna be
like oh okay we create a function but it
just went it stores it in memory so that
way the Python knows that it's there and
then it will continue execution so if I
said like you know another statement
down here and another one down here
eventually it's going to get to this
block right here and then it's going to
call this this function that has already
been determined in memory so if we went
ahead and we ran this let's go ahead and
do that you can see that this actually
gets called and let's go ahead and just
to give you an example you'll see which
one gets called first so this will get
called first then this so you see the
function gets hit and then if I went
ahead and I let it proceed then it's
going to hit the actual function and do
the print screen so this gets evaluated
first and when the program is running
through this just gets stored in memory
the reason why that's important is
because I've told you before that Python
reads top to bottom left to right so if
I went ahead and I tried to actually
reference this before Python even knows
what what the hell it is then we're
going to end up having a problem and you
can see we get an error it says hey our
function is not to find what the f you
know but all you got to do is just keep
in mind that Python needs to know
it exists before you try to reference it
and that's why I stress the top to
bottom left to right it's really
important that you guys know that so
once again the functions are cool
because I can have this this piece of
code and right here you're like why
would I do that well let's go ahead and
make it a little bit more more helpful
basically so what I can do here is I can
say my integer 1 my integer 2 and what
we can do is we can actually say print
my integer 1 plus my integer 2 so what
we can do is um call this like some
right so we're summing two values now I
can call this function and I can pass in
to our two arguments which can be any
sort of integer that I want to add so
this is actually going to print out the
value of 10 I'm sorry I changed I
changed my function name here so just so
you guys know that error was because I
have it's like hey look for this
function but it's not there same error
that that we showed before so now I
changed that to the right function name
that we changed that to and if I run
that this will output the value of 10
and the reason why is because we passed
in two integers which here's the first
integer this eight gets assigned to my
integer one this two gets assigned to my
energy two and then inside the actual
function code we use both of those
integers that were passed in so what I
can do is I can isolate large chunks of
code and really complicated code into
their own unique little things and then
identify a name that says what is this
stuff trying to do so as we get into
more complex programs it's really
important to try to understand you know
why a function would be necessary to try
to you know prevent having number 1 it
prevents it keeps things concise right
and clear and it prevents duplication so
instead of having to you know completely
completely add these two values over and
over and again I can just simply call
sum and I can do this as many times
I want and pass in different values if I
run it I didn't have to actually
expressly say add this and this for each
time I ran it the function already
handles that for me so that is the
purpose of a function and Python alright
guys thanks for watching please
