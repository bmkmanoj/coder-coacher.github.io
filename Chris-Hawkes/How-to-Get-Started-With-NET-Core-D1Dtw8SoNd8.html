going to be looking at how to get dotnet
core up and running and before we even
go into what you need to do I just wanna
take a moment just to kind of discuss
what it is I mean done net core is
Microsoft's latest really it's its
entire rewrite of its dotnet
infrastructure which has been around for
15 years now which powers things like
Microsoft sequel server IAS server
asp.net like a lot of different things
WPF and the reason why down that core
though is better than what we have
before is it's a much more slimmed down
version of.net that we're used to and
the best part is that it actually works
on all different devices and and an
operating system so it works on Mac
Linux and Windows and a lot of people
say that net or c-sharp is just
Microsoft or just Windows and it's
actually not the case anymore and it
hasn't been that way for for quite some
time now down at core is still very new
though so a lot of companies still
haven't fully embraced it yet just
because there's a lot of kinks and
everything still being ironed out but at
this point I do have a friend of mine
who has in a bun to digitalocean server
that's running asp.net written and
c-sharp and also using MongoDB so there
are people that I know personally that
are using dynamic or in the wild right
now and it works just fine in addition
to that though the reason why I see
sharp is a good language which is the
primary language to use for dotnet core
and dotnet itself is because c-sharp
allows you to basically take one
language and through xamarin you can
write mobile apps that work on Android
or iOS you can also get into gaming
using something like unity engine that
allows you to use c-sharp to write your
game code in addition to that I mean
everybody that's you know that's running
Windows which is still like 44% of all
the developers out there I think are
using Windows machines as of a Stack
Overflow survey last year there's
there's all that market there as well so
now you can learn C sharp you can
literally write C sharp code that is
pretty much going to reach almost your
entire audience in addition to that
there's the things like the microsoft
hololens with an augmented reality and
all that stuff so definitely there's a
lot of potential there and then on top
of all that
language is backed by Microsoft's
themselves which as much hate as
Microsoft gets they've still been an
industry leader in the IT field
programming software and everything else
for 30 40 years now so they're not going
anywhere they're making like 22 billion
dollars a year in profit they're not
going anywhere anytime soon they have a
ton of money to continue to develop
their products and everything else to
make it a good business solution so and
then I guess one other thing I should
have mentioned there's a ton of jobs in
c-sharp and dotnet so if you're looking
to make money writing codes and they're
there's a ton of opportunity there so
all those reasons are why you probably
want to get started with C sharp and
dotnet I have it as one of my top five
languages of 2018 I think you know the C
sharp Go Python JavaScript you can't go
wrong with those but c-sharp may
arguably be on top of all that list if
it came down to making money and getting
paid by the way that is actually a lot
of what I do as well right most of
JavaScript these days but I've spent you
know a couple years working in and out
of net and c-sharp so alright so the
first things first so we need to go
ahead and you need to download there's
gonna be two options you have the ripe
the dotnet the core code Visual Studio
is the there's a free Community Edition
that you can download and install it's
going to take hours so it's a humongous
product a lot of people don't like the
fully integrated development environment
so they choose to use Visual Studio code
which is cross-platform now Visual
Studio just recently came out it's
confusing is there's visual studio and
Visual Studio code the Visual Studio
code is a much more slim down editor but
it still allows you to debug your code
and things like that and the first
example I'm going to show you though is
how to get it set up on Visual Studio
code these are all free products
everything's free here so it doesn't
cost you a thing but you can download
this and you can also get it for Mac and
Linux as well so Visual Studio code here
go ahead and download and install it I
already have it so I'm just going to go
ahead and run it so if I type Visual
Studio
there's Visual Studio code so I'm going
ahead and open this up now we need to
install an extension here so that we can
get c-sharp working so we're going to
click on this little square icon on the
left
outside that's going to open up our
extensions and we can just type c-sharp
there's going to be one that pops up at
the top and you can see if you click on
it that it's got 283 or weight now two
million eight hundred thirty-eight
thousand downloads that's taking the
longest amount for any programming
language so go ahead and install that
reload so we get that working alright
now we need a folder now we're going to
put our stuff in so I'm going to say
open folder and I'm going to have inside
of here I'm going to create a folder
called
you know what I'm not going to do that
I'm going to get rid of that folder and
I'm going to put this inside tutorials
and we're going to put a folder in here
called net or so I'll do next clip
alright so now that we have this out of
this neck net core folder setup here and
I opened up that folder so if I go ahead
and I right-click on this I can save
reveal and explore it'll take me over to
the Explorer where net cores and this is
where our code is going to go but for
right now let's go ahead and we need to
download and install net core so we're
just going to type neck or download and
it comes with Visual Studio and all this
other stuff but we actually don't want
to do that we just want the actual
executable or really the Installer
that's what I want to do here so you can
see there's a dotnet core SDK and it
comes with both version 1.0 and 1.1 and
we're just going to do the ESC 64-bit
installer alright so here we go you can
see I already have it and yours is not
going to say repair uninstall hopefully
I'm not sure you have it so you can just
go ahead and hit the right buttons here
and say next install just going to
cancel out of this now if it's installed
correctly if we type up a CMD in our
cortana and we open up a command prompt
if I type dotnet it should give us some
information about the version we have
like if I want to say the dotnet version
I could say - - version that will give
you the version that I'm dealing with
here so so we're good to go there
there's probably a newer version I could
go ahead and
and update if I wanted to but I'm not
going to worry about that at the moment
so now that I have that actually
downloaded what I want to do is go to
this folder where I have our project
here and I'm going to type CMD here so
it opens up the command prompt right to
the folder location and we're going to
create a course a.net new and then we're
going to create a console application so
this is going to go ahead and create a
new blank project for us so if you're
using Visual Studio code or if you're
used to Visual Studio then there's not
you know nearly as helpful of a wizard
if you want to use the command line but
if this is you know it's really probably
the better route to go I think is just
to use the command line I know that it's
there know what it does for you and then
you know use the wizards and things in
Visual Studio eventually once you
understand some of the stuff that's
going on behind you now now that we have
that running here we have this program
they create a main starting point so in
c-sharp you have a main starting point
which takes arguments that you can pass
into your program and it's just going to
output a console you know hello world
now another thing too is that you can
see that it's going to automatically
download some of these dependencies that
it has which is like the debugger and
all this other stuff so just let it
finish doing that alright so we're going
to get out of this message that flashes
it says that required assets to building
debug are missing from dotnet quarter
you want to add them so we're going to
say yes and then we're going to go ahead
and restore
and if everything worked correctly you
should be able to get some intelligence
here so you can say you can extra
there's different label lightbulbs and
things that will help you and you should
see all those like squiggly lines and
everything go away all right so now the
final thing I want to show you for this
visual studio code demonstration is that
when you go if you click on a program
itself and make sure program is
highlighted and click on this little bug
icon to the debug icon and from your
drop-down you should be able to see that
dotnet core launch console is there
you're going to want to have that
selected so now if you press the brief
green play button it will actually a
debug and output your code there if you
just want to see the output yeah the
debug console here so this is all
verbose we can actually get rid of some
of that verbosity if we wanted to before
right now I'm not going to mess with
that for this tutorial video but we also
have the ability to fret and place break
lines so I think you know the code is
stopped there and you can see if I press
f10 it can actually I can't press f10
because that actually kills my recorder
because they share the same same thing
but here you can see this step over is
f10 so if you're not doing a video like
I am then you can normally press f10 or
you have to click this button and now
you can see it outputs out there so
you're actually running dotnet core now
the good thing about this so is that it
actually when you go and publish this
like so you're going to sell this
application you go ahead and you publish
it as an executable that people can just
run on their machine that process of
packaging it up actually packages up the
entire got net core runtime which is
needed to actually execute and run the
code on their machine so you don't have
to tell them to download dotnet version
blah blah blah all that stuff can be
distributed right with your ESC and
that's actually the same method that
both rust and golang are doing as well
so that's a huge benefit like because
nobody wants to go to a client's machine
and say hey downloaded software oh now
you got to download you know X Y &amp;amp; Z
because my program doesn't run on your
computer and things like that so you
know with this whole distributable
environment it's it's supposed to solve
those types of headaches that we dealt
with for a long time all right so now
let's move on to the other version of
getting this installed so Visual Studio
2017 community is the latest version now
if you download this version you can
just go here you can download the free
it's gonna take a long time this is a
huge program but once it's done
you're going to see it and you'll be
able to run it so this is completely
free we're into Visual Studio 2017 and
you can see it's going to open up and it
looks a lot different now there's a much
more heavy-duty industry like leading
integrated development environment it
does a ton of stuff it can take you
years to learn this thing but luckily
just like with Photoshop and all that
other stuff there's only certain
features that we're going to be using
day in and day out so you don't to learn
the entire thing but that says let's go
ahead and I want to say new project and
in here and I'm going to click on this
little link that says open visuals fail
installer and this visual and studio
installer is actually going to be it's
like the new version that is a new
product they have that actually allows
you to if you want to be Python
development or other things like Ruby or
anything like that then like with what
the league was telling you at the
beginning of the video if you wanted to
do mobile development with xamarin you
can individually check these things and
it will add them to your Visual Studio
instance so that they're there in our
case what we need to do is add the
visual studio or the dotnet core
cross-platform development so we want to
click that box and then once we do that
you can see it says close all instances
of visual Studios 2017 so I'm going to
do that I'm going to close this down or
cancel right now so now I do that all
right now it's not going to complain
anymore and we're going to modify
alright so this is going to take our
just a few seconds hopefully and it's
downloading these of these templates so
if I we want to go and create a project
instead of staying with Visual Studio
code where we said dotnet new console
we're just gonna be able to use a file
system from within Visual Studio
and and start our project so we've
already done this here now let's go
ahead and reopen Visual Studio okay so
we're going to click on that open this
joint back up alright and now let's go
into a file new project and then now if
we go inside dotnet core you can see
let's see this stuff what is this crap
so for a second that I was like why is
there not showing up but it's because
the dotnet quarterly we wanted to grab
the latest on that framework so we can
see this asp.net core web application
because that's what we want here I'm
going to change this folder location to
browse project tutorials net core the
hell we'll do that that's fine web
application one just click OK that's
fine
now this is the part where you can say
Web API we're going to do just a
full-scale web application so that we
can get this working you can even add
authentication so you can do like
windows authentication which a lot of
Lee corporations are using and stuff
like that using Active Directory and
other things like that so that is some
of the options you have you can also
enable docker support which allows you
to you know if you need to move your
stuff formatter to AWS or something like
that if you have it in a docker
container you'll be much much more able
to do that but definitely beyond the
scope of this tutorial or anything I
want to talk about so let me go ahead
just click OK and it's going to create
the web application now you could have
also done this you could have created
the same project with with dotnet core
with the command line you could have set
dotnet new and then instead of where we
said console earlier in this video you
could have said MVC and it would have
created this application for you so like
here's our here's our web applications
I'll set up here so in the WWE root
there's a lot of things that it's very
opinionated actually on some of the
stuff that it brings in for you because
if you look at some of this stuff you're
like bow or why is he using battery like
Bowers basically does
you want to you want to replace really
all this stuff with with uh with NPM and
they worry or yarn I mean you're not
going to use Bower the nobody's using
Bower anymore it's kind of unfortunate
they even ship that to be honest
with you but anyway let's go ahead and
press play and we're going to run this
in is Express and this is Express is
actually using something called a
Kestrel web server which is their
cross-platform server that can handle
some some things like twenty times
faster than I asked but basically when
you go and you have a production net
core website
MVC dotnet then you're going to end up
most likely putting a Kestrel web server
in front of IAS and basically test roll
will probably handle a lot of things
like handling static images JavaScript
files stuff like that and then other
requests will probably be made to is
directly so that's kind of a recommended
route that Microsoft suggests at the
moment but who knows maybe you know
there will be more opportunities or new
products that arise down the road here
but you can see this is an actual
working website so this is the attending
the local host address it's used in is
Express if we wanted to put breakpoints
on the actual controller you can go to
the home controller here you can see
these are like the index where it
returns the view so if I put a
breakpoint here and let's go ahead and
the hell did it girl alright I guess I
closed it son of a bitch alright so if
you want to open it back up and go down
here click on this little is icon and
then you can go to your little bit host
address now you can see that we're
actually hitting this breakpoint so if I
hover over something area and you can
see it's returning of you there's
nothing really there but if I want to
continue execution go ahead and press
play you can see that we're there and
this is all just kind of brought to you
out of the box now in another video I'll
probably do what I know there is an open
tonight no wonder Microsoft so you can
you can also change that browser too if
you wanted to you can say hey under is
expressed we could say browse with you
can choose Chrome instead as the default
and now it will run inside of Chrome
which is a much better product and
everybody knows that so that said
there's a lot of there's a lot of
potential that you could have with this
setup here and this video is just simply
how to get set up and dotnet core and
then I gave you two separate routes that
you could go you could go visual studio
community which honestly I would
probably recommend if you're going to be
serious about C sharp and dotnet core
but if you're just trying to dabble it
might be easier for you to get started
and visual studio code but Visual Studio
itself is going to give you a lot more
debugging capabilities it's going to
work a lot better probably than Visual
Studio code and what you know where you
guys go with this it's completely up to
you but one of the videos I do want to
follow up on it is basically gutting
some of this Bower prop that they give
you and replacing it with was you know
NPM web pack and Babel and stuff like
that and that's that's honestly like the
suggested route that I would go at the
time of this video which is August 1st
of 2017 I mean that's where everything's
headed so I'll probably touch on that
just let me know what you guys think and
everything and and I'll try to basically
if motivation is there to create
follow-up videos I'll do that but if
only a hundred people ever watch this
video them
probably won't so alright guys thanks
for watching man have a good day bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
bootcamp is a 12-week intensive course
