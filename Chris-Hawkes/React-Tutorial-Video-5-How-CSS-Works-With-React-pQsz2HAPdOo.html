first video react is it uses JSX and
what this is here is this is JSX so it's
not quite JavaScript it's more of like
an XML type of syntax it boils down the
regular JavaScript but basically there
is some nuances of the JSX language that
is going to make you pull your hair out
at times and other times you're going to
be like wow that's pretty awesome so one
of the guys that I like to watch is npj
Mattias works for Spotify as is on
YouTube channel and I'm envious of him
because he has more subscribers than I
do but hopefully you guys can help me
out and get me some more subscribers but
that guy he talks about the fact that he
hated JSX when it first came out and
it's funny because I actually hated that
 too when it first came out in fact
I hated JSX so much time so much that it
took three separate occasions for me to
say you know what I hate his ex I'm not
using it I did that twice and it wasn't
until the third time that I finally gave
it a chance and I said you know what I
can get on board with this JSX stuff so
if you're ever one of those guys who's
like a total hipster douche bag who says
you can't mix different presentation
logic in with your JavaScript you're not
going to like JSX at first but hopefully
you can get over yourself and you'll
eventually start to like it so that said
there are certain rules that must be
followed so when you have a component
box here this return function is going
to have to return one outer div there's
always going to have to be an outer give
you cannot do this you cannot do this
what's the problem here is that you have
to sibling div containers there's no
parents so watch what happens when we
try to render this in fact webpack
probably if I save this it won't even
compile see like you start getting error
messages from our NPM why because
there's no parent so if I want to fix
that I could I could wrap this entire
thing into a given to one parent and the
render function is happy so let's take a
look and now you can see it's happy
again and it's actually compiling so
don't don't do that okay I said don't
twice but you know what I mean don't do
it alright so inside here we can render
stuff in in a slightly different way now
if you'll notice in regular HTM
a class is identified like that but in
JSX it's actually using camel suitcase
so class name renders this class named
there's other certain weird things too
like if I wanted to put a style on this
I could say style equals and what I'm
going to do is actually use two two sets
of curly braces because inside here I'm
just gonna use standard JSON object or
JavaScript object notation which is just
key value pairs so key value key value
now key is not an actual thing but what
if I set font size now notice this is
this font size with the hyphen is the
normal way that you would do it with CSS
but everything that has a - you need to
replace that with a camel case so font
size then turns to this and JSX
and then we're gonna say 24 pixels so
watch what happens now when we rerender
oh now we have bigger font but we're
using JSX font so this is all being done
through JSX but it's slightly different
like I said because normal CSS this is
the normal CSS property and selector but
it's not that way with JSX so you're
gonna have to get used to that and
that's something that takes a little bit
of getting used to but it's fine you'll
eventually get used to it you can bake
your CSS and styles and everything all
into your components using JSX
distribute your components everywhere
and instead of jQuery components where
you have a plug-in that has like eight
million dependencies and you got to do
 just right in order for it to work
and this is a separate case you can just
get it to work you should be able to
just export your component anywhere and
since all the stuff that it needs is
baked into it it should just work so
anyway that is how you do CSS in here so
if I wanted to say color obviously color
and doesn't have more than one word or -
so everything is just fine so if I say
red this will work it'll turn it red
all right so remember inline styles are
gonna have to have two sets of curly
braces you can't have one so you can see
one can't find mods welcome and you'll
see that there's also an error you're
gonna ask why can't you have more than
one well don't worry about it you just
can't have more than one for inline
style just do two I don't want to
confuse you guys or too early on in this
this tutorial series so just don't even
worry about it
another thing too is that we can
actually put stuff inside of P tags like
their normal Pete Ang's I'm a paragraph
and we can have header tags so all this
is all this is just fine and good and
you'll notice the parent is still
dictating that it should be read and
that's about it guys we're gonna end
this video here that is how inline
styling works or how CSS styling works
and react alright guys thanks for
watching make sure you subscribe check
out hipster code for more tutorials and
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
