comment from user Sam deacon he said
that I but he found a lot of success off
of my channel he says he's now a junior
PHP developer he's been doing it for
about eight months apparently he's
watched my videos quite a bit for the
tutorials I know that as a mixed
audience some people are here for
tutorials or just you know programming
thoughts and other people are just kind
of interested in I guess my outlooks on
on business and and creativity and
things like that I guess but the the
flash tutorial series he said that you
know he's been doing PHP but now he's
like learning python and django and
flash news back to my tutorial series so
that's pretty awesome I I don't think
that all my tutorial series are great
some of them I think are pretty good
like this last one and I have a price on
one that's very popular and some of my
react stuff is that I think a little bit
more complex i am working on a new
series with my react Redux cuffs and
right now it's a little bit it's a
little bit complicated but the whole
situation is just complicated with that
so I do plan on expanding on that I did
think it's going to be helpful to a lot
of people once it's finished and it's
going to be a while because there's so
many different concepts to cover but the
whole modern react Rita expressed kind
of a kind of environment so i just
thought i'd share that there's actually
been quite a few occurrences of people
have said that they've actually gotten
into the industry a lot of people said
through motivation or inspiration and
also just your tutorials and things that
I've done on this channel so it's pretty
cool also I'm looking for feedback from
you guys on how to make this channel
better in 2017 so if you guys have any
sort of insight some of the stuff is
just beyond what I'm able to do and
people have asked whether or not
actually have worked freelance or work
full-time and I actually do work
full-time for a company so you know that
is my priority and anytime I have on the
side it's pretty much devoted to this
channel in learning so there hasn't been
a whole lot of effort made on my partner
last year to try to do like side
projects or anything hipster code was
created more as like it in conjunction
with this channel and the tutorials but
aside from that like I used to do movies
and music and things like that and and
right now i'm building a music and
movies website surrounded around that
react Redux tutorial series and i'm
working on but you know as far as
aspirations and things of trying to get
that like into some you a major content
you know website or something is just
it's just not in my my plans that all
right now also just a quick question
from wicked moon a viewer he said hey
Chris thanks for the video have a
question for using reinventing a website
or app is any good so he was asking
because I told him about just getting
out there and building stuff because
that's what you have to do i'm actually
working on expressive reactor redox nor
for me to learn better and things like
that i'm actually just building
something even though i don't have a
huge aspiration for it but and the
process so there's nothing wrong with
like if you wanted to make a movies
website or a music website or something
like that obviously there's last.fm and
there's pandora and there's all these
you know different types or if you're
going to a music player it's more like
Spotify Pandora versus like hell I don't
even know popular music study anymore
but like last.fm or something like that
or pure volume or something if you're
talking about certain music related
things as opposed to being a music
player but the thing that I'm trying to
point out is that if you were going to
build a content sites a movies or
something you thought rotten tomatoes is
very interesting I'd be a hell of a
thing to compete against but you could
say you know it through the presentation
of the movie itself like how I lay
things out there's nothing wrong with
being more creative about how you create
a content-based website there's not a
ton of money in content based websites
because there's so much competition and
the the dot you know there's a large
market players like dominate almost all
the search traffic so you're gonna have
a hard time competing and plus something
new industries like music and movies
they don't just have music and movie
websites talking about them they have
like literally mutant really creeps LA
LA Times or Washington Post you know
you're competing against even like
newspaper and regular news outlets and
things like that for for market share
but the point is is that there's nothing
wrong with taking and exist
idea or concept and making it better
even if it is like a analyzing tool for
stock market stuff you know what I mean
there's going to be tools and things
like that out there you don't have to be
like completely coming up with your own
idea because something that's never been
thought of before because in most cases
if that is the case you know it's very
rare that it's never been thought of
before but then even if it has there's a
good chance somebody can feel your your
idea you know what it means so I don't
know man as i said the point is you make
something better and that's kind of what
i'm talking about with getting out there
and building stuff and for the most part
when people are saying how do i get my
foot in the door I've always said I
don't have those answers I've always
recommended people do go to college
because it's such a tough market for
people that don't have the degree but I
you know I've always been adamant that
you have to get a portfolio out there
there's really nothing short I don't
know that just udemy courses or
something like that is going to be
enough it seems like you're going to
need you to me as well as having your
own portfolio that means having websites
and businesses or you know apps in the
app market whatever it is that you're
trying to do get stuff out there in that
regard you have to have yet to have a
track record I mean even with a track
record that I had I was getting rejected
for three years now my track record
online like at one point I'd like a
static website and it wasn't very
impressive at all but the point is you
end up learning more and more for every
project you develop and getting stuff
deployed and actually you know she's
showing your worth is going to be one of
the few ways I just don't think that a
Coursera course is going to be enough
for anybody to give anybody a you know a
gig just starting out I could be wrong
but that's just my sauce also when
people post racist comments and things
like that I am going to delete them I'm
not sure why anybody thinks it's
accessible also some people have asked
me if I could be like their mentor and
things like that guy said unfortunately
I can't do that and i even told john i
was talking to him one time that i was
going to recommend this video for the
people that think that they need to have
a mental
or and how to find a mentor because I
guess he gets the question a lot as well
but there's just no way that we have
time a really most people for that
matter have any time to be like a
personal mentor you usually get that
once you get you know into the job but
you know the YouTube channels and things
like that if people can find like some
sort of like I said in the beginning of
this video like inspiration and things
from youtubers like myself or John or
whatever that is great but as far as
whether or not we're going to be able to
literally get on the phone and start
talking you guys like that's that's
literally almost impossible especially
for free so just thought I'd give that a
you know I mentioned just because I do
get that like quite a bit and I'm really
not trying to be a dick but it's just
the way it is I'm sorry also Chris
Cavanaugh gave a shout out which I
thought was with great he's actually one
of my oldest viewers literally going
back almost four years now maybe all the
way there's over the whole four years so
he knows how terrible my stuff was when
i first started and and that was kind of
the point i just didn't give a shit but
now it's like I have grown quite a bit
obviously my skills have improved over
four years and things like that so he
takes notice of it but he's also another
person that um you know was self-taught
had the same blue-collar type of
background and was able to get his foot
into the doors and industry now he's
like a consultant business owner who
does you know actual professional work
for people so that's that's also really
awesome especially from one of my
earliest youtube videos or youtube
viewers also i like the fact that i got
this guy that is a 46 year old history
teachers learning python from my channel
he's like nothing wrong with learning
new skills that's pretty awesome as well
some of these comments i haven't been
able to get back to so i apologize if i
haven't but i got some new faces here as
well i wish i could mention everybody
all right so anyway that's really all i
got right now guys thanks for watching
