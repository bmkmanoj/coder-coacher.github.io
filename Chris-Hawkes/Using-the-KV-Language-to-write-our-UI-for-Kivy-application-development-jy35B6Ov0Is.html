tutorial that we need to discuss the
differences between you have two ways of
developing TV applications number one
you spell out your entire tire all your
widgets and your routes like your labels
your buttons your text all that stuff
you define it within your actual build
methods for whatever class it is that is
being fired and that from what I
understand can get out of hand
so the key be developers had created a
TV language in order to be able to
create like external files and a dot kV
extension that will layout widgets and
entire layouts actually for certain
aspects of your application so let's um
we see we've seen in the last video how
we add the label using the UX label in
this video we need to talk about adding
a layout using the K V language so if
you look at like the pong tutorial
you're gonna see you're gonna see that
it actually has a like a definition
here's like the K V language like here
it's um everything's indented it's a
four space indentation which is required
so just keep that in mind
so following in their footsteps we need
to go ahead and import something here
for our application we're going to
import the widget class so we're safe
from Kivi dot UI X dot widget import
widget alright now that we have that
they seem to follow a different path as
far as instantiating the the widget
class so we're gonna build that widget
class now we're gonna say class and
we'll just say test widget
and we'll just pass in widget and say
pass so now we're going to edit the
return object on the build method and
we're gonna return this class we just
created here so I'll just copy this and
make sure there's an open and close
parenthesis and what this is going to do
it's actually going to hopefully point
to an external KB file and hopefully be
able to lay everything out so in the
same directory of our application let's
go ahead and create a file and I'm just
going to add a text file with a dot K V
extension on it and we're gonna name it
it's gonna be called test widget the
same name is this class here actually
you know it's not that's not right one
of the common slip-ups apparently is
that whenever you're you're linking to
these KB files and the KB file actually
needs to be the name of your application
except you don't want to include app so
whatever your applications name is it
should always be test app or Jean's app
or whatever you don't whatever it is it
should be in the name of your app and
then the app but when you're linking to
the KB file it is very important that
you just say test kV it needs to be
lowercase so I'm not adding the app so
now we have this KB file and I'm gonna
go ahead and just copy the code from the
KB documentation for their pong game
tutorial except we need to replace this
name with the actual name of our test
widget that we had come up with and if
everything goes well we're gonna have
some sort of a label here I'm not even
sure the label says anything but let's
just go ahead and see what we're looking
at I believe everything should be up to
par here but we're gonna go and run this
all right sweet so this is a layout that
is defined in the pong tutorial and
alternate a bit just to match our
application just but just so that we
know what's going on here we have this
class which can be found inside in this
kv file now the kv file needs to be the
name of this part of your main
application class not the app part just
test all lower case k v and that way
when the application runs it'll pull up
the test ikb file will say oh look
at this this class exists inside the kv
file let's go ahead and populate that
class with this UI layout using the kv
the key v language which from what I
understand and I don't have a ton of
experience with it cuz i've been using
key v obviously any longer than you guys
have but the benefit is that you can
have your UI it takes much less code and
it's much easier to read to use the key
v language as opposed to trying to spell
out everything inside of your class
definitions and hopefully i'm assuming
we can do a combination of both maybe
maybe not I don't know but we'll get
into that more on future tutorials
alright guys thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
