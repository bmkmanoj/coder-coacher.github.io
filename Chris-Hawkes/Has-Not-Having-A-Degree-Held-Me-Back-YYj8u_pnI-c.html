question from one of the viewers his
name is Jared and he says what you say
not having a degree is holding you back
question from a high schooler thinking
about College one of the things I want
to make clear on this channel is that
just because I found success doing
something one way doesn't mean that
everybody else can find the same success
I mean there's people that watch this
channel from all over the world and
there's all kinds of different
backgrounds and I never want to
discourage somebody from thinking that
they can you know go down the same path
or whatever but I can't I can't
guarantee that type of success how does
not having a degree held me back yes it
actually has its held me back at even my
current employer the my current employer
actually hires people right out of
college and and will end up when I when
I started with this employer actually I
was starting at a lesser position
because I didn't have a college degree I
was able to work my way up and work my
way through the ranks and everything
without that college degree but I would
say that it definitely did affect me but
at the same time I would also say that
it also motivated me to to to try to
succeed I mean so one of the things that
I would say that you shouldn't do or at
least people have told me that I
shouldn't do is that it and that is
compare myself to other people so a lot
of the times I will actually compare
myself to those that maybe get hired by
the company that i work at that have a
college degree and or even some of the
you know sometimes like senior
programmers that might you know be
ranked higher than me or making more
money than me all sometimes let that get
into my head where I think that person
doesn't know some of this you know this
basic JavaScript stuff you know they're
probably pretty decent it's t-shirt but
they don't know this javascript stuff
and here i am i'm pretty good at sea
short but i can also do the java script
tag and you python and django and all
this other stuff that I do on the side
and I start comparing myself and
thinking hmm why do I not get you know
paid as much money as those people or
why do I not have that rank or have as
much responsibility as those people and
that can leave a little bit of a chip in
the shoulder which can also be unhealthy
I think so
something that I've been very very aware
of but one of the interesting things
that I think in my particular case is
that I almost feel like in a way that
this entire thing is just like almost
predestined it's weird like I don't I
don't believe in predestination like
that in fact I'm not a religious guy at
all but it's very interesting to me like
my background and my entrepreneurial
spirit which I feel like comes from my
family my father was an entrepreneur and
I know I'm sure preneur can be a very
broad title to basically being a
business owner if somebody that strives
to build something you know themselves
instead of being like a company guy or
whatever I feel like I have a fine
balance in between the tears that like
I'm somebody that wants to learn new
things to try to build new things and
some of the times i will admit that
those build new things have a monetary
you know basically the hamster wheel
inside my head starts turning with
monetary gains that that could be a
reality with you know some new framework
or some new tool and things like that
and there's something like that i think
in a lot of programmers if you read
hacker news there's a lot of people that
are genuinely interested in the success
of certain people and you know and then
they want to replicate that success and
a lot of times you know by the time
people are telling you how to replicate
the success it's already too late so
when I say hey I think you could
definitely do it without a college
degree in law stuff I would be lying to
you because it's personally held me back
and it's something that I even continue
to worry about to this day knowing that
I have to go out there in the open
market and try to find something you
know something different now here's the
thing I've been if I were a religious
guy I would say I've been very blessed
now even though I'm not religious I do
still have like a kind of a prayer a
minute meditation type of thing that I
do I would say that you know that I
definitely fear you know the unknown a
little bit maybe a lot but the thing is
is like things have been very very good
for me as far as everything really
everything I'm I I don't mention the
company that I work for and I haven't in
the entire time that this channel has
been in
distance because this channel has
nothing to do with my full-time employer
it's something completely separate it's
something that I do in my own time and
it's a passion that actually benefits my
current employer so the reason why I'm
going to mention my current employers
because I'm not going to be working for
them after two days from now so that is
something that I'll probably end up
dedicating another video towards because
it is something that is a big important
piece of my life right now but the
company that gave me a shot at being a
programmer I am actually going to be
leaving and that company is geico so if
you guys live in the United States you
guys probably have heard of geico guy
goes a major insurance companies owned
by Berkshire Hathaway which is literally
one of the largest companies in the
entire world they gave me my child as
being a programmer and i love that
company and I wish them the best once
again and the reason why I never
mentioned them is because Geico never
gave me permission to say hey you're
representing us and you're going to try
to recruit programmers to work for us
and things like that there's never been
any sort of relationship like that this
is literally just me starting up a
channel on a social networking site that
anybody could do the same thing and then
it just kind of built into this audience
which is great I think it's awesome and
it's awesome to the point where like
I've had other companies reach out to me
in fact capital one that didn't work out
very well capital one is a company that
I can clearly see you know the entire is
the entire interview probably all that
Subway's I didn't work out very well at
all and I'm glad I don't work there but
it was also in tysons corner virginia i
live in Fredericksburg that commute
would be miserable so it was like okay
capital one they reached out to me over
this channel so they didn't seem to care
that i didn't have a degree amazon is
another company that's reached out to me
through this channel they didn't care
that i didn't have a degree pack
publishing window calm pluralsight
record express interest in being in
working with some of the tutorial series
i've had i've had people tell me that
they've used my Python beginning Python
series and their computer science course
so all this stuff is great and none of
that stuff had
me any effect on what had nothing to do
with whether or not I had a college
degree or not another company Raytheon
or no yes so so you know unfortunately
you know with the things the way things
have worked out with geico I think I if
it was a great company I would recommend
them I want to finish my business
administration degree I do want to
finish it I want to have that I feel
like having that is much better than not
because you pick you can check out that
you know that one extra check box with a
human resources department there's going
to be certain companies that are very
stringent and say absolutely we're not
going to hire somebody without a college
degree that there is that possibility
but here's where I end up in and where I
want to prove everybody wrong everybody
that has that mentality that I can't do
it I am a hardworking person I've been
somebody that has that is like had to
work very very hard to get where I'm at
and I'm somebody that's going to
continue to work very very hard to get
where I'm trying to go and and I given
my all I mean I give it my all and
trying to to better my technology skills
and that that generally you know that
generally comes around full tilt towards
whatever sort of employer that you work
for so I think that's really good that's
a good feature I think of being a
programmer because to me a good
programmer is somebody that actually
that tries to better themselves it
understands like what day what they
don't know or they know what they don't
know and and that's something that I've
learned along the way because for the
longest time I used to think that like
that I knew I knew everything I mean I
remember one time reading a pearl book
where I was doing pro programming and
was pro by example i believe it was what
it was called and I was just like
flipping through the pages one after
another hose oh it's an array that's a
hashtag you know I me and I just wasn't
retaining a damn thing but the waves
that book broke it down was that like it
was some sort of simple context and you
read it but literally nothing registers
even though you think you right you can
even recite words that you just read and
recite even full sentences maybe that
you just read but the fact of the matter
is is that
none of that is actually
registering with you that stuff
registers with you through repetition
and through coding and eventually you
run into problems that literally will
keep you up at night and you'll wake up
in the morning and you'll not to solve
the problem that's happened on multiple
occasions with me there's been times
that like where I just need to run the
ideas on another person and as a senior
program where you start to understand
that hey I need to run this by another
set of eyes because I'm clearly just not
seeing it you also understand some of
the you know the basic things like you
know you have to have a proper amount of
sleep you have to drink a decent amount
of water you have to get exercise
stretch do your stretching you know take
walks if you have a foosball table or
anything ping pong at work there's a
reason for those things a lot of people
in the business world don't understand
that programmers can't literally pound
out eight hours of code that's just not
it's not a humanly possible thing and if
you did you'd probably be some sort of a
robot and let somebody can literally
pump out algorithms eight hours a day I
personally and have never seen it in my
professional career but anyway as not
any so not having a degree is it as they
held me back it has I feel like I'm a
pretty good success story for myself you
know considering where I came from you
know where I've gone so far on go on and
I hope to continue that success and as
that as it is i am going to be saying
goodbye to my current employer and the
next two days so friday will be my last
day and I'll probably talk again about
that a little bit because I think that
there is a you know there's just a lot
to talk about i think a lot of people
can can get out of that you know as far
as a lot of you guys watch my channel
are trying to get into the industry but
there's still quite a few of you guys
that are already in the industry so I
think that's cool because I you know my
target audience I would like to have it
a balance between people that are in the
industry and those that
do want to get in but once again i would
say that having no degree has held me
back it's held me back multiple times
throughout my career I would be further
along if I would have had it but I'm
also very very very grateful for the
success I've had for the chances that
I've had and really I have to thank you
know a couple of managers that literally
gave me my first shot and I do like a
tremendous amount of gratitude towards
those people and I'm sure that they
probably wouldn't want me mentioning
their name or anything like that so it
doesn't matter but um at least you know
as far as mentioning it to my audience
or anything so anyway guys thanks for
watching make sure you subscribe I
appreciate all the support and I'm
getting ready for my 50,000 subscriber
mark hoping i can get that in the next
couple of weeks my son actually is in
the process of making me where he said
he's going to make me a homemade plaque
for another o'clock but he's going to
he's going to do a little illustration
type of thing for the 50,000 subscriber
marks and and then once i get to a
hundred thousand maybe i can get one
from google legit but right now i'm
going to go with what he's offering me
and it's probably uh to me it's more
special than anything so alright guys
thanks for watching have a good day and
by hey guys so a lot of you asked me how
do i get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and i just want to take a
moment to mention dev mountain coding
boot camp is a 12 week intensive course
