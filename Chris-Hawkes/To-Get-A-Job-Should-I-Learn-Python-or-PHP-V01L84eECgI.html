comment here from ftfs and she I'm
assuming it's a she it's got a girl
profile picture but with FGFs that could
mean anything and it could be anyone so
might be a guy not sure but this person
says I'm new at all this programming and
I've only recently started getting
comfortable with HTML and CSS and some
JavaScript and she puts in parenthesis
that she does not like JavaScript
however I've already started thinking of
what language I should learn next which
is you know great we all start to try to
figure out where where else we should be
once we start getting comfortable with
something right now she says the hype
seems to be in PHP so the market is
saturated with PHP developers my
question is should I learn Python or PHP
which one is more profitable
honestly I'm in this because I want to
earn money from what I'm passionate
about I am NOT interested in being a
rogue artist so this person has the
right intentions in mind and something
that I don't think that all programmers
share the same the same dream and and it
is not even really a dream it's just
it's an app it's an absolute necessity
it's a need and that is to make money
nobody wants to be a broke-ass B you
know what I mean you don't like we all
have to eventually get out there on our
own afford our own houses we might want
children one day you got to pay for
health insurance not for yourself but
for your children you're gonna have to
buy a house one day or at least pay for
someplace to live
if you're not already doing that a lot
of you guys watch my channel already
doing all that stuff now so you guys
don't need to be told that you know
being a developer makes good money and
then having good money is makes life
easier so the reason why I mentioned
that is because it's the same reason why
like there's so many millennial young
developers out there that claim that you
know JavaScript is a solution everything
and I am NOT a JavaScript hater by the
way I've been writing JavaScript for
years making a lot of money writing
JavaScript but I'm willing to write code
into in whatever whatever opportunities
exist for me so if if today it's react
and tomorrow it's angular I'm perfectly
fine with that if I'm writing Java to me
tomorrow compared to c-sharp
no big deal to me like I'll learn it
I'll be good and and as long as I'm
getting paid money and I'm making money
so I wouldn't really be a programmer if
I wasn't getting paid to be a programmer
I can honestly tell you that I would
dabble with things here and there but
life is short man
you like I feel like I want to get out
there I'm going to travel I want to do
things I'm going to you know one day I
might want to you know buy a boat or
something I had no idea I may be but
you're not going to do all that stuff if
you're working at you know part-time job
as a dishwasher or you know and then
it's that second part-time job with
Starbucks or somebody at least not not
that I know of you might be able to be a
manager maybe I starting to contradict
myself here but you guys get the point
I'm trying to say like it's about making
money man is it life is about making
money and programming is about making
money programmers we have a job to
create software to make money for
businesses to make products that people
want to pay for you know whether it's in
video games or websites like Facebook
and things like that everybody is all
about making money anybody that tells
you that they're not they're lying to
your face and including you know people
like Zuckerberg knowledge then that
guy knew probably from Jump Street that
he was going to have a billion-dollar
business on his hands and he certainly
went for it just like Larry Page did
with Google and everybody else does if
they're given the opportunity so whether
you're going to be a PHP developer or a
Python developer those are both
languages that I think are great
languages if you can get a job with them
so if the market and I don't know what
your market is or where you're located I
haven't personally seen any sort of rage
with PHP I've heard a lot of that
laravel lately but you know PHP has I
believe still like 50% of the market
when it comes to websites you know that
a running PHP is certainly out numbers
Java screws re evil yeah even no js'
sites I would imagine and it definitely
out numbers Python and Perl and in Ruby
so PHP has a lot of opportunities
there's no doubt about that so I feel
like PHP might be the better option for
you if you're noticing that there's more
PHP developers in your industry
especially your geographic area and then
it's also to me a much more forgiving
language for junior developers that are
trying to get into the industry Python
is great but there's a lot of data
scientist jobs out there that require
advanced degrees you know PhD is
released master's degrees and they're
using Python to just you know do massive
data calculations and things like that
that's not stuff that's geared towards
absolute beginners that's not the same
Python doesn't have like you know a
startup culture like Python has a pretty
strong culture on the west coast
I chose Python for my hipster code
website because I felt like Python gave
me the best ability to be able to build
a website that has user profiles it can
it can build for credit cards and things
like that so I also have little things
like you know building little quizzes
and things like that that I built on
this website and everything for you know
calculating user profiles who took the
test who's paid for the product who you
know like who's downloaded certificates
and things like that all that stuff
requires you know obviously a pretty
pretty good relational database as
opposed you can go no sequel if you
wanted with like Mongo but I certainly
didn't want to do that I wasn't trying
to make my life more difficult because
I'm not and I'm not a hipster I'm
looking for a product that actually
makes my life easier and that makes me
money in this case I was able to create
this django website and in roughly two
months now it's been a lot of additional
work to it and things like that you know
here and there but not a tremendous
amount of work and the reason why is
because I chose Python and Django a
fully mature full stack framework that
has almost everything I needed it to
have out of the box without me having
the you know custom write hardly
anything so you know that is that is why
I chose Python for my site but I see the
market in my area is obviously c-sharp
and it's it's JavaScript and for those
reasons that's that's where I make you
know my bread and butter and things like
that and and for most of my coding and
development stuff you know day to day
it's all JavaScript because that's where
the jobs are that's where the money is
at and I'm not an idiot man like I mean
money talks and walks right so
you want it you want to get out there
and makes it and make some money make
something of yourself and no need to
spend time on some obscure language that
nobody's ever heard of so you can master
the art of you know how a form should
you know should should validate properly
or something like that you know it's
like basically your business is about
getting things done as quickly as
possible and you know hopefully we live
with the least amount of maintenance
possible so a lot of the times though
the right way of doing things you know
the supposed right way and everybody's
got their own opinion ated
version of the right way but the status
quo is that hey we're not going to give
enough time to do things the right way
we're going to do things the working way
and get done that's that's what
I've seen in the business world so
that's why I really feel like people
that are like Oh C sharp lacks tail tail
recursion and all this stuff or tail and
recursive optimisation or whatever I was
talking about in my videos a few weeks
ago so I'm going to blow off Steve all
together and I'm just going to focus on
F sharp well all of a sudden you've now
limited your area there's not a whole
lot of jobs out there and F sharp
there's not a whole lot of hype that
I've seen in even at a sharp and all
this functional programming nonsense
 that we've been talking about
whether it's Elm or F sharp or Scala or
elixir I don't even those elixirs and I
know I'm Haskell whatever dude we've
been talking about it for 15 years now
we're talking about jQuery being dead
but guess what it's still being used
everywhere it's going to be around for
another 10 years at least they're still
websites out there that has to support
ie9 and ie 10 so people aren't really
and then you know there's people like
whoa I can't believe you're not using
es6 and then and I can't believe you're
not using babble but then at the same
time they don't understand why somebody
uses typescript so it's all just you
know this is all speculation about where
the market is going to go and things
like that the fact of matter is ever
like if you want to learn you might be a
good developer you build stuff like if I
were learning Python Django I would look
to build a website like this that's the
quickest way to learn Django and Python
you know at the same time for Python or
Django is just Python code so get out
there and build stuff man so I would
definitely suggest PHP / Python if
you're noticing a lot more PHP jobs
Python is going pretty strong though I
mean if you look at the govt index and
this is not an exact science at all like
nobody nobody claims it is really and
you can't but tio B's kind of been like
to go to try to figure out you know
based on search traffic and other things
like how well language is faring and
things like that so you can see really
the most impressive language I think all
years
but other than that and it's not just
about the govt index I think goes a
pretty phenomenal language I started
looking into a lot of different things
that I think it's crazy how you know the
the functions can return multiple values
I've never seen anything like that so I
think that's pretty pretty cool
obviously with concurrency so multi-core
processors and things like that are
going to have a much be much more
efficient with a language like go
compared to some of these older
languages but anyway yeah so Python PHP
can't really go wrong with either one
I'm not really sure one is a rage over
the other zone but definitely for
younger beginner developers things like
that I think PHP you're going to have a
much easier time getting into a PHP dev
shop then you will you know some sort of
mature Python Django operation being run
by you know the National Geographic or
something like that so all right guys
