this video I'm answering a question I
actually had a very good question that
was asked by one of my viewers and it
actually got me thinking but they seem
to I guess they were kind of reading the
the writing on the wall couple days ago
I made a video about whether or not
c-sharp was dying and I cited a lot of
examples like to TOB index and you know
the amount of jobs like the job trends
on indeed.com and things like github and
how many projects are being built with
python and a lot of different factors
that would indicate that python is
emerging as a contender to the c-sharp
language and the question was wanted
from one of the viewers he says knowing
that you have a j-job in c-sharp which
means I work for a net c-sharp company
these insights give you that much more
credibility very good deeply thought-out
video they said with that said have you
considered switching jobs from c-sharp
to Java or Python if not why not I
remember you talking about your job and
saying how you like it and all that
stuff and he says so what's your gut
telling you it sounds like you're
priming to switch away from c-sharp so
I'm going to answer that question at
number one switching jobs from c-sharp
to Python as far as what is my gut
telling me I find that a bit concerning
actually of all the reasons why I
mentioned Python is a great language and
all these you know things that I has
going forward it is actually it's very
good right but c-sharp is um is a little
bit more modern it has a lot a lot more
commercial tools built around it that
make really really complex jobs a bit
easier to deal with now granted there's
editors out there like integrated
development environments for Python like
pycharm that has tools it was built by
the guys that did a riche R / which is C
sharps basically it's the JetBrains
company and they build all these cool
little tools where you can click a click
of a button shows you how to rewrite
your code in a you know a particular way
I've seen the way
that PyCharm works and i can tell you
that when you have visual studio and
resharper running together i find that
product to be a little bit more
sophisticated making it a lot easier in
my opinion to be able to really come to
deal with a very very complex code base
so as far as what is my gut telling me
about whether or not C sharp or Python
is more secure I mean it really depends
on your area but in the United States
with the amount of fortune
you know 100's and fortune 500s that are
using dotnet and c-sharp or Microsoft in
some way shape or form a lot of
companies still use c-sharp so where
we're seeing a lot of you know the the
success that Python has had is we're
seeing it in a lot of startups we're
also seeing Python succeed and things
like bioinformatics and and machine
learning and things like that from what
I've seen of those jobs it almost seems
like the companies that are hiring for
those positions they're looking for
people with advanced stem degrees you
know advanced mathematics and physics
and things like that it seems like
there's there's a lot of that being
asked for so from a Python perspective
of where I'm at in my career those types
of jobs wouldn't really appeal to me so
the question is are a lot of
corporations running their entire stack
in Python and I really don't think that
it's anywhere close to the amount of of
companies that are actually running a
Java or.net stack so my gut tells me it
would be a terrible decision for me to
move away from c-sharp and try to take a
job where I'm doing just Python
development there's absolutely nothing
wrong with Python but a lot of what the
Python jobs that I've seen like I said
if it's not advanced stem degrees and
things like that I've seen a lot of
startups now a lot of people would love
to work for a start-up a startup is like
their ideal spot I startup sometimes get
your foot in the door of the industry
and it's easier to get into a startup
than it would you know especially if
you're self-taught then it would be you
know trying to break into like a
commercial enterprise development gig
using
over C sharp so in that regard I think
Python is great for newbie developers I
think it's great trends that we're
seeing it spring up but the question is
geared toward towards me
you know personally about whether or not
I would want to up in my career and
leave a steady gig as a c-sharp
developer in a very corporate
environment and then you know try to go
to an all Python divide environment so I
have no desire to work 16 or 18 hour
days and some startup unless it was my
own startup or maybe I'm getting paid a
lot more money than you know there's a
money helps everything right so if there
if there was enough money thrown at any
sort of thing I would be in tight and
theis to join up and do that kind of
stuff because I worked my butt off
anyway I mean if I'm not working on this
YouTube channel I'm always working on
something I'm always trying to better my
skills and things like that so it's not
like I don't work those crazy type of
hours because I kind of do but I also do
on my own terms I'm not I'm not working
16 hours trying to build somebody else's
vision so that they can get a big huge
cash payout when the IPO happens and
then I get you know $30,000 in stock you
know after I poured in years of my life
you know that kind of thing doesn't
interest me as much but if you're just
getting started there's going to be more
opportunities for some of those hot
startups and probably in my opinion I
would think it would be easier to try to
break the break in the industry using
something like Python as opposed to
c-sharp or Java now another thing too is
that um you know with these these
corporate gigs I mean there they tent
they tend to be you know steady
employment right I mean if you have kids
you have a wife and a mortgage then you
know a steady employment a steady
company is ultimately you know what
you're looking for so how many of these
shops are not startups that are using a
full Python stack at least in the United
States and from what I've seen it seems
like there's quite a bit of Python stuff
going on in Europe and the UK and things
like that but I'm just not a hundred
percent sure how many how many companies
are truly using Python as like a primary
stack of choice for
for you know a lot of their their
corporate like if you have a development
environment of several hundred
developers or even thousands of
developers how many companies have
thousands of developers and they're like
a fully Python shop
besides consultants like if you're a
consulting company like Accenture or one
of those other major contracting
consulting companies then they're going
to have thousands of employees right and
there's going to be probably thousands
dedicated to Python and trying to you
know help customers with their Python
stacks and stuff like that but so the
bottom line is this though is that
Python is showing some really good
trends it's been around a lot longer
than c-sharp it was never taken
seriously for the longest time people
used to say oh it's you know it's like
Perl but slower and makes you do forced
indentation and stuff like that and you
know and it always took a backseat to
Perl through the 90s and into the early
2000s and it wasn't until like really
Django came along or about 2004 that
Python really started exploding and a
lot of that had to do with the success
that Google had and you know since that
time we've seen Python get adopted by a
lot of different corporations IBM was
using it pretty extensively now every
single library out there that has a
public API is going to have Python
instructions on how to to interface to
it you know if it's something like
stripe or anything you name of Python is
is right there so I think Python is a
great language but my gut tells me it's
probably not a good idea to try to
actively seek out a different career
than c-sharp because I mean c-sharp is
it's a very stable language and it's
used by a lot of stable companies that
employ quite a bit of people in the
United States beyond that even all the
things that I mentioned where c-sharp is
not able to compete very well because
you know it's not embraced by the young
hackers and it's a lot of nine-to-five
developers that are just you know doing
you know their jobs
you know then going home and not really
coding or worrying about you know trying
to to build the next thing the
the thing is is that the amount of cash
that Microsoft has is a tremendous
amount of cash I mean I talked the other
day about how Microsoft Apple and Google
have a tremendous amount of corporate
cash so even where Microsoft is not able
to compete very well they almost have so
much cash that they can just force their
way to be a competitor even in things
that they're inferior at so c-sharp
developers are pretty safe and the fact
that you know even with Microsoft you
know seeing the writing on the wall as
far as them losing market share in so
many different areas you know that
they're trying to open source that their
their entire stack and they're working
on the.net core and and granted it's you
know it's partly a pile of at the
moment and and partly it's it's
basically half working because it just
got released but they are going to make
it better as we go along and that's
going to continue to stabilize the C
sharp development environment they just
bought xamarin for probably over a
billion dollars I'm not sure that the
details of that that sale were ever
released but it was definitely a
humongous purchase Microsoft's obviously
pretty well aligned with like companies
like Facebook and and they're going to
and then now you know since Microsoft
just recently bought LinkedIn oh my god
what is that going to do now you know so
it's like you know Microsoft's going to
get into this corporate world the Azure
stack even though they only have about
10% of the cloud market they're still
they're still growing quite a bit in
that out area and they're making a lot
of money there so you're going to
continue to see a lot of cloud demand as
a c-sharp developer who knows where this
indeed.com stuff is going to you know go
but they obviously they bought Skype and
then with the indeed.com trends are not
indeed that I say indeed I meant
LinkedIn I hope I didn't say indeed
several times I meant LinkedIn so with
the LinkedIn purchase though it's
interesting because LinkedIn even though
they weren't really making any money
most of the time they went out and
purchased lynda.com the learning
elearning platform for over a billion
dollars so now microsoft owns lynda.com
and they'll probably be able to compete
with Pluralsight now since you know they
they have all that cash so when you have
80 billion dollars in cash
actually you can pretty much do whatever
you want with and you make about an
additional twenty two billion dollars in
profit every year there's all kinds of
stuff that you can do to stay relevant
one of the biggest fears that Google had
when they were first you know just when
they were first understanding how
valuable their product was in the late
90s Eric Schmidt the CEO who goes by the
title mr. Google who's a billionaire now
thanks to the Google guys but he gets
brought in as an executive who can run
the company because he has you know
real-world experience where you have a
lot of who are just starting
their company that don't really
understand how to actually run a
corporate company so one of the first
things they usually do they go out and
they get an actual person that can help
them run the company Zuckerberg went out
and got Sheryl Sandberg
the Google guys got Eric Schmidt and
Eric Schmidt at one point I had sat on
the Apple Board of Directors and things
like that but the point is they go out
and they get CEOs and know how to manage
the company but Eric's Eric Schmidt one
of the first things he told the Google
Google guys he said you need to watch
out for Microsoft could be because they
knew that if you know at that point they
were vulnerable they were vulnerable to
Microsoft was even more powerful back
then and they're still quite you know
quite powerful now but the thing is is
Microsoft you know people love to hate
them but they've been relevant now for
decades
you know what three decades now and and
they're not going anywhere anytime soon
they're not IBM they're not like fading
quickly even iBM has a tremendous amount
of wealth that they can turn their their
ship around but it's going to be a lot
more difficult for them than a company
like Microsoft but that's another story
so yeah do I want to switch from Python
the c-sharp no not really if there was a
job opportunity and enough money the of
course but you know money talks and
 walks right so what I just want
to switch just for the sake of switching
no I mean there there's no reason to do
that you can be a Python in a c-sharp
developer there's nothing wrong with
doing both and as far as my own personal
ventures like when I'm building websites
and stuff like that I'm Python 100% just
because it's it saves me a lot of time
and effort yeah it's easier to develop
in Django than it is asp.net
it's cheaper to host it's a pleasure to
work with as opposed to a pain in the
ass
so many reasons to use Python over
c-sharp but I think it's good to know
both of them c-sharp is a more powerful
language when it comes to having
hundreds of developers working on very
complex software at the same time
c-sharp is a much better language it's
better suited for that type of stuff so
that's just my opinion guys let me know
what you think and please subscribe
please vote up the video if you would I
appreciate it and take care have a good
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
