couple of you guys had asked me about
what I was doing with unity and um I
just I kind of bounced you guys know I
balance in between stuff and I'm
building stuff all the time what can I
say it's actually interesting because I
was reading about programmer burnout and
I'll probably do other videos on that
but I guess I in some ways I concern
myself in a sense that I'm like man
maybe I programmed too much but I'll be
honest I've been programming now for
like 7 years and I like to do it and and
I like to switch things up and I think
honestly that's how I probably avoid the
burnout because sometimes during your
day job like it can be very monotonous
writing you know unit tests
over and over again you know whatever
language it is that you're doing I mean
there could be monotonous boring stuff
you end up doing but I think I kind of
spruce up programming by completely
playing with you know different
technologies and things and and unity is
part of that and I told you guys I would
be using xamarin I was gonna focus on
xamarin and I do plan on well you know I
don't even know if I planned on I messed
with xamarin for a little bit and it's
just as miserable is the last time I
tried to do Android development so I'll
probably mess with it again I guess I
hate the emulator whole set up I hate I
hate the whole either the zamel type of
XML type you know layout for Android I
haven't even messed with your whole
iPhone type of thing so I will admit I
am ignorant on the subject of xamarin
and website development as a whole but
what I do like about something like
unity is number one I can write in
c-sharp number two the community is
great number three it's free and then I
already stack of rating C sure I did and
number four this thing does support to
all kinds of different environments so
if I want to you know cater towards
Android and iPhone you know I could
probably have an easier time doing that
on this platform I would say then maybe
xamarin
I I'm just kind of throwing it out there
I don't I don't know if that's actually
accurate or not but all I know is I like
what I you know with what I see with
unity and I've I've been messing with it
for quite some time really years kind of
jumping into it jumping out jumping and
jumping out so I think I think the
learning curve is somewhat high just
because there's so many different little
toggleable options and a lot of what you
you see on the web is outdated
so it's constantly outdated and you need
a decent amount of c-sharp experience I
think in order to be really effective
but then again I'm also a beginner on
unity but what I want to demonstrate to
you guys here is that I basically have a
you know an idea of the mechanics and
the game and all the stuff and I really
don't want to release all that
information until it's actually finished
but what I will show you here is that
when I jumped into unity really earlier
this week I think was like a Wednesday
night and I said you know what let me
hit up the Unity store and I just
started grabbing all these free
resources and to date all I've done is
pay ten dollars for a model because the
model that I bought it would take me
literally years to become that good in
order to make something like that and
and blender or you know one of those
other animation and 3d programs like 3ds
Max or something now those programs I
have spent some time in in fact I have a
learning blender in 30 minutes which i
think is relatively effective for a
complete noob when it comes to models
and things in and in that that tutorial
actually in 30 minutes I explained a lot
of the basics of how do I actually mold
something and then also how do i do UV
unwrapping with UV unwrapping I find to
be a complete pain in the ass but I feel
like that tutorial is pretty well done
but that said every time I jump into 3d
modeling I always quickly realize that
I'm never gonna be like this 3d model
expert and nor do I really want to be
because it's it's kind of like in a
completely different side of the
industry it's like those people should
be really good at that and that's what
they choose to do and they like doing
that and then there's people like me who
want to build cool stuff like that but
know that I'm probably never gonna have
enough time to devote to it and that it
would be taking too much time away from
actual programming and then you probably
have 3d modelers that were like damn I
just wish I was a better coder that's
just my guess and assumption but let me
go ahead and explain let me give you a
demo first all right so these are all
free assets in just a $10 model so when
I start the game you can hear some music
and everything once again I think I
spent like an hour and a half on
Wednesday night and then a couple hours
last night messing with some more of the
mechanics and that's all I've spent on
this game so the fact is is that the
unit unit
community I should probably just do this
demo real quick because you can hear the
music in the background but I take
notice of my crab how he's moving he
looks very very professional he's a snow
crab so you got options you can move
this ain't there he's moving around so
if I go to start I'm loading another
scene so it's a two scene game and this
is just a free environment but I have
the ability to jump here's my crab over
here it's a little bit choppy because of
the screen sharing and everything going
on but you can see it looks healthy
looks looks pretty and you notice the
trees are blowing there's gonna be some
wind effects and everything now some of
the mechanics that I actually
specifically wrote just kind of
monkeying around with this is like when
I press Enter blocks are going to start
randomly falling from the sky so I'm
using prefabs and stuff like - is a
standard block I actually created the
block models to bit the standard block
model from blender when you start it up
but then I'm I create a prefab from it
but I created the fundamentals here with
the Ray caster where if I click on an
object and I hold it down it's going to
turn the object yellow and then I take
the color off and you can see each
prefab block has its own gravity and
stuff I can even drop it on that guy and
I can stack blocks and everything now
one of the things I wanted to do you can
see I got some weirdness with my
mechanics and everything but one of the
things I end up wanting I will want to
do is actually have the block stick
together very similar to the way
minecraft is because even though
minecraft defies gravity it's not very
realistic at least it's a decent user
experience if you guys have ever played
Minecraft it's pretty addictive and fun
but there's going to be a point to this
game and then here you see that I can
turn the music down in fact I probably
should have done that as I was showing
you guys this demo but the point is is
that there's so many free resources in
unity and you know if you do make some
cash on some of these free models and
setups you know get give some of that
back you know for goodness sakes like if
I ever made money on this which I don't
expect I think
gonna be a terrible game this is
something that I've actually been
brainstorming with my son who talks
about you know we actually planned this
game out a long time ago and this is
something that I'm just like slowly
getting to but I'm hoping you know the
next maybe a couple months that I'll
have something released it's gonna be
terrible but the goal is to actually get
this release to multiple different
platforms I know it's not gonna be
accepted the Steam or ps4 or anything
like that but I've been I plan on having
the mechanics be relatively simple and
then honestly one of the things I would
like to look at is the virtual reality
cuz I went out and I bought the psvr I
have this this oculus VR the VR I'd like
the headset for my phone or not the
full-fledged oculus but VR is something
that I'm very interested in I think it's
really cool and and the fact that unity
actually supports that I'm not sure what
kind of hoops you have to jump through
but the mechanics of this game are gonna
be so basic that I feel like if there's
gonna be anything I could ever port to
something like virtual reality it would
be something like this and I'll explain
more I think in the coming months one of
the things I'm meant to do is actually
this is working quite well I was gonna
lock the cursor in the center of the
screen but I actually like the ability
to to move the cursor around anyway all
right let me go ahead and stop the the
demo here I want to show you number one
the entire UI the user interface there
so you know dealing with you know
pressing escape and dealing with
controls like volume and things like
that that is a free download that you
can just download from Unity store so
it's completely free like it
I basically toggled a few things to
basically say that I have more than one
scene and in tell it to actually load
scene to really it's scene one so I can
show you so you can see here's the scene
so if I look at the actual
or the scene I look around you can see
it's got a first-person controller these
are all just built in unity things so I
didn't even have to do a lot of the
scripting for the first-person
controller I did end up adding some
scripting which actually uses the
first-person controller in order to look
at the objects and use a break caster to
figure out where they're pointing to and
things like that here is uh what I call
the sand script in order to this is a
prefab so this is actually what's taking
the prefab object and putting a box
Collider on it so it doesn't fall
through the map and all that stuff and
that's what I'm doing there I have this
this box script now this is actually
where it's taking random positions here
so this is all written in c-sharp guys
so I have you know my variables declared
up here at the top and this start method
runs in one time but here you can see
this is there's a click sound anytime
you click on an object the click sound
is actually rendered but you do that
through an audio source that you attach
to this this box script here and you can
see here I just basically I'm sitting
you know if I'm dragging then that means
it's gonna move that object wherever I'm
I'm dragging as soon as I release then
you know I'm Mouse up then I'm actually
telling it to drag here I got some
commented out code but the whole thing
is that it's very easy here I mean here
I'm setting the actual object color to
the yellow color which I define up here
so this code isn't like anything that
I'm trying to actually show you guys is
like impressive because this is
literally something that I'd spent a few
minutes with in fact the code that I
wrote to actually turn the blocks yellow
was from a different game that I just
poured it over here so I just poured it
over the entire code but here's the ray
caster and stuff that actually figures
out where you're pointing to and where
you know how I'm debugging out to the
screen and everything so you know for
the most part this this stuff is all
very basic but that's what's great about
unity is just a few hours and some basic
stuff man
you can really get a lot of stuff going
here so I'm using a game jam UI menu so
that's a free asset floovio here
actually I need to get rid of this but I
needed it I need to get some fluid and
like fluid dynamics and I feel like
that's gonna be relatively difficult
he's got all kinds animations in fact he
comes with like a character controller
so you could actually control the crab
if you wanted to that's not really in
the cards at the moment
so what else entered okay here's the
island so the island is all free
resources as well and oh yeah I got some
game sounds so here this game sounds
those were free and then the actual game
music there's always game music stuff so
really I'll probably if I do get this
thing closer to completion I'll probably
pay for for better music and more beachy
typing music which you could still buy
for like 5 or 10 bucks my goal is to
actually buy all the resources for this
game for less than $100
I'm not sure what it's gonna cost to
actually distribute it but once again I
fully intend the game to be absolutely
terrible it's gonna be very very basic
and it'll probably get bad reviews and
I'm not trying to be negative I'm just
trying to be real like I don't have a
ton of time I my goal is to get it out
there not to be a complete pile of crap
but I do it's just gonna be very very
basic you guys will see I'll make
another video in like a month probably
and show you guys where I'm at on it but
that's really it so definitely check out
unity minutes it's fun and yeah that's
about it guys so that's all I got
tonight man check it out let me know if
you all have questions and make sure you
subscribe and vote up the video and
share it with your family
I'm just getting another shirt but
anyway guys talk to you later good night
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on it
technologies of the here and now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're gonna need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding bootcamp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
