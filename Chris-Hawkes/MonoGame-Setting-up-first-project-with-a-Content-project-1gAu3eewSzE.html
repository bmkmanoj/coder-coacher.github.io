installed you'll be able to open up your
visual studio go to file your new
project and then if you have mono game
installed correctly you'll see the mono
game option here and what we want to do
is just go ahead and make a mono game
windows project pick a destination for
it we're gonna call this our game and
click OK now for every mono game project
you're gonna have the program file which
instantiates the game one object and
out-of-the-box game one object it comes
with a constructor here which is
initializing all these methods that it
runs out of the box and it wants you to
know that it's all there so in your load
content this is where you're actually
going to load any sounds images and
things that your game needs to run
unload content is really only necessary
for larger games that have a lot of
content and eventually need to kind of
dump some of those after it's done to
make it run a little bit better you have
an update method that actually runs
repeatedly over and over again for as
long as the game is running and it runs
based on the amount of frames per second
at the machine that's viewing the game
is able to handle so typically 30 60
whatever the graphics card can can
handle so update runs constantly you can
see out of the box that says it's
looking for a keyboard input for the
Escape key like specifically here and
it'll actually exit the game and exit
out of this update loop calling the exit
method and then you have the override
the draw method and the draw method is
used in conjunction with the updates
that are constantly being called on each
other so that if you have like some sort
of object or something in your draw
method it and the update is actually
updating that draw method so that being
said let's go ahead and look into how we
can add an image to our to our game
you'll see by default it creates a
sprite batch
instance variable from the sprite batch
class and we want to leave that in place
because the spray batch is actually how
we're going to draw things to the screen
we do need to actually load something
though so let's go ahead and do that now
we're going to add an image and what it
is it's a texture to the image we'll
just call this our first image and we
just want to instantiate it there now
that we have that instantiated we can go
ahead and reference that in our load
content but before we can even do that
we need to go ahead and add another
project to our mono game solution which
specifically handles content it's a long
story short basically the content that
you have in your game whether it's a
JPEG a PNG or some other sort of image
or sound like a WAV file or mp3 it needs
to be converted to an X and B object so
that mono game knows how to handle it so
in order for that to happen there's a
lot of work that needs to take place and
luckily that's all been written for us
and we just have to create that project
so with our solution highlighted not the
actual project but the solution make
sure you highlight the right one and go
ahead and right click and we're going to
say new project and in here we're going
to say mono game content project I'm
going to actually put the content
project inside of our game folder so I'm
going to put that inside there and we'll
just call this our game content
all right so now we're gonna have two
projects here we have our game and then
we have our game content now what's
funny though is that our game content
the project we just added also added an
additional project called our game
content content it just concatenates
content on name of whatever the project
is that you just created now all of our
content for like images sounds and
everything is going to go into this
content content project so let's go
ahead and create a folder there now we
will say like folder for sounds and then
another folder for images and we'll go
ahead and should I mean to do that
we'll go into images here and let's go
ahead and add an existing item I'll just
grab an image off of my desktop and I'll
grab a profile image I use around the
web so I have that added down and we
want to go ahead and load that in our
load content here so we'll see it and
say our image which we've already are
actually it's our first image equals
content content dot load and then we'll
in here we say what it is that we're
loading it's a texture 2d object and
then here we just give it the path to
where it can be found so it's images and
then the name of it is me profile you
don't have to give the image extension
so you don't want to do that especially
if you start updating but just don't do
that anyway so just give the images me
profile now in order for our game to
actually find the content we need to add
a reference to it so in our game under
references we want to go ahead and say
add reference and we're going to look at
our solution here so click on that and
then just check box the our game content
and click OK
so now there's a reference so if you
look at right click and you say should
be something like show dependencies
review project dependencies if we click
on that you'll actually see that our
content our game content and our game
content content are both well actually
just our game content is a dependency
but if you look at our game content then
our game content content would be a
dependency of that so you only need the
dependency to our game content hopefully
that's not confusing all right so now in
our game one we want to go ahead and use
this image that we've now loaded into
our game then we need to do that in our
draw method and if you notice I believe
I mentioned before but the spray patch
object that it created automatically for
us that actually draws all sprite
objects like all vector 2d images and
things to our game so we're going to use
that sprite batch thing
so what let's go ahead and say sprite
batch that begin and then spray batch
starts and and inside of those two
callings we want to go ahead and load
any sort of sprite batch things that we
want to draw so we'll say sprite batch
draw and we want to go ahead and draw
our image I think our first image and
then what we do is we say new vector2
and then here we wouldn't want to give
it our coordinates so you can see that
it can accept no parameters but it also
has an x and y and that actually is
going to say where it sits on the game
game screen so basically 200 pixels from
the top and like 200 from the left-hand
side for the y-coordinate
all right so now if I run the
application if everything goes well
you'll see my image okay so there's my
image inside the blue screen all right
so that is all I'm going to touch on
this this tutorial series here and in
the next video I do want to show you
guys how to actually export this so that
if you do want to go ahead and show the
world your video game I'll show you how
to do that in the next video because
there are some some issues that I've run
into that I've been able to figure out
and we're getting in that regard alright
guys thanks for watching and please
subscribe and bye
