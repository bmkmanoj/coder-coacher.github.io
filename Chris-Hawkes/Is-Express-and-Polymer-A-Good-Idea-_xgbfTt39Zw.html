coming man I love them here's and here's
a great one I actually like dude I
forgot how big you were giving tutorials
thanks so I think I'm over rated to be
honest with you but that's cool I did
that learning gift for beginners
tutorial i was i think that was ok so
that's cool you can go and get mine for
free and you know what to pay anything
like some of those other places so one
person said ok so a lot of people also
for anybody that's watching my beginner
Python series add Python your path by
going to the install process if not you
have to go and decide a sista light onto
your path you can look that up i have
videos on it but that has been a major
downside to that tutorial series is just
simply not clicking that one box and
making sure people are like do click
that box when you install python because
otherwise you're not going to know
anything about adding things to your
path and all that stuff was just
completely foreign to somebody who
hasn't done programming so this question
this question I was like about AC was
askin just as i was planning these
polymer an express should I continue so
in sm response to the web components
video so basically this video is going
to be about polymer and express Jas and
whether or not it's a good option so i
will tell you though the the entire
discussion these days in the corporate
world for the last two corporations that
I've worked for including really this
channel and a lot of you know the stuff
that i read about online whether it's
you know hacker news or something else
it seems like it's all about two things
when it comes to javascript libraries
react and then what you do with react
and then then there's this guy so I know
there's actually a third that a lot of
you guys are talking about as well but
like from a corporate perspective web
components you're looking at angular 2
so a lot of people are talking about
should you learn reactor angular 2 a lot
of people tell you that reactance is
already starting to win that they do a
fairly good job at a component based
system I've actually talked about the
fact that a lot of web components just
simply can't be isolated that you know
that
the business creeps into those
components or edge cases creep into
those components or just they get to a
certain level of complexity where
they're just trying to do too much and
you end up bringing in too much stuff do
you don't need that's like if you've
ever used a Babel project to compile
your es6 code one of the reasons why
Babel got broken up into multiple
projects is because people didn't want
to have to bring in the entire project
just to use a small piece of it so
babbles like hey we want to appeal to
everybody so we're going to go ahead and
just have all these different features
so you can use Babel polyfill and babble
this and babble that and bring them all
in and stuff like that if you want to
use Babel 2015 you're going to bring in
Babel preset environment maybe you want
to use the command line tool so you're
going to use battle that CLI or hyphen c
li but that's kind of the direction that
we've gone where it's like we've gone
like super like we used to be all
inclusive jquery type of saying that did
everything for you and then it was like
oh that's too much let's go ahead and
let's branch that out and and then now
we're using you know different
individual pieces so now like even
people are saying react is too big so
things like pre-act are coming out that
are much more slim down there's the new
dipping engine that react is using a lot
of people are talking about but I'm not
going to discuss in this video because
I'm going off on a tangent so you're
asking those specifically about Express
jas right expression yes is a framework
that's built on the nodejs technology
nodejs allows you to write JavaScript a
lot of people think it's JavaScript it's
really not as its technology it's code
that was written in C and C++ and it was
you know part of the chrome v8 engine it
allows you to write a JavaScript to
interact with that that you know the
code base that is written in C and C++
but a lot of that low-level stuff the
ability to write two files to read from
files and things like that javascript
doesn't have that ability because
javascript just runs in the browser so
note is this you know whole new
framework but it is very minimalistic
it's fast and express is built on top of
that expressed as has used all over
place from simple api's to larger more
complex applications by major companies
so you can't go wrong with express a lot
of people talk about the mean stack the
mean stack these days where it used to
be what the hell did they used to call
them when it was like pearl and stuff on
it honestly I just it fails me tonight
I'll remember play MongoDB express
angularjs and note note and express they
kind of deserve a mention in the same
breath really and then MongoDB is
obviously or no sequel database um I
prefer sequel databases whether it's my
seat or postgres most of my sites these
days are using posts postgres and I
still have some my stupid sites out now
the thing about polymer though is I just
haven't heard too much about it like a
lot of people mentioned that you know
Google sponsors the angular project and
why doesn't you know physically
angularjs always anti-google but like
Google doesn't exclusively use angularjs
a lot of their stuff is still written in
house although I do believe that that
they are using a fairly decent amount of
it and some of their you guys here but
here's a polymer I just I just haven't
heard a ton about this and I just might
not even be the right project so here's
polymer the polymer was originally
announced like years ago at a Google
developer conference and now we have
polymer 2 point 0 last time I was
dabbling in polymer like it was a it was
a giant beast that had to have all kinds
of polyfill and stuff to support the
shadow Dom I think this one has
potential i really do I think you know
find it intriguing the fact that Google
backs it is is somewhat reassuring
although Google does abandoned projects
just as much as Microsoft or any of
these other companies out there that
that disband failed projects so
definitely you can do no wrong with
expressed is really you can't do any
wrong with a polymer project I think
most corporations are using angular 2 or
react and that brings up a good point
with typescript so
I've wanted to learn type script in 2017
we're still fairly early into the year
but typescript is on the developer
reviews or the developer survey that
stack overflow did time script was one
of the most popular languages out there
it's written by some of the same people
that are responsible for the c-sharp
programming language which really is a
fantastic language so typescript offers
a lot of promise the problem is is that
typescript is not quite JavaScript
although you can write JavaScript with
it and it's very similar to JavaScript
not quite there lacks some of the
features that babbles going to be a
little bit quicker to get out but then
again I think there's a little bit more
sanity that typescript could offer over
something like babbles so if you're a
former csharp Deb and you're trying to
get into the modern JavaScript world and
typescript is probably very you know
very appealing to you and I think that's
one of the best things that has going
forward now and on the same token I also
think it's a detriment to angular 2
because angular 2 now people have to
decide do I want to use Babel and yes
six and es7 would sink in a waiter who I
want to use typescript and wait for them
to to you know implement some of these
features and can they do it fast of a
job as the open source community because
typically Microsoft has done a fairly
poor job keeping up with some of the
latest standards when it comes to things
like visual studio and trying to write
you know jsx code of Visual Studio I
couldn't do it in 2015 and you know
they're fairly slow at adapting to that
although one of the best tools out there
is Visual Studio code in fact even for
the Unity engine that I'm working on a
game in unity which is C sharp I'm
actually writing the code in Visual
Studio code which is a completely free
and open-source developer that is
written by Microsoft and it has like all
kinds of packages for all kinds of stuff
so if I'm right in Python these days
like I'm writing it in Visual Studio
code and even if I'm writing C sharp and
unity and I need to step through my
unity game for a game code and
everything i'm using i'm using a visual
studio code as well for that alright
guys so I'm and just to let you guys
know also for an email newbies out there
Visual Studio code is not the same thing
as visual studio there are two separate
projects the Visual Studio code is a is
considered an integrated development
environment and has a lot of features
and everything a month on the right-hand
side you can see that it's got support
for C sharp Python you can develop and
chrome like source Maps there's a ton of
show you p deal with Visual Studio code
alright guys make sure you check out my
sponsor I have two sponsors now they
help pay the bills as Deb mountain
coding boot camp has been sponsoring
this content for almost a year now so
those guys are have been great to me
they're easy to work with and they come
easy for you guys to work with as well
they have 12 and 16 week courses they
focus on jQuery JavaScript es6 they're
going to be doing a lot of stuff with
angular and react and you actually work
on site with real developers that are
helping you through the project you're
going to be checking in code to a
version control system using things like
github and get and make sure you guys
check them out there a little bit
expensive but they do have a good track
record for getting people in the door as
a junior level developer and then
there's also my other sponsor which is
site 123 so if you're trying to get any
sort of portfolio or website out there
with minimal hassle than site 123 is an
option that you should check out because
for a very limited fee you can get
things like basic e-commerce site up or
restaurant site or even just a blog or
professional portfolio site saying a
your programmer and you can do that on
their platform very quickly literally in
a matter of hours it really maybe even
minutes as opposed to spending days
trying to set up your own server so
those are my two sponsors for more
information for both of those guys make
sure you check the description
description of tab below or tab box
whatever underneath this video and
the two links there are there for the
companies to make sure you guys check
them out they do help me out as well all
right guys you have a good day take care
