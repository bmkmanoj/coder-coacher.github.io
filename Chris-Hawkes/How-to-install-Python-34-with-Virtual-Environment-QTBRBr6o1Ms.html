Django programming with the latest
version of Python Python 33.4 I think it
is just go to Google we're gonna go to
Python we're gonna get the latest and
there's actually a little bit risky
because typically a lot of the libraries
and things that Django might be using
might not work with the latest Python
but if you want to be cutting-edge now
this is definitely the way to go so
we're gonna grab the latest one which is
just released in May 3 4 2 and let's go
ahead and once that's downloaded it will
have an installer so just going to
install it on your machine I'm using
Windows as far as development is
concerned I'm gonna be using Visual
Studio but you can use whatever editor
you want and I use the latest Visual
Studio it's a little unorthodox for
Python development but you know there
are free editors out there so you can
use whatever you want
I saw be installing Python 3 for three
point four point two
all right once that's done we now have a
working copy of Python 3 on our system
let's go ahead and open up a command
prompt now one of the things on my
machine here is I have Python 2 7
installed and that's actually already
added to my command line so if I type
Python into the command prompt you can
see that it's finding 2 7 8 so I need to
actually fix that all right so what you
want to do if you're in Windows 8 like I
am now you can right click on the
windows icon there's actually Windows
8.1 you go to your control panel and
your system click on system again over
on your left you'll see advanced system
settings and click on that click
environment variables go to your path
and we're going to edit that and on the
end make sure there's no spaces put a
semicolon and we need to figure out
where we installed Python 3 so let's go
ahead and look at that real quick and
you can see I have a Python 27 in python
34 and you can see python 34 is actually
the same name python so i actually want
to change the Exe of it and I'll just
call this python 3 4 and then over here
I'm going to add the path variable it's
just like I have with python 2 7 so that
 is
I'm just gonna copy all this so that's
Python issue 7 it's gonna be um Python 3
for one second so with you just straight
C colon forward slash Python 3 4 and
then we'll do a Python 3 4 and just go
ahead and select ok ok exit out of that
let's go and try to open up the command
prompt again when I say Python 3 4 you
can see that it now finds Python inside
the 3 4 directory because there's no 3 4
and the to 7 directory if I just did
Python once I get neck hurts if
I just did Python they would find the 2
7 8 version so anytime I want to do any
development with Python 2 3 I'm sorry
3.0 series I'm just gonna do Python 34
and it'll work so alright now that we've
done that let's go over to Google and
we're gonna put in this link here and
this guy's a goddamn genius he's put
together a lot of Python libraries here
for all the different Python versions
for most of the major libraries out
there so this thing is just a treasure
trove of libraries that you're going to
need to do development with we're
looking for virtual environment it's
that it's an important thing to have any
time you do python development so you
can create different python environments
because whenever you have libraries that
you're using some of those libraries
only work with certain versions of
Python or they have to be hacked up to
work with a particular application in
your building so you want to make sure
you can find that environment for
whatever sort of application that it is
that you're building instead of just
adding all these libraries to your
Python path and creating a big mess that
doesn't work with everything so that's
the purpose behind virginal environment
I have the amd64 installed so I'm going
to do this one
so I'll just run through and it'll
install correctly if it doesn't install
it means you didn't you don't have
Python 3 for the right one selected all
right let's go to our C Drive here I'm
going to put inside my projects
directory a folder that pertains to this
tutorial series and we're just going to
call this thing Python 3 4 tutorial ok
and let's go back and open up a command
prompt and let's go into that folder
that we just created what I call
that
all right there we go all right guys now
in order to use a Python and virtual
environment that we just installed
windows you have to do a workaround
because it's typical Microsoft garbage
but what we're going to do is we have to
use the PI V and V PI event I can't even
pronounce that we have to use that
library though in order to create the
virtual environment so in order to do
that since we've already added the
Python to our path we can type Python 34
and that'll be fine so that windows
knows where to find Python 34 then we
have to give it the path to where I can
find the virtual environment that we
installed so we're gonna do C colon
forward slash Python 34 forward slash
tools forward slash scripts and then
we're gonna forward slash again py ve
and V that's the actual command for a
virtual environment and then all we got
to do is simply give the name of our
virtual environment so I'm always I
always do a real bad job I'm gonna come
up with a name to a virtual environment
and really names are failing me right
now you know what we're gonna go with
like a Greek name Hercules that
didn't work one second I'm not sure why
that didn't work one second
and it's a Python is being found I could
try it with a forward slash can't open
the file oh I'm a dumbass it's because I
have a CD there I know there's something
stupid all right
it's the CD it's supposed to just be see
you guys probably saw that all right and
that will work this will take just a few
seconds here to set up because what
virtual environments doing it's actually
going to install something called pip
which will allow you to easily install
other libraries just by doing it pip
command so it's going to take a look at
that now we directory an you can see
Hercules is there if we CD into that and
we look at what we got we got on this
lib going to that site packages T space
site packages and then you can see in
here that I installed pip like I was
telling you about also easy to install
those are two popular methods of
installing libraries and right now we
need to go ahead and enter into that
environment I'll go back to the command
here we're gonna go CD space scripts and
directory into that and then you just
have to say activate the HD I believe
alright and now after you do that you
can see that it has over here on the
left hand side this Hercules it means
that you're actually in your virtual
environment now so anything that you'd
like if you do a pip install
Pippa's gonna try to install something I
installed I tried to install something
that I knew was wasn't going to be there
but you can see that pip was using and
it was using the pip from the virtual
environment that we just created all
right guys well that's what we're gonna
cut this video short just under 10
minutes and that's how you install
Python 3 for add it to your Windows path
also explains that you can use multiple
versions of Python at the same time how
to install a virtual environment and
then how to activate a virtual
environment all right guys talk to you
later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
