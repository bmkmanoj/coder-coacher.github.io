been asked a few times about the h-1b
program and the United States and for
those who don't know there's a program
that the US federal government has in
order to try to bring in overseas talent
and typically that talent I mean it can
be in all kinds of different industries
but there are a lot of h-1b visas that
are used within the tech industry so
Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg has
always been a proponent to extent expand
the h-1b visa program because they feel
restricted with the amount of overseas
talent they can bring in to the United
States to help their business cause and
a lot of people are against it though in
the United States and part of that
reason is because there's incidents that
occur where large IT consulting firms
like Infosys and a few others they come
in and they bring in a lot of talent
specifically from India and the talented
they end up bringing in is usually the
argument anyway is that it's at a
cheaper rate than what an American
worker would have to you know be paid in
order to do the same job now it's not
even just about that though there's
actually a few issues with the h-1b
program the way it currently is right
now the abuse is allowed by means of
companies that try to fill positions
that they say that they can't fill in
order to be able to bring in somebody
from overseas that they can pay less
money but it's not even necessarily just
the fact of the matter that they can be
paid less money than a US tech worker
there's also the fact that basically the
the h-1b visa worker can almost be
considered a a indentured servant to the
company that they work for because their
status their legal status in the United
States is tied to their employment and
if they end up losing their job for
whatever reason then they and they have
to find another corporate sponsor that
will sponsor their visa otherwise they
can be you know considered to be in the
United States illegally and nobody ever
really wants that you know if you can
prove
that but that is uh you know that is the
the primary you know gist of the h-1b
program and some of the problems so a
lot of the US workers they complain
because incidents like what happened
last year when Disney which is a very
profitable company I mean these Disney
is not a small company whatsoever you're
talking about a company that made over
eight billion dollars in profit and one
single year in 2015 they ended up laying
off roughly 250 tech workers in orlando
florida which isn't really considered an
IT hub down there so a lot of these
workers were later on and then in late
stages of their career and they were
very concerned they wouldn't be able to
find other jobs and it Disney ended up
laying them off because they hired an
Indian contracting company or consulting
company that ended up bringing in a lot
of h-1b workers to actually replace the
Americans and what's even more
humiliating than that is that they ended
up having to train the people that were
coming in to replace them so the reason
why this is in the news of late is
because the president that is going to
be going in the office here in the next
few months in the United States is
Donald Trump and he's elected or
nominated for attorney general a guy
that is that has been a pretty big
proponent or not proponent but a
opponent like he's proposed to the h-1b
program saying that it's widely abused
and in that there's going to be some
sort of hardline approach in order to
try to limit the amount of h-1b workers
that are coming into the United States
so already it's sending alarms
throughout India like the CEO of infosys
has already stated that he's concerned
what it's going to do to their corporate
profits and things and it's already
started tanking really since Trump got
got elected and in the United States I
mean to be honest I'm in the tech
industry and I have concerns both ways
now number one I know that the h-1b
system is being abused by companies
there's just there's no question about
it but on the other hand it does end up
helping out companies in the sense that
they can bring in
you know very smart talent in a lot of
cases and they can do it for cheaper
than your typical American workers so it
does help company's bottom line and it
allows them to spend more money on maybe
research and development and just you
know being able to lower their
operational costs now at the same time
it sucks because American workers
including myself I could end up you know
being out of a job and not being able to
find a job because I'm competing with a
bunch of overseas talent or maybe I have
to take a twenty-thousand-dollar pay pay
cut in order to be able to you know to
compete with with overseas talent so
there are pros and cons in that sense um
but one of the things I worry about
whenever you have a policy of what is
considered to be like you know
nationalism or protectionism where
you're protecting American companies by
imposing tariffs like I mean Donald
Trump's talked about imposing tariffs on
Chinese imports if you've ever done any
shopping in the United States you
realize like almost everything we
purchase it's probably this way around
the world but at least in the United
States I know that almost everything you
purchase you look at it and it's been
made in China it doesn't matter if it's
electronics or you know a lot of cases
clothing Auto Parts I mean it's it's
almost all made in China it seems like
but he's proposed like tariffs where
they end up making china basically have
to pay more money in order to export
their goods to the United States but
those things typically drive up the
costs for all consumers so everybody is
going to feel the pinch when something
like that happens now it might end up
bringing more American jobs back over
here or manufacturing jobs but in most
cases probably not it's probably just
going to raise the prices of everything
I don't know for one way or another I'm
not an economist or anything but that's
just my opinion it it really it's an
uneducated opinion as far as you know
what I think's I haven't done a whole
lot of research it just seems like you
know with the United States I mean
you're not going to be able to compete
with the country like China on
manufacturing they have like it just
seems like you're not going to compete
already the wages are just too expensive
in the United States there's many laws
and things like that that and
bureaucratic red tape that you have to
go a jump through in order to set up
factories and power plants and things
like that so I'm not really sure it's
going to have the effect that some
people think it's going to have now
maybe I
I could be wrong I don't know but one of
the things that is concerning about
something like that so your Facebook
Zuckerberg already Jeff Bezos from
amazon genie or Jenny from IBM and a few
other companies they've already tried to
reach out to Donald Trump even though
none of them actually supported Donald
Trump and his presidency now that he's
been elected they want to you know reach
out to him and I'm pretty sure that some
of that reaching out has to do with them
asking to not you cut back on the h-1b
program because that's going to affect
all companies like 80 HP IBM amazon it's
going to affect all those those
companies now I could end up bringing
you no more job opportunities to
American workers but on the flip side
something that people don't really seem
to be talking about is if you end up
imposing all these restrictions on
companies like Facebook or Amazon who's
to say that you know they're not going
to set up shop and start operating you
know more of their development crews
outside of you know Canada or our inside
of Canada or the UK or or wherever they
may not be you know given the same
restrictions so I think there's a fine
hoopty that you have to jump through in
order to make sure that that you do
things in a way that number one isn't
going to you know have these negative
consequences that may not be foreseen a
lot of people nest you know they just
think that if we just you kill the h-1b
program or cut it back significantly
that all of a sudden prices our salaries
will go up and not and job opportunities
will go up that may happen in the short
term but once again a company started
packing up and going overseas there's
not going to be anything in a free
market capitalist society like the
United States that's going to prevent
them from being able to do that and the
more Prevention's that you try to do
that the more you start you know
involving yourself with you know the
free market and it's just you know
that's typically not the way you know
capitalist societies have operated so I
don't know but it's definitely strange
times yesterday I was reading an article
work then they were saying in the united
states that the average student loan
debt is now or not the average student
loan but the overall student loan debt
in the united states has surpassed 1.3
trillion so there is one point
three trillion dollars of United States
Capitol and wealth that is tied up and
college loans and we've talked about on
this channel quite a bit but it sucks
when number one the college system in
the United States is completely broken
because I've said before that there are
great colleges out there like you know
the Stanford's and mi tease of the world
and they're always going to have you
know they're going to provide great
opportunity they're going to be very
expensive and only the truly elite or
going to be able to go to those types of
schools but there's a lot of opportunity
for people that aren't going to be or
that don't really have that same you
know set of fortune that they can afford
that that type of thing so you know
there needs to be more trade schools
there's more boot camps that we seize
springing up including my sponsor Deb
mountain coding boot camp out of provo
utah in dallas who has really good
reviews from everything I've read and
everything so you guys should check them
out but you're seeing those spring
spring up to try to fill this void
because in computer science if you go
for a traditional computer science
degree from maybe a you know average
run-of-the-mill university you're going
to pay forty to sixty thousand dollars
per four-year degree and it's going to
take you a long time you're going to be
paying you know maybe four to nine
percent interest on that loan i mean i'm
not sure what exactly what your interest
rate would be but you know you're paying
that loan over a period of time so it's
hard for you to be able to compete with
other countries that have cheaper
education especially when we bring up
the h-1b thing so if you're bringing in
h-1b workers that have a master's degree
from universities and in ethiopia or in
India or in Europe and those
universities cost a fraction of the
amount of the United States University
and then it already puts American
citizens at a disadvantage so there's
really just there's really no easy
answer but I think it's definitely a
problem the education system in the
United States and I've said this for a
while but I was going to school for my
two year business administration degree
which I'm still trying to finish up so I
didn't even go to computer go to a
computer science school but I'm
fortunate I'm lucky I was able to get my
foot in the door I don't know how many
companies would give me a shot you know
if any companies or interest i've had
some people reach out but you know there
hasn't been likened people knocking down
my door like saying hey chris from work
force
and I think in some of those cases you
know they have looked at the fact that I
don't have a degree and they're not
interested so that you know the same
things that are plaguing you guys that
don't have degrees are plaguing me as
well so the end of the thing is though
is that we know that something needs to
change so we're seeing boot camp start
to arise but even boot camps seem to be
kind of expensive for you know a few
months worth of schooling but granted at
least it's not as expensive as a college
degree and you don't have all these
fluffer courses that you know let's be
honest you're going to end up learning
it and then you end up forgetting it and
if you truly had an interest in you know
Southern literature in the United States
and you would pick up a book or you
would read a website I have a major
interest in American history of World
War two history you know decent amount
of interest in like World War one but I
knew I read on those books so I can
almost be considered a history buff with
all the the amount of time that I've
read about people like you know Custer
in the United States or the American
Civil War and World War two and
everything and but I do that on my own
time there's going to be people in a
traditional four-year university that
have no interest in history whatsoever
that are going to be forced to learn
about those things and they just truly
aren't passionate about it I don't know
that it necessarily makes them a better
person to have to learn something
they're not passionate about you know it
makes you obviously have to put up with
you know with with stuff that you don't
want to do but you know life will teach
you those lessons without having to
spend sixty thousand dollars in a
four-year university so obviously
something needs to happen in the United
States to lower education costs we've
seen you know I've created this site
hipster cocom I've done my YouTube
tutorials other people are doing YouTube
tutorials people have asked me like you
know do I have qualifications to teach I
mean I'm not claiming to be some sort of
qualified teacher I'm actually teaching
courses and it just so happens that some
of those courses people are saying are
better than the stuff that they've heard
that they've heard from the
professionals and even companies like
pluralsight pack publishing and Linda
have actually talked to me about you
know having an interest in and doing
tutorials and things for them but I
don't I didn't need to go and have a
computer science degree or even be able
to
you know get a teaching degree now if I
was teaching the nation's youth and I
which may be charging for some of that
education possibly you know maybe I need
to have some sort of certification there
you know there's definitely I do I
obviously know that that teachers are
underrated that they need to have
degrees and in order to teach our you
know your young children elementary
school teachers high school teachers
middle school teachers I'm not saying
that I could do that without a degree at
not saying that for a second but you
know if I'm teaching somebody my hobby
there's no reason why if I have a
telescope that I have to be some sort of
you know certified astronomer to give my
opinion on the stars and things like
that and and the fact of the matter is
is that there's a lot to be learned from
people that are giving out information
for free people like me who have given
up python and django information that
I've learned and the time and the time
that I've spent to do that they probably
saved a pretty considerable amount of
time had they had you know gone down the
same path that I had to go down when I
went down it but I've also learned from
people before me too so it's just it's
kind of like it's just a doll like flows
around up and down around around like a
happy gilmore quote from that crazy guy
anyway so those are my thoughts Amanda
the h-1b it's going to have pros and
cons if we start cutting back on it
especially significantly in addition
there are going to be some good 24
probably india i would imagine a lot of
a lot of families and citizens from
india probably don't like the fact that
a lot of their brightest talent or some
of their brightest talent anyway is in
the united states or in the UK and and
you know advancing those countries which
is what the united states in the UK they
want they want this near the smartest
talent every country wants the smartest
home to come in but um you know that
smart talent could also help out their
own country so i would imagine that it's
not all bad for india i mean their
economy might hurt in the short term but
it could also have good implications for
them in the long term
you know should they be able to retain
some of their talent that's in that's
leaving their country to go and work in
other countries so I'm curious what you
guys think on this latest news it
definitely seems like there's going to
be some sort of a cut back on the h-1b
visa program in the United States and
what impact that has on the world or in
the United States is completely unclear
to me I can't say for sure that I feel
confident one way or another that it's
going to be beneficial or hurtful anyway
guys thanks for watching have a good
night bye hey guys so a lot of you asked
me how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12 week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here and now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in the suevi course it's geared

on things like jQuery nodejs react
angular how to use github so a lot of
the things that you're going to need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
