I just actually installed a graphics
card tonight so you know what they say
if you put it all together and it didn't
catch on fire and then you must have
done a good job actually nobody says
that except for me if you know the story
of what happened last time I try to do a
graphics card I install the new power
supply unit which I had to do the same
thing tonight and but the last time I
did it was a few years ago and I
completely blew away of my hard drive
and damn near caught the computer on
fire in fact it started smoking and you
could smell burning plastic and stuff in
it and that didn't go out there and go
over very well
one of the things I don't want to
mention you guys is Bill Watterson the
creator of Calvin and Hobbes is probably
one of the one of my idols as a child so
when I was growing up like Calvin and
Hobbes I think you know it might have
had something to do with my my childhood
really but for some reason like Calvin
and Hobbes seem so real to me and it
wasn't just me in fact a lot of people
that watch that strip actually had the
same connection to those characters and
there's an entire generation that has
never seen him in the newspaper and if
you guys know Calvin Hobbes to create or
build Watterson he only did it for ten
years so from like 1986 to 1996 that's
all he did it and and he had the
opportunity to market his products and
if Calvin Hobbes could have been stuffed
animals and t-shirts and everything else
like if you look at Snoopy characters I
mean there's the Met Life Insurance
Company has Snoopy as their logo you
know they're everywhere you go to theme
parks and and you see Charlie Brown and
all that stuff so you see toys and
everything Bill Watterson had the
opportunity to do that with Calvin nobs
here but he chose not to he actually
turned out some of the estimates I read
or watched and documentary when it's
like something like two or three hundred
million dollars that this guy could have
put in his own pocket based on Calvin
and Hobbes and I mean this was so
popular they made a US postal stamp of
his character so a lot of people say it
was the last true great comic because a
lot like American culture and I don't
even know if it's American or not they
comics do play a big part I think in
American culture going back to
to 50s and 60s and you know when you
look at like Charlie Brown and Garfield
and things like that you know it's a big
part of American yeah I say American
culture it might be worldwide or may be
part of you guy I don't really know but
all I know is growing up here in America
and there's always been a a lot of comic
book characters that are beloved by by
people McElveen Hobbes was special to me
I thought because um you know just you
know simple artwork and stuff like that
I mean the fact that his his toy comes
to life and only he can talk to him and
Hobbes is only real to Calvin and
everybody else is just a stuffed animal
and you know as a child like I actually
loved that I I couldn't get enough of it
really so watched it over and over and
over again but one of the things that he
did an interview the creator of Calvin
Hobbes like 20 years after he stopped
doing this strip in fact when this book
was released and I'm he had he said
something interesting in here which I
thought was was really really
interesting because a lot of us
including myself like when I was trying
to become a program riot applied to
different positions on multiple
occasions and got turned down several
times and the last time I got turned
down it was such an embarrassment that I
really when I was walking when I walked
out of there and you know walk back over
to my day job I realized you know I
needed to give it up I mean that was
basically my mindset like it was never
going to work I'm not gonna be a
programmer yeah this stuff was a pipe
dream and these people pretty much told
me so and you know that was a terrible
feeling and but it didn't last very long
in fact I don't remember the exact time
frame that that lasted but it was a true
embarrassment and I actually think
reflecting upon it now that it may have
been really the kick in the butt to to
really try harder you know what I mean
like to because that was the one
defining moment where it was like dude
you're not good enough like what are you
doing I mean why are you even here why
are you wasting our time and then you
know that but that was a huge incentive
for me to get out there and not just get
out there but just you know basically
not not have to to worry about failure
anymore because I for me like I couldn't
have failed any worse
That moment when I went for that Android
programming job and was basically
embarrassed walking out of there so that
was probably that was that was a very
terrible time but one of the things he's
bill Waterson says here in this
interview he says because the person
asked him the question she says well
it's a great example of failure turning
into spectacular success but it's hard
sometimes to see that while you're
involved in failure so Bill Watterson
says true although there were a number
of years out in the wilderness my
failure was probably one of the best
things that ever happened to me although
i don't recommend the humiliation and
solvency so much but if my experience at
the post hadn't been so catastrophic I
don't think I would have started over
I'd have limped along doing weak
editorial cartoons it would have never
gotten to what I was good at I didn't
want to throw all that time throw away
all that time and effort but sometimes
you can't move forward without going
back to the beginning to get your
bearings again so I mean to me I feel
like that that was really what I did
because when I left that Java draw a job
and I was like you know what job is not
my thing I mean I tried to jump in the
Java to get this job as an Android
developer my my passion was UI UX I mean
it was a JavaScript and front page web
design along with the writing content
and then being able to maintain a stack
using Python and Django and and
ultimately I went back to that and it
wasn't until like eight months later
that I reached out to that hiring
manager that eventually got me into IT
that that I was able to say hey look at
all this stuff that I've done I was
talking about the Perl scripts that I
had created and some of the Python
stacks and everything I was doing in
fact one of the blog's that I had at the
time it was actually new post which
isn't on any more but that blog was
getting a pretty significant amount of
traffic to around August 2012 or so but
the point is like I I kind of I think
that's what ended up happening to me I
was completely embarrassed and I went
back to square one I went back to
reevaluating like what is it that I'm
trying to do do I really think that I'm
gonna be a programmer is this the moment
that I give up and I go back to my real
life or do is this the moment where I
get my
 together and really you know push
harder and and you know just just don't
give up you know so I know that a lot of
you guys are fighting with the same
thing and many of you guys are younger
and going to school and that's great and
I think CNF school is definitely the
best route to go because you probably
don't want to go the same route that
some of you know some of some of us have
gone through I think in this field
trying to trying to get into the
industry and I think sometimes i
overstate you know i may overstate you
know that what happened to me like that
it you know some needle-in-a-haystack
type opportunity or something but it
really wasn't I'm sure that there's a
you know thousands upon thousands of
cases similar to myself but I think you
know eventually I will have revealed
more about you know my history of my
back story but I had some major lows in
my life like some major major lows and I
was never fed with a silver spoon
growing up or anything like that so
nobody's ever given me anything as far
as as far as I'm aware I've had to earn
every bit of it and I think sometimes
people don't really have that same you
know that streetwise backstory that I do
but you know I don't know I mean so the
point is though guys is you don't want
to give up you know take a few steps
back if you need to try to figure out
where it is where you're going and you
know but but just don't give up this
number one thing all right guys have a
good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
