video and what I'm making this video
about is in response to a Wall Street
Journal report that just came out today
and the entire gist of the the article
is that Silicon Valley employers from
San Francisco where a lot of you know a
lot of these hot tech startups are
founded or actually requiring that
almost all of their developers that
they're hiring have college degrees so
this is obviously a pretty big topic of
conversation on my channel because some
people have actually seen that I don't
actually have a computer science degree
I know a lot of people that don't I
think if you ask a lot of programmers in
this industry that they'll know a lot of
people that don't have degrees and maybe
we're not the best example maybe we're
not you know the smartest programmers
out there we're not solving the most
complex problems that we have in the IT
field although I think a lot of people
would agree that we do you know a damn
fine job at what we do and that said you
know I don't know that we're the best
type of example going into the future as
to you know what somebody should do
should they go to college or should they
not go to college according to this wall
street journal article it was based off
of a burning glass technologies company
they did like a labor market analysis
and they searched apparently 1.6 million
ads for software developers throughout
the entire United States and they found
that ninety-five percent of all the jobs
listed was asking for a degree so in
many cases like a bachelor's degree or a
master's degree but I've been saying it
for a long time when you look at you
know the job postings all you got to do
is look and you'll see that a lot of
these jobs are asking for a degree I
have recruiters and things that reach
out to me all the time main out of
curiosity I asked them whether or not
the degree is required and in many cases
the recruiters you know they'll tell you
whatever you know they think you want to
hear I'm sure some of them do that some
of them probably don't but many will say
that you know it's not an absolute
requirement that they do have that
degree I think most
companies are willing to flex on that so
really the fact that ninety-five percent
of all the jobs out there or asking for
a degree for some reason that just feels
hi to me I don't feel like that is an
accurate number though although
according to Wall Street Journal and
this burning glass technologies that is
a number and they felt good enough
writing about it one of the quickest
things that comes to mind with an
article like this and I'll link to the
article in the video but one of the
things that comes to mind on something
like this is that they're only taking
into account and what a company is
asking for and we've talked about this
in the past but on the company's ask for
the world when they're looking for job
applicants so in most cases you know
this is a very difficult industry of
being so they want to have smart people
college kind of vets people there's a
vetting process that you know when you
go to college of that you're committed
that you went through all you know the
four-year program and that you took all
these courses and I think it says a lot
about your character and your driving in
many cases but it doesn't necessarily
mean that you can program so just
because you have a degree doesn't mean
you're a good programmer there's plenty
of programmers out there that have
degrees that are terrible that only did
it because you know they wanted to make
money in this industry and then there's
people that that have gone and they've
had this passion since they were younger
and they're excellent and they're
they're way better than what most people
would ever hope to be so there's always
this so I you know there's always both
scenarios so the fact of the matter is
that this article is asking for a degree
well that makes sense i mean like i said
it's a tough industry so when these jobs
are posted from what I understand from
talking and listening to some of these
these hiring associates and HR and
everything they're getting a ton of
applicants for every single job and from
what we're told there's not enough
qualified candidates to be able to fill
these positions many will tell you that
this actually isn't the case at all that
sometimes companies are actually posting
for jobs that don't
necessarily exist in fact I've actually
seen this firsthand with a company in
Alexandria and I'm not going to mention
them but they are a relatively big
company and they posted a job and then
long story but basically you know that
that is a fact that companies are
posting positions that aren't even
available at the current moment and in
addition to that some companies are
gaming the h-1b system where they're
posting all kinds of crazy requirements
from you know the applicant that they're
looking for in order to game the system
enough to be able to bring in cheaper
labor from abroad from overseas and you
know they can do that and obviously you
know they can save a lot of money doing
that so I think you know there's there's
really three things that play that you
know there's those are three
possibilities with some of these
positions that are listing these
requirements I think it would be foolish
for any sort of company to turn down
developers that have you know been doing
this for five or ten years when you know
because at that point if you've been in
the IT industry for five or ten years I
mean really what is the degree offering
over you know that experience you know
the degree is obviously important for
somebody who doesn't have a degree I
wish I had I had one I wish I was you
know really smart when it comes to
complex mathematics and physics but I'm
not and and I never will be and I guess
I'm going to be okay with that but you
know from for the most part you know
some of the cutting edge work that's
being done in Silicon Valley probably
does require some of the greatest minds
and physics and mathematics but for
ninety percent of the other you know
positions out there it doesn't require
some of these you know these advanced
degrees you know from MIT and and the oh
thank goodness because if that were the
case I mean I don't know there's enough
smart people in the world that would be
able to fill that void because we
obviously have millions of jobs in this
industry so really my point I think
behind this video is that I'm concerned
that some people consider dropping out
because they've see
the success of certain people that are
able to get a job in the industry
without having the degree but then
there's plenty of horror stories of
people that have you know either had the
degree or didn't have the degree or lost
their job and they're trying to find a
new job and you know they're not being
treated you know with you know I guess
their respect is are there their
experience isn't gaining the respect
that they thought that they would get in
the market so I think you know that is
concerning that that people might want
to throw away their opportunity at
getting a degree because they think that
the degree is not going to help them
that much so there's also something to
be said for the fact that if you have
that degree in once you're in the
industry I mean you're always going to
be like rest assured that you can always
find another job so I think that there
are you know people like myself and
other people that are self-taught that
you know you may run into a situation
where you feel like you know if you had
to hit their open job market that you
might not have this success a year that
you're hoping for because you don't have
the degree so I don't think anybody
wants that to be held against them but
then there's also cons to the degree I
mean just because you're going to a
computer science school doesn't
necessarily mean that you're learning
how to be an enterprise programmer in
the real world it also means that you're
spending four years when you could be
spending four years of getting real
experience and then there's also the
fact that some colleges now are well you
know over a hundred thousand two hundred
thousand dollars depending on where you
go so one thing I also seem to recognize
and I wonder if you guys recognize I
recognize this as well but it almost
seems like the Silicon Valley world is
different from everywhere else like I
mean in Silicon Valley to me it almost
resembles like an in like a humongous
like circle jerk and and if you guys
don't know what that is you might wanna
look that up but basically it's
everybody stroking each other's egos and
stuff like that and it's just kind of
sickening I think and I really don't
have any desire to be to be part of that
so I just like the code I like to solve
problems I'd like to I'd like to look at
things in a business sense like how can
I use this technology to make money how
can i how can I use this to be better at
what I do or
you know to me I look at all these these
things and that's just kind of the way
my mind works and I don't know it just
seems like that's not really the same
mentality of some of these silicon
valley hipsters I guess that I called
him and that may be a bad term for them
but yeah circle jerk just kind of
reminds and I really just I think that
hits the nail right on the head so is
one of the largest Silicon Valley
employers like Google going to hire a
bunch of Stanford grads and MIT grads of
course they are why wouldn't they do we
all have to be MIT grads or go to
Berkeley in order to get an IT position
no but do we need those advanced degrees
in order to probably right maybe the
next physics engine that you know starts
being adopted by the Android operating
system or that you know really takes
machine learning to the next level maybe
maybe not I don't know I'm not saying
that I'm ever going to be in that
category but I don't know i guess if
that is your goal if that's your
company's ambition and things like that
then you would need some of those
advanced degrees one other thing I'll no
i'll point out that I've that I've also
heard is that some companies actually
don't want graduates from some of these
top name schools like you know Princeton
and like I said Berkeley or Carnegie
Mellon oh I mean because what they're
worried about is that there's like an
expensive process for companies to be
able to onboard new employees and you
know train them and you know the company
ways and the company code line and stuff
and some of these kids that have these
advanced degrees they're constantly
being poached by other companies like
eventually you know Google or Facebook
or LinkedIn or any of these other you
know Silicon Valley hotshots they're
going to be trying to you know poach
those developers away or even some of
the smaller companies that we don't know
but still have you know budgets to be
able to pay top dollar for some of this
talent so you know I've kind of heard I
really heard I've heard it from all
different angles really whether or not
the degree is necessary whether or not
you need to go to a top-tier school or
whether or not a state college is good
enough we're whether or not even a
Unity College is good enough what about
experience some people say experiences
trumps all that stuff some people say
that if you're you know too old you
can't find a job in Silicon Valley if
you have a family you're not going to be
able to find a job in Silicon Valley if
you don't work 16 hours a day you're not
going to be able to find a job in
Silicon Valley and if any of that stuff
is the case and I really don't want that
for myself anyway so you know screw them
but I don't know guys so it you just
caution you know you really have to you
know way the fact that the markets
change all the time the economy is not
doing nearly as well as everybody thinks
it is or everybody says it is you know
from the President on down I mean the
economy literally since the Great
Recession has grown by less than three
percent every single year so coming out
of a major recession in the worst
recession since the Great Depression
those are pretty stagnant growth numbers
in the United States now we're starting
to see venture capital funding dry up in
the IT industry and you're starting to
see these billion-dollar unicorn
startups are starting to lose valuation
and I think tech companies you know
headed for a downturn right now so now
we're going to probably see even more of
that h-1b poaching and all this other
crap or h-1b you know gaming the system
and the you know the poaching between
different companies and I just think
that everybody just needs to just you
know way where we're at try to you know
come up with educated decision I don't
have those answers you probably don't I
think that if anybody is going to
college that you probably shouldn't drop
out unless you absolutely have something
solid on your hands or you have an
opportunity to get your foot in the door
with a company as we speak I would not
drop out of school and then try to find
a job I think that would be probably the
worst idea that you could do but anyway
guys let me know what you think and I
just thought I'd respond to this article
because I know that based on some of my
viewers you guys would be interested and
what this article had to say and what it
really means alright thanks for watching
have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
