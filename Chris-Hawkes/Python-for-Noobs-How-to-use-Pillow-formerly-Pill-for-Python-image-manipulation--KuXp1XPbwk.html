I'm doing is current I'm currently
building a Django avatar system to store
profile images and what I'm trying to do
is I'm trying to have a directory here
which is where my project that's
currently located in a static folder I'm
trying to have the avatars is where the
images are going to be stored and I want
to have folders for every user name that
has a profile and then within that that
folder that will be there their actual
profile image so the problem with doing
that though is that let me just show you
so I'll go ahead and I'll select the
file and i'll upload it and you get the
error that no directory exists under
this profile name trying to save this
image under this folder which does not
exist as I just showed you guys in the
avatars folder okay
alright so our solution is to go to our
views file and we want to go at an
import OS and then import or no
alright so after we have our paths
identified with our username
I sit down here we're going to get into
a try and catch statement or try and
accept will say oh s make ders and then
we'll feed it our file save path here or
whatever the path is that has the folder
that you need to be created and has not
yet been created and by doing it this
way even if you're unsure of whether or
not that folder exists the try and catch
will not bog your system down because it
will simply fail silently if the
directory already exists
let's do our except same except OS error
as exception
if exception dot or no not equal or no
dot exist raise
alright so let's go ahead and try this
again
and now we go to our folders and you can
see that it now created the folder where
there had not been one before this is
especially if you're using Python 2
series Python 3 has introduced a
workaround to this type of issue which
is a bit more you know maybe a bit more
solid in this approach but if you're
using any Python 27 any two series this
is definitely recommended we're out
there's several different routes you can
take but this is definitely the best one
for system resources all right thank you
