developer survey was actually
recommended but one of my viewers ash
who wanted me to check this out and I'm
glad he actually share this link with me
because this is done some pretty good
information but Stack Overflow they end
up doing this a yearly survey and
they've been doing this for quite a few
years and I believe since 2011 and and
basically all the developers a you stack
overflow which is like pretty much every
developer in the world they respond to
the survey in that and in the survey
asked him a bunch of questions
unfortunately the surveys already closed
so I wasn't even aware that the survey
was ongoing which is I find a little
interesting I because I would have
filled it out myself but unfortunately
my results here or not part of this but
they had looks like not exactly sure
what the overall numbers are here but
some of the interesting results from
this is that like most of the people
that ended up responding or web
developers but I don't really think that
that surprised as anybody like most of
the jobs out there for web development
although this is like twenty percent or
desktop applications developers it
almost seems like if you're a web
developer like me like everybody's job
as a web developer so full stack web
developer apparently more people in the
United States identified as a full stack
developer as opposed to other countries
like Germany and things so you could
tell like sometimes it's just buzz word
kind of in this industry and
like you know but buzz words that you
originated out of the United States
you're gonna have more people obviously
that you know that call themselves by
that and things like that so here's
another interesting thing so it's like
years since learning to code so you can
see that there's quite a few newbies out
there well not really actually if you
look at this I mean less than a year and
one to two years I mean that's about
seven about eight percent eight point
three percent there so a lot of people
have been doing programming for a very
long time but it's very scattered what's
interesting is that 17.2 percent of all
the respondent respondents have been
doing programming for 20 or more years
so that is something that I've said for
a long time well in fact i am going to
be releasing videos more than a few
especially because the crop of YouTube
videos that seem to be springing up in
this industry where people I try to
claim that you know that you're a
professional after like two months of
programming and and anybody that you
know that it is you know mislead down
that path i think is just not it's not
it's not fair exam you know but the
thing i'm trying to say is you know
watch out for bull out there
there's a lot of people it takes a long
time to be a very good developer it
doesn't mean that you can't program
within a year or two but you're not
going to know very much years coding
professionally so you can see here that
less than one year seven point four
percent 20 years or more once again
pretty high seven point five percent
which is more than a lot of these in
between but obviously programming is
becoming a more I think mainstream type
of thing it's been you have more and
more mainstream ever since you know the
60s and 70s and really all the way to
today it gets more and more mainstream
so years coated professionally in the
past 20 years or more 17.2 percent so
that's uh you know quite a quite a bit
of our like a lot of people are like
what are the old programmers go the old
programmers are still around and they
can actually blow away a lot of the
younger programmers so I mean I've seen
it firsthand and but I think they're
still there and then the thing is like
they're the market itself just grows
exponentially so there's just more
positions now and a lot of those older
developers can still move into other
types of arenas whether they work for
themselves or they retire their
consultants or things like that but vote
you know most definitely their expertise
are still quite quite needed now you can
clearly see that this is a
male-dominated demographic here so
that's not surprising to anybody like my
audience is ninety-two percent male a
lot of programmers out there you know
you're going to see you nine times out
of 10 it's a male programmer so that's
pretty spot on there you know whether or
not you know there's something is going
to be done about that or or they're
trying to do that like you know that's
something that i really i don't know i
mean there are women programmers I've
worked with quite a few women
programmers like I said that Ada
Lovelace she was
the first ones actually have like a
thought about like subroutines and
things like that and that you know that
predated programming and computers in
general now here's something that's also
not surprising that the programming
industry is is pretty white and I guess
it's a very white type of sin you look
at like look at all the P all the
programming languages that have been
developed out there so like name any
random programming language like there's
a good chance it's like somebody from
like Denmark effeminately Europe or
United States and a lot of times they're
white people and that's not a racist
statement but clearly you know this is a
very I don't know there's not a whole
lot of diversity and the programming
field but I will say that it is actually
becoming more and more diverse so and I
would probably expect that to continue
to occur but you know that is that is
what it is so disabilities so I guess
I'm not sure there's no real core like
not a whole lot of information there now
let you look at the parents education
level a lot of parents a lot of
programmer parents had bachelor's or
master's degree so neither yeah I don't
identify with that but there's still a
good majority there that another actual
education so a lot of this stuff is
getting more and more into the
demographics everything
now this is this is interesting a
forty-two percent of all the respondents
and the programming field had a
bachelor's degrees when one percent had
a master's degree so you're looking at
60 almost sixty four percent that I
either had a bachelor's or master's
degree or even higher so the dollars
without a college degree or definitely
in the minority importance of formal
education so they're kind of mixed
whether it's important or somewhat
important I think everybody would agree
that you know an education is important
even if you don't necessarily apply
those things day-to-day other types of
education now this is something that I
wanted to add a video that's going to be
scheduled here pretty soon and the the
what was really interested if what I'm
telling other people is like when I was
getting started programming I didn't go
to youtube tutorials or pluralsight or
any of those places like that I learned
through actual books I went out and
purchased books which is hard to believe
in this day and age it also went to
official documentation so I have a video
that's touching on all of that so I'm
not going to get too much into that
right now so this business where I
really wanted to mention that weighs
developers teach themselves so a lot of
tutorials are out there including my own
where you know you may or may not be
just better off going to the official
documentation there's not really any
need to follow along on a plural site or
a YouTube tutorial or something like
that even though you know you can find
some stalls like I actually like some of
the stuff in new boston was doing out of
people that tell me that they like what
I've done but I would probably say if I
were truly make telling my my kid or
something how to be a program red wants
them to go to the official documentation
because that's that's really where it's
at it's the most up-to-date and out
there so unless somebody really likes
that personal you know teaching style of
somebody then just you know go ahead and
try to bypass that if you can so a lot
of programmers program as a hobby I
definitely do
it's almost fifty percent so I think so
what kind of learning do developers
recommend to online courses so that's
actually I suppose becoming more and
more prevalent but a lot of people still
like to buy books you know I mean and
that's what I'm saying as well that's
how I got started so contributing the
open source that's something I don't do
enough of but it's certainly something
that is going to help other people learn
a lot about the industry as well as like
if you start working with open source
projects and getting pull requests
merged into projects and things like
that dude there's no question you're
going to be hired by a company but you
know getting to that level is it usually
takes years of experience to be good
enough to do that kind of thing
depending on you know the complexity of
the project you probably get anything
you know the thing is like you obviously
want to contribute to a project that
people have actually heard of as opposed
to like some project that has you know
one get github profile attached to it
that nobody uses you know what i mean so
there's there's definitely you know
there's something that's just taking or
keep in mind and with regards to that so
here is the cool part most popular
technologies programming language is
javascript number one then sequel Java C
sharp Python so as much as we talk about
Python things like that a lot of young
professional developers are writing Java
and C sharp everyday species both of
those are ahead of Python and PHP and to
me that's not really surprising but what
is surprising and I even had this on my
top 10 list is typescript even though I
don't use it it was something I wanted
to use and in a way I feel like it's you
know it's really difficult on angular
because they're they're trying to push
the tribes crisp late typescript seems
to be going very well and that's
something that I find very interesting
here so and then you can see pearl is
still holding on at four point three
percent and then go is cropping up to go
is up being mentioned here in the same
breath as pearl which you know I think
it do it just basically go is becoming
prime time so a lot of interesting stuff
and stuff there obviously no jsem is
really popular everybody
about no Jessie J's dotnet core here is
a surprise nobody it seems like nobody
talks about this I've talked about it a
little bit but dotnet Korres is you know
microsoft.net implementation but it's
cross-platform so if you look at Visual
Studio code I just got Visual Studio
code up and running here on my on vs
code actually can step through and debug
the code by putting breakpoints in my vs
code so i don't have to have visual
studio I don't use monodevelop or
anything like that I'm writing C sharp
and unity and i'm debugging it with
Visual Studio code that is a fantastic
project and I'm not getting paid one
Microsoft to say that i wish i was so
then you have react obviously react is
up there and angular still hanging on
but like react being twenty percent i
think react is already beaten out
angular i really do i think that
companies are going to continue to adopt
reactor at quite a great cliff cordova
surprises me i don't understand that but
then hadoop you know obviously big data
and things like that that's that's not a
huge surprise their database is my
sequel sequel server is right there a
lot of people ask why i used i know why
i use microsoft will sequel server is a
big reason for that but you can clearly
see Mike my sequel owned by oracle now
and then post grass or to sequel item
surprised because I wouldn't really put
a production database out there was a
with sequel life within Cassandra Redis
is like the number one the very very
slim down key value cash based database
you know it's very very fast and very
popular nowadays cassandra is a big data
database and then you got windows
desktop so you're like Chris you're an
asshole while you develop on Windows
well still the majority of developers
out there using windows so who is the
asshole now I'm just kidding I like my
next to put on Linux i mean i'm using
ubuntu linux i run putty here is putty
it's running linux here's my gift bash
also very linux like so it's not like i
don't write linux you i do
i'm just kidding not trying to put there
anyway guys you know window is still
number 1 1 X number two
android AWS a lot of this this is some
great information this is uh this is all
some really good stuff here this is
great alright guys well I'm probably
going to break this up in the tutor for
videos because it's too long so I want
you guys to hopefully keep in mind my
sponsors I have two sponsors now there's
dead mountain coding both camps that
you're trying to get yourself in the
industry of the developer dev mountains
going to focus on the technology of the
here and now they have 12 and 16 week
intensive courses where you can actually
live on canvas they can work on housing
situations whether you have to check out
their their website and the link below
in the description tab but they're going
to do things like nodejs teach you about
kids working with teams of developers
and things like that so make sure you
guys check them out also I've said
before if you guys are also trying to
get your foot in the door and you don't
have a whole lot of time to set up a web
server shared host or anything like that
you're going to want to go to site 123
calm and you can create a quick and easy
site even if you were going you know
like like a restaurant or any a basic
e-commerce platform we're just a simple
blog if you're trying to showcase some
of your development skills maybe your
own UX or something like that inside 1 2
3 can get you up and running very
quickly and for very cheap and it's much
less hassle than some of the other
options out there so make sure you guys
check out both of my sponsors their
links are in the description tab below
and thank you for sponsoring my stuff
both site one two three and dead
mountain and thank you to you guys and
everybody out there for watching my
channel and take care guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
