alright guys welcome back so in the last
video we made the template and we used
some of the object model that we grabbed
from the database and put it inside the
template now what we want to do is we
want to go over and make a base HTML
page which is going to be located in our
templates directory inside the base
folder and let's just create an HTML
file and we'll just call this base one
alright alright so first things first
I'm going to take out this um HTML XHTML
directive here and I just wanted to say
language equal eat in us and that's US
English inside the head let's do meta
character set equals utf-8
and then inside here we're going to go
ahead and build a block container and
this block container we're going to
touch on this more but right now will
call it block title and every block
container you have you have to have an
end block and when we inherit from this
base page basically we can put block
title containers in the page that is
inheriting from it and then inside of
that block title is you can put anything
there for your page title so I'll touch
on that more in just a moment
and while we're at it every website
should have meta content describing what
it is that the site is about so we'll
add that now and it's called keywords
I'm going to leave a blank for the
moment but whatever your site is about
you just want to put in whatever
keyboards you think should be associated
with your site all right so now we have
description that's also going to be left
blank but you should always have a
keywords and description meta tag since
we won't decide to be mobile-friendly we
also need to add something called a
viewport and the content just needs to
say width equals device width and when
we get into responsive design and we
make this site so it adapts to a mobile
device and shrinks and expands on you're
basically saying with that directive use
the actual phones physical width not
what its resolution is capable of
all right at this point let's go ahead
and build our main CSS page so let's go
to the static folder inside CSS and
we're going to add a CSS file and then
we'll just call it mane and just to make
sure it's working let's change our
header one to be color we'll just make a
color red so we know that the CSS page
is being connected and we have to add it
to our main HTML page now so we're just
a link relation equals stylesheet type
is text CSS and then the h RF is the
physical location we're going to be
using a shortcut here which is our
static URL I'll say CSS main dot CSS
okay and inside the body let's go ahead
and make a block content this is where
the main content of our web page is
going to sit
alright let's go back over to our base
or not base but our band HTML page and
since we're now using this well we want
to inherit from the based on HTML page
basically the master HTML page we just
created and in order to do that let's
get rid of all this HTML above and below
our content and inside this statement
here this is how it's going to work
extends and it's going to be base and
then base one HTML and make sure that's
inside on a single or double quotes now
let's go ahead and add that block title
that I was telling you about before and
it just simply needs to have the block
title and an in block and here we'll say
the actual title is called noob music Oh
sedan name so this will be like a
dynamic title for whatever band is
currently being viewed and also any
content it has to be inside a block and
container if you're inheriting from a
master HTML page so this stuff is going
to exist inside block content
we'll just go ahead and close that off
now let's get that on our server
and when we pull up the web page it
looks the same which is to be expected
but one thing that is an issue is our
main CSS is not being found so let's
take a look here and the reason why that
is willing uploaded the templates in on
our static folder all right so now you
can see that it is being found and our
h1 is now turned to read each one so
what we've done here as you can see on
the HTML structure of our page we have a
head we have the actual dynamic title
being added now keyboards description
all that is blanked obviously but
basically you have a band page that now
gets most of its HTML from just one
particular HTML page so you can use that
for inheritance and just prevent a lot
of duplicate code alright so that's
that's what we're going to end this
tutorial here we've gone far we've added
a base at HTML page and now we've also
made our band HTML inherit from that and
we've also added our first CSS
stylesheet all right guys um I'll talk
to you some more in the next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
