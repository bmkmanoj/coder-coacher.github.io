what I want to talk about is 10 things
that you should master in order to
become a good web developer and
especially a good JavaScript developer
and before we even get into that you
have to know that javascript is a
programming language and that it is the
universal language of the web it didn't
start off that way it was invented in
90s and then eventually became the they
standard that all browsers used as a
programming language to be able to do
things inside you know Chrome Firefox
and Internet Explorer javascript is
currently referred to as just Jas or
Microsoft people will commonly call it a
jscript and the reason why is because it
goes back to Microsoft having their own
version of JavaScript which they called
jscript and and then the actual standard
that the entire web community had built
which is stands for it actually is
called ACMA script which is spelled
ECMAScript and that's still what it's
called to this day so there's
organizations out there that determine
what are they're going to be the new
features in the JavaScript language one
of those features is going to be
supported and they try to make they try
to make sure that all browsers heed to
the standards that they develop and the
reason why is because even to this day
we've had major problems with every
browser out there coming up with their
own interpretation of how JavaScript
should work and Microsoft has been
notorious for you know basically not
following in line with following suit
with a lot of the standards that were
paved along the way they would cite that
you know they wanted the standards like
basically written out in writing and
Chrome and Firefox were basically more
adapt
to whatever the community was doing and
really the community is led by
developers that develop the browsers as
well as the developers that write
JavaScript for those browsers so for
companies like Microsoft I mean they
used to be able to drag their feet a lot
easier but as we have moved forward into
the future Chrome and Firefox have
clearly overtaken ie and Microsoft's new
edge browser is there their latest plan
to try to get back into the browser
market but they have a hard time
competing and keeping up with the open
source community
that Google and Firefox embrace so the
bottom line that though is that there
was multiple versions of JavaScript
there still is and every browser runs
JavaScript a little bit differently and
there's a lot of gotchas along the way
that you're going to run into as a
JavaScript developer so just know that
javascript is the language of the web
and we need to go ahead and inspect how
it works
so the most important thing number 10 on
our list is how does JavaScript work so
we're not going to go into the actual
details of like specifically like byte
code and computer code of how JavaScript
works what we're more interested in is
how do we actually get JavaScript to
work within our pages so this is a
pretty basic basic thing that you have
to learn but when you fir when you're
first starting out you really don't know
how JavaScript works so as an example
here is a website that I built which is
in bad it needs repairs badly but for
right now we're not going to worry about
how its outdated and how I haven't been
maintaining it we're going to look at
the the source code of the the page here
and I want to show you an example of
JavaScript in action here so this right
here all your JavaScript is put into the
actual HTML page and it's surrounded by
these script tags so that's the first
thing you need to know the JavaScript
okay so you can put the script tags
right inside your your file and execute
this JavaScript code the alternative is
to actually link to an external style
sheet which you can do by using the
script tag but then you're pointing to
an actual source directory where
a javascript file can be found so if I
click on that you can see the web knows
how to traverse itself to be able to
find this file sitting on a server and
actually execute that so JavaScript
doesn't have to be written in between
script tags they can be loaded
externally like this so this is a file
of straight JavaScript code and it was
just referenced as a script tag
reference and then you also have what's
called you know in line or in page
styles which is actual script code
that's going to be in between the two
script tags and gets executed as soon as
it's loaded in the page so that's the
two ways that you need to know how
JavaScript works all right number 9 on
our list here is how to actually test
JavaScript and the reason why this is
important is it can be a hassle
sometimes to to write JavaScript not to
reload your page and things like that
and there's tools because javascript is
the language of the web and a language
that can be executed within your browser
you actually don't have to even have a
file in order to start writing
JavaScript so if you're just starting
out the best thing to do is actually go
to a site where you can execute
JavaScript without any sort of problems
and there's actually plenty of sites out
there one of them is a clunker which I
will go ahead and provide you guys
plunker dot Co is a really easy site
that you can get started with all you
have to do is when you go to the main
page you say launch the editor and over
here you can actually see it comes with
a script tag an external file and the
way I showed you guys before you can
actually just put a script tag it
doesn't even matter if it's in the body
or if it's in the head it'll be executed
and then you can just write some simple
JavaScript right into your browser and
test it out without actually having to
save files load external files or
anything like that so if I went ahead
and I ran this application this little
page you can see that it printed up the
hello world and that's actually
JavaScript code being executed and all
you had to do was go to a third-party
site there was no need to do anything
else the other popular one that you're
going to find out on the web is a
jsfiddle so you don't see a lot of
people are using I'm J
but all to create JavaScript and
everything so we're not going to do that
right now but that's the other
alternative plunker is really helpful
because when you start dealing with
other libraries which we'll get into in
just a moment you can easily include
them can do that as well with um with a
jsfiddle so it's going to be whatever
sort of preference you have all right
number eight on the list is how to use
Chrome to your advantage and what I mean
by that is that chrome has all the
built-in tools that you need in order to
be a sufficient JavaScript developer so
if we go back to the site that I had
which is new movies I can actually
within my page right now I can go ahead
and right-click on the browser say
inspect element and it's going to pull
up this little this actually several
different boxes down here and we're not
going to get into all of them but if I
go over to console the you can ignore
this stuff in fact if I want to delete
that I could say clear console side of
this empty console and I can actually
run JavaScript code right in the browser
so just like I did before I could say I
can write JavaScript right in and just
execute it I can even use third-party
libraries which we'll see in just a
moment but the bottom line though is
that there is a lot of lot of tools
inside of this chrome developer tools
that you can use to to really be able to
evaluate your JavaScript and one of
those big important things is that you
can actually step through your code
using the beat debugger so it's going to
be really important when you're getting
started that when you're looking at at
something that you know how to debug it
so it can be very difficult but the
chrome makes it a lot easier than it
used to be on the left hand side here
you can see that there's all these
folders and if I go into the jas folder
I can look in something like common
which is currently open or if I just
look inside this script I can go ahead
and I can set a breakpoint on any one of
these and
trying to get a good spot here so I'll
go into this index react so let's go
ahead just set a breakpoint and we can
do that just by simply clicking on any
one of these locations on the left hand
side but you need to actually click on
something that is actually hittable so
the code has to be located so if I like
stop it on the return statement if I
went ahead and refreshed it if this code
executes you can see it actually blocks
and right now we're in the middle of
execution so if I highlight any of these
elements you can see primary image is
currently no so that variable that is
primary image is is null but you can
look at like this dot state state has a
bunch of stuff like the box-office this
is all stuff related to my website but
you can see actual code pause in its
state at any given moment wherever the
breakpoint is hit and then you can start
traversing a line by line by just
pressing and what I so you have these
tools over here where you can step into
the next function call step out of so if
I stepped in it's going to go ahead and
it's going to go the next execution and
you can see now it's actually going into
a JavaScript library which is called
react and a lot of times you don't want
to do that but Chrome has the ability to
actually blackbox it so that it doesn't
follow into libraries that are all
minified and things like that so that's
actually something that's beyond just
the beginner tutorial but the bottom
line is at chrome developer tools is
going to be hugely important for any
sort of JavaScript developer in order to
to really be able to understand and and
take a full advantage of what javascript
has to offer
all right number seven on our list is
the JSON syntax which which stands for
JavaScript object notation and it's not
its own language or anything like that
it's actually a semantics style it's a
it's a structure it's very similar to
something like HTML HTML or if you look
at something like XML so it's not
considered a full fledged programming
language but there are semantics
surrounding it that you
have to abide by in order for it to be
valid Jason Jason back like five years
ago was considering considered the
darling of the web and it's basically
the ultimate way of having two different
applications be able to communicate with
each other using a similar language back
in the day well not really back in the
day but you constantly have when you
have two different applications or two
different companies working on different
code they don't know how to communicate
with each other effectively so in order
to solve that problem the XML language
was was established so that basically
it's very similar to HTML and you have
these tags that say hey there's a title
tag so title tags a title here's a body
tag body tag as a body you know product
a is a product a or whatever it is so
that's what XML is so it sees you know
open and closing items that contain data
within inside and it's it's considered a
structured language that is easy to
follow the problem with XML is that it
can be bloated and it's not as fast and
lightweight is Jason and it's not built
specifically for JavaScript like Jason
the reason why Jason is well JavaScript
object notation
is because it's built for the JavaScript
programming language so I pulled up
Jason lint here which is an online free
editor that you can use to actually
validate your Jason it's just a
JavaScript object so that's all Jason is
so JavaScript object is an open and
closed curly brace that's actually valid
Aysen so if we went ahead and validated
it that's actually valid and it's very
similar to a dictionary like if you've
ever used Python there's key and then
separated by a colon and then value and
both of them should be in double quotes
and that's all it is it's just a key
value pair it gets a little bit more
complicated but you can see this is
valid Jason instead of this just being a
string value you can actually have it be
its own jason object within
other key value and then that would be
valid Jason or actually on its invalid
because of our opening closing braces
here tsimmes Ali because the quotes
there I'm Abed so you can see that this
Jason object has a key object that
contains key value inside so you can
also have a contain like this instead of
this being an object so key is currently
an object but now we're going to
actually say key is a list and the list
of goddang it
start accent erased it but this could
just be a list of strings and you can
see it's still valid chase and so there
are certain semantics that you do have
to follow in order for it to be valid
Jason but the reason why Jason is
important is like I said it's it's the
language of so Jason is very easy
because you can see like on this movie
website that I have here I have these
these movies that are being loaded and
if we actually look at how that's taking
place what I'm doing is I'm actually
making an ajax call using javascript and
it's making a call out to a server on
Google's YouTube server and it's
actually pulling returning back Jason
which is the exact same format that I
just showed you guys and then I'm able
to parse it because I know how Jason
works so once you know how Jason works
you can just go ahead and parse that
right into your program and you'll you
know easily be able to understand how to
work with another company's API because
they use Jason our guys number six on
our list is what is Ajax so Ajax is the
ability of being able to a synchronous
Lee make a call out to another server
and update your webpage without actually
requiring a page reload the reason why
that's important is because users now
are very accustomed to not having to
load the back in the old days you used
to have to go ahead and go to a web page
and if you
wanted to see if there's a new news
article or get you know in an updated
stock price or something like that you
always had a refresh nowadays websites
are able to dynamically update data
constantly like it whether it's a
commenting system or you know Facebook
notifying you with a little red red icon
saying that you have a new message
that's all done via Ajax so Ajax is
behind the scenes from your browser
making calls out to either its server or
some other company's server to pull down
data and then update the webpage without
ever requiring any sort of page load so
it's a very smooth fast user experience
and that's actually what's being done
here so there's actually calls being
made across the wire grabbing a
different movie and then making on the
display now just because I'm clicking
next you can see that the entire page
isn't reloading it's just in this one
particular portion of the page that's
reloading and the reason why is because
I'm using JavaScript and Ajax and Jason
to make that happen
number five on this list is where to go
to find answers to your questions that
you're going to have so you're
undoubtedly going to have questions
whenever you start programming a lot of
newbies don't know this this video
series is aimed towards newbies but you
need to know where is the most reliable
information to go to find information on
JavaScript and really programming in
general and the answer to that question
is stack overflow stack overflow has
every single question you could possibly
need well not really I mean there's
there's constantly questions probably a
thousand every day for JavaScript
JavaScript is one of the most
talked-about languages on this site you
can see that it's actually approaching 1
million questions asked in JavaScript so
reason why when you compare that to
something like Python that has four
hundred eighty eight thousand which is a
lot and then C sharp which is also a
very popular language has closed the
same amount but JavaScript has
definitely exploded in popularity and
there's a ton of questions so if there's
nine hundred and seventy-one thousand
questions asked by you know everybody
from the most experienced JavaScript
guys to the least experienced the
chances are good that this website has
has those answers for you so
you typically want to search because I
like I said but in most cases they will
have the answers that you're looking for
and the rare cases that they don't then
go ahead and post a question but you
know they are pretty harsh on people
that ask you know questions that are
repetitive and you know for people that
didn't do any research whatsoever to try
to find the answer to their problem all
right number four on this list and
arguably number one is who invented the
JavaScript language the reason why this
is important is just because anybody
that actually develops something that's
used essentially by almost every single
person on this world deserves a lot of
credit for you know being able to come
up with with that and the guy's name is
Brandon Ike and it's that's how it's
pronounced anyway but it might be Ike
Ike but anyway he was a he was actually
CEO of Mozilla for a short period of
time and he was actually really torn
apart in the media for some of his
religious beliefs which was actually
messed up for it so for for all the
people that you know have a certain
belief and believe that everybody should
believe you know what they want the
bottom line is that it is a people
should be able to believe what they want
spiritually and this guy was you know I
feel like unjustly just torn apart in
the media and had to resign as CEO of
Mozilla which is completely uncalled for
in this society and I feel like you know
he deserves a shout-out for this list as
far as you know being somebody that you
know created one arguably one of the
most important pieces of software code
in the history of really the web and and
for that reason the history of the world
so anyways a really smart guy was that
job at Mozilla Corporation for a long
time and and has been a champion of
JavaScript for a very long time
alright number three on this list is
what is a JavaScript library and the
reason why this is so important is that
javascript is a language that can easily
be messed up it's a very finicky every
browser is different you could have a
chrome version that that renders
something different in JavaScript
compared to a later or newer chrome
version Firefox doesn't render the same
things as Internet Explorer at the new
edge browser some browsers update
themselves some don't some don't so the
so you have to know what a JavaScript
library is because the JavaScript
library was made because JavaScript is
such a hassle to get right the language
itself isn't difficult but just trying
to maintain all those browsers and all
the different code that you need in
order for things to work correctly
javascript frameworks sprung up left and
right and they've been doing so for the
last 10 years or more and certainly over
the last couple of years we've seen just
an explosion in the amount of JavaScript
frameworks and a lot of them come
accomplish the same goals and people are
very very particular about it they're
very passionate about their languages
and you know they could argue with you
all day long over why react is better
than angular or angular is better than
backbone or backbones better than
knockout mule you know look at execution
speeds and those site semantics or you
know design philosophies and the bottom
line is that there are tons of
JavaScript libraries you need to know
what a JavaScript library is one of my
favorite new libraries that has come out
of late was developed by the Facebook
guys and they created their own
framework which is just JavaScript code
that's written to work a certain way in
order to keep things updated in a
webpage so like you can see hello John
if I went ahead and you can see that it
gives you like actual examples so if I
went down here and I actually change the
code to Chris you can see it's updating
on the fly and that's using something
called a virtual Dom and the virtual Dom
is actually able to update itself and
multiple
locations because of the way the react
code is written so a lot of different
things I can see the elapsed time so
like any sort of timers and countdowns
that's all working through JavaScript
react makes a very complicated thing
much easier so so you can see they're
doing a to-do list here so there's a lot
of different things that are really cool
that you can do as far as making the
webpage dynamic and in the old days we
had to write a lot more code than what
react requires you to write in order to
be able to keep things updated another
popular framework that you hear a lot
about is the angular JavaScript
framework which is more of a batteries
included type framework that tries to do
everything for you there's some
criticisms there but ultimately angular
is a very popular framework and I would
definitely need to mention it but
there's there's plenty of them out there
they're all just JavaScript libraries
though and that's why you know that it's
very important um that you know what
that is
alright guys number two on the list is
jQuery because jQuery is a library like
we just talked about it at number three
but it is the most popular JavaScript
library and as much as people want to
try to replace it and say that it's you
know going to fall by the wayside
eventually jQuery is still an absolute
must every website I've ever seen is
using it it makes very complicated
things easy and it's almost its own
entire language of itself now it's it's
a language that's cross browser so it
works on all different browsers because
of all the JavaScript experts that have
built jQuery along the way and it's
pretty much used and probably almost
every single major web site out there
it's been developed so much over the
last five or six years that like I said
it's pretty much its own language
there's the jQuery way of doing things
and there's the JavaScript way of doing
things sometimes the JavaScript way is a
very simple way but people still do it
the jQuery wages because jQuery is so
common so if you're going to be a
JavaScript developer you know jQuery is
going to be one of the first
you're actually going to want to jump in
to once you're ready to start using a
JavaScript library so when you start off
we're going to jump to number one but
before I do that let me go ahead and and
just give you guys an example of what
jQuery is so jQuery can be found on its
website jQuery comm and you can actually
click to download the latest version or
you can actually view the source all
it's going to give you as an actual
JavaScript file you include it in your
web page like I showed you with the new
movies website where you have the
external source pointing to a JavaScript
file and that's all jQuery is once it's
in there you can actually use it so if I
go to google.com
I'm going to be able to write jQuery
code by going into the console like I
showed you guys eventually and jQuery is
used by using the dollar sign so I
should be able to say just give me all
all elements so you can see that that
returned an array of all the JavaScript
elements in a webpage so this is
actually something called an XPath which
is something related to the XML that we
talked about earlier but what this is is
actually using a jQuery to pass in an
XPath and even Google has the use of
jQuery so jQuery is working within
within their original or their their you
know their single Google search engine
page all right guys number one and
hopefully guys one thing is lame but
number one if you're going to be a good
JavaScript programmer and I've showed
you those things along the way you have
to actually know where to start learning
JavaScript so there's several places
that you can go a lot of the websites
you can actually go to YouTube tutorials
similar to the ones that I provide for
like Python and Django there's plenty of
JavaScript tutorials out there that that
you can learn from from you know maybe
people that fit your your style and I
that you don't find annoying if you like
the video presentation type of thing a
lot of people learn from books so so if
JavaScript books or your thing you can
actually get one of these definitive
guides to Java square
which is going to teach really all the
basic semantics of JavaScript what is a
variable what is a list or an array how
do I add things to an array how do I
remove them how do I add and do
multiplication it's going to teach you
some of those basic things I wouldn't
spend it you know all day well I would
spend probably all day but I wouldn't
spend months trying to be like some
JavaScript master after you know some of
the basics of JavaScript okay how do I
include a file how do I execute some
code how do I print stuff to the screen
how do I use variables and work with
those variables how do I build lists or
arrays or anything like that and then
once you get to that point at that point
you probably just want to go ahead and
start learning jQuery so jQuery in
action is like one of the best books on
jQuery which as long as it's written by
yeah this bear Bieber guy on jQuery in
action this is definitely a solid book
to get you started in jQuery so once you
have a solid grasp of jQuery I think
then it's time to go ahead and start
moving on to something like react
JavaScript which is going to be very
easy for you react javascript is much
easier than angular in that you can use
this with them with Django ASP Ruby on
Rails whatever you want to use for your
web framework you're going to be able to
plug in react much easier than you would
something like angular so for all those
reasons you know JavaScript is
definitely a great language to learn
it's a number one language in the web
and if you guys have any questions feel
free to leave a leave a comment please
write up the video and subscribe and if
you disagree with anything just let me
know as well and I always try to respond
everybody if I can anyway guys thanks
