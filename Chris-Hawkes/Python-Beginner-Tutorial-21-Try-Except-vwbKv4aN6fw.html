we're just gonna take a moment there's
gonna be a pause kind of video with with
the Python series here and I just want
to address a question that got sent in
to me and this is the code and I just
actually copied and pasted pasted it
right into the editor here and he's
basically saying why doesn't it work it
gives me a valid value error so I just
actually thought it might be a good idea
to try to take a look and look at this
in real time with you guys so number one
he has this this try and accept and we
haven't really covered the try and
accepts or anything like that but the
indent indentation is wrong it has to be
your try has to align with your accept
so it's same thing with the if and the
else the if if this was an if then your
else would have to align with it
Python is very finicky about the fact
that you have to you have to make sure
this stuff is all indented properly then
he has an else statement here so I don't
yeah I don't know that really it's gonna
be your try accepting your else isn't
really going to apply here so let me see
what were you trying to do here so you
were saying print it's a number so I
don't alright so number one let's let's
just get rid of the else for right now
in fact I'll actually comment it out and
here's a shortcut if you wanted to
comment out you can press ctrl forward
slash and it comments would use in
whatever language you have so let's see
if we could actually run this real quick
to try to make sense of this and just so
you guys know even as a programmer I
gotta been working all day I come home
I'm like I don't really know what's
going on here
indentation expected and indentation
block at the print here so yeah it's
gonna it's going to complain about all
this stuff this has to be properly
printed I'm assuming this stuff probably
got on indented when you copy and pasted
it so just pick a number so that seems
to be working three and then
not really sure so the editor is
probably not going to run this very well
actually I mean you can make an
adjustment
apparently divisional studio code in
order to fix that so in order to fix
that actually you're gonna go to your
code up here where it says Python you
want to change that to integrated
terminal console and I want to zoom out
a little bit to see you guys can see
that a little better so you change that
to integrate a terminal console and now
by doing that when we press play it's
actually going to run it like a console
type mode so you can see like when I
pick a number I'll say 3 and it'll say
pick a number again 3 3 is an odd number
2 2 is an even number so it sounds like
you got it working just fine man if you
if you take out your else here which
obviously doesn't need to be there and
then if you tried to give it like an odd
number let's let's stop this real quick
so just pick a number 3 take your number
2 2 is an even number 1 is an odd number
and then I try to give it something else
it's not a number there you go alright
so number 1 we learned a couple things
in this video and this probably wasn't
the most helpful for him but he's been
following along the series what we did
look at this and we we we debug to a
real life program that somebody tried to
create we didn't get into too much of
the where and the why obviously this
thing is looking at even and odd numbers
and that it uses a try and except which
we really haven't gone into yet but it's
accepting a specific type of exception
which is the value error we've seen the
value error when you're trying to use an
integer or a number as a string or a
string as a number you get those value
errors because it all relates to a type
and like I said type is a major part of
any programming language and you can't
just mix and match types a they behave
in a certain way so this is saying hey
you know we we expect you to try
something and then we're just accepting
it no matter what the consequences so it
it's as long as it's a value type error
so there's all kinds of different
in the Python language which we'll get
into more at a later time but this one
is just specifically saying hey if you
get a value error just continue to run
because otherwise Python would
completely freeze up and your program
can't continue to run so you can see
down here though it it was able to say
oh that's not a number and then tell you
to do it over again the while true is an
infinite loop so that'll just run
forever that's what they're doing here
yep so that hopefully this answer is the
guys question and in addition I think
it's a pretty good topic just on number
one how to use the console from within
visual studio code and also the second
example would just be the try and edge
try and accept within Python all right
guys let me know if you have questions
once again this is a little bit of an
unorthodox video for this tutorial
series so far but I still feel like it's
gonna be helpful so just let me know
what you guys think if it's too much of
a distraction I'll probably get rid of
the video but otherwise this will be the
21st video in the end the and the
tutorial series thanks for watching guys
bye hey guys so a lot of you asked me
how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course is
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're gonna need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're gonna be teaching you in this
and this coding bootcamp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about dev mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
