the last video we looked at this and how
the context of this actually or the way
the context of which methods are
executed changes to this value so that
it can point to different objects like
the global object or the object on which
the method was executed and in this
video what we want to look at is the
arrow syntax of the arrow or it's called
an arrow function actually is a new
standard of Ekman script 6.0 guys so
that it's also called ACMA script 2015
that's actually its official title
because the JavaScript 6.0 like the
latest standard of JavaScript that was
finally approved and agreed upon by all
the people involved was just done last
year so it's called that the script 2015
as the official title and you guys can
check out the specification if you ever
want a very dry read although if you
really wanted to be a master at
JavaScript then that would be the best
place to go probably so that said though
this this arrow function why did they
create it well they created a number one
because they wanted to handle the way
and the bind was being executed so it's
lexically bound to its function so this
keyword is not being passed around and
changed and stuff like that so it's more
predictable and also it's just a shorter
syntax so in the old days what did we do
we we created functions that return
something and we would do something like
bar x equals function return this so
this is kind of what I touched upon in
the last video but what is X X is an
anonymous function so guys what is an
anonymous function you're probably
asking that that's a confusing term but
anonymous function means a function that
has no name so if you look at X X's and
what we're talking about here X
obviously is the variable name X but the
anonymous function is the function that
is a sign to the variable X so why is it
anonymous because it doesn't have a name
it just says function open and close
parentheses return this so I could
execute X and it returns the window
object like we saw in the last video but
why is it anonymous because it has no
name it's just a function how do we give
it a name okay function
I have a name and obviously you want to
do camelcase so I would do that in
JavaScript and then I could say return
this same thing execute it's the same
exact thing but what's the difference if
I type X and this actually returns X you
can see function is not anonymous
anymore it says I have a name so it's
not an anonymous function why do I
mention anonymous functions because
number one you need to know what they
are number two you need to know that the
arrow functions the newest standard of
JavaScript 6.0 does not support anything
but anonymous function so it's only for
anonymous functions so the way that I
showed you guys how to actually create
an anonymous function doing this the old
way we have certain things like function
spelled out we have then you know the
fact that it takes no parameters it's
just an open and close parenthesis and
then it returns a you know an object to
do you know basically that is the
verbose way of going about it and that's
the normal way that we've been going
about it up until now so let's look at
an alternate way of being able to do
that with arrow functions so I could say
VAR x equals and I'm going to do open
and close parentheses arrow and then
just say this that's it so when we say X
what do we have oh we haven't we have an
anonymous function and if we execute X
you can see it returns the window object
so that's some crazy crap right there
isn't it so one of the things you will
need to know also is that Google Chrome
is the first browser to actually support
all of the ACMA script 6.0 standards I'm
not even sure that they support all of
them like a hundred percent but I know
that they at least touched upon all this
stuff that was agreed upon the latest
standard it's gonna take years probably
for like ie 11 to catch up and they may
never catch up
why because Microsoft browsers suck and
you probably shouldn't be using them but
besides that Chrome and Mozilla paved
the way for the newest standards and
everything and it just takes forever for
these things to get on board so what has
been created instead well we look at
things like babel or we look at things
like Eckman
and I type script but it provides these
newest features to the browser and
you're able to write it and then you
compile the code and then it actually
breaks down to code that works on all
browsers so why am i mentioning this I'm
mentioning it because this works in
Chrome but it may not work in other
browsers because they haven't
implemented the arrow functions yet so
the thing to keep in mind is that X is
an anonymous function because anytime
you're using the arrow function it's
always anonymous it can't be anything
but that another thing too is that this
particular anonymous function has no
parameters so what if I wanted to say
you know what this as aehlert X and then
we can actually say X then if I do this
and I say X hello world you can see that
it executed so it said hello world now
with an arrow function I actually don't
have to put this in parenthesis when you
have one argument the exact same thing
can be done this way although we didn't
pass in a value so it would help if we
did that so now it says hello world so
the exact same thing
why because I only have one parameter if
I had more than one parameter in my
arrow function I have to wrap it I can't
do this at least I hope not that would
stop if I was able to do this yeah see I
can't do that what I have to do in that
case is I have to wrap them in
parenthesis and now if I do this we can
pass in so we'll call X and we'll say
Chris Paul so we're passing in two
parameters and you can see that just
concatenates both of them and to Chris
Hawkes using the arrow function syntax
another thing too is that the this
variable is set for us so if we went
ahead and we say you know at my
anonymous function or my arrow function
is going to be open and close
parentheses arrow it's just gonna return
this so I'd like to say returns just to
say this so if I set X it returns to the
window object so that's cool now we saw
before what happens if we assign the
object
x2 a new object so let's go and create a
new object we'll say y equals new
javascript object which is just open and
close curly brace so we look at why it's
an object all right so now what we're
going to do is we're going to say y dot
x equals x so we're attaching our x
anonymous function to it all right so
now when we look at this and we look at
the y object we can see it's an object
we look into it we can see okay there's
an X now an X is a function and the
function is just going to return this
it's an arrow function though but anyway
so let's go ahead and if we saw if you
looked at the last video in this series
that were I explained that this variable
we know that the this keyword is
actually going to change because the the
context of which the the method is
executed is on this Y object so it's
going to this would return the Y object
instead of the global object so what
happens with an arrow function though so
it's going to find out it returns the
window object so that is the difference
guys if we had used the arrow function
that this wouldn't be bound to the
function itself or to the X object
instead it would have been bound to the
Y but because hopefully I said that
right I feel like I didn't say that
right anyway when we created X as an
anonymous function using the arrow arrow
function it set to this for us and it
set it to the window object because we
created it in the global scope we then
took that value that object and we
attached it to the Y object and had we
not used an arrow function then the Y
object when it executes X it would have
returned
the Y object as the this keyword so the
fact that we use an arrow function and
it sets to this for us lexically then no
matter what I can attach X anywhere I
want and it doesn't matter the execution
or where was executed or by who was
executed or where the prototype
points to or any of that stuff it's
going to it's going to send back to this
this you know the proper this context so
it's something where your your this
isn't going to be bouncing around to
different different values and stuff
like that or different objects so
hopefully you guys can wrap your head
around that that is definitely a more
advanced feature I think this is a more
advanced thing that once again unless
you actually understand it it just it
bites it it'll bite you really well
eventually you're gonna be like why is
it doing that and people are gonna blame
javascript and say that javascript is a
terrible language and all this stuff and
but ultimately it's just that they they
need to understand that this can change
two different objects depending on the
context and you know using anonymous
functions they might expect it to change
but it doesn't change because they used
an anonymous you know this anonymous
arrow function to to instantiate it so a
lot of different things can end up
biting you all right so the next cool
thing to discuss with an arrow function
is that you're gonna see some crazy
stuff when you start getting into like
react Redux and especially when they
start writing everything in ActionScript
6.0 and you're gonna be like what the
hell is that doing and it's some weird
stuff like this so like VAR x equals and
then it's going to be open and closed
parenthesis and then it could also be
the same thing where it's like okay like
so something like that and this could be
like so now if I was like X where we
have here we have these two functions
wrapped inside so you can actually have
the function like anonymous arrow
functions that actually return functions
themselves so it's pretty interesting
let's let's look at this in a more I
think a better concrete way so we're
gonna say you know what we're gonna say
a and then we're gonna pass a to this
and this is just gonna say alerts alerts
and so now if I go ahead and I do this
will say testing then now I need to
execute it actually then you can see
that actually did not pass down right I
didn't mean to do that actually so let
me let me fix this real quick my bad I
don't want to pass an A to the the
second I'm going to throw the means of a
closure and I should probably have an
entire video on closures in JavaScript
but closures are the ability for an
inner function defined with another
function to be able to grab parameters
passed into the outer function so
normally everything's lexically scoped
so that like you only have access to
variables within like the curly braces
of a of a function okay so with a
JavaScript loader though you could have
a function inside of a function and that
internal function can actually access
parameters pass into the outer function
and also you know private variables set
within the outer scope as well so a lot
of people hate JavaScript for that too
but you know through the power of
closure and stuff like that you can
actually do some interesting things and
that's actually what we're doing here
you can see that var X is going to be a
function that takes a parameter which is
a and then it returns a function that
uses the parameter that's passed into
its outer function so by means of a
closure with error functions that's what
we're not going on here so if I said X
now and I call it and I'm gonna pass in
a value so we'll say testing and then I
also want to say open and close because
I'm actually executing the internal
function of our error function so open
and close parentheses because if I don't
let me do this first you can see that
okay it returns this anonymous function
that doesn't take any parameter but it
says alert a so how does it know what a
is it knows what a is through the means
of a closure so if I say open and close
parenthesis then you can see testing and
that's some weirdness tube for a lot of
people they're like you know how does
that happen but you're gonna see a lot
of that kind of stuff in in some of the
latest versions of JavaScript
so it's quite a few things to swallow
here anonymous functions arrow functions
and closure alright guys thanks for
