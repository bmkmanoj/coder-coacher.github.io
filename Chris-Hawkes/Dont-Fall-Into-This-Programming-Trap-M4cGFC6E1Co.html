talking about basically a day in the
life of a newer programmer I would say
and this is just kind of like a mock
simulation had a thing of how I kind of
approached certain situations where I I
don't know something that's put in front
of me and and whether good or bad this
is kind of like Davey you know the
rabbit hole that I end up going down and
I just want to kind of show you so if
I'm like new to programming and I'm just
like I said I'm kind of just kind of
pretending here a little bit and I don't
know what anything means here where I'm
like okay this guy's comment don't rate
functional code and c-sharp that
language doesn't even optimize tail
recursion so we're like well optimized
tail recursion well what what's it what
the hell is tail recursion so you know
obviously the logical thing is that you
would search tail recursion try to
figure that out so you can see in
computer science a tail call is like a
function at the end of that function
it's going to call itself so if it calls
itself and its conservative B tail
recursive because it's like if you have
a function a and at the end of function
a of called function a and its tail
recursive right that's possibly a good
explanation in a nutshell I don't know
but you can go in here you can delay
well in computer science a subroutine
which really can just consider like a
function call perform that it's the
final action of a procedure so you're
looking at your like tail recursion or
tail and recursion so say well what is
tail end recursion so you start looking
in here what is tail recursion so you
get to the stack overflow question and
it's like tail recursion is well
described in your previous answers but I
think an example and he gives an example
of a function that he calls wrexham or I
guess for short vertices so maybe and
you have this is this variable it gets
passed and which is a number and if x
equals 1 it returns out of the function
so if X is not equal to 1 it will it
will instead take X and call itself
again with the argument though being X
minus 1 so in this example you can see
calls the function initially with 5 and
hopefully you guys consider so he calls
this with 5 and then he's saying ok 5
foot but so when he calls this function
then this code below here is actually
what he's describing is what happens in
the Python language with the way python
handles were recursion so the
interesting thing with with this is that
each time this recursive function will
call itself over and over and over and
over again before it ever actually
returns the final values so the
interesting thing is there is a final
value once again so it has to go all the
way down to where you know X finally
equals 1/2 where it finally returns but
then you can see on like the comments
he's like python is time and our choice
here since as far as I know tail
recursion are it does not have tail
recursion elimination so you live what
the hell is tail recursion elimination
so you start looking at that and then
you're like oh language agnostic
what is tail recursion elimination and
it is about the elimination optimization
that saves stack space sitting are like
stack space what the hell is that so you
started going down that rabbit hole okay
with a stack and other stuff over for we
know what that is but result like so
basically you can you continue to do
this stuff until eventually like your
brain turns to mush and you're just like
 it fluff recursion sucked
functional programming everything
right so that's where we don't want to
be in computer science and the thing
that I would caution I think just on
beginners is that a lot of the
doesn't matter so I've been programming
for eight years five professionally for
major corporations and as far as as far
as I know I've not had to deal with
retail recursion optimization or
anything like that so the fact that
c-sharp d-sharp lacks tail recursion
optimization
I would certainly probably agree that
without even having to look into it that
it's lack of being able to do that by
saving stack space and all this other
stuff probably means that it's not as
good of a functional language is
something like Haskell or even I
don't know
scholar or something I don't know like
I'm just I'm just kind of guessing out
there but the thing is is like there the
purpose of this video is just simply to
say that some of this stuff should only
matter to you when you determine that it
is a
every time for it to matter to you so if
you're in the functional program and
clearly you want to know the differences
if you have a lot of time on your hands
clearly you might want to read up on
this stuff if you're pulling your hair
out though going down there - too many
rattles like I just did where it's like
all these different things there's no
way you're going to understand all that
stuff in one fell swoop now you might be
able to have like a ignorant
conversation with somebody else about it
but you're not going to understand to
the point where you would care that much
about c-sharp having tailing
optimization or you know versus some
other language or something like that so
basically my entire purpose of this
video is like if you're just beginning
programming you start going on some sort
of rabbit hole and that is like this you
know this abyss that's basically just
you know taking away your motivation
taking away your brainpower taken away
your productivity to get things done and
continue to continue learning you know
just take a break from that for a moment
just you know focus on little concepts
and things like that you could actually
do what I just did where you're like
okay let me look this up this up this up
and this up and then try to get to the
base level of like okay clearly I need
to understand what a stack is in order
to understand how stacks are optimized
with recursion and different languages
and things like that so I don't know man
to take that for what it what it's worth
I don't know what its words that's just
kind of my thoughts but it's something
that because I am interested in computer
science I don't I even study theoretical
computer science or anything like that
I've never built my own compiler as far
as I know I probably never will and I
never really had to so you you could
probably go your entire career as a
sequel developer or maybe have to see
what maybe a web well over a PHP
developers and like that and you
probably would never have to worry about
a lot of this stuff that's just my
thoughts at this point but um it just
really depends on where you're going
outside just once again just really just
a word of caution that a video if it's
pulling your hair out with complexity
and things like that it just may be that
you're just not ready for that or that
you know this particular problem that is
that is being addressed or discussed and
things like that it's not your problem
and that maybe you shouldn't try to make
it into a problem if it's going to deter
you from being able to be productive
maybe with something else that doesn't
that you know that matters a little bit
more to I guess your productivity all
right guys thanks for watching man have
a good day bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
