out for coming my website website is
down I'm actually aware of it so hipster
code I noticed the other night that it
was down for like two days because the
node the hosting company that I use and
I can't really prove this I don't know
what the hell happened or maybe it's
Namecheap or something but all I know is
that the node did some sort of then
update like Xen whatever however you
pronounce that it's some sort of
software that they use for their servers
they had to do some sort of security
patching or something and then you know
once they did that all of a sudden my
HTTPS is it has crashed like so engine X
that serves my static content for my
website so I hipster code wasn't able to
restart and and it gave an error message
when I looked at the logs that said that
the key value pairs for the the security
didn't match I can show you the error
actually I can't show you I don't have
it up anymore but basically the
certification for the HTTPS so I bought
their name sheet it says that the the
cert that was generated from the key
because then it was open SSL for HTTPS
to make sure that data transmitted from
the browser to the server is encrypted
HTTPS requires that you like would open
SSL you generate a key and then you pass
the key to like Namecheap or whoever
you're going to get your SSL certificate
from and then when you pass that in you
get like a cert file back and I and when
I I had it all set up and working and
then apparently whenever node or the
node updated their their website with a
server can't talk today man but anyway
they updated the server and it didn't
work at all so tried to fix it real
quick I never wanted to figure out the
how the problem was why am I even
talking about all this time talking
about this because it stops trying to
run your own startup or your own website
and in one of the reasons why projects
don't ever seem to get off the ground
especially my own is that
like they've become such a headache to
deal with like for instance with this
hipster code thing I might end up trying
to tackle the issue tonight I know what
I have to do it's gonna take me like an
hour to regenerate another key and and
do DNS verification through Namecheap
which is a real piece of by the way
and then and then get my third and you
know obviously upload it and update my
engine tags virtual host files for
hipster code so the HTTP works and why
do I need to do that I need to do that
because like if I do let me just also by
the way another reason why having a
startup stocks is because like there's
this website here I was paying somebody
to write and it was just losing money
every month like I couldn't I couldn't
afford to pay somebody anyways you can
see that Google has indexed the HTTPS
version of the site so somebody tries to
go here and click on this article
they're going to end up getting that the
page is not found because it's not
listening on HTTPS anymore so I had to
disable that because if it was listening
on HTTPS I would get one of this flag
messages that said hey this site is not
you know trusted blah blah blah and
another way they of both situations are
pretty terrible but yeah I don't have
anybody writing for me anymore at the
moment like this is the kind of
direction that it was being taken was
basically a more controversial to
everything to try to generate activity
and spark and all that and that's just
really number one doesn't work and
number two it's not really direction I'm
trying to go so yeah that's that's all
done but anyway I mentioned all this
stuff because it's a complete pain in
the ass having to deal with this type of
stuff like I'm busy like I come home I
don't have to redo this I just had to do
it like a week ago when I had to renew
my HTTPS because it had expired and I
was being notified day one that it
wasn't working but like you're not
getting paid for this effort and so if
you want to do a startup man you have to
have like you know you have to put your
your heart and soul into it otherwise
it's not going to work
and a lot of people just don't really
want to do that like I was talking to a
guy the other day they had a pretty good
idea but he's like yeah I'm only really
you know I can only really devote you
know the weekends to doing it well like
nothing's ever going to work in that
case like you can't build a technology
startup as far as I'm concerned and just
working on the weekends I don't I don't
see how that's possible
and then another thing too like when you
look at like you know content is king so
either they've said that for the longest
time you know right you know you need
content all that that's all
 dude I'm sorry for cussing but
it really is you know Google and I've
said this before Google Google gives you
what you think you want you know or what
it thinks you want it really Google is
giving you what they want and and the
thing is you don't know what you don't
know so when you're searching something
you're just automatically assuming that
Google is giving you the best results
and stuff like that I mentioned all that
because it really sucks you have to play
you know by Google's rules and then even
still like you you can't get any sort of
like recognition or anything like for
instance I had somebody that I was
paying to write articles for six months
and for six months I was taking a loss
on these articles and they were being
written they were unique it's not like
it was like some of you know randomly
generated stuff for somebody's copying
and pasting or retaining words around
they were truly unique articles in the
sense that they were not being copied in
the information however Google doesn't
give hipster code any credit whatsoever
and it could be for different things
like maybe the JavaScript that's running
on it and so a lot of the blogs are
using quills yes maybe that is something
to do with it
either way I know that I didn't get any
search engine optimization from from the
six months of effort at all like
whatsoever so it's like Google
completely controls your destiny so
whether you want to be you know a nice
or niche focused website or you want to
have a Content website and then talk
about everything like technology
programming man good luck dude like it
it's almost impossible because unless
you're like CNET and TechCrunch and
hacker news and a few other ones like
it's like you might as well be on page a
million you're in a deep
web dude like you're not getting your
ACTA to get sound and why is all that
man I don't know it's because there's
hundreds of millions of websites out
there there's so much blogging and
content it's impossible to be able to
keep up with all of it like it's
impossible for me to follow all my
youtubers or for the 67,000 people that
are subscribed to me to view all my my
videos and everything that I put out
every other day like there is a excess
of content on the web unlike anything
we've ever seen before so like there's
the chances of being able to rise up and
be able to get notice and stuff like
that is next to impossible you look at
stuff like um this is coming off very
negative actually but it's just it's
like a dose of reality basically I'm
talking about content so I'm not saying
all your ideas are or anything
I'm just simply saying content based
websites are a terrible idea
and I know that firsthand box office
Motel used to look like a terrible
website look at this thing we're in the
process of updating Jesus it's so bad
that they're just took it offline while
they're updating it that's that's pretty
funny but it's interesting that box
office mojo is actually owned by Amazon
Amazon owns box office mojo why it's
because Amazon wanted that search engine
optimization that box office mojo you
know that search engine
fairy dust that they've agreed that
they've gained over the years for being
like you know there's a go-to for box
office ratings and things like that so
why didn't Amazon buy it well they
bought it because they wanted to
complement what they've done with IMDB
which is another website that they own
so when it comes to movie data like IMDB
was a bootstrap company they were one of
the first ones in the industry to get
into the web and to actually you know
pay a lot of people to get all this
updated information they were bought by
Amazon for I think like 300 million
dollars like a long time ago but so
you're probably thinking oh that's great
I want to have a 300 million dollars at
web site as well but what I'm talking
about is that when they did it like it
was a different ballgame like the
playing field was completely different
the rules were different and the rules
that we have now like I said as far as I
can tell they're next to impossible
Google says that they don't look at page
ranks and they don't look at meta tags
and all this other stuff I think
honestly that at this point Google is
just looking at almost all menu or like
intervention and it's all about germane
Authority through their own secret like
oh I'm going to give IMDB a ton of
credit I'm going to give Wikipedia a ton
of credit I'm going to give basically a
top you know a few hundred websites a
ton of credit and everybody else is
going to eat scraps so you're going to
get content from those websites unless
it's a very very nice focused thing like
so you write a blog about a specific
programming problem that you run into
granted you're going to get a decent
amount of search traffic but if it does
if any sort of stack overflow question
comes up and it gets answered over top
of you do good luck because you're going
to get buried managed stock overflow is
going to be right on top of you so and
get all getting all your traffic getting
all the revenue that you should have
gotten for your unique content but it's
all because of the rules you know that
Google has created to try to fight spam
in the flight you know basically just
see the excess amounts of content that
we have available on the internet so
yeah they're content sites are good log
dude you're screwed not going to work I
would if I would if I do a content based
website I would go I would I would
probably be like super and drill down
and you know I wouldn't even like
normally I would say oh just be
passionate about what you're talking
about Volvo nobody's passionate when
they're writing a bunch of stuff or you
know they're trying to promote a bunch
of stuff like even with the tutorials
and things like that and nobody's
watching it and nobody's paying for it
like it's just oh man like you can't you
can't keep up motivation like that for
sure but anyway so the whole gist of
this video is just simply that if you're
going to do some sort of startup you're
going to put your heart and soul into it
I would seriously reconsider any sort of
content based website that you might
have I would try to build an app I
really would I would go for data unique
and unique you know there's always a
better way to display data so if you're
going to do data whatever it may be even
if it's in movies or whatever it is you
know focus on the data aspect of it
and
something creative with that data that
nobody else is doing otherwise you know
create a product that helps people in
their day-to-day lives so alright guys
