cryptographic algorithm it's like a hash
algorithm I'm not a cryptographer I
don't know much about this stuff but the
shot one algorithm is is important
because it's being used right now was
good but the reason why I'm bringing it
up now is just a couple weeks ago Google
announced the first ever like collision
of the sha-1 hash algorithm from what i
was told when i was learning about get a
long time ago and you know kind of
touched over the the surface but i could
have sworn like they said something
along the lines of literally like it's
more atoms that ended in exist and like
in entire Earth for the universe I you
know I can be way off i don't i don't
know but the point is like the
possibilities of a collision are
absolutely astronomical like literally
this algorithm right here explains it
and you would have something to this
effect which is it's an astronomical
unlikely possibility that you're ever
going to have to hash keys collide so
the reason why like I said sha-1 is
important is because it's usually get so
a lot of people are freaking out because
google recently announced that you know
the security breach has has has occurred
and and just for the record google has
been trying to prove that the sha-1
algorithm is not you know not states
against brute force attacks and things
like that for for many years now so it's
been around though for decades like
we've been using this is a very common
way of hashing something here so here
you can see that they Google actually is
providing evidence of 22 documents that
share the same hash key which is like
like I said the possibilities of that
happening happening is like or really
you look at that number like literally
it suits I think that number is probably
greater than the amount of milliseconds
and like you know probably the time left
on earth or something like that like all
right I could be off on that as well it
might be too like one hundred and
eightieth anyway it into the point is
that it was extremely unlikely that an
collision could ever occur so even
though people knew that you know this
possibility through brute force and
things like that it wasn't something
that was easily provable so it is this
study that Google was actually working
with so enable learn whether sorry the
CWI Institute whoever the hell that is
in Google research to carry so this this
collision that they were able to to
recreate and actually show to the world
it shows you it says these here are some
numbers that give a sense of how large
of scale this computation was nine
quintillion sha-1 computations in total
so they did nine quintillion oh my
goodness that's the biggest number ever
I don't even know how much more than a
billion so that's one hundred thousands
of the millions hundreds of billions and
hundreds of trillions and whatever comes
after a trillion so yeah obviously there
that is a humongous number and they did
that many computations before they could
actually find a collision and then it
would took 6,500 years of CPU
computations to complete the attack
first base so literally if you had you
know once you I'm assuming that would
take you six thousand five hundred years
to actually be able to to do that this
is 110 years of GPU computation to
complete the second phase so so
literally eat up six thousand five more
years in the first one a GPU obviously
is much faster than then a CPU but the
the actual i'm not sure if they say how
much it actually costs to conduct a
study somebody was telling me the other
day that it was like literally hundreds
of millions of dollars to conduct a
study but like i said google has been
trying to push people to the shops
sha256 algorithm so it's much more
secure eventually our computers will
probably be able to you know to breach
that on on a relatively frequent basis
but the question really at this point
though with sha-1 being breached and
being able to provide evidence that hey
you can run into these collisions and
therefore if you could actually create
the collisions through super powers
through super computers and things like
that then you could technically
manipulate data
in repositories like such as the
repositories that use git which is most
repositories to say hey nothing's
changed here because but really you've
changed and injected all kinds of shit
into the code you know that could spy on
end users and things like that please so
you're hashing algorithm that get uses
with your shot one would be able to pick
up on something like that so that's kind
of the the entire premise line that so
you think of like who the hell capable
that will really governments are so like
it's not like it's out of there it's not
like it's out of the question that I can
you know Chinese over a Russian
government American government could
come up with something to breach these
you know these algorithms so that's
clearly what you know what Google was
trying to display to everybody now the
sha-256 algorithm was also created by
the NSA that created the sha-1 so I
suppose Americans it would seem we're
leading the way with in you know that
cryptographic study it would seem I
could be wrong on that but typically the
people that create these algorithms
probably also have a way of easily being
able to to break them I would imagine so
the real question right now is get
unsecured like do we have to worry about
get it going to have to like update
itself because these new security
breaches this just came out a couple
weeks ago so the answer to that is most
likely no here's Linus Torvalds he's
actually and it's actually pronounced
Salinas I believe Lina's or Elena's in
his own country but everybody calls them
lineup because of Linux and at least in
the American one but he actually created
the linux operating system back in the
80s 1991 I'm sorry so as well so 90 91
he created a Linux operating system and
he's considered like the golden child of
open open standards and free software
and all this other stuff so what's funny
about that he's actually not really the
near the golden child that the media
portrays him out to be like he doesn't
have anything against you know companies
making money and things like that so you
know when he came out with Linux at the
time Microsoft was dominating the OS
market
I'm estas and things like that so
personal pcs were all using Microsoft
they still allowed to a large extent but
you know when he was he was only in his
early 20s when they release Linux so he
never really thought about you know
charging money for it and things like
that if I key made it completely free
without trooper postcards from people
that were actually using it from around
the world but in hindsight like you
actually wish he would have asked for
more money I'm sure he's a millionaire
by tana by now you know many times over
but you're looking at the possibility of
a difference between like a millionaire
and impossibly boards you know hundreds
of millions maybe even a billion so here
is people where they going to do about
on a side note like I was looking at
this apple campus man this thing is
absolutely ridiculous like this
spacecraft building that they've been
working on now for the last like several
years is supposed to be ready next month
finally so it's a four-story structure
as 2.8 million square footage of space
and I'm just like looking at it it's
like if that bitch doesn't have a train
like how are you going to get from one
side to the other you're going to cut
across the middle you know this is like
a really really far away shot so this
place is absolutely humongous so that
I'm really curious how they're going to
get people from one side of the building
to the other because that thing is a
monster so that was definitely
interesting it's not like Apple has a
shitty canvas at the moment like they
have a pretty nice campus it's almost
like a college system there's buildings
all over the place but you know that's
what happens when you Apple became
obviously they were just rolling in cash
with their iphone enough and the you
know the max max blowing up and
everything popularity so many way Linus
uh he came out and said that really you
know get isn't it's not you you're not
in jeopardy you know continuing you'd
get so maybe one day they will try to
update see the algorithm but the way it
works is that it monitors and your root
directory any changes that are being
made to the files for whatever branch
dear I've checked out and it uses that
shelwyn algorithm because literally nine
quintillion you like you could make so
many different changes and not come
anywhere near a fraction of that number
and any you know give a repository but
how
maybe thousands of developers still
wouldn't come close to that number so it
uses that algorithm though to keep track
of changes between you know what was
there before what was there now that way
it can it can pick up on you know
converge conflicts and what's changed on
other stuff so the answer to the
question though is it's really not going
to go away just because Google spent you
know five hundred million dollars or a
couple hundred million dollars on this
study probably to to build these
supercomputers to break this algorithm
and prove that you know the shops you
could do six is a better idea it's not
like the sky's following anything like
that so even Linus as said that in
himself so we're going to continue to
use get by the way get is a dream come
true compared to TFS like I've been
using again but I've been for source
control repository xiamen I come from a
background he's professionals the last
you know for half years or so of using
team founder accountant for Team
Foundation server as a means of you know
and handling code repositories and
things like that I'm checking an
emerging conflicts with TFS you always
ends up the server up so when the server
went down you couldn't work but we get
you can work offline but just even
dealing with like merge conflicts I
would much rather use the command line
like I'm trying to turn into like a
command-line ninja with with them and
just using a just basic kid like to me
there are so many frustrating moments
that I've had dealing with Microsoft
chrome bases and trying to merge in
conflicts and stuff like that we're like
it is just like like I says the dreams
I'm sure it makes it so friggin easy to
deal with if I have a problem I can
aboard my merge I can fix things up I
can branch I can clone that I just did
the entire league just married it's very
very simplistic and it just works and
like it's all thanks to Linus you
actually created all that so anyways I'm
not trying to bust on Team Foundation
server writing like that back team
foundation forever you can still use
their server but you get as your so I
forgot the word version control system I
don't really call a version control so
that's what it is TFS has its own
version control to
as well as i get is its own separate
version control but you can use get with
and TFS so anyway that alright guys
that's really all I got tonight thanks
for watching make sure you guys
subscribe and have a good day bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention des Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12 week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here and now for web development some of
the things that are actually teaching in
the 12 week course it's geared to get
you into the industry by focusing on
things like jQuery nodejs react angular
how to use github so a lot of the things
that you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp in the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description proud of this video thank
you for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
