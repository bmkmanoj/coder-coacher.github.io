we're gonna do is start with Python and
everybody starts off in every
programming tutorial with a simple hello
world program so it's just a simple
program that outputs a statement hello
world and we're gonna write in Python
now as far as these Python tutorials are
concerned I'm not gonna explain how to
install Python I mean go go on the web
type in install Python paper version you
want
I would suggest either 2.6 or 2.7 that's
really the stuff that I deal with a lot
of the libraries that are out there
right now they don't work with the
Python 3 series and up so I would
definitely stick with like it like I
said a t7 it's a good bet and you're
gonna want to make sure that you do have
Python properly installed and one way to
do that is if you type CMD pull up your
command prompt which is ms-dos and if
you type Python it should automatically
run Python this interpreter this virtual
interpreter that it has and ctrl Z to
exit now if you don't have that hooked
up you're gonna want to look into number
one installing Python number two you
need to add Python to your environment
variables so just once again look that
up I apologize there's a million
tutorials online and everybody's
operating system is a little bit
different so that's why it's better you
just go out there do a quick search
don't try to look at whatever everybody
else is doing just you know for your
specific operating system get Python
installed properly so that when you type
python necessary everything i'm gonna do
i'm gonna save it under a training
directory so under my c drive I have a
projects directory in a training
directory you can save your programs
whatever you want but that's where I'm
gonna put mine
and let me go ahead and launch my IDE
and that stands for integrated
development environment everybody has
their own option here I'm using active
state comodo which is not free it's
actually quite expensive so I personally
like it I recommend it but most likely
if you're just learning programming just
download a free editor like I would
recommend like a ton of studios it has a
free one and that's apt a na Studios you
could use something like crimson editor
notepad plus plus I'm just a few other
ones and but you want to get some sort
of program running that can actually
that you can write your code in because
you don't want to just use a regular
notepad file that'll be a disaster so
let's go ahead and write our first
program and all you have to do in Python
is say print now in order to save this
as a Python file so that the computer
knows to run it and invoke the Python
interpreter which will be installed on
your machine we're gonna go to if I said
training
yeah we're gonna do it under training
here I saw I got these other files in
here that I'll delete them later but
anyway let's go ahead and save this will
save hello world and you want to do a
dot py on the end so it saves it as a
Python file and if you notice too this
is a simple casing called camel casing
it's the way most programmers work
everybody has their own preference but
what it does is you keep the first word
with no capitals and then you capitalize
any word after the first word so hello
world the W is capitalized and that's
called camel casing because it's like a
camel home alright so we're going to
save that and pull this joint out
remember sorry I don't even remember if
we just we put in a training goddamnit
right now man alright so there you see
it's it's their hello world dot py so in
order to run it we just say hello world
and then you see it prints out hello
world so I'm gonna go ahead and kill
this first video we just want to do the
simple hello world the program that's
all it is so that's your first
successful program hopefully you're able
to do it and I apologize if I do use
cuss words sometimes I just try to keep
people's attention and make sure that
I'm paying attention as well all right
I'll talk to you guys later I and we'll
do some more programming in the next
