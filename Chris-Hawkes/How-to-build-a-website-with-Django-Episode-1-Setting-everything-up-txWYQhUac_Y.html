because first things first we're be
trying to build a website as quickly as
possible you want to make sure you have
Python installed and then virtual
environment I'm using Python 2 7 so go
ahead and pull up a command prompt and
I'm going to go to I'm going to put my
project on my projects directory if you
have virtual environment installed you
should just be able to go a virtual D&amp;amp;V
and then I'm going to call it on B G C D
and V and this is going to go through
and create a virtual environment which
can finds your Python set up to one
particular directory from one particular
project so when you install new modules
and things it's not going to interfere
with other projects that are using
Python once that's done you should be
able to go ahead and CD into my BGC all
right in called us at a B G C and B a
and B all right now go into scripts and
then click a type activate and now
you'll notice that we're inside of this
virtual environment so anything that you
installed now will be installed into
that virtual environment so we need to
add a few things since it's a Django
project we want to go to do pip install
and then I'm going to be doing django
1.5 so you can specify what version
after django by doing equal equal and
then i'm going to do 1 point 5 point 4
and this will go through and install
django for you
I'm also going to be using my sequel for
the project so you want to go to my
sequels website and download the
Installer if you're using Windows and
when you install it it's going to ask
you to create a root user so you're
going to need to know how you connect to
your my sequel server and that is stuff
that you set up on your own when you
install my sequel so make sure you have
that that taken care of as well
you
all right so notice that that is on move
one go ahead and use easy install to
install I think it's about Python my
sequel
I always forget the order of it it might
be my sequel Python ok so that worked on
so it's a my sequel Python alright so
once those things are done we should be
good and it's going to exit out of the
scripts here and I'm going to go all the
way to my projects folder here
and you know what I think I'm going to
go ahead and just create yeah I was just
trying to think if I want to put my
project in my environment or if I want
to keep it outside of the environment I
think I'll just keep it outside of the
environment it doesn't well you know
what we'll do it inside the environment
so go back in the BGC EMV and then this
is where we're going to go ahead and
create the Django project so we go
Python Django admin dot dy sorry about
that
and then Python Django admin py and then
there is a bug with virtual environment
where you have to spell out the exact
location where the virtual environment
can be found on you go z : actually do
that right here some of the C colon
forward slash projects /v g c e MV
scripts and then we're going to name our
project let us call it my project
okay that did not work one moment
you
yes I forgot the most important part
here where I say start project alright
so now that we've done that if you go
into if you do do a door on the
directory you see my project so that is
all good there next thing let's go ahead
and pull up whatever sort of editor you
plan on using I'm going to be using
Visual Studio and I'm going to go ahead
and just open website and then find the
new project that we just created
all right so I opened up my project
within the my project application by
default my project is the first module
created in the Python application and
let's go ahead and have some folders
here outside of within your your root
directory which is my project so I'm
going to have a folder called static I'm
going to keep it under lower case inside
static I'm going to add some more
folders I'm going to have a CSS folder
for my cascading style sheets I'm add
another folder for images I'm going to
add another folder for JavaScript and
I'll call that J is that static is done
I'm going to have another folder here
inside the project and it's going to be
for templates inside templates I'm going
to have enough alright so inside
templates I have another folder called
base I apologize the video that I'm
trying to record I'm trying to find the
right settings because this piece of
 keeps cutting off and like it's
kind of struggling to figure out where I
left off in things but anyway the
database engine this is inside my
settings that py file of my project
there is a database backends and you're
going to want to make sure it says dot
my sequel if you're using my sequel name
is the name of the database in my case
it's going to be called BGC and the root
user is root and then my password is
testing one two three port by default
should be three three zero six alright
now as we move down to our templates we
want to go and set the static route to
our application go forward slash static
forward slash then we want to go ahead
and grivet a static file directory here
and this is going to be the full spelled
out directory to where our static files
can be located so it's going to be
projects and then VGC
my project templates and that should be
fine go ahead and copy this part
actually we don't want that to be
templates that's right we want to get
these static with no forward slash I
think that should be fine
now go ahead and take this make sure you
have a comma after this because it is a
tuple and then go down to our template
directory paste this in here in this
instead of static is going to be
templates okay and that should be good
for right now I believe with our with
our settings file
alright so settings should be pretty
good let's go over to URLs we want to go
ahead and enable the backend
Django Administrator it's a good feature
that comes with Django so let's go to
make sure we make use of that uncomment
this first line this is a regular
expression hopefully on your going to
get to hang of this eventually but this
basically means match anything because
the caret sign means starting with the
dollar sign means ending with it so that
matches anything I'm going to change
home to just index and I'm going to get
rid of this name home I don't think I
need that so we'll just have index now
let's go over to my project and add a
file so I'm going to say a new item and
because I'm using Visual Studio it's not
a Python editor by default I have to go
to like text file which is weird and I'm
just gonna save use dot py so it'll save
it as a PI and file so now that I'm
inside views I want to go ahead and add
some stuff in here we're going to create
our first view which is define index the
first argument always when you're
building a view is that it's going to
take a request object we're going to
just a return render to response and
then this is going to be the template is
the first argument so it's going to be
in
dot html' it's going to by default look
in our templates directory that we just
set in the settings file I forget what
the rest of this stuff is on a second I
just kind of go off of what works before
let me go into one of my projects here
for another thing that I'm working on so
the two shortcuts I need to import or
right here just pause your video for a
moment and copy this and django
shortcuts render to response and request
context the way that it ends up being
sent back here we're going to add this
to the comma in one more parenthesis so
that should work so basically what our
application is called the root directory
of our application if it's your website
comm whatever it is new movies comm this
matches whatever that root directory is
and then it will route to index so it's
like a default page for our application
and now it's going to look for an
index.html template inside of our
templates folder so let's go ahead and
create that now I'm going to add a new
text file because I ran into a bug
before on a previous video and I'm not
sure if it's Django if it's chrome or if
it's Visual Studio I want to just keep
this a text file and just save it as a
dot HTML just for my shits and giggles
because I want to make sure that this
editor had no problem with this bug that
I was reporting earlier so inside here
let's go ahead and just say HTML had
to me a very basic setup here and then
we're going to go body body and then
let's start just test as testing page
one so we've done that everything should
be good there I think alright so now
that we've done that I think we're
pretty good let's go over to our command
line and we have our virtual environment
activated let's go in CD into my project
and in here you're going to notice that
manage that py file you're going to be
working with that a lot go ahead and
type Python manage py run server and we
should be able to go to this localhost
address of one to seven I'm going to do
that now
and properly configured installed apps
or is this
okay so we have to install okay well
yeah what what happened here let's go
over here into our settings file and
from our installed apps we want to go
ahead and uncomment the Django admin and
since we're in commenting this let's go
ahead and kill the server we're going to
a sy n c DB so sync DB and what that
does is it actually sy MCD and that
actually installs any sort of modules
that you have in your file that you've
added and one thing this just went
through and it created you're going to
see something different when you run my
sync DB it since my database already
exists for BGC I've already created the
auth and everything that you need all
tables that Django comes with the
management ocation it's going to go
through a little bit more stuff to
create the tables for you and you're
going to see to create a super user go
ahead and do that and you're going to
create a login and password for your
admin so now when we go back to run
server let's go back here and now this
actually works it found the template on
page one go into the admin and then this
is going to work I've set up mine as a
admin username and then testing one two
three I think anyway testing two free
yeah so that works I'm going to your
site's here and change this to whatever
the name of the site is that you're
working on so that's good so I have this
out like I said testing one two three
when you run that sync DB for the first
time you'll create this table since my
database happened to exist already
within my sequel it was just working now
if for some reason um you don't know how
to set up a database in my sequel what
you want to do is I'm just pressed if
you're using Windows 8 look for the my
sequel command-line client and here I
setup my password I think I'm
testing 1 2 3
and then you would just say create
database in my case it's called VGC it
already exists but whatever you want to
create and then put a semicolon after
the name of the database that you're
creating and that will create a database
and that's all you need to use the my
sequel client for and you'll be good to
go so and then you can just reference
that name of the database here all right
now just keep jumping into just getting
this mother F rolling going to based on
HTML I want to see if this thing
actually has the bug that I had
experienced earlier which was driving me
crazy and ought to just show it to you
but we're going to create a base to HTML
page and let's go ahead and add that to
base and all this stuff that's in index
let's go ahead and just copy that and
then put that into base all right and
now get rid of testing 1 and what you're
going to do is inside the squealing line
with a percent time we're going to say
block content and then we're going to
close that off and then we need to go
ahead and just give it an in block any
type of block content you have or block
whatever you want to call it you're
going to have an end block and you can
make up your own tags for whatever you
want and the benefit of doing this is
that it prevents duplication of code
because index can now go like this it
can say extends and then inside double
quotes we're going to say base for our
base directory and then we're going to
say based on HTML so it's going to
extend based on HTML and now we can say
inside of our block content we're going
to say if you give it a 10 block as well
and then here we can go ahead and say
testing page one so we test page one and
index we're extending from based on HTML
let's go ahead and see if this works go
back to your application go back to your
root directory and you can see testing
page one is working and let's see if
this
yeah the bug persist the bug is there I
have no idea and I've actually submitted
this on Stack Overflow nobody else seems
to have any idea but you see these tags
being inserted into the body here this
is the craziest I've ever seen
we're just going to have to ignore this
right now because this is just this
error only occurs when you extend from
base HTML and it only seems to occur
within windows as far as I can tell
windows 8.1 django 1.5 using Chrome and
Internet Explorer because if I use
Firefox which we may just use Firefox
from this moment on because this is not
going to be something that plagues you
 maybe this is not going to be
something that bugs you when you go into
production
something here I'm going to pull up
Firefox and show you what I'm talking
about here because this only persist
with chrome watch this it doesn't do
that gap you see that gap doesn't
have this dynamically inserted thing if
you right-click on the source
semantically it's all appearing
correctly so you're not going to have
this problem it's it's something to do
with Chrome and maybe the development
server some sort of local thing and the
reason why I say this is because the
exact same methods are used on a site
I'm using Django 1.5 Python t7 for this
website that I own right here new movies
and I mean this this has no problems
it's all the same thing there's no crazy
insertion of logic or anything like that
so so I mean it has absolutely nothing
to do with a Django or anything like
that this is just a temporary bug I'm
assuming that is going to be resolved
for the local development server but in
the meantime I do want to continue to
use the based on HTML because that is
the proper way to build your website and
we're just going to debug inside of
Firefox so hopefully Chrome if it's
their problem they can fix their
and we can move on all right now inside
head we need to have a title that's what
it's complaining about right now title
we're going to put that into a block
content will say block title and once
again everything is have an unblocked
all right now it's going to add a few
things actually I want to kill this
video now in the next video we're going
to really start getting set up with some
of the UI stuff that we're going to be
dealing with thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
