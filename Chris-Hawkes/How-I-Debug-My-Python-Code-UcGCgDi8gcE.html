wanted to do a short and sweet video and
one of my editors that I like to use is
just a text editor but it's the atom
editor and it really falls short when it
comes to actually stepping through your
code and figuring out what's going on
granted Python has some tools like PDB
and those are you can print the stack
trace and stuff like that but all that
stuff kind of sucks to be honest like
having to deal with that a visual studio
and there's another reason why I've said
that c-sharp is one of the better
languages as you start getting into
really complex development you really
need some good tools to make your life
easier visual studio I think is better
than pycharm some of you Python
developers may disagree I just
personally I think visual studios is
really made some major headway
especially with 2015 and now and you can
have Python included you know by default
but a lot of this you know built-in
stuff that it's just so beneficial so
one of the things that I was playing
with tonight is the Python request
library and I actually wanted to step
into the Python request code and I
really didn't have any way an on hawkish
way of being able to do it with the atom
editor or anything like that so what I
want to show you guys is how I would go
about this if I so here's the the Python
request folder it's in my projects
directory first things first I would do
a virtual environment I'm just going to
name it env that's typically what I'm
calling my environments nowadays I don't
know why but so I'll say virtual
environment and then I'm gonna say no no
- site packages so I don't want any
packages being shared through the global
Python installation so python 3.5 is
installed on my Windows machine it's
going to go through it's going to
install pip and all that crap for me and
then once this is done I can go ahead
and activate my environment so I'm going
to do this longer way where you go into
the env which is the name of the
environment we just created we'll go
into the scripts folder and I just
simply say activate if you're on a Linux
you would say source activate and then
I'm going to go back to my root
directory here and then I'll just say
pip install requests which is for the
Python request live
so this is just gonna install Python
requests inside my virtual environment
so you're gonna see here that if i go in
i go into lib going to site packages
within the lib folder you can now see
request is in there and it's only
installed in this one virtual
environment so now the benefit of this
though is that this virtual environment
has everything it needs in the sense
that python will be able to operate from
within this environment when my virtual
environment is activated and it's not
going to contaminate or mess with any
other projects that i may have going on
now now that i have all that in setup
here let's go ahead and we want to open
this project inside of Visual Studio so
if I open visual studio I can go to open
or in fact I'm gonna say new project and
as long as you have Python tools at the
tools installed you're gonna see other
languages if I click on Python I can say
from existing code here is where I'm
gonna actually give the folder for my
python request library so I'll just
select that folder there and then I can
give this a name and I'll just call this
python request click OK and this is just
saying that it's the default directory
so we'll click Next now it's asking if
we want the global or an auto detective
virtual environment so it will give it
the right Python version since I have
multiple versions of Python installed on
this machine this next one it says
detect virtual environment so hopefully
this thing will be able to detect that I
have a virtual environment in the
directory where I'm trying to open this
project or essentially create this new
project in Visual Studio so this is
telling me what my my PI proj file is
going to be called Visual Studio has
something called a solution file and the
solution file is used by Visual Studio
to open all the files and projects
related to one particular solution that
you deem you know necessary every time
you open a visual studio to open the
solution a solution can contain multiple
projects and
ton of files but you typically want to
keep you know solutions you don't want a
humungous solution I've seen it where
you gave them so big that Visual Studio
can barely manage them but essentially
solutions can contain multiple projects
and the project file is more Python
related that way you can port that
project from one environment to another
but here make sure this detect virtual
environment is selected so now you if
you look inside here if I go into my env
folder you can see I have Python 3.5 and
I know the text is kind of small I
apologize I can't really get this any
bigger that without going through some
some major work here but here you can
see all the different libraries and
everything inside my virtual environment
now that's all code and Visual Studio
that says hey we detected the
environment so it found my env
environment that I had created when I
first started this video but what you
want to do is go over to the solution
Explorer and go to the show all files
and when you click on that you're going
to see the actual env folder shows up
and that's what we want so I'm gonna
actually include this entire environment
into my project now this is a lot of
files and it may not even be a good good
idea to do this but essentially this is
what I'm gonna do so take the advice or
not but it might slow down your solution
just a little bit because it's gonna be
quite a bit of files that are going to
be added all right so that took a bit of
time but now that I've done that if I go
into my Lib and I go into the site
packages you can see that I have all
this stuff in here so here's the Python
request library so here is all the
source code that I can you know that is
part of this library so I click on any
of this stuff and you can see that I
have all the source code so that's cool
alright so let's create a first file
here that we want to use and I'm gonna
go to my just my project folder there
and I'm gonna say add new item
I feel like normally it's not this slow
but I do have a lot of applications open
right now
and I'm also screen capturing so inside
here we'll just create an empty Python
file and we'll just call this start dot
py so here I want to say import requests
and then we'll say URL equals WordPress
if I could spell that correctly got get
and then here I'm going to give the name
of the website that I own I'm not
requesting anybody else's and then we
can say print so you can see that this
thing wants to
all right let me let me go ahead and try
to run this now so now we need the
market as a start-up file we need to
tell Python where to start so I'm gonna
right-click on the file and I'll say set
as startup file and now you can see it's
a little bit bolder I know that the
fonts small I'm sorry again so now when
I execute this you can see okay we get
this Unicode error which really isn't
that big of a deal but in fact if I
wanted to get that resolved I could just
say ut encode utf-8 so I can click stop
and click run so now I'm able to execute
my program right from the command line
which is nice
if I wanted to get this a little bit
larger I could go to my font will make
it real large there we go
so it's printing all the text so it's
pretty ugly looking obviously but I can
close that out but obviously at the
click of a button now I can just run the
Python program so it's much easier but
where it gets even better is that if I
wanted to put a breakpoint like if I put
a breakpoint here and I go ahead and
click start let me minimize this again
so now you can see that this part is
stuck at this breakpoint line so if I go
in click on this URL object I can go in
the URL I can see everything that this
URL which is really a request class
object consists of you can see it has
cookies which is like a cookie jar class
object there you can see its encoding is
utf-8 so even though it's utf-8 it's
still choked until I actually encoded it
as utf-8 explicitly so you would think
that might be a bug I'm not sure and
then you see all the headers and
everything so all those headers being
sent and then if we go down to the text
this is where you can see the actual
HTML of the page so since we've
requested let me copy all this
so I could right click copy value open
up a notepad and paste that in there so
you can see all the source code for the
page and in case you didn't know you
know if I type so you can see we're at
hipster code comm so we're definitely
here's the title hipster code home so we
definitely went across the web we
grabbed the source code all that stuff
exists inside the Python request library
but once again if I uh if I click on
like f12
for this get it should pull up
information in fact let me stop
debugging real quick if I click up f12
this tells me the I in it so here's
where it's grabbing get so I'm not
exactly sure
yeah I'm not sure if I want to get into
all this but if I do ctrl shift F I can
actually search the entire solution
which is going to search through all
those lid packages and everything and I
can explicitly state that I just want to
search the request library folder if I
wanted to do that like you have all
kinds of options when you say inside
here how you want to search I could say
find options I can give like regular
expressions and all that stuff this is
where it says entire solution so I may
not want to select the entire solution I
can even I'm just explicitly state
projects and I'll go to my Python
request EMV Lib site packages and I can
even say request and then give us a
custom name we'll just call this request
click apply click ok so now I can say
just looking request and I can say get
so now it's only gonna look inside that
request folders and I can start going
through all the code where references
get so you can see here a lot of this
stuff is inside just uh but basically if
you want to start learning a lot of the
ins and outs of a Python library like
this you absolutely have to have some
sort of editor you have to have a
debugger and I prefer Visual Studio so
once again I mean I use Visual Studio a
lot but this is one of the reasons why
you would want to use Python tools with
Visual Studio to get some of this you
know to basically get a better
understanding of how stuff works so
anyway guys let me know if you want me
to give more videos on how I would go
about debugging and stepping through a
complex program but you can if you had a
similar setup like this you could
actually set breakpoints in the actual
source code of the libraries that you're
interacting with and not just the code
that you're writing yourself so it's a
very it's an invaluable at the way to
save but it's it's definitely a very
trusty tool that you need if you
any sort of complex debugging not just
in Python but really any language for
that matter all right guys so this is
just another example of one of the
reasons why Visual Studio Microsoft does
do a good job when it comes to debugging
and tools for programmers alright guys
