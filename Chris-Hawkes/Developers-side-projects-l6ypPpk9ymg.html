reading a blog by Joel Spolsky who is
the CEO of Stack Overflow and he
actually helped found Stack Overflow
along with Jeff Atwood they founded the
website in 2008 and Joel here is has
wrote this blog that um I mean he raises
some good points but essentially if you
read this blog what it's saying is that
that any sort of developer that's
working for a company they should have
to sign some sort of an agreement saying
that anything that they develop on their
own time even if it's completely you
know unrelated to the work that they're
doing and that it belongs to the company
that they work for because that there is
no way to know whether or not this
creative ambition or drive or idea had
come from while you were you know
working essentially nine-to-five or you
know was it something that you were
actually going at home so one of the
reasons why I hate this article and I
don't know this guy personally but you
know I just I you know I hate where he's
going with it is he sent he says at one
point that companies are negligent if
they don't get you to assign to sign
those agreements and that you
shouldn't work for them anyway so
essentially he's trying to use as his
own his own you know value in the
marketplace in his own influence to try
to force other companies in my opinion
to get you know to get on board with
doing this arrangement of
getting people to sign away you know
essentially their own creative freedoms
as if there's some sort of slave to
their employer I mean this isn't where
what programming should be about I mean
there are so many different areas of
programming it's impossible for a
company to say whether or not an
employee was actually doing something
that is related to the business for
instance if you are Google and you
mentions Google they did everything they
do everything under the Sun so if if
you're creating a geographic here are
some geolocation application but your
entire job is like text parsing within
the Google search or messing with the
Google
algorithm it's it's not related in any
way shape or form but he's basically
saying while google can't really prove
that it's not related and in the burden
of proof you know maybe put on them but
you know on paper it says if these
arrangements are a sign that you know
really the the burden is on the the
creator the person that came up with
these ideas and they're off time and I
think it's just it's a crappy way to you
know give companies more power than they
already have over people you know they
almost treat them as an indentured
servant or a slave like I said and
really I think the danger comes in
because it's gonna a hurts innovation so
a lot of companies and things are
founded by people that get ideas you
know people have dreams and ambitions
and I've talked about this a lot and you
know they should be able to pursue those
dreams and ambitions on their own time
and with programming the it's just it's
a means to an end to be able to build
whatever sort of dream or vision you
have and and that could be in gaming or
mobile apps or anything I mean it could
be an assembly programming but you know
the point is is that there should be you
know a clear separation between anything
that you're writing at work any sort of
proprietary you know algorithms software
even tools that you're using versus you
know coming home and you may be using a
completely different you know set of
skills or something along those lines
you have to really be careful I think
when you're trying to do this stuff you
know on the side but I really think it's
it's shitty because Joel was supposedly
you know some sort of hackers friend and
clearly he's not he's got you know every
and he's not on the hacker of the
program or the creator side at all he's
now you know fully you know business
mode he owns Stack Overflow and if you
work for him and you do anything on the
side then based on his arguments here
that he owns you he owns all that that
creative drive that you have because it
probably came from while you run the
clock working for him so this brings up
the next point I think that you know
this is going to end up having to lead
the way to software creators uh you know
having a union I mean unions are about
making sure that employers cannot
exploit their their their employees I
mean that they can't treat them poorly
and and this is part of you know what is
being yeah I think being treated poorly
let's like let's just back up for a
second when Jeff Atwood created Stack
Overflow there may have been like a
six-month gap or something and that's
probably because he signed some sort of
contract but there's no doubt that you
know Jeff Atwood had a plan this site
and probably wanted to build a Q&amp;amp;A site
for a long time he'd probably had a lot
of skills to build that site based off
of his previous employer so he was
working at a place just six months
before he started Stack Overflow
once again these guys probably once
again being an IT or were under the same
sort of contracts and agreements and
that's probably why they waited six
months or so but it's just like I still
think that you can probably make an
argument from his previous employer The
Hague maybe they own some of you know
Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange
because at one point Jeff Atwood was
working for them just before launching
that codebase another thing too is um
you know Stack Overflow is not that
impressive it I mean it's an impressive
site in the fact that the community
makes it impressive so I don't think
these guys should get in too far over
their head and think that you know
they've they've somehow made the world a
better place and that you know their way
goes and stack over closed a lot of
things but it's all been based around
the community there's nothing that that
blows you away with with regards to the
codebase or anything like that I mean
it's it's plain NBC Net and I mean the
the site works great but like all I'm
what I'm saying is that this dude didn't
land on the moon he didn't design a
rocket ship that that left the solar
system ring like that he designed the
freakin website in the community made it
good but I guess what I hate the most is
that this guy he has over a hundred
thousand followers on Twitter he used
his influence to to post this blog it
started training at the top of hacker
news so it's probably already been read
by millions of
people I'm sure you know thousands of
business owners and things like that
thinking oh I need to get all my
employees to sign these contracts and
then things like that and um you know
for that reason you know I don't want to
use stick overflow to be honest so I'm
gonna try to do my best to not support
this guy for his company's in any way
shape or form and this is the part of
the article where I feel like he's using
his stature to try to bully people into
his way of thinking where he says that
he said so they all try to do this as
far as getting them to sign contracts
and and you know makes make sure they
turn over all their creative freedoms to
the company they said you know he and he
said unless the company is being
negligent and has not arranged for
appropriate contracts to be in place in
which case the company is probably being
badly mismanaged and there's another
reason not to work there or maybe
they're just not a bunch of dicks I mean
have you ever thought about that what
about the fact that creative ambition
and drive comes back full tilt
I mean there's been times that I've
worked on technologies where I was
teaching other programmers how to tell
how to use this technology and we
weren't even using it in my place of
business and then several years go by
and then we start using it so it's like
I had all this this knowledge of how to
use software and things like that
because of creative drive and ambition I
helped other people in it and in some
way shape or form I'm sure it helps you
know the community as a whole get are
getting motivation and and you know
using the product more it doesn't matter
I mean even if it's just a small
influence it's still you know any any
good influence is good so in a way this
reminds me of the you know the total
hypocritical you mentality of
some of the most uh I guess top-notch
officials in the United States that end
up making millions sometimes billions of
dollars and then all you know and they
play by all these rules and cut all
these corners along the way but then
once they they they've arrived they want
to tell you you know what you can and
can't do and that's just the kind of
mentality I get out of this I mean it's
like this guy is most likely
you know worth a hundred million dollars
or more he lives in Manhattan and
probably some multi-million dollar
apartment complex I mean and he got
there most likely through the same
creative ambition than anybody else
would try to get there but if you work
for this guy you better be careful
because he apparently owns everything
that you've ever gone or thought of and
might think to do in the future that's
just my thoughts it pisses me off I
think it's a it's a terrible thing and
hopefully hopefully software engineers
eventually start unions to protect their
creative interest because otherwise it's
going to kill innovation I mean do we
really want just a bunch of nine-to-five
programmers that literally have no
interest in programming once they go
home I mean I've seen a lot of
nine-to-five programmers some of them
are able to you know turn that switch
off and they are effective at work and
things like that and others they have no
creative ambition they don't know about
the emerging technologies there's not
enough time to learn that stuff during
their day jobs and they end up falling
out of favor they fall out their skills
get will go out of date and then they
have a hard time finding new jobs and
you know things that they can work on
and they're just they're just behind so
one of the reasons why I feel like I can
avoid burnout and continue to stay up to
date is that if I go home I'm constantly
playing with other other technologies
things that I don't normally use but
things that I enjoy doing and it makes
me a better programmer so this is just
why I feel so strongly about this I
think that if we had everything Joel's
way and in the stupid Joel standard when
it comes to how well a company handles
their IT staff and things like that I
just said like I said I don't I'm gonna
do my best not to support Stack Overflow
all right guys thanks for watching have
a good day bye hey guys so I've talked
about this a lot Deb mountain coding
boot camp they are my sponsor they're
one of the reasons why I'm able to do
these videos and they offer a 12-week
intensive course that teaches you the
technologies of the here and now they're
gonna focus on a lot of things that are
actually being used and websites things
like jQuery and they're going
using stacks like nodejs the 12-week
intensive course is to try to get people
in the job market so that is their
entire focus we've talked a lot about on
this channel whether or not a college
degree is worth it I'm not the one to be
able to answer that question for you I
absolutely think that college degrees
are great especially in computer science
I never want to convince somebody to say
that they shouldn't do that you know
obviously schools like Stanford and MIT
I'm you know I'm an envy of all those
graduates however there is you know the
bulk of developers that don't
necessarily need to be the MIT graduates
to actually have success in the
programming world I think I speak
relatively well for for that type of
person and with coding boot camps we're
seeing them you know try to offer more
skills more modern-day skills because a
lot of times when you're going to a
computer science course and a major
university you're learning technology
that's already outdated by the time
you're learning it with Deb mountain and
coding boot camps like what Deb Mountain
offers they're focusing on really what
is hot right now so and they also focus
on a relatively you know a small set of
skills in order to make sure that they
are teaching you what you need to know
in order to be productive in a in a
workplace environment so make sure you
guys do me a favor do yourself a favor
check out the link in the in the
description tab below for more on Deb
Mountain coding boot camp thanks guys
