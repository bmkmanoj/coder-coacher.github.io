just talking about six things that came
to my mind that trip up beginners and
the reason why I'm making this video is
I have my Python tutorial series and
it's gotten a few hundred thousand views
over the last year and a lot of
beginners they constantly asked the same
questions so I think I think the six
items here I mean like I said it kind of
immediately jumped out at me I'm sure
I'm missing other things but I'm just
gonna go ahead and jump into the list
alright first this virtual environment
this is so hard to explain to people why
you would need to do this because they
don't understand packages they don't
understand virtual environments they
don't even understand how Python is
installed on a machine or how Python is
used to execute Python code like none of
that makes any sense so when you're
trying to explain how to set up virtual
environments and things like that when
they're first getting started it always
just like it's almost impossible for
somebody that hasn't been in this game
for you know a while I mean six months
or more probably for them to even be
able to start to grasp but you know some
of the stuff like virtual environment
and why we always use it so that is
something that I personally try to gloss
over when I'm trying to do Python
tutorials and things because I just feel
like it you know people aren't ready for
that and eventually we'll be ready for
all this stuff but right now like you
know as a beginner definitely virtual
environment just go ahead and have one
Python installation and just use your
pip install and don't worry about
virtual environments or anything that's
my advice anyway for absolute beginners
the next one is path and this one only
applies to Windows so this is probably
like the single worst thing that I've
had to deal with and Python because a
lot of Windows a lot of Python
developers especially newbies are using
Windows and in Python works fine on
Windows but when you're installing
Python it used to be that Python didn't
actually edit your path settings and you
would always have you would always have
to do that manually and that was always
a problem dating back you know even all
the way back to when I was first getting
into Python and then like with some of
the later three series of Python there
started to be this option that you could
check during the install to say hey I
had Python to my path but anyway if
people didn't check that box python
wouldn't run like Windows wouldn't know
how to execute a Python program
and like nothing works and and they get
immediately frustrated like and they're
not even they're not even at step one
and they're already like frustrated with
the entire process so yeah path is
something that has tripped up a lot of
Windows Python developers for a long
time next one is unit testing and this
is something that I would say beginners
should also gloss over because they're
gonna have a very hard time
understanding how unit tests even work
or even understanding you know basic
things like encapsulation and you know
how true your true unit test should
behave in a unit test versus a
regression test things like that a lot
of that stuff doesn't make any sense to
newbies and beginners and really the
only beginners that have to know that
kind of thing are the beginners that do
land a job you know fresh out of college
something like that that's where they
immediately need to start looking in the
unit testing and how they can start
writing unit tests for their code
because that's something they will have
to do day to day it's it so it's a
mandatory requirement of the job so I'd
say you know as soon as people can
feasibly get into unit testing that's
great but immediately right out of the
gate it's really not something that most
people should should jump into next one
is like IDE and really you could
probably say IDE versus a text editor
some people really know about the two
differences there but there are clearly
differences between an IDE which stands
for integrated development environment
and a text editor with IDE so like there
is much there's a lot of great solutions
like with my Python tutorial series I
always use Visual Studio code because
it's free in the Python extension for it
is is like it's really it's really easy
for me to be able to set up a debug
environment and it's free now pycharm is
kind of the leader with python ide s and
it's been that way for a while that's
made by the JetBrains people and anyway
there's other editors out there that you
can use including the actual you know
Visual Studio product or not even just
Visual Studio code but there's a lot of
different editors that's usually a
tripping point for people because they
want to know okay what is the best
editor well there is no such thing as
like the best editor and that stuff
changes your
a year and people's preference that
plays a lot into that so it's one of
those things where a beginner expects to
have somebody hold their hand and tell
them exactly what they should be using
we're like and that's just not something
that that Python people do really and or
really any any developer I mean if there
are certain languages like C sharp
really we're like Visual Studio is the
like the the de facto or the the
standard but with Python there isn't
really like a clear front and running
standard for IDE s I would say papaya
Tron is probably the closest thing to
that but anyway the next one is object
oriented or procedural I should say
versus procedural so those are two
different ways of actually writing
computer code object oriented
programming came about what like that
80's probably it was probably even way
beyond that but like sorry becoming like
a common thing in the 80s into the 90s
when you had you know Java which was
fully object-oriented and c-sharp or an
infrastructure so with with Python
things get really confusing because when
you start off with Python it's almost
always hello world examples and
everything is always done in a
procedural way whereas like if you find
in c-sharp like you can't have a
procedural way of doing a hello world
you have to do a fully object-oriented
you know console.writeline things like
that you have to have an actual program
with a main starting point things like
that
we're Python you have you don't know you
don't have to so you could just write a
script that is self-contained in one
file and just execute that script
manually and it's very easy to do and
that's why Python is a great first
language to teach people but then
somewhere along the lines when when you
want to develop a Django or an you know
an Instagram code base or anything major
with Python that's when you're going to
start building classes and you have to
start looking at class inheritance and
things like that and and that's where
people's mind gets blown and I have like
an equation here way or an anecdote
basically where it's like it's like
finding out that there's no Santa so you
learn this procedural way of doing
something and then realize that there's
a completely opposite way and in a way
that's much more hard for newbies to
wrap their minds around why
we we have object-oriented programming
but it's it it takes time to get into
that and for Python it's one of those
unique languages that can be both
procedural and object-oriented so
eventually you're going to have that
Santa moment next one is Len ting this
one is also driving me crazy lately
because um a lot of the editors like
Visual Studio code with its Python
extension like it's expecting you to
have Python linting extensions installed
as well and for the most part people
have to worry about linting like I've
never worried about lynching in any of
my personal projects because I I don't
have multiple people in my code base now
de-linting
is all it is is it it's a set of rules
that say hey when we have Python names I
want you know I want to use this
formatting or something like that I want
to use them you have to camel casing and
and there there could be rules that are
set on okay I just named the class
something with all under case and I need
to have that be Pascal casing or
something like that
well linting you define the rules and
then it just runs and it kind of watches
the code as it's being written and it
will provide little squigglies under the
lines of code that don't match up to
your Lenten rules what lending is great
for is it's great for getting a bunch of
different developers that write code in
a bunch of different ways all writing
code the same way under a you know a
unified set of of instructions that's
usually passed down through you know the
person in charge of the project or you
know the the most senior dev that's
assigned to the project but that said
like linting is not something that any
beginner developer needs to worry about
especially with Python and indefinitely
if I could update my tutorial series to
reflect the way Visual Studio code is
just to where it's always like
suggesting linking and all this stuff
like I wish they could just turn that
off but anyway guys that's my list man
these are the six things that they trip
up newbie developers and Python all the
time it seems like alright guys take
care have a good day bye hey guys what's
up so this video was brought to you by
the tech Academy so make sure you guys
check them out the link is in the
description tab below from the courses
list here they have computer basics over
all software development github html5
CSS database and there's a lot more
courses and they're adding query
is all the time so make sure you guys
give them a look once again the link is
in the description tab below thanks guys
have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
