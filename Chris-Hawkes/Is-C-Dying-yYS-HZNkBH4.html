want to pose to you today is is C sharp
as a language dying so I was actually
looking at a few charts and everything
earlier today and it made me wonder
whether or not C sharp has actually
peaked as a programming language C sharp
has been around since dotnet was first
introduced in the early 2000s I
literally like right at the turn of the
century there so dotnet or Microsoft
came along with the.net platform and
they yo they created the first revision
of c-sharp as a programming language
that was going to be able that was
really built to use microsoft.net
library and tools and everything so he
looked back at those times I mean that's
before smartphones with the internet was
obviously already popular but we didn't
have the whole web 2.0 things so it was
a pre myspace pre pre Facebook so it's
kind of hard to envision an internet
that didn't have those you know those
types of platforms but those were the
times that we were looking at right so
I'm a lot of people were a lot of
Microsoft programmers were used to using
WinForms and building GUI apps like
software apps that you download and
install on your Windows platform
pretty much everything had to be
developed for Windows because even now
Microsoft has dominated the operating
system market for personal pcs so you
know a lot of the web developers are
really not web developers but a lot a
lot of programmers we're using winform
so what Microsoft did is they created
the asp.net framework and the asp.net
framework was a web framework but it had
a bunch of web tools that were kind of
built for the old dotnet GUI app type of
thing so when when you when asp.net came
out they had this thing called web forms
and web forms allows you to build
websites using the traditional you know
software development tools like and if
you've ever done GUI development it's
never very fun in fact I you know from
being a web developer and doing GUI
development I've never had a real good
time doing that so I find it you know
relatively involved and they're really
two different things right so being a
web developer you're more interested in
HTML and CSS and
javascript in hell that stuff fits
together with solver applications a lot
of event based systems and stuff like
that a lot of background workers thread
processing thread management everything
in order to build a sleek fluid software
application so with the tools that were
introduced with web forms they had
things like data grids and um and button
controls and all these different
controls that Microsoft had and really
just a terrible terrible experience if
you've ever done that but it's supposed
to make web development easy but the
problem is the tools never work exactly
the way that they're supposed to there's
a lot of black box Microsoft magic
involved in you know just long story
short it's it's really not the best you
know tool for the job but anyway a lot
of people love asp.net it gave rise to
MVC dotnet MVC dotnet is still a popular
option obviously but one of the things I
want to mention is that if you look at
like the TOB index just this month for
the month of June now I know that TOB
index is not the end-all be-all for the
discussion of whether or not this truly
is the best programming language I mean
TLP looks at a lot of different search
engine traffic a lot of different things
to determine what they feel are the most
popular languages so they you know there
is no exact science to this thing
there's no exact answer as to what the
best language is but but TLB is kind of
the industry standard as far as like if
you were going to try to cite a source I
mean keopi is like the source that you
would cite for like 20 years running now
so it's not even not even close um so
with gob though like I'm showing you
that they they just recently announced
in June and the Jim results that Python
had surpassed c-sharp now I believe I
had a video an older video that was
talking about whether or not Python has
surpassed c-sharp and I think it did for
a moment and then c-sharp took it back
but now according to this chart python
has a pretty significant advantage over
c-sharp and I think that's interesting
because a lot of c-sharp developers will
tell you oh that's you know pythons this
you know this ND level beginner level
you know stuff that that you know that
companies are only using and it was
basically a fad right but it's hard to
really equate Python as like a
and when pythons been around for twice
as long as c-sharp and it is still going
strong after all this time Python was
the tool of choice for Google when they
were getting started with their search
engine so the original Google search end
was all using Python Python they needed
something faster eventually so they
wrote rewrote a lot of their libraries
and C++ from what I understand but I
believe they are still using Python
pretty heavily but so they wrote the
real question is is is Python really a
more popular language now than c-sharp
and I don't really know that I have the
answer to that but what I do want to
mention is that there are a few charts
that seem to indicate that c-sharp it
has like maybe not decline and maybe
it's not in like a full decline mode
like Perl or something like that or Perl
was you know I think they're kind of
having a resurgence lately with Perl 6
but I don't think it's like full-on
panic mode but I do think that c-sharp
and that there's signs the seashore may
have peaked and popularity and that
would have happened about two years ago
two or two or three years ago so if you
look at what is Microsoft do really well
what would C sharp programmers do if C
star c-sharp programmers are writing
Windows applications Windows I tried to
push the whole WPF technology in order
to write Windows applications and that
didn't really catch on so WPF is kind of
a dying thing they tried to do stover
light so we're like it was supposed to
be you know the way we view videos on
the web and now there's html5 video and
nobody really wants to use Silverlight
they don't want to use flash player
either so you know we're seeing
Silverlight falling flat on its face the
old winform stuff I suppose that's still
being used to some extent but people
aren't really using that all that much
where else is Microsoft ok so they're in
the cell phone market right but nobody
likes the Windows Phone I mean nobody's
using the Windows Phone over an Android
or an iOS so you know it's a distant
third place there so you can't really
see sharper mobile development so what
did Microsoft do well they went out and
they bought the xamarin studio xamarin
Studios was a what it was built by the
former mono guys including a miguel de
casa or something whatever his name is
from expo is self-taught developer i
believe but really a great developer
great high
a great advocate for open source
technology but he was the one behind the
mana project primarily of being able to
take C sharp which was closed source
proprietary code he didn't have access
to and not just C sharp at the dotnet
library and then open source that
basically make it so that works on Linux
Mac and and all that stuff but the
problem with mono is it was always like
two steps behind the dotnet framework
because dotnet would come out with some
new thing and then the mono guys would
have to adapt to the new thing and order
you know with no help from Microsoft for
the most part as far as being able to
make that available in the mono
framework so so if you so if you look at
that right so because Microsoft hasn't
been able to compete in the cell phone
market they went out and they purchase a
mer and I don't know what the full price
was but I'm pretty sure xamarin was
valued over a billion dollars and they
went out they purchased a right so they
purchased it because they needed to have
a foothold in the mobile market because
people were writing native Android apps
excuse me in the Java programming
language and then you had all the Apple
iOS stuff was being written in Objective
C and now Swift so Microsoft needed to
can be able to compete in the mobile
market since they didn't have a mobile
phone even though they tried to buy
Nokia and all that other stuff they
still couldn't really brand this Windows
Phone is I got a legitimate option for
developers so they bought its Ameren
Studios now in Visual Studio 2015
xamarin Studios is included but even
when you try to run that stuff but you
get all these runtime errors and stuff
like that so I you know I don't know
that's it does a review for a different
day but um but obviously that's why
Microsoft's trying to stay relevant as a
c-sharp language and I think why are
they doing some of these these things
and I really think that some of this is
being done because of the fact that the
hacker community and the newbie
developers are not embracing dotnet and
it seems like they really never have but
people wanted to learned on that they
want to learn c-sharp because that's
where money was that's where the jobs
were headed than everything else but now
if you have things like the Tod index
that's showing you that a language like
python is becoming more popular and then
you have like JavaScript right people
are writing web apps with JavaScript on
the front end and back end now granted
is in a programming language it's a
runtime it's a runtime library written
in C and C++ but you write and you
interact with using JavaScript so you
can write JavaScript on the back end and
it's great and then you can also write
on the front end so you only have to
deal with one language the problem with
that though is that the nodejs framework
or library or runtime library is not
very suitable for all the crud
applications that we deal with and
create a crud is create update delete so
create read update delete so you know
the typical web website development
stuff nodes not well-suited for all of
that nodes well-suited for two-way of
synchronous communication back and forth
it's non-blocking so that you know it
doesn't really bog down but ultimately
if it's hitting up a database or
something like that or making a database
read or anything like that it suffers
from the same problems that any other
framework would suffer from whether it's
MVC net or Django or Ruby on Rails or
whatever it is so so with you know this
this you know with node being a viable
option we're seeing less and less
developers jumping on this dotnet
bandwagon I really think that there's a
there's a you know there's a specific
crowd out there that is like why do I
need to do dotnet what do I need Visual
Studio why do I need all these Microsoft
tools when I have free open-source
technology that can just run on the
front end in the back end so I know what
everybody else on the dotnet side is
going to say about all that so I'm going
to say oh but dotnet the newest version
of.net and dotnet core and asp.net 5 is
it is open source and it runs on both
Linux Mac and Windows but here's the
problem dotnet core is just now getting
released they've been talking about it
for like two years now and Donette 1.9
core 1.0 it was just released that's
great that they're trying to make these
you know these updates in order for it
to work on Linux and stuff like that but
there's no database driver that exists
from my seat board post rest so when I
tried to use it for an application not
that long ago it wasn't a viable option
there was a built-in web server that
you're supposed to set up it was even
built in but it's called the kestrel web
server and that wasn't even ready for
primetime either so it was really weird
because like we're supposed to be like
they're touting dotnet cores here and
all his other stuff and as I way in
advance of anything ever being supported
so you know even up until like a few
months ago it wasn't really a viable
option when it comes to running a
website so if I'm actually looking at a
website do I want to do a dotnet web
site in Azure and pay a ridiculous
amount of money to host my my dotnet web
site in Azure or do I want to use
something like Django which has
everything I need right out of the box
including the admin authentication all
and stuff and install it on any sort of
shared host or a virtual private host
like Lenovo I always recommend windowed
it's a great company that's where
actually where I host my websites
literally like $20 a month has brought
me in 250,000 visitors in a month and
that's not even scratching the surface
of what it can actually do because I
didn't even use like more than 15% of my
resources but with but with you know all
these options like why would you want to
use Azure well as your makes life easy
right because you're not going to pay a
bunch of network administrators to set
up your server
there's elasticity where you can have
server setup on China and in India and
South America and you don't have data
transferring across cables late on the
ocean floor you know what I mean of your
server like Milan owed servers out in
New Jersey so for the most part somebody
is requesting it from China all that
data package is going across the
Atlantic Ocean probably to London or
somewhere and then eventually getting
dispersed to Asia or maybe it goes the
other way I have no idea all I know is
that there's cables under the ground and
that's how data is being transmitted on
the web unless it's mobile but it's not
going to be mobile I don't think so in
fact it wouldn't be mobile unless
somehow like my cables is transferring
to some data center and then some of
that's being sent up to mobile I
seriously doubt that's the case but
anyway that's it it's a subject for
another day but the the data there it is
arriving so like if you need to be
responding you know in real time to all
the different people across the world
and you're going to want to use
something like a j''r but then you're
like oh they will Microsoft Azure so
Azure is you know great you can do
c-sharp you can write it would be you
can also do note and
on everything else and hosted in an
azure environment as well so you're like
oh yeah well c-sharp can dominate there
right well with c-sharp I mean they have
currently about 9% of the corporate
cloud environment for environment you
know for Fortune 500's and things like
that they're actually setting up their
operations in the azure cloud but Amazon
AWS has like 40% of the market so
Microsoft is a distant second place in
that regard although they are making a
lot of money that's a cash cow for them
Microsoft still makes a ton of cash so
you know c-sharp isn't going to be dead
overnight like Microsoft makes a
crapload of cash like literally like 22
billion dollars a year maybe more I
don't even remember what it is it's some
ridiculous amount of profit they make it
based on to their operating systems
which are installed and pretty much
every personal PC out there they still
make a ton of money on their office
products like Microsoft Word and Excel
and that that's going to continue to
bring in a lot of money they make a lot
of money in education they're obviously
making a lot of money in Azure now
they're making money in Xbox and stuff
like that so Microsoft has a ton of cash
to compete in fact when you talk about
the biggest IT companies in the world
you're going to mention Microsoft Google
Amazon and probably Oracle those are
like the four humongous companies right
and there's there's a lot more besides
that but those are the four that that
you're going to talk about a lot so is C
short dime right there's a lot of
indications that would make me think
that you know the new the new CEO of
Microsoft Satya Nadella
he made a lot of changes like open
sourcing a lot of Microsoft technology
because they've traditionally been
closed source and then the hacker and
the newbie communities don't embrace
that so I think part of that reason is
because they've seen the direction of
Microsoft they've seen the demand for
their tools and their programming
language's decline amongst newer
programmers and ultimately these newer
programmers are entering the scene
they're going to be the future of
programming and we're seeing all these
Silicon Valley startups and stuff like
that where eventually or where it used
to be an edge case so that's just some
hipster hacker that used Jango for
Pinterest and that's a terrible idea but
that's not the real world but you're
seeing Netflix and Walmart
and Instagram all these major sites are
using things like Django and Ruby on
Rails and they're using Python they're
like Yelp read it they're using you know
even corporate environments like
walmart.com is using no jf so nodejs
isn't a fad you know I mean it'd be
works for a lot of people and I think
Microsoft seen the writing on the wall
so they started open sourcing their
stuff they started working as fast as
they can not trying to get note or the
dotnet core 1.0 out as quickly as I can
even though it's not really a feasible
option for the reasons that I've told
you before and then they're doing that
but because I think that there is a
noticeable decline if you look at the
the the the actual stats for github
which might be the most telling actually
of all stats when it comes to whether or
not a language is popular or not the the
most common repositories that are being
created the code that they use you can
see it's JavaScript it's Python it's
Java and then c-sharp is like way down
there you know so there's like there's
an entire there's a lot of c-sharp
developers that are like 9 to 5
developers that aren't hacking away at
home and stuff like that they're not
trying to expand and push the language
forwards that they could care less right
they get paid to write code for some
major enterprise during the day they
know the Microsoft way of doing this
that the other but they're not really
like going home and like pushing the
envelope of what the language can do
where when you compare something like
that to you know like the Python
environment the pentium pythons got all
this like contribution and support
coming from all these different
industries and it's not all based on a
company it's mostly private and you know
personal support that's being poured
into these frameworks and libraries and
everything and I think that's relatively
impressive so even if you have a
language like Python which is a
dynamically interpreted duck type
language which is never going to be as
fast as a compiled static language like
C++ or C sharp or Java but it can still
save you a tremendous amount of time in
you know the amount of code you have to
write in order to get things off the
ground if you have good community
support it means you're gonna have a lot
of community support when it comes to
questions that you may have or plugins
that you may implement to to push your
agenda forward whatever it is that
you're working on so there's a lot of
options there I think that github stat
really tells a lot about where where the
language is and then you know beyond
that like if you look at the trends on
nd comm for asp.net and C sharp both of
them are declining pretty pretty
significantly so while there's still a
lot of jobs in c-sharp and dotnet and
arguably a lot more jobs in c-sharp and
dotnet and there are Python at the
moment or even Ruby you know I don't
know if that's going to continue I mean
with with the way trends are going I
mean it would seem like you know Java
C++ Python you know even c-sharp
probably even in our entire lifetimes
like there's going to be a lot of
support for for c-sharp and Microsoft
well you know it's gonna be interesting
to see what they do
but um you know I think that there's
pretty good indication that you know the
language has peaked as of about two
years ago so if it hasn't peaked it's
definitely in a a goalie over the last
couple years even with all the effort
that Microsoft's pouring into trying to
make themselves relevant in the
different areas where they just can't
compete or where they haven't been able
to compete thus far anyway guys let me
know what you think please subscribe to
this channel if you like this definitely
subscribe because it helps me out thanks
