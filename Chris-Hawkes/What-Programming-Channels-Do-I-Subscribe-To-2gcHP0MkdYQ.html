question about what's channels do I
subscribe to for programming information
there's a lot that I could actually list
here and I'm just going to go through
and I mean just kind of name the ones
that I actually listen to myself so I
mean number one on the list and arguably
the most popular as far as been able to
get a large audience as the new Boston
Bucky Roberts is out of New York and
he's been able to do programming
tutorials in a way that kind of just
like sounds like a like a layman giving
you know programming advice to other you
know potential programmers out there
he's got a really good style that I
think people are just naturally
attracted to when you don't come from
like a kid academia so you know Bucky
has his own unique way of doing it he
was one of the first ones to actually
jump into this market a long time ago
and I actually was when I was doing some
Python programming I actually watched
some of his videos on like
object-oriented Python and I just I like
to style myself in fact I started my own
channel shortly after watching his
videos just because I was just I guess I
was inspired by him so you know Bucky
Roberts is definitely a channel you
should check out one of the criticisms
with him is that he kind of scratches
the surface because he deals with so
many different technologies he's doing
everything from like teaching you Adobe
After Effects or Photoshop all the way
to like Linux and FileZilla and putty
and like you know basically all these
different ends of the spectrum where you
can't possibly be an expert and all that
stuff but you know most of the time when
people are going to YouTube tutorials
anyway they're not going there to get
like these advanced level you know I'm
going to learn how to program a rocket
ship on YouTube you're pretty much going
there to get your start learning some
sort of new technology and then you take
it further and then maybe you know you
got these certain niche videos that do
get into some you know nitty gritty
details of certain technologies and
libraries and stuff like that but now
the new boss that typically will kind of
stick to the high level I think with a
lot of the programming tutorials that he
does but he's definitely one of the best
he should check him out next one a
simple programmer now simple programmer
from what I've seen you know since I've
been watching him he doesn't really do
too many like programming tutorial type
videos he's more talking about being in
the IT industry
and he does a lot of different things
like he'll be standing in front of a
camera like in his bedroom or just
walking down the street and it
definitely has a unique style I think
he's at a Tampa Bay Florida the United
States so he does a lot of content so if
you're ever looking for somebody that's
like uploading videos like every single
day
John Samas and that's his name John
Samas and he has a civil programmer
channel but you should definitely check
that out I'm actually had reached out to
him because we're going to do some sort
of collab video or we may need to do
some sort of collaboration type video
between me and him he's actually
expressed interest in that which I
thought was pretty cool because some of
the other youtubers on this list
probably wouldn't even respond to my
email now one of the newcomers is a fun
fun function and this guy's really good
he's out of Sweden he works for Spotify
and I watched his videos he does a
really good job actually you know going
through and editing his videos and stuff
like that and I'll tell you I mean I
work a full-time job I come home like I
don't want to spend a bunch of time
editing videos out and stuff like that
if I make a mistake some of the times I
might swear in my video if I make a
mistake or something like that and some
people like it some people probably
don't but at the same time it does it
saves me a lot of time but this guy he
goes through and he makes sure that his
videos are all edited nicely usually I
was like background music it usually
sounds kind of silly
maybe European I don't know that's
coming from an American but he's
definitely an interesting
uniqueness to his videos and he's
definitely exploded on them on YouTube
I've seen his subscriber base go up
quite a bit and I think he's had a
channel much less than I've had mine so
he's already surpassed me which is you
know good for him
next one on the list is Eli the computer
guy he's one of my favorites and he's
actually a guy who's actually taking his
time to respond back to my comments
which I thought you know it's pretty
nice thing to do because he he gets
thousands of comments obviously if I get
thousands of comments on my channel and
he's got I got a fraction the amount of
views that he does and I'm he does a
pretty good job trying to respond to
people he doesn't like the criticism and
that naturally happens whenever you have
a bunch of people reaching out to you
some people are jealous some people just
want to you know nitpick some people are
just assholes but it definitely comes
with the territory I think you do get a
lot of like criticism and your videos I
mean you could end up
saying something wrong or phrasing it
the wrong way and people just take that
and run with it but Eli he he's really
good he typically just sits in front of
a camera similar to this and just kind
of talks and he also doesn't really do a
whole lot of like tutorial type videos
that I know of I think you used to touch
more on the technical side of things but
now he's basically just kind of given
his v advice from being in the industry
for so long and Eli is out of Baltimore
Maryland United States as well so I'm
not sure if I mentioned but fun fun
functions out of Sweden and it's always
like negative 30 whenever he's doing a
video it looks like
but anyway so definitely Eli the
computer guys is an interesting listen
and he's the type of guy that you can
listen while you're coding or doing
something else because he's not giving
coding demonstrations like some of the
other guys now Derek baños he's been
around for a while he kind of started
after Bucky Robertson and he goes into a
little bit more detail from what I've
seen then Bucky does but his videos can
also be kind of long-winded and yeah I
guess that would be the main criticism
with him is he's also all over the place
but he's got some some long-winded
videos but definitely some great
information out there and I never I mean
I'll be honest with you I mean Derek is
one of the bigger youtubers doing
YouTube tutorials but I've never really
watched them all that much I've watched
some of his stuff which I thought was
good it's just I mean I guess I guess I
don't watch that that much you know
tutorials on YouTube for the most part I
spend more of my time actually writing
code and and you're using Stack Overflow
or other blogs and stuff like that
trying to figure out problems now
so I mentioned fun fun functions sent
Dex he's out of I believe Dallas Texas
or maybe Austin somewhere in Texas
this guy's not even a computer science
major similar to myself I think he went
to school for business or something like
that but he is also self-taught and he
goes into a lot of detail on his Python
videos he pretty much takes just the
Python but he'll do things like you know
like facial recognition software like
GUI apps
Gamze goes into a lot of detail so if
you're looking for somebody that
definitely does more than scratching the
surface this guy does that
but his area of expertise is mainly just
in the Python Python field okay Mike
Hobart Mike Hibbert was like the Django
guy that I went to for Django tutorials
like this guy he I felt like had some of
the best django videos at the time and
he also sticks to Python but so if
you're looking for a specific Django guy
this guy does a pretty good job now
while we're on the subject of Django
that's actually kind of been my bread
and butter as well I mean I'll tell you
one of the things I've found with with
YouTube is that for some reason whenever
I do a video where I'm just kind of
talking whether I'm sharing some sort of
experience or giving advice or answering
a question or something like that those
videos typically get more views than
doing tutorials tutorials number one
take more time you have to do more
editing because honestly you don't want
to trip people up so if you don't
actually edit and fix the mistakes in
your tutorial videos and you're going to
get a lot of negative feedback and
that's something I actually gave when I
first started out I would actually make
mistakes and go through like some you
know 10-minute explanation and then it
wouldn't work and you know some people
like that but it's not very good for
teaching people out of program it's more
entertainment value but um I don't do
that anymore I try to actually be a
little bit more professional with the
tutorials but my whole point is that
making tutorials takes a lot more work
and there's less views you have a much
smaller audience potential that's going
to be interested in like a flask
tutorial with sequel alchemy and and
Postgres or something like that you know
so I do a combination of the two though
because I would say I've done several
videos where like I talked about
integrating react with Django I'll sit a
video that got like a hundred thousand
hits that had integrating angular
angularjs and Django which was a little
bit more complicated than using
something like react so I try to give
back to the Python community by doing
some of these videos so I have like a
Python 3
Django 1.9 here's my
flash tutorial and stuff like that but
yeah basically I'm just throwing my name
out there and like a shameless plug to
say that I also do tutorials and talk
about programming but I guess they
already knew that since they asked the
question on my programming channel
anyway guys those are the ones that I
definitely come to mind and yeah that's
really it guys so let me know what you
think let me know if there's other
videos that are channels and I'm missing
but I think I named some of the bigger
ones at least the ones that I watch on a
pretty regular basis alright guys thanks
for watching have a good night and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
