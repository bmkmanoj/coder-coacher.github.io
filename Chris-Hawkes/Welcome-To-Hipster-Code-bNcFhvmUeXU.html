this video I just want to give you guys
a heads up on this new website that I'm
trying to work on I'll be perfectly
honest with you I was looking for a
domain name that had the word code in it
I have a company that's called New Media
LLC so I had movies are websites for
like movies at one point I new movies
new music and a bunch of other ones and
like I basically decided like I don't I
don't really want that name I want
something that has to do with
programming and I didn't want the name
programming because programming is not
difficult to spell but it is kind of a
long word and typically want to keep the
words down when when you're looking at a
domain name it's almost impossible to
have a single word domain any anymore so
I wanted something to have the word code
in it and encode is a popular term when
it comes to programmers and I was just
kind of thinking like you know I tried
like literally hundreds of different
things and I ultimately ended up you
know i settled on hipster code and i'm
not even like I'm not like a hundred
percent sold on the name it's only like
twelve bucks for the domain for a year
so I just went ahead and purchased it
because I just didn't know of anything
else at that point and to be honest
since I'm doing tutorials you know I
figured it might be a good name because
ultimately I'm into doing these
tutorials to learn new technologies
which you know you could consider to be
hip or hipster technologies hipsters
always want to be on the cutting edge
and there's a ton of hipsters in the
Silicon Valley world and and and I'm not
it's not even supposed to be like
derogatory towards em or anything like
that but I just figured okay well that
at least signifies code which is
programming and then hipster is kind of
signifying new and you know people just
getting started because a lot of like
you know real established programmers
aren't going to be watching my videos
anyway but ultimately I wanted to to
build this platform and start trying to
you know I guess promote the tutorial
videos that I plan on doing in the
future and some of the ones that I've
already done in just a more beneficial
way and maybe one day trying to
integrate some more like you know they
kind of learning resources and then in
addition to that I also want to be able
to blog about code and
share coding examples and possibly even
entire repositories you know whether
it's on github or not or maybe I just
you know hosted the code myself and have
people download it there but yeah
ultimately I just wanted to give you
guys a heads-up data if anybody has ever
followed along and one of the Django
tutorials that I was doing I was
actually creating a replica of this site
and it's not exactly this site this site
isn't done in any regard i actually just
threw it up so it's not even close to
being done but the the Indy site itself
the entire process of building it up is
is also in a tutorial series so for for
what that's worth you guys can you know
check it out hopefully if you're
interested and I just let me know if
there's any problems you know that you
notice but then it will actually don't
don't let me notice don't don't get me
any heads up on that yet just because
it's not done it's got a long way to go
and I'm not really pushing it all that
hard to be honest I I've been spending a
little bit less time trying to pump out
code at home just because I've been so
busy at work and then when I do get home
I have a little time to do anything else
but luckily my my courses in college
just finished up so I have the rest of
the next few months off which will be
nice so hopefully I can do some more
videos finish up this Web site maybe to
start doing some more tutorials and
things like that now one of the
questions I want to pose for you guys is
that I have a combination of videos that
I do that our tutorial based and then I
also have videos where I just kind of
talk like I'm doing now so I'm not sure
if I should be spinning off a new
channel or not like it's so difficult to
build up any sort of audience and any
channel so I feel like you know
splitting it off is going to be more
difficult but at the same time I feel
like if I throw it and start throwing
out a bunch of tutorial videos it might
be confusing so maybe I need to find a
way of being able to separate the
content you know from tutorials and and
typically the way i title it should be
you know good enough but i just wanted
feedback from you guys anybody that
watches my videos out there that well
you just let me know what you think
about the fact that the channel is both
tutorials and just simple like vlogs
where i'm just talking and you know
shooting the crap with you guys about
tech
ecology and programming so anyway that's
all I got tonight and thanks for
watching guys thank you for subscribing
and have a good night and by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
