went ahead i went to github and i
actually fork to copy this project I'm
you really doing me to do that you can
actually just go ahead and download
minified version here so I'm going to do
that it just gives you all this we just
copy this ctrl a ctrl C and let's go
ahead and paste this in a notepad file
here I'm gonna save my notepad save as
and I have my HTML page for the test
that we're going to do I put it into my
C Drive and I just have a project
directory that I created and everything
i do i'm going to put in this web GL
folder so in here i'm going to just make
a java script folder just j/s for short
and then in here we're going to put this
we're just gonna call this 3j s3 jsjs so
actually know what that's not even
necessary and actually that'll work
change that to all files so we saved a
copy of three j/s here now let's go
ahead and run the sample here because
this thing says it gives us some
practice coaches to see how everything's
operating so it's copy and paste this
from github so i'm a copy this and then
inside my editor okay so inside my
editor actually have a bunch of stuff i
was playing around with if you actually
followed along with that learning WebGL
you're probably gonna be a little
disheartened after i'm doing all that
stuff so 3j ass is still going to be
difficult in its own right but not
nearly as difficult as what we were
experiencing before I have an extra
script tag in here and take that out so
we're going to save this file i have it
just test WebGL dot HTM and if we go
ahead and open that then obviously I
didn't connect my JavaScript so one
second we need to insert our javascript
file
ripped type text/javascript source
equals so it should be j/s and then
three jsjs I think that's what I named
it it's going to close it off so
hopefully that'll work let me see if
this works again it does not work okay
let me see what's wrong oh actually what
we do we actually put the script tag in
the head that's not supposed to go in
the head it's important that the body is
actually rendered before the the the
code is called because if you look here
and there test code it's out body down a
pin child and if it's in the head the
body hasn't even been written when this
is actually created on the fly here so
when we run this in this should work now
so now there we go so just like an
example we can go ahead and see that we
have a moving working cube so that means
our 3j s is found and we downloaded it
properly you have any questions or
anything just feel free to leave a
comment and in the next tutorial we're
going to go ahead and move on with 3gs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
