this video we want to look at how do you
render a list and Vijay s and we're
gonna get rid of what we have here with
our message and we're gonna actually
edit the data that gets passed down and
we're going to pretend this data comes
from a server but data can be all kinds
of different things so we could say data
and then down here we could say bands
and then inside here we could actually
have bands be a list and each list item
is a JavaScript object that has a name
and then we'll just say origin all right
so we're creating some elements here so
since this is going to be separated we
can copy this entire piece right here
or United Kingdom whatever all right so
we have three different band names here
that we added and they're from three
different countries making this thing
diverse so in order to display this
information what we need to do is we
need to go to our our app where
everything is being bound here and we're
gonna create a list item so we're gonna
say ul which stands for unordered list
and HTML close it off inside of here
we're gonna create our actual list items
and here is actually the the repeatable
part that we're going to be repeating
over and over again so let's go ahead
and close this off so we need to do
something special with the Li because we
want the Li to render for every single
item that we have inside of our list
here so in order to do that we're gonna
say v4 which is another special tag for
VJ s and then we can just say for bands
in data bands okay so now inside of the
Li we're gonna go ahead and say band dot
and if we look at band our name so we'll
display band up name in fact we can even
create a label we could say name and
that name and then I'll do a I will just
say origin and then the same thing ban
origin
all right now one thing that is not
necessary is the data reference here
which is down here does not need to be
referenced when Vijay s went binding so
this is actually not necessary you just
need the name of the actual data element
that you're trying to bind to so because
bands is a list and this is a list and
JSON structure that has just three
separate JSON objects in it then that
will be bound and then we look at band
and band as the individual name and
origin so that's that's all you have to
do there so now if we refresh the page
you can see that is now displaying this
name was the placeholder and here's the
data element and another placeholder and
the data element and obviously when
you're looping through a list like this
you probably would do something a little
bit better in fact let me do something
just a slightly bit cooler so just so
you guys didn't have to see me typing
out everything what I did is I actually
changed the loop structure and whatever
you you assign v4 attribute it actually
creates the template so this is all the
template that gets reusable for every
element inside of bands and we know that
there's three of them we have Adele
Bayside and silverstein and I went ahead
and I added data to these create
creative commons images for each of the
musicians and I added the extra field
image so now if I go through and I add I
create HTML that says H 1 will be the
band's name H 3 will be their origin and
then the third element is the actual
image source and I just assigned a width
so that way you know the heights would
be dynamically interpreted and then to
do the reference like the image source
this is an interesting part because you
still have to wrap it in these double
quotes for valid HTML but view j/s
renders and reads this product properly
through the double curly brace tag so it
looks for those double curly brace tags
and replaces it with the actual data
element so if we go back to the page and
we refresh you can see that we're now
displaying the
origin the image the name the origin the
image the name the origin the image so
obviously there's no CSS so it's still
not pretty or anything like that but
when you combine this with like a
bootstrap theme or something like that
then obviously it's a very efficient way
of being able to take data that gets
passed on to the server just in JSON
format so you just have to store the
JSON and then use VJ s to render it in
your template all right guys thanks for
watching this is the View j/s list item
or looping through list items tutorial
and please subscribe bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
