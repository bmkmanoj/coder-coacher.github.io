looking at the 10 things to master for
advanced JavaScript so I've actually
done a video like this in the past where
to be honest I didn't feel like it was
very good I hope this will be a little
bit better I did think about it but I
didn't really like I mean this is coming
from just a lot of experience of dealing
with JavaScript but like I didn't really
like you know thoroughly analyze you
know this should be like number one this
should be number Ken and all that
so if if I have this out of order in
your opinion feel free to express your
opinion and you know just know that you
know I try to number things and what I
feel is important but it may not be
perfect so these are 10 things that you
want to master for advanced JavaScript
so I'm not gonna actually tell you how
to solve all these problems but I will
tell you that some of the things that
are addressed in this video I do have
two tutorial videos on in case you're
interested in learning from me but
there's also all kinds of other
resources out there so I never claimed
to have the best resources some people
find me to be really helpful and then
other people probably don't so that said
let's go and get into this so number 10
and this is a you know a lot of people
like it goes without saying number one
you should be using Chrome when you're
going development if you're not using
Chrome at least be using Mozilla Firefox
those are going to be the two best
they're going to save you a lot of time
if you're using Internet Explorer I
don't really know what to tell you but
um the chrome developer tools it is
absolutely impossible for me to work in
JavaScript without them I use the
console on a regular basis the console
is a great way for you to be able to
execute your JavaScript code directly in
the browser so you don't to actually you
know open a HTML file or a s file and
have to set up everything save your file
open it up in a browser your browser's
already open you can literally
right-click on any webpage go into your
council console and start writing some
JavaScript code so I'm sure the most
JavaScript developers know that but you
know that's where you should be testing
your assertions okay does this piece of
code work or does this do that or do
that in addition when you outgrow that
you're going to find that the console
gets a little bit annoying I would the
type everything in because it wants to
execute all the time so you might find
that like jsfiddle is a little bit
better but it's still going to save you
time over having to write the files in
addition I'm not really mentioning in
this list but you should also know about
the network panel you know how to
inspect Ajax calls and stuff like that
because you know ultimately that is a
hugely
important thing whenever you're doing
JavaScript I'm also how to step through
and debug your code is another thing
with chrome dev tools so it's an
absolute must I have it number 10 on
this list but it kind of goes without
saying but at the same point I felt like
it needed to be on this list so I put it
number 10 but that should be the first
place you start how do I get better at
chrome dev tools in order to be able
step through my JavaScript and all that
the next is number 9 the specification a
lot of people don't realize that the
JavaScript or ACMA script 2015
specification is available online
anybody that wants to take a look at
this you guys can see the exact write-up
of all the people that have been
responsible for putting these standards
together so if you wanted to be on the
bleeding edge of JavaScript you want to
be a master you're going to go to the
specification you want to write a book
in this stuff you need to go to the
specification if you're going to be
working on like Core Jas like this guy
from Russia who created that project
initially that is now included in Babel
to be able to polyfill the browser's to
be able to use some of the latest admin
script standards which aren't actually
implemented in all the browsers you have
to go to the specification that's how
these guys figure this stuff out they
they go directly the specification
arguably this should be higher on the
list if you truly want to be a master of
JavaScript also you need to know that
the name is JavaScript 6.0 because it's
the sixth standard or it's the Ekman
script 2015 technically its ACMA script
2015 because 2015 was the year that they
finalized everything next you need to
learn about object constructors a lot of
people don't know what object
constructors are in JavaScript they
don't even know that JavaScript has
constructors we'll see in just a little
bit you know why some people might be
confused behind that but you know
knowing how to actually implement a new
JavaScript object via its constructor is
important number seven is like babel
versus typescript but you could also add
CoffeeScript and all these other you
know pre-processing languages even stuff
like JSX like what is all this stuff
like what are the differences what is
babel trying to solve what is typescript
trying to solve typescript is a a is a
subset of JavaScript so that it brings
you features like Ekman script 6.0 and
it also brings you features from macro
script 7.0 which isn't even close to
being finalized but
brings it to you now and the way that
microsoft sees fit microsoft i p--
script project babel is owned by it's a
more of an open source type of thing
where it's community based and and
typescript as well but it's mostly you
know catered or directed by the you know
the microsoft crowd over there but
typescript also aims to bring type
safety to javascript not really type
safety but by means of having to declare
types and stuff like that which is more
familiar to java developers and c-sharp
developers so they're aiming to bridge
that gap but Babel is bringing you all
the same stuff they allow you to write a
necklace crip 6.0 even though browsers
don't support it you use a Babel
compiler it'll compile all your code
down to code that actually works an edge
and Internet Explorer 11 and Chrome and
Firefox everything else so you know what
are those two things make sure you truly
understand those because a lot of people
you have conversations with them and
it's clear that they have no idea what
Babel is or what it's for and they don't
even know what typescript is either
number six is closures a lot of people
don't understand closures like how do
inner functions have access to outer
function parameters and you know why
aren't things in JavaScript lexically
scoped certain things are addressed in
order to you know lexically scoped
things and that's some of the you know
some of the things coming down the pike
in the latest standards but people need
to understand what closures are because
it will create some you know it creates
some interesting ways of and will
accomplish certain problems and some
people just can't wrap their head around
it so you know make sure you thoroughly
understand what's going on there number
five is a global namespace a lot of
people don't understand what it means to
pollute the global namespace they don't
understand what the window object is in
JavaScript and why attaching things to
it is a bad idea especially if you have
var X and you're just you know storing a
number two for some you know particular
execution time you know they they
pollute up the global name space they
have naming conflicts and clashes and
it's just a terrible experience number
four is the if he and the modules like
why do we have the fu pattern why do we
have modules in JavaScript why or
libraries like jQuery using them you
know this also goes back to the whole
global namespace thing so you know if
he's exists because you don't want to
pollute the global namespace private
functions
only exists through modules and if
easily your modules it like iffy and the
standard module pattern or the self
revealing module pattern you know that's
how we actually restrict access to our
to our classes and aren't done to our
classes but to our objects and then
furthermore in order to prevent things
from being attached on to you know the
global namespace we can declare one
particular library like jQuery or
something like that and then attach
things to that and everything is
embedded within the jQuery object and
not attached to the global name
number three is prototypes like
everything in JavaScript is object
javascript is actually an object
oriented language a lot of people don't
know that they think it's like some sort
of functional and procedural language
JavaScript can be considered a
functional language depending on who you
ask I mean I think you know the pure
academic definition of a functional
language JavaScript probably doesn't
match that but JavaScript allows you to
pass functions around as first-class
citizens what does that mean it means
that you could pass a function around
like it's a string or an int or a number
and it's I'm gonna call it int and
JavaScript is called number but you
could pass those things around because
of the fact that javascript is somewhat
of a functional language where other
languages won't allow you to do that as
easily but with prototypes everybody
needs to know about prototypical
inheritance how does that use how is
that used for your benefit do you
understand that JavaScript objects
always point back to some prototype you
know how to change their prototype do
you know how to prevent their prototype
from being changed like so a lot of
different things that you need to
understand with prototypical inheritance
but it's ultimately the most powerful
feature of you know being up JavaScript
being an object-oriented language number
two is functions and this probably could
have been number three with with
prototypes being number two but either
way they're both both very important
things a lot of people don't understand
that functions are first class citizens
and that they're passed around now they
don't understand the difference between
an anonymous function and a function
that is that is named they don't
understand that you can that you know
they don't understand that the term you
know callback function and how that is
what how that works and they don't
understand the a synchronous nature of
JavaScript as well so understanding
functions call
is an extremely important thing and
until you actually wrap your head around
that you're never going to be an
advanced JavaScript developer number one
is that this keyword and once again I
feel like the top three could be in any
particular order but a lot of people
don't have any idea of this keyword they
don't know why it exists or how it works
they don't understand why it changes
they don't understand why the bind
feature or the bind function was created
in order to prevent your that you need
to be able to bind your this to the
context of which you were executing they
didn't understand why this sometimes
points to the global namespace or
sometimes it points to an object
sometimes it points to an object when
they think it should point to the
objects prototype there's all kinds of
different confusion when it comes to
this keyword and it's a it's a very
important concept in JavaScript so
there's probably other things that I'm
missing on this list but honestly like
when I sat down I thought of this list
and literally like 10 or 15 minutes but
this is after years of doing JavaScript
and I just basically said you know right
now you know there's tons that you could
learn with JavaScript 6.0 there's tons
you can learn with babel and typescript
and all this other stuff and then
there's you know the here now this is
what has you know bit people for
literally a decade or more of JavaScript
development so let me know what you guys
think and let me know will actually
please leave comments if you guys can
think of anything that may have been
left off of this list I probably could
have made it longer anyway thanks guys
take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
