video we're going to touch on something
that is extremely popular and important
its regular expressions and I'm not
going to get into all the regular
expression formatting because then it
takes a long time to master the typical
typically any sort of programming you're
gonna run into some regular expression
regardless of what language you're using
it was mainly I'm not sure when it was
invented but I know Perl the programming
language had made regular expressions
like the easiest to work with and they
kind of took it and revolutionized
regular expressions and since then every
language is pretty much implemented it
as a major part of the language and
Python is no exception to that except
that anytime you use a regular
expression in Python you need to import
the re module so you just say import re
and then we can go ahead and say much
greater string so we'll say test string
equals Chris walks his dog now with a
regular expression the first thing you
need to do in order to be able to use it
you need to figure out okay what is it
that I'm actually capturing so you do
that with the compile method so we're
gonna say we'll just say word equals re
actually it will say dog dog equals re
compile and then here is where we're
gonna actually put in our regular
expressions so since we know exactly
what we're matching we can just say dog
and then in our string and we're gonna
say dog equals already dot find all and
we'll say find all dog within test
string make sure you have a comma that
separates the two and then we'll say
print and dog so there's gonna print a
list cuz already find all actually
returns a list of how many objects that
find so it only found one and in this
case we knew it was only going to find
one so if we wanted to say hey print
this as a
stringing out a list item we could do
this so now it's the dog string a lot of
times if you know you're only gonna have
one it's just easy to say like okay dog
equals dog zero so you're getting a
string and you show you here no I have
to actually print a dog all right so
I'll print dog and this is gonna be the
string so the same thing that we just
did it's just one extra step and like I
said this you know this works well if
you actually know that there's gonna be
at least one occurrence of dog because
of like if I did then you're gonna
get a compile error because there is no
match and you try to index something
that is not indexable because the list
is empty there is no zero element which
because in the list element Python
counting starts at 0 so 0 is the first
element in there and since this word
here did not match anything in the
string you're gonna have a failure so we
go back to something that does match and
it works just fine so that is how you
use re-find all all right now another
method of searching is we can do instead
of find all that returns our list we can
just simply say search so re search and
we're gonna use the same thing so let's
go back to the dog just to make it so it
sounds a little bit more right since we
have our name of our variable as dog
instead of referencing a list item we're
gonna simply say print dog and what
you're gonna see here is you're gonna
see something a little bit weird you're
gonna see this s re it's a match object
it's basically pythons built-in ability
to actually point to a object in memory
and the object in memory is you know the
search object because it did find
something so watch what happens if we
don't find anything
and we'll go back and we'll this time
not say any bad words
we'll say crap and you'll see that it
actually has none however it did not it
did not um did not fail so that's good
so if you're dealing with something like
this let's go back to I match so it
actually does find a match and you're
gonna go back to seeing this cryptic
looking thing we can say here we're
gonna say print and dog dot group group
zero so it says match the first group
and you can see that we had dog now the
way that works is that there's only one
group that matches so here's group it
matches this so this is just one group
now if I actually wanted to say
something like this and we'll say his
and we leave into a space I can put the
regular expression this are you compile
these brackets mean match this group so
we're gonna have more than one group
match now so group one says hey his dog
because this entire regular expression
matches here just ignore the braces and
you're gonna see his space dog matches
his space dog so the brackets though are
the braces and saying if I want to
capture Group one so first group is
obviously this entire match second group
is going to be his because that's what
these brackets indicate so watch this so
when we do this we can say Group one is
gonna be his alright and if I actually
put parentheses around dog as well we'll
still get the same results when I print
except this time I can say group two and
it'll be dog so Group one is the entire
match group two and member counting
starts at zero so we'll say group zero
is the entire match group one is his
we're up to is dog so it starts from
left to right alright so now we're
obviously not going to have any sort of
match here so it'll throw an exception
so it's another reason why
you always want to make sure you do like
a null check so in this case we know
that his dog is gonna match so we can
say print dog group all right so we
print dog group and his dog okay so if
we want to do a null check to make sure
that we do not have a problem here we
can say if I believe we can do this I
have not tested this will say if dog
group 0 print tall group 0 maybe this
will work I'm not sure obviously it's
gonna work the way we had it before but
if we actually make this not match I
should normally test these things I
didn't even test that so it has no
groups that's not even gonna work at all
so that's not a good null check there a
better way to do it might just be to say
if dog because if there's a match
there's gonna be you know dogs not going
to be null so there's at least group
zeros is definitely a match if dog
exists now it gets a little bit more
complicated if you're trying to say okay
number one exists or number two it's
just blah blah blah there's other ways
to do that that we'll touch on in a
different video but I'm just keep on
subject here you can do it like it's
just a quick null check I if dog and
this should work unless I had to restart
it all right so you can see that it just
didn't do anything because dog doesn't
exist because there was no match so
please say his dog this will not match
dog will not be null and it'll print
Group 1 alright guys so that is a brief
explanation of how to implement regular
expressions within Python regular
expressions themselves are like an
entire book on their own and I mean you
can do some pretty crazy matching with
regular expressions and all that crazy
matching will be inside your re compile
method that you build so you can use
things like
you know like this signifies word or
letter actually so it'll just grab the
first one so if we said word plus it's
gonna grab all of Chris and if we said
word plus and then space and then
another word plus it'll grab walk Chris
walks and then once again we can do
another space and then word plus the
plus means of one or more occurrences of
a letter so obviously we could do that
now we could also say one or more word
and then also instead of the plus we can
do dot star triangle and then also this
dollar sign it will grab basically the
entire phrase because what that
signifies is word and this means at
least 0 more times and then this star
means match anything and then the
triangle means okay don't be a greedy
bastard just match the shortest possible
match because there's differences
between matching short matches and then
also a short match that you think might
just be short but can also be applied to
like an entire paragraph basically the
triangle says hey don't apply this to
more than you need just apply to this
the first and smallest match possible
that gets a bit hard to wrap your head
around but eventually you will and then
the dollar sign just means grab the end
so the this is like I said this is all
cryptic stuff and regular expressions
are definitely something you should
check into and just play around with and
try to figure out what you can do to to
match certain things alright guys thanks
