back so we're going back into the node
tutorial to use the Express framework
with node and last where we left off we
use the Express framework got it running
with the hello world example and now
what I want to just jump into which is
one of the harder parts is actually
getting it hooked up to a database node
and Express works with a lot of
different databases out there I tip I
typically like to stick with the
relational database I've used Mongo
Mongo is okay but it's just very
unfamiliar for me so I just want to use
my sequel so if any of you guys want to
go along the same route you can do the
same thing just follow along so what we
need to do is we use NPM to install my
sequel and first things first you also
have to make sure that you have my
sequel installed on your machine if
you're going to be using that and to be
able to log in on Windows you would do
it you would go to where it's installed
and then go into your bin directory this
color is friggin terrible one second oh
my god that looks a little better sorry
this is hard to read I can't make it any
bigger but if you go to where its
installed under the bin this thing is
going to ask you for your password so
I'm going to put that in and then oh god
dang that is not cool
otherwise I was just typing it wrong
over and over again so once you do that
you should well log in and let's go
ahead and cancel out of this how do I do
that see oh god bad maybe I can type
exit all right there we go
all right so we're out so now let's go
over to where our folder is and here's
where the app is listening on port 3000
I'm going to end that by pressing ctrl C
and then we're going to use a MPM npm
install my sequel so let's go ahead and
see if that actually did anything to our
config file that we have remember this
package dot JSON file is the actual like
configuration settings for our node app
which it doesn't look like it actually
changed anything so let's go and grab
I'm going to just do a copy and paste
here over to my app file and we're going
to find out if we have a connection
problem here in just a moment but let me
just paste it underneath all this other
stuff I'm going to say variable my
sequel and I'm requiring my sequel and
then I think I'm route I don't remember
and then I'm just going to put this
password since there's a local password
don't really care so you need to put
your password there I'm going to leave
the connection string it'll probably
throw an error but I'm wondering whether
or not this will give me an error if it
actually can't connect because I don't
remember if my username is root or not I
also need to make sure that my sequel is
running which I think it should be
should be running by default if you
installed everything correctly so let's
go back over to our project is and then
we're going to go ahead and run er up
so you can see that the the successful
output there is the solution is to so
that means everything was working right
so I had my sequel installed I had the
server running on my machine
I was using the default root user I put
in the password to locally running
database instance and it actually
connected to the database just fine and
then wrote out that basically tests
query alright so let me go back over to
my command line here where I have my
sequel and I log back in here
and I'm going to create a database
called post so I should be able to then
use post you can see the database was
successfully created
so if I go back over to node here under
these password I can actually specify
here a database and then we're going to
use the post database that we just
created and I want to kill node for a
moment and then restart it
it looks like we're able to connect
which is fine so I've actually never
created a database table in my sequel
shell without actually a norm object
relational mapper that does it for me
and like things like Django and stuff
like that so this would be my first
attempt but we're going to go and create
so I make sure I'm using the database so
I should say show tables and there's no
tables there so we're going to go ahead
and create table and we're going to call
it a video I guess you know what mmmm
yeah it's called video because this is
what it's going to be about YouTube
videos and then we're going to add a
name so I'll say title is the name of
the column it's a VAR car probably 50
characters you know maybe I'll do a
hundred I'm just in case and then we're
going to say URL this is going to be the
same thing URL space variable characters
100
and I think that's all I'm going to do
for right now do the semicolon so that
went ahead and created the table so if I
say show tables you should see that we
now have a video table now let's go back
over to our app so I'm actually going to
get rid of this a connection query so
I'm going to remove the whole thing here
so we're going to insert into video
which is the name of the there's things
looking for a variable title so we'll
just create a variable title real quick
which is um
testing
and then we'll create another title for
the URL
I don't know that I made those own those
feels mandatory in my stable so we'll
just see if we can just enter in a
record with just the title
so stop known again and then we're going
to try to do it looks like it's thinking
a little bit here actually we're not
even displaying that console.log message
anymore because I got rid of it so let's
see if we can look at the records inside
the table to see if anything got added
so I could try the select all from table
see if that works I'll look at that
title testing URL is no because we
didn't add URL so let's go back over
here alright good so our title got
inserted into our my sequel database so
that is a success guy so that is how we
hook up my sequel to express and nodejs
and just do a simple insert query so in
future videos I'll probably get into
more of how we can manipulate the
database using raw sequel is crazy to me
it's I've been using Django so long that
I've never had to do that so I
appreciate you guys patience while I was
trying to work my way through that and
thank you and please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
