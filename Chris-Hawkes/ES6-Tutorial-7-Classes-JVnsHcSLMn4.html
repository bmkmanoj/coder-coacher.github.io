this video we're going to be looking at
the new classes and javascript es6 and
classes or something really knew a lot
of people bitch your mind because
javascript not a class-based language
it's actually more of a object
prototypical or there's like more of an
object prototype pattern as as opposed
to troop classes that output objects
everything in javascript is an object
and has a prototype leading all the way
up to the you know the global window
object so within this new you know this
new es6 standard oh we're now introduced
in classes that have more traditional
constructors to generate objects and
it's a reference function so the syntax
is quite a bit different than probably
what you're used to with the normal with
the old JavaScript so let's go ahead and
look at how to actually create a class
and we're going to take just a class
which is the keyword and we're going to
call this band and then you just do
curly braces so inside here what we need
to have is a constructor and the
constructor is going to take an argument
so we'll just days can take names and
we'll say you know what it'll take
origin as well and now we can we can
actually just design assign values we
say this name equals name and this
origin equals origin so we're assigning
it to be this this is actually the
object that gets nude up from this class
so we're saying whatever object you
create and give the name variable the
name that gets popped into the
constructor and then we're going to go
ahead and say you know what we're going
to say print name so that will be a
function so we can say print name and
now we don't actually say functions
where you use arrow functions in back or
anything like that that's all you have
to do and we can say console dot log
name equals
and we can say there's Scott just got
name all right and then we're going to
do the same thing for print origin will
say french origin console dot log origin
rooftop origin all right so that we got
we have that so now we need to do up an
object based on that class we can do
that now we can say variable based size
equals bands and then we pass in the
name that we watch the base side as the
first argument and it will say they're
from Queens New and you're all right so
now if I were to say bayside dot print
name and base i dot print version then
we're going to see the outputs of the
screen here can I call it class as a
function wait I do here oh wait I'm
gonna tell me I have to do it up so that
you have to use the new keywords to do
up the object from the class my bad
alright so here you can see name equals
a side origin equals Queens New York so
that's really all there is to the new
class syntax with in JavaScript po6
alright guys thanks for watching make
sure you subscribe somebody hey guys so
a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12 week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here and now
for web development some of the things
that are actually teaching in the
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery no Jas react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp in the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
can't just check out the link in the
description proud of this video thank
you for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
