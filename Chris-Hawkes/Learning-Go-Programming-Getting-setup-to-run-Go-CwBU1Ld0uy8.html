gonna be doing a go tutorial series and
in the previous go tutorial series I
tried to set up everything under Adam
editor which is an open source editor
and I just wasn't too happy with it I'm
using go it's been a little bit buggy
here and there I use it for JSX at the
moment so it's not like a horrible edit
or anything like that but I just wish
like something like Visual Studio would
offer better go support but it doesn't
at the moment I don't like a go go clips
I spent like an hour trying to get all
that set up don't like it your clips is
just a monstrosity I think compared to
Visual Studio it's not very good so I'm
gonna go with the the smallest version
possible I'm gonna use light IT ide the
reason why is because apparently it's
geared specifically towards go I'd
rather not have to deal with a bunch of
 trying to get everything set up so
we're gonna hope that this thing just
works
so here is the link I'll make sure I
provide this in the the description here
okay so light i de did install and it's
gonna be in a zipped up directory so
what we want to do is just extract this
I'll put this in my C Drive I just want
to put it right there in the and the
base C Drive and if I open this up I'll
go over to C we should be able to see
light IDE I'm so you can see this here
now another thing too is that I'm going
to be using and go version 1.5 so you
want to make sure you install that 1.5
is the latest version it's also the
version that has gotten rid of any sort
of dependencies on the C language so go
is not relying at all upon C anymore
there was a small piece of it that was
still using some C code
they've also redone their entire garbage
collection process making it much more
efficient so go was already quick before
this latest release but apparently this
newest release is making it even quicker
so with this light ide file that we have
let's go into the bin directory let me
see if i can make this thing bigger and
then we're just gonna click the
application icon
and I've actually never used this before
so let's see that's this last screen a
splash screen so let's go ahead and just
uh knew it already has the go path on
there on the left hand side which is
good
all right so we're just gonna pick go
one command project let's give it a name
so sit first go project click okay do
you want to open it yes all right so
this automatically has the hello world
now just so you know what's going on
here let me see if I can zoom in on this
now if sweeter has the zoom in and out
see Eclipse doesn't come with that by
default which i think is completely
crazy but anyway so let's look over here
so we have the files on the left-hand
side and I go project you can see that
this is a main go file so and go
everything has a dot go extension so
it's a go file now this import statement
this is where it's actually gonna import
anything that the program needs in order
to execute and you'll notice with the go
language which is unlike other languages
is that your program will not compile if
you have an import that you're not using
so it's supposed to be efficient as
possible so it doesn't want your
importing anything that you don't need
so you can see this FMT the library this
is a standard library that's built in
the go and it's used for standard
input/output so like reading things from
the user on a console or outputting a
line to the console which you can see
what it's doing here is it's using the
library that was imported and it's going
to call this statement which is print
line which is a method attached to this
object and then you're going to pass in
the actual string that you want to
output to the command line
which in this case is hello world which
is the typical introductory application
or program to a programming language now
one of the things you also notice if
you've done any other programming is
that there is no semicolons so that kind
of takes after Python a little bit how
there's no semicolons but it still uses
curly braces so it's going to be very I
find it very difficult not to do to
semicolons so I do that all the time and
that'll create problems for you
javascript c-sharp I do a lot of that
development and you definitely have to
and your statements with a semicolon but
not let's go alright so let's go ahead
and run our first program here that was
built for us automatically one other
thing before I get that though is just
to touch on the function main so any
sort of console application a lot of
programming languages you have a main
starting point so it's pretty much every
program needs to have a starting point
so in this case main is it's only gonna
be one method called main and that's
gonna be the first thing that gets fired
and from there go we'll just call other
methods to do this that and the other
thing so that's how that works out in
Lite IDE you have this BR command here
which means build and run so when we go
ahead and click on that it's gonna go
ahead and take this go code and it
compiles it down into machine language
and then just outputs in the hello world
so if you ran this from like a command
prompt it would actually output hello
world but one of the things and let's go
ahead and do that actually right now
we're gonna go into the command prompt
and find where this this project is
currently located so it's in my projects
directory so if I go in there and I say
first go project I think and then if we
go into the bin directory it's not in
there I'm missing
no it's not in there Shh it's actually
because I'm in the wrong project so
that's another thing to touch on so if
we go over to go light IDE actually
found our go project and we put it in
source so it could reference all the go
libraries and things like that so you
can see that's what's going on here we
have this brush scope project and that's
actually how it's able to use the FMT
and all that other stuff so you can see
fmt is here and this is all the go code
that FMT needs in order to work properly
so when you build a go project you
basically are building it and inside of
your go directory you can build in other
directories too but it does need you
know those that go code or at least
needs to be able to find it depending on
whatever sort of editor you use but to
keep things simple for now we're just
going to have all our projects inside
the source of our go installation
directory so you can see I'm actually in
the wrong file altogether and this was
actually because I have in Clips
installed and I tried to go to the
Eclipse route which I didn't like very
much but that's the project that I was
in just now so if we go in there go and
go into source and then go into first go
project okay
so I can say it go and then I really
because it's already compiled the first
time we can just simply run the
executable first go project and you see
it runs HelloWorld so you go built the
exe for us when we went ahead and we
compiled it now if we try to run the
actual program which is main go so if
you look at the IDE the actual file that
got compiled and made into an executable
was main dot go so if we just wanted to
run the go from the command-line we
could do that now if you type main dot
go Windows isn't gonna know how to
handle that so you can see that's
looking for the app store and all that
you don't want to do that so close that
so what we want to say is go and if you
have go installed correctly when you
type go you should be able to get go
information here and if you want to know
what version you have just say go
version and you can see I have the
latest version which is go 1.5 and then
let's go ahead and look at the the file
name again so we have main dot go so
what I want to say is go run and then
main dot go so you can see that this is
actually going to build and run and then
output the result of the screen so just
like what the editor did if you don't
want to use an editor you can actually
do that you can just brought your
programs wherever you want and then just
do the go run may not go and it would
actually compile and run the program for
you so anyway guys this video is a
little bit long a little bit involved
we're trying to get everything set up so
we can be on the same page and
everything but thanks for watching
please subscribe have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
