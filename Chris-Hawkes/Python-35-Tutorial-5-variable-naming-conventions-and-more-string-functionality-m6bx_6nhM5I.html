tutorial in the last video we talked
about the difference between integers
and strings and the fact that they can
have different value types also that
they can have different values and we
talked about the variable name and and
how this is not a very good variable
name for what 21 is that nobody's going
to know that x equals 21 a better name
would be 21 because then you know what
that value is so if I had a variable
named cat then I could say that you know
meow or something and really this cat
would be a bad name to somebody cat in
the waist would be a better variable now
you're gonna know notice in Python one
of the preferred mechanisms for actually
naming a variable is that if you have a
multiple word variable to be as
descriptive as possible you want to use
underscores there's several different
styles of of naming variables there
there's these this underscore way which
is kind of the pythonic way of doing it
I'm actually I'm more of a JavaScript
c-sharp mostly that's where I spend most
of my time nowadays so a lot of times I
do my variables like this so cat noise
and this is called
camel casing because of the hump where
any you know any subsequent word after
the first is gonna have the first letter
capitalized so if it was cat noise crap
you know that's a three word and you can
see every subsequent word is capitalized
sometimes people have you know they
capitalized both of them cat noise so
for right now just you know keep it with
the under underscores keep them you know
keep it all lowercase for your variables
and for a very long time that's all that
really matters for right now unless
you're actually contributing to
production code you're not going to run
any problem whether or not you actually
do something like a camel case or just a
normal pythonic underst
our case now one of the things that we
did touch upon in the last video is that
we said that you know Python this
built-in function that takes an argument
you know an argument which could be a
string or an int or whatever it has the
ability of being able to take in
multiple arguments so really I can say
or it takes in multiple variables I
should say so I could say 21 plus cat
noise so what I'm saying is um combine
these two into one value which is going
to be one string value since they're
both strings and when we actually run
the program you'll see that it just
combined the bolt the two of them
without any sort of spacing or anything
like that now if I wanted to space what
I would want to do is just put a space
in between these two and make sure
there's a plus on either end so it's
gonna take this Plus this Plus this and
that formatting will be a little bit
better so now we have 21 meow now what
if I wanted to actually put cat noise on
the next line if I wanted to do that
Python Python strings have so Python has
special characters that are actually
inserted like normal strings but they
have special meaning and it's really
weird it takes a long time to get used
to and you might scratch your head about
it but it's important that we just get
it out of the way now this is one of the
ugly things about getting started with
programming and just trying to you know
make sense of it if I went forward slash
newline you could see this thing we're
smart enough to know that that is a
special character that means something
and when we run the program here you're
gonna see the 21 and now meow is
underneath of it the reason why is
because /n is a character a special
character that means newline so that is
what that does man if I did a forward
slash I think it's R yeah R for return I
believe that's going to have the same
exact
actually no that didn't work at all so
I'll get rid of that I mean I I'm
getting used I'm getting it mixed up
with actual regular expressions but
either way I don't really use anything
beyond the newline all that often but I
believe /t is gonna be tab so there's
gonna be like an actual tab space
between the two values so you can see
that being the big gap there but anyway
you can look up Python special
characters you're not gonna need to use
them a whole lot the reason why is that
you can actually format things just by
you know doing what I did here so I
don't really need to do much beyond just
new lines and stuff so Elysa for the
most part now one cool thing I do want
to show you which just seems so old
school and like takes me back to there
yeah I guess the 90s or the 80s
whoever's if I wanted to make that
little Bell noise that you hear your
computer make every once in a while you
can do /a so that's pretty cool so if I
ran this I'm not sure if you guys are
gonna be here but I did that you can
hear that Bell it's just awesome not
sure why you need that you know maybe if
you want to create a virus and just
freak somebody out and just have that
Bell playing over and over again that
might be cool but those are some of the
special characters that I was talking
about that you can accidentally put into
your string and you're like you know
maybe maybe you wanted to mate you know
put /s and you want the damn thing not s
I'm sorry
/n the new line and you don't want to do
a new line you're like Gavin I just
needed it to right /n because maybe it's
in my book report or something like that
well you're gonna be screwed because
when you run the program obviously this
thing is going to put it on a new line
and you're gonna be like ah my book
reports all messed up so if you actually
wanted that thing to print just like you
know 21 in me out what you need to do is
do something called escape and this is
another thing you know that you really
need to know because you're gonna deal
with escape characters and every single
language out there so to escape
something you simply put another forward
and it says to make it literal so now
you can see that it literally instead it
said I don't care about your special
meaning you're now just literally /in
and the reason why is because we added
the extra forward slash to quote unquote
escape that special character so that is
the escape key word the next thing we're
going to look at in the Python
programming language was just extremely
important is code
I'm sorry commenting every sort of
programming language you're ever going
to deal with is going to have comments
and what those are is just text telling
the you know the programmer or whoever
reads the code and what a particular
line of text is doing so in this
particular case it's it's pretty clear
that um that you're just adding two
strings together but and let's pretend
it was like some sort of complicated
algorithm or whatever in order to do a
line of comment code you're gonna want
to use the pound sign sometimes people
use multiple pound signs in a row but
either way you need one pound sign and
you're gonna see that the editor turns
at a light-gray meaning that Python when
it converts this code over to machine
language which is called compiling it
it's going to ignore those those lines
it's just gonna pass right over them
it's not gonna do anything so this is
ignored as a comment you can put
whatever you want down here and if you
need to make it on the second line you
can do this is blah blah so you can have
multi-line comments that way but this
pound sign has to be you know the first
thing because once again remember the
program is read top to bottom left to
right
all right so comments are gonna be
important that you should always leave
tidbits to anything that is even
remotely complicated and anything that
you might forget in the future because
whenever you're reading really yourself
is gonna you're gonna be your own worst
enemy as a coder because especially when
you're first starting off you're gonna
write terrible code you're gonna come
back into it and you're gonna end up
saying dammit it's easier to rewrite the
entire thing because I have no idea what
the hell I was doing
comments are gonna help with that
experience is gonna help with that
even after years of programming you're
probably still gonna look back every you
know a month or three months or six
months you're gonna be like damn I
didn't know what I was doing back then
and that's actually good it's normal
process of being a programmer it lets
you know that you're growing as a
programmer but that's actually a very
common thing that I hear among
co-workers that they look back at their
code just six months ago even if they're
professional programmers that have been
writing for years you know in a actual
you know production commercial
environment they look back on it you
know in a short period of time and
they're like damn that and it just looks
awful so I'm completely normal but
that's why comments are supposed to help
so it's supposed to be able to clarify
anything that is not really self-evident
alright guys so I'm gonna go ahead and
stop the video now and in the next video
I want to go ahead and just quickly run
through all the different Python types
that we haven't covered because really
we've only looked at integers and and
strings there's a few more that we're
going to want to look at we're not gonna
look at all of them but we're going to
look at just a couple of them that are
going to be important that you're gonna
run into a lot and just so that we know
what they are and we're not gonna deal
with them too much because we're gonna
get into just a little bit more
important object types and in Python
that you're gonna end up using a whole
lot and there's gonna be a whole video
dedicated to one particular object right
that is one of the most flexible and
awesome ones to deal with them Python
