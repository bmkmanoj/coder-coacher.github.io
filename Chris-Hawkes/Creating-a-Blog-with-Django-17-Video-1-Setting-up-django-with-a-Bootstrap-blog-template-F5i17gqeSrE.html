Django application here which is a new
post calm and what I want to do is just
I use a typical blog theme that looks um
you know nice little design here so what
we're going to do is download this free
bootstrap blog theme and install to our
Django version so we can do that really
easily just when click download now what
we need to do is unzip it to the
directory where where everything is
installed so I'm gonna go ahead and
abstracts tract it to my C Drive
projects and then the name of my
applications called post and inside
there I have a static folder so all the
images will want to extract to that
static folder I also want to make note
of copy in that directory know the j/s
we're going to extract that to the
JavaScript folder
the same thing to the CSS probably need
the fonts and the fonts don't currently
exist so let me go ahead and add that
all right and since I'm using Django I'm
not really gonna use any of this lesser
in this other stuff that it has with it
right now I'm just gonna extract that to
the post directory I forgot where I'm
going to put that one second so I'm just
going to copy these templates and the
name of the application is post in the
the module the main module is also
called post and in there there's the
template so I'm going to go ahead and
paste those templates where they need to
go all right now I'm inside the Python
editor go ahead and close this let's go
ahead and honey refresh the project so
it'll find the new files
all right so what we have to do is since
we're using Django we have to go through
the process of replacing these
directories using the built in static
files helper so at the top of your
Django template you need to go ahead and
say load static files and now we need to
go ahead and go through the process of
saying static and close that off someone
actually copied this entire first part
of it because we're going to do that for
every single image and CSS file and
JavaScript file that's in the document
looks like it's actually looking at
these are external calls to an actual
phone so we have to leave that in place
and I'm not familiar with this simple at
all so I don't even know what all this
garbage is right here I might keep it I
might not so I'll keep it right now
though okay
so we're looking for anything with an
image any sort of static file reference
so I might be missing a few of these but
for right now I'm not I don't care I'll
just revisit it later I'm gonna try to
hurry up
so if I missed any references in there
don't worry about it all right so now we
need to upload all those documents to
our server
all right so you can see it's a it's a
start one of the things the reason why
the image isn't being found is a
reference problem so we can solve that
by went back into the main folder here
and this needs to say images
I said would think there's some sort of
image or something that's supposed to be
showing up here there must be a 404
error okay let's see we got missing all
right some
my home background all right so my
editor says that there's a problem here
but there's really not
I'm try to upload it one more time just
to make sure that's not the problem
so the image that's missing is located
right here for some reason
there must be some other reference to it
all right that's obviously not working
but what I can do is just spell it out
so if you've had enough playing weather
you can just do that this should work no
problem oh you know what also it's the
fact that I needed to update update my
actual template inside post and not the
static file the static file is not the
problem at all it's in the templates so
just we upload that template I was
stupid stupid of me I was updating the
the template and not uploading that I
was just uploading the static directory
anyway either way if you would have done
the previous method that would work as
well or you can do a straight path and
it's the same end result it's just
better to use the Django built-in stuff
all right guys that's quickly how you
get bootstrap implemented with a Django
setup thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
