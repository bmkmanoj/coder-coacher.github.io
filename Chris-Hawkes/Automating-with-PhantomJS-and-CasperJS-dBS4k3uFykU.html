hey wassup guys we're gonna be
installing phantom JavaScript so I'm
gonna go ahead and show you guys what
you need to do so first thing is go to
google and you're gonna download a zip
file here for a phantom javascript and
if you're on Windows like I am just
download the zip file and literally all
you got to do is once it's done
downloading open it up extract the
contents just the entire thing just go
ahead and extract that too and then
place it anywhere you want like mine is
gonna be in the C colon projects
directory and then within there I have a
phantom j/s folder which is right here
and I actually already downloaded it so
it's already in there
so I'm not going to go through that
process but that's we have to do just
create a directory for it now because
we're gonna be using more than just
phantom JavaScript to do some scraping
we're also gonna be using something
that's built on top of that called
Casper JavaScript and Casper makes
things a lot easier to click and one of
my previous videos I had mentioned that
selenium is really good but it's slow so
fan of JavaScript is really fast but it
doesn't have a lot of capabilities like
clicking and things like that so that's
where Casper comes in Casper JavaScript
is a framework that works on top of
phantom javascript and it makes it a lot
easier to click and follow links and
stuff like that so you'll be really
unhappy with that so the same thing with
Casper
you're gonna download this here it'll
give you another zip directory just like
with phantom JavaScript and you're gonna
want to extract that to a different
folder in my case I have it in my C
colon projects directory just like
phantom JavaScript there's a Casper
JavaScript here so that's just the
contents that you're going to download
there you don't have to install anything
you strictly just extract it to that now
if you're on a Windows system I'm on
Windows 7 right now you're going to need
to add both phantom JavaScript and
Casper JavaScript to your environment
variables
so that it knows how to execute the
programs when you call on phantom Jas or
Casper Jas so in order to do that you
want to go to your control panel
and then under just click on system and
security and then click on system and
click on advanced system settings and
then you'll see a little option here for
environment variables just click on that
make sure your path is highlighted like
it is here and then you're gonna want to
edit that and for a fan of JavaScript to
work you want to just append to the end
of this your path your direct path to
where you place phantom JavaScript so
right after the semicolon don't put any
spaces or anything because you're gonna
have stuff in your path there don't
erase it just strictly put it make sure
there's a semicolon between the last
thing there and then where you're going
to place your phantom JavaScript so in
my case it's C colon forward slash
projects forward slash phantom
JavaScript and then just simply
semicolon to end that statement and now
I'm also adding Casper JavaScript so
that and that will also be on the
windows path so same thing make sure
there's no space just strictly paste the
exact path to where it can find Casper
JavaScript batch bin folder and that's
what we have here so anyway that's
that's all you have to do and then it
works so once you have that in your path
if you open up a command prompt and you
just simply type forecast well just
let's do phantom JavaScript first so for
phantom javascript me just say phantom
Jas and it'll pause there because it's
um it actually executes phantom
JavaScript there so that means that it's
installed correctly and now go ahead and
open up one more command prompt and
we're going to try out the Casper in
order to launch a Casper application
though you actually need to say Casper
jaya stop dat and you'll see there that
it executed so both of them are on the
path both of them are now installed and
now we'll be able to move forward with
actually scraping websites using phantom
javascript in Casper JavaScript
