going to talk about view and react
mostly I'm gonna mention a few other
client-side frameworks but technically I
think
Act is considered a library and view is
also should be a library you can see
it's called a JavaScript framework but
anyway doesn't matter call it framework
or library doesn't it doesn't matter so
the reason why I want to have this video
is that for the longest time I was I was
touting that react is that is the best
client-side framework out there I go
back like Mia react to go back probably
to 2014 or 2015
I remember integrating it into my Django
projects a long time ago and this was
before they even had like a JSX compiler
or transpiler whatever you call it and
then they also like at that time you
didn't even have babel so we weren't
even using babel there was a JSX
transformer code that reacted would
include and you would end up using that
for your development so react is great
for very large-scale large projects I've
seen some really really complicated
projects there was a commercial real
estate company I was working for and
they we came into a team that had been
working on a react codebase for about a
year and it was an express jeaious based
framework and a single page app and it
was using react react router it was
using redux and a few other things and
it was an incredibly complicated code
base for newbies that were just coming
into it like the the component hierarchy
and an inheritance hierarchy of the
application was just absolutely
mind-boggling it was it was incredible
because as you know like with react it's
all about building components and these
components are supposed to be plug in
place so essentially you can create a
component you should be able to reuse it
over and over again it's kind of the
entire idea of react is that you're
building really react is one major
component with a bunch of little
components in it like it's all about
this component structure and and that's
kind of the direction that the web is
taken with with Google polymer and other
things is we want to build these
self-contained
modules that don't have any sort of
dependencies on anything else I wanna be
able to drag it into my project and I
wanted to work and work correctly which
means like it's gonna be styled
correctly it's gonna have the right you
know obviously Styles colors it's gonna
have the right functionality so if I'm
uploading something or if there's
built-in validation things like that all
that should be self-contained it should
just work and that's the idea of like a
opponent so all the web frameworks
nowadays are trying to like kind of push
us into this component based system and
even jQuery did that right I mean like
we were building plugins with jQuery and
we would distribute our plugins but the
problem with that is we would say hey
you want to use this jQuery plug-in
number one you need the jQuery library
and then you need to bring in this
jQuery plug-in project then you need to
instantiate some code have some sort of
yeah like some sort of constructor
initialization or something that that
you're gonna end up doing in the file
and then you have to drag in your CSS
your images all that stuff all the paths
all the the file paths have to be right
for it to work so it was a major pain in
the ass like projects jQuery plugins
that were not very well maintained a lot
of times none of that stuff worked or
wasn't well documented drag all these
files in and find out it doesn't work
you're looking at documentation yeah
this sucks like it but the thing is is
the applications like those plugins are
not self-contained they have reliance
upon other scripts and things you have
to drag into your project and with these
component systems that like view and
react or trying to push it's like that's
you don't have those external
dependencies so it should just work
there should be a component with an
expose elate I so react is all about
these reusable components so what is the
difference between react and view well
view does the same thing and the reason
why view is so much better than react
for newbies is because with react
projects you have to actually set up a
bunch of configuration files and
everything I did a video a couple weeks
ago so in this video here what I've what
I do in this video is about in about
three and a half minutes I set up a
react working project and and that
working project includes a web pack
Babel being able to write in es6 and
also being able to have modules that you
can import and export I mean that's
using the new es6 module syntax which is
the JavaScript syntax for how we're
going to be able to import stuff like
you can import things in other languages
like Python that's not it's not
supported by the browser's in the
JavaScript language itself not now but
it's it's being worked into and we're
not quite there yet so we still have to
use tools and stuff to import our
modules as an example in that video that
I created about a week ago this
configuration was all all this stuff is
doing things and like you have to
understand what all this stuff is
actually doing
order for an actual react project to
work react also requires something
called JSX and JSX is this new syntax
which is very HTML like but it's a
combination between like HTML and
JavaScript and it's some people think
it's really ugly other people really
like it I it does grow on you
but with JSX that's another learning
curve that you have to deal with with
react where with view you don't have
that view components like view you can
drop in a file and literally start
writing your view code with view you can
use JSX and you can use module loading
and things like that but you don't have
to so for for beginners like view
definitely beats out react by far so
that you probably wondered is it only
good then for beginners well clearly
it's not I mean Alibaba major companies
are using view and view is like it's
gaining widespread adoption why because
we had a lot of libraries like like
jQuery around before jQuery became the
front-runner and like it happens almost
overnight but like 2008 like it was 2008
2009 jQuery all of a sudden like it
became a front-runner were like
everybody was using it and we're herd
animals in the coding sphere once people
start jumping on something we're looking
for the best thing we've been fighting
this JavaScript fatigue for for several
years and part of that JavaScript
fatigue was brought on by tools like you
know knockout and the JavaScript
language itself which isn't you know
very well-put-together language compared
to other programming languages doesn't
mean that it's easy to write hell Java
scripts probably harder to write than
c-sharp or even Python but the thing is
is like so it's not like JavaScript
developers or idiots or that modern UI
developers are somehow inferior to
back-end programmers that that is
completely bogus these days I mean these
client-side frameworks are so
complicated these days that I would
argue that we completely did a switch
Roo and now the client-side framework is
much more complicated to deal with than
the backend code the back-end code you
have all kinds of tools Java Script man
you you got nobody holding your hand
you're just thrown to the wolves
and
with no weapons and just torn apart man
that's that's JavaScript for you but
like so why so obviously that that
burned out a lot of developers like we
talked about over the years I did videos
over the years about JavaScript fatigue
and like and it didn't affect me as bad
as they did other people in fact I still
love JavaScript I love writing UI code
like my favorite is being in the UI even
now so with all that experience that
I've had you know eight years of
developing UIs and everything from
jQuery all the way up to where we are
now with react and view and everything I
I like react still and I still think
that react is a very viable product for
a component based system I think
reiax components are a little bit more
robust and then what View has to offer
but I think that view simplicity of
being able to do two-way data-binding
dropping in a file and automatically
having the ability to use views
templating like the views templating is
so much better than knockout Jas is
templating like it's not even close this
knockout J's this is what we were doing
in fact like I said I wrote professional
code using knockout Nakao it's not a
shitty product but it was like the first
of its kind it was it was like it was
all about taking JSON data and binding
it to your view because when we're
talking about our view you're talking
about Model View controller MVC and the
view typically depending on your stack
is going to be whatever sort of you know
whatever your stack thing is like so
with MVC net most of time you're gonna
use razor right if you're gonna use
Express you're gonna use pug which used
to be called Jade or something if you're
going to be using Django you're gonna
use Django's built-in templates or
you're gonna use Jinja too if you're in
flask or even you can use that in Django
now the point is is that these these
tools came about and because of the in
theory the because of what those other
tools couldn't deliver we created these
new tools so it's not like knockout as a
piece of and I'm here to drag I
like to drag in the mud I'm not like
knockout had its time in the Sun we took
knockout like knockout needed to be like
knockout was in my opinion one of the
first ones that really did this JSON
data binding and made it a very you know
I would say easy process to be able to
have a pretty fluid and dynamic UI that
is much easier to write the code for and
then trying to use like you know dynamic
hiding and showing using jQuery and
like you know a razor template engine
for the MVC net framework so so anyway
not trying to knock out a knock-on
knockout that's funny but a knockout had
its time in the Sun nobody should be
using anymore for any new projects don't
use it if you even consider knockout
like you'd be silly not to use view and
even still you probably want to give a
look to angular or to react
we've deviated so much so like my
opinion like where I'm at right now
unless somebody pays me to learn angular
I'm not writing any more angular code
like for real like if I have a job
prospect or they'll I had Christ we need
you to start writing some yeah I'll
learn it but like I'm not gonna learn
angular on my just on my own accord at
this point like at least that's where
I'm feeling right now on this date and
2018 that you know but and that's
only because I've spent years now going
in the other direction writing react and
then I feel like my react experience I'm
able to slide right into view and it's
just my the difference between writing
react code and view code is like view is
fun and react is not fun anymore where
react you used to be fun to me so maybe
it's just that view is just so much
newer but I don't think so I think it's
because view is so much easier it's so
much easier to reason about when I can
write my my templates in HTML and not
have to deal with a bunch of
JSX or like JSX transpilers and all this
stuff that needs to be done and I have
to like camelcase my class names and
 you know what I mean like I don't
have to do any of that with view and I
can just jump right in and do it so if I
have a major project with teams of
developers like I said multiple like
multiple developers on a team I would
consider react everything else I'm going
I'm going view if I have a bunch of
newbie developers that aren't like
JavaScript ninjas or very good UI
developers and I'm going with you if I'm
gonna be like so bare-bones where I'm
gonna choose between jQuery and view I'm
going with view like view is gonna be a
lot easier for even jQuery noobs to get
a grasp of than writing a bunch of
jQuery code that's hiding and showing
and and data binding and removing you
know elements and
watching for for stale data and stuff
like that bottom line guys my opinion
having worked with both of these for a
long time now view is the much better
option for younger developers for newer
developers not just necessarily younger
me I mean you know what I meant I meant
new we're not not like an ages type of
you but but if you're new to development
like I would definitely say view is
gonna get you started much easier than
these other client-side frameworks and
get you up to speed on where we are in
this modern day component based UI
system that we're developing alright
guys thanks for watching have a good day
bye so this video was brought to you by
a dead mountain coding boot camp they're
a boot camp that is based out of Utah
but they're also in Texas in Arizona now
and they have very good reviews so make
sure you guys check them out the link is
in the description tab below they offer
courses in web development iOS
development UX or user experience design
quality assurance and just a few other
ones in fact they're even getting into
Salesforce as well now so they're
continuing to adapt their courses based
on what the market needs are and major
companies are hiring some of their
alumni so make sure you guys give them a
look they have great reviews and thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
