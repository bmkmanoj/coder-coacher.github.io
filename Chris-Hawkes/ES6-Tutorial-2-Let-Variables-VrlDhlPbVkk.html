video we're gonna be looking at the
light variable and explain its
importance really and I think though in
order to be able to do that we need to
do this by example so what I have is um
this is the bundle jeaious so I know
that we've been using a babble in the
first video to actually compile into a
bundle yes but in this particular case I
just want to write things the old way to
kind of explain the situation real quick
so if I were to give let's just create
our like our function will create and
this is just a function regular
JavaScript function I need to say all
right so here we go and inside here I'm
gonna just give it like ow let's do it
anyway I really wished that video
wouldn't play as soon as it starts
rendering that stuff anyway so more goes
grab a variable X inside of our function
that's defined and we're just gonna say
this is and the outer scope and then
we're gonna do age like a wild true or
in fact we're gonna just say even say if
true and true is gonna be true so that
means this will run we can then say
variable x equals this is a new value
and here I want to say console dot log X
and then outside of the if loop we're
gonna say console log X so in JavaScript
when the language was first created
because it was created in 20 days the
Creator Brandon Ike said that there was
no time to add lexical scoping so what
is lexical scoping lexical scoping is
when you declare a variable inside of
this lexical burlock basically this
curly brace anything inside of this this
curly brace right here so you can see
start and anything inside here is
lexically scoped so VAR x is lexically
scoped to this to this area now down
here we create a new var X and we're
saying that this should be lexically
scoped X should really you know when the
one that's declared here should really
only exist inside of the
these braces right here but by default
JavaScript doesn't work that way I'm
going to show you if we go into and I'm
going to actually execute our function
too so that way when the page loads it
will actually run this code so let's go
ahead and open up our browser here
alright so if I hold down the refresh
button I can empty the cache because you
always want to make sure the cache is
empty go to your console here and you
can see that it actually outputs this is
a new value this is a new value so
things it didn't respect the fact that X
was already lexically scoped to this
outer function or this outer of code
block this internal code block just over
wrote the outer code block like it was
no problem whatsoever
but there is a new feature within
JavaScript to prevent that sort of thing
from happening so the new feature within
es6 is the let keyword so let variables
are basically the same thing you should
probably always use them for the most
part because really I'm finding it
really hard to come up with a
circumstance where at the top of my head
as to why you wouldn't want to use a let
but yeah so just you just use the lens
all right so let's go ahead and take a
look at this and see what happens here
and you can see that it respects to
enter an outer scope it does not change
them when we let use let let variables
now one thing that's interesting is if I
were to take this function and I would
put it in first and let's write it this
way so we're using the new es6 standard
and what happens when we use babel to
then compile it to the bundle file and
we did this in the first video so let's
go ahead and take a look at what kind of
output we have and let's take a look at
the bundled file but look what it did it
took our Lex and it turned them to VARs
but what it did do because let's are not
actually supported in older browsers
chrome knows how to how to execute all
that variable but other browsers don't
so bad will saying hey you know what we
know what you're trying to do you're
trying to protect the scope of the
variable so I did it the old way but it
gave X a new name so you know
it basically figured out what we were
trying to do automatically so that way
it will still respect the code which is
cool in a backwards compatible way but
that is the reason why let's were
created in the first place is because
you should be able to share variable
names within different block scopes and
and let now gives us that ability and
Babel will also give us the ability to
write it that way and then change it for
us on the fly but eventually the way
that we wrote it here will be supported
in all the major browsers eventually now
this is also just from one variable name
which happens to be a string but you
could also have this same you know the
same lexical scoping can be applied to
any JavaScript object whether it's a
string a number a function because fun
functions are you know just like strings
and integers basically in JavaScript so
the lexical scoping applies to not just
like you know strings I want to make
sure that that is clear alright guys so
that's all about the let keyword thanks
for watching make sure you subscribe and
have a good day bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
wanna take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
gonna be teaching you in this and this
coding bootcamp and the entire goal is
to be able to get you into the industry
within 12 weeks so if you guys are
interested in learning more information
about Deb mountain coding boot camp just
check out the link in the description
tab of this video thank you for watching
and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
