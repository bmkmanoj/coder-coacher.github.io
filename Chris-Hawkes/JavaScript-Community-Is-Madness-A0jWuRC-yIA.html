hipster douchebag who's created a nodejs
framework the video that I posted I
believe it was yesterday see I don't
even know when I post these videos
sometimes they go out like you know a
couple days sometimes I never get
released actually there's been videos
I've created that I've never released so
what I wanted to talk about in this
video though is that the JavaScript
ecosystem on certain days just you know
just this week has been a relatively
long week I'm getting ready to go on
vacation so I'm happy for that but the
JavaScript community though is a
complete mess just that's the
best I can say for it at least it feels
like that right now okay why do I say
that number one what are the hot
frameworks right now who the hell knows
right I mean there's there's angular one
and it didn't take long for angular one
to say oh this we got to keep up
with react let's go ahead and do an
angular 2.0 and let's do it all
completely different now and now instead
of using any sort of JavaScript brainy
we're gonna use typescript and you can
make the argument that typescript you
can use regular JavaScript also I'm not
a typescript developer in fact I've
never even used it I had it as one of
the languages you should learn in 2017
because it was being used by angular 2
but that was essentially it I I felt
like you know with the the designer on
stuff it might be good however now you
look at you know web development and
2016 going into 2017 and it is a
complete clusterfuck it really is like
every single project that you're
downloading now has all kinds of
different that is attached to it so
let's look at something like Babel so
number one if you want to use Babel are
you supposed to use webpack browserify
Babel doesn't do module loading so are
you even aware of what module loading is
and the synchronous module definitions
also AMD's pre-processors compilers and
anyway Babel okay so you have to figure
out Babel is going to take my ECMO
scripts six
No you can even install babel like
polyfill which is going to go out and to
every Tom Dick and Harry's github
account and attach all this stuff and so
you can actually write Ekman script 6.0
and 7.0 and the browser right now this
isn't just the regular babel compiler
this is the babel polyfill that that
does all this stuff that the browsers
are yet to support and all it really
does is you write it in a certain way
and then it actually transforms it down
to into a different way like this here's
one of these new map features for an
array and you get this which it's doing
the exact same mother-effing thing but
it allows you to write a more modern way
right now
now why do I get annoyed by that because
this is just one small piece of what
appears to be like an out-of-control
complete madhouse that is the JavaScript
development community and I'll preface
also by saying that I do like JavaScript
I write JavaScript a lot I consider
myself to be a JavaScript developer I
created websites in fact I use react in
my hipster code website I use nodejs for
this new base ijs framework that I
created I understand the benefits of
node and everything but if we look at
Babel Babel is going to here's the
polyfill that I was telling you about so
let's look at the the check out the
polyfill so Babel polyfill github so if
we look at what is this project here it
is on github let's look at the source
that can't be right is it just one
source
well that's probably a bad example but
you can see here it's importing core
Jayesh shim so what the hell is core j/s
number one what the hell is core Jas and
then what is core Jayesh shim because
you can see it's obviously not part of
this project
oh here's gorgeous it's another it's
another github project and this is bye
who the hell is this so this is actually
part of okay here's some guy from Russia
and he's got quite a few followers but
he wrote core je s and now core je s is
now somehow attached to babel polyfill
but not just in that it's also got this
core J of shim
so use Coar j/s instead of es6 shim so
once again this is just one of those
things I mean this was December 9th of
2015 so it's like oh I was using
es6 shim now I'm supposed to be using
the core gem from this guy in Russia who
attached it to the babel polyfill or a
big of polyfill attached histah you know
what I mean like who knows what's going
on at least with something like C sharp
or Python you get you know version 3.5
there's a lot of like there's a lot of
talk about what goes into it there's a
lot of documentation they say hey look
at all this stuff we just created oh and
there's going to be all these breaking
changes and things like that and
nothing's ever good enough right like so
look what if we look at the flux project
okay why didn't okay
react right okay I've always been a fan
of react but writing react and Ekman
script this is not the right flux
actually so the efflux is actually how
you dim your monitor but here's flux
that was architectural pattern created
by Facebook to be able to better use
their react components and stuff like
that to manage state between components
and now everybody is trying to use a
project like this to overcomplicate even
the simplest of processes the simplest
process is that you used to be able to
use web forms or a django template
engine or Jinja - or flask or any of
these things in just basic form handling
we now are building a bunch of react
components and then having to use a
Redux or flux architecture and we're
just making our lives more difficult in
many cases and the end result is not
really anything better than what we had
before so I've actually been able to
take let's just say for instance
knockout knockout Jas has templates so
you can do knockout Jas it's JavaScript
templates you can embed them as partial
templates and whatever you're working on
whether it's Django or asp.net razor or
something like that and it doesn't get
overly complicated but as soon as we
start using okay let's use react and now
we're using redox so now we got to use
react router and now you know what we're
gonna end up let's go ahead and use
amplify to start handling our Ajax
requests
each one of those projects has a million
effing dependencies all over the web and
they're getting updated all the time
they're getting changed all the time
there's no stability in any of it it
seems people are considered geniuses for
actually building certain projects and
maybe they are here's Redux
so Redux is main guy creating Redux is
whatever if I went over to the
contributors he's gonna be the main
contributors like Garen or something I
think he works at Facebook this guy he's
probably a really smart guy in fact I
know he's really smart but you can see
he's got all this attention and
everything
he works at Facebook it appears out of
London but now everybody's like well we
got to use redox instead of flux and
then there's other stuff that we can use
to so one the other day flame one of my
video reviewers who comments a lot and I
appreciate that he was talking about how
this basically disheartening it was to
look at some of this madness on github
and try to figure out what the is
going on I mean there's too much stuff
going on it's changing way too fast and
I think it's just the age that we're in
I don't really think I'm getting older I
just think it's the age of web
development where we are right now so
it's easy to get down on the whole thing
and say the entire thing sucks or you
can be a douchebag like me and just
create another framework and then start
promoting it and you know hoping that it
can be another you know unmaintained and
difficult to use framework that's a joke
but anyway I'm not sure what you know
how we fix this in some sense though I I
do miss the simplicity of like a ruby on
rails app or a django app or even a
flask or even MVC net or we eat hell
while web forum sucks no matter how you
look at it web forms was terrible but I
mean just
can we bring back a little bit of
simplicity now all of our javascript
through all these main projects we're
gonna be like okay we have to use Babel
we're going to be writing a necklace
crip 2016 we're acabelles step through
the code anymore really because we have
to compile that down using Babel
and then we also have to use some sort
of module loader like web pack or
browserify or gulp or something like
that and then we're gonna jumble it all
into one big-ass file that has like
28,000 lines of code good luck stepping
through that bastard when you have to
actually figure out why your stuffs not
working I don't know man and and then
what is the end result what are we
gaining when when Google Maps first came
out it was a long time ago right
but when Google Maps I remember Google
Maps like wowed me I was truly wowed by
the technology I've been able to scroll
in with my mouse wheel and scroll out
and the fact that if you had a solid
internet connection you could just see
the streets appearing and it was so much
better than what we had like with
MapQuest and stuff like that so they Wow
tuss and this would have been like 10
years ago now and they did it all
through JavaScript and they kind of like
to me it showed me you know the power of
JavaScript and what you could do with it
and you created this truly revenue
revolutionary user experience react has
millions of components that comprise the
Facebook website the Facebook website
doesn't Wow me any more than any other
website that I've ever been to 10 years
ago whether it's YouTube if YouTube will
you know YouTube was around 10 years ago
about that's when it got started but
whether you know it's YouTube or Google
Maps or something else like I to me the
entire end experience isn't any better
like I mean are we are we just going
around in a dumbass circle or are we
actually heading somewhere I don't
really know I really don't know but I
guess the only thing you can do is just
jump in and get all go and get all up in
that dirtiness and and hope to come out
on top so that's what I'm doing
I mean right now I'm writing a lot of
Atma scripts 6.0 and then having to do
this compilation process and to be
honest with you I think you know just
the whole thing kind of sucks I think it
really does I look at somebody's github
project and it's this humongous sprawled
out mess and then they give me this
minute minified javascript file and what
I actually need to figure out what the
fuck's going on I have to like
completely clone their entire
environment to try to build the project
changed around some of their atmos crypt
code before it's even turned into older
JavaScript and it's a challenge man it
really is it's a challenge anyway guys
let me know what you think I mean is
there any sanity and the JavaScript
development of our community or am I the
only one who sometimes feels this way
all right guys thanks for watching have
a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
