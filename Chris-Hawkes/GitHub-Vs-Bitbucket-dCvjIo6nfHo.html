we're looking at in this video is github
versus bitbucket so I'm sure you guys
have heard of both of these projects on
what they are as their repositories
which means there are places where you
store your code which handles like
version control and conflicts and things
like that and it helps for making sure
your data is backed up when your source
codes backed up and it also helps for
collaboration with other developers now
there's multiple versions of of how
repositories work two of the ones that
I'll mention you have Microsoft's
version of TFS and then you have what
github and bitbucket use which is get
which was actually developed by Linus
Torvalds the guy who invented the Linux
operating system so those are the two
options in github and bitbucket both use
the git version of repository handling
now microsoft's version just to give it
a quick update it is going on they use
something called team foundation server
TFS and it has a lot of built-in stuff
that a lot of corporations like as far
as like items so tracking work items to
dish out to different people tracking
work hours associated to those items
it's also very good for like a jallandar
the open source community has embraced
get and is definitely it seems to be the
de facto standard for most projects even
dotnet open sourcing their stuff as of
late they open sourced it on github so
that's really why I'm looking at github
and bitbucket
so github is free and that's the first
one we're going to look at github is by
far the most popular repository out
there it's had a lot of venture capital
funding including like Adrian Horowitz
was one of those guys that actually
invested quite a bit of money in github
because most of the projects that were
being started were on github so
definitely has a lot of traction
their pricing though is one of the pain
points for a lot of indie or small
developers it is free for unlimited
repositories however you cannot make
those repositories private so as you can
see you get zero private repositories
another thing too is that you so you do
have to pay at least seven dollars a
month to get any sort of private
repository with collaborators now it
does allow unlimited collaborators which
is pretty cool so it doesn't limit your
team member or team size or anything
like that
now the big buckets pricing on the other
hand is actually much more flexible you
can get a free plan without paying for
anything it allows up to five users so
there is instead of unlimited users with
bit github you have bit bucket
restricting you to five users which is
still a pretty decent size small team
and you can also get unlimited
repositories whereas with github you
only got I think it was five
repositories for the $7 a month plan so
i'm limited users five repositories this
is unlimited repositories and five users
and it's free so bitbucket definitely
has github beat on the price point now
one of the cool things about bit bucket
is that it's actually written in Python
Django which is one of my favorite
frameworks one of the first frameworks I
ever got involved in I feel like I've
contributed quite a bit to the Django
community as far as questions and
promotion and things like that so that's
pretty cool so if you ever wondered what
bit bucket was created in it's actually
Python Django and on the contrary github
is written using Ruby with Rails as its
back in framework so we all know that
Python and Django beats ruby hands down
I'm just kidding guys so they're both
good frameworks as far as security and
reliability is concerned github made the
news a couple years ago where they had a
major hack you can read more about it
happen in 2013 regarding their SSH
handling and there's plenty of new sites
that that you could read up on the
actual security risk so github hasn't
had like a perfectly clean record when
it comes to actually
of maintaining those private
repositories now bitbucket they're
always stay up-to-date on their security
it's not like there are flawless or
anything like that but if they do run
into some problems they have a blog
that's available and they try to address
those those concerns immediately and you
can see like they mention it open SSL
security issue that was advised and they
give you know a shout out saying that
they're not affected by it so that's
pretty nice of them now as far as the
user interface is concerned github has
bitbucket beat um they have a lot of
features that they really pioneered how
this whole set up works here's the open
source project that I created just you
know this entire layout is just fluid
from the issues reporting to how issues
are tracked and resolved pull requests
for merges things like that the online
wiki a lot of these features are just
really nice now so github you know
definitely has bitbucket beat in that
regard however I'm bitbucket has made a
lot of recent advancements so they have
a lot of the same features where you can
do pull requests and issues and a lot of
you know a lot of the same you know a
lot of the same things that github does
have available is slowly being
integrated into bitbucket but it seems
like you know they're constantly playing
catch-up in that regard but once again
they you know they are free for smaller
teams now another thing the bitbucket
has which is pretty cool is that they
have integrated the JIRA so JIRA is a
way to track a lot of you know work
items and requests and things like that
that a lot of companies use it's part of
what makes TFS and Microsoft's um you
know solution very attractive but a lot
of job of people they've been using JIRA
for a long time and JIRA and now is
baked into bitbucket with support so big
book it has github beat in that regard
as far as I know bitbucket is the only
repository that actually has a plugin
that you can use for integration with
JIRA now the final thing that I'll
mention is that github has
bitbucket beat by quite a bit when it
comes to actual users so
I don't have the exact percentage I was
trying to find something that was
actually reliable for you guys and
unfortunate I don't have it but um I
wanted to give a percentage of what
github has but github by far has more
users than bitbucket at the moment but
bitbucket does seem to be I'm also
making a comeback in that regard as well
so the bottom line is that you can't
really go wrong with either version
bitbucket is certainly a feasible
alternative to github for no money down
and if you want something that you feel
like is going to be built it to last I
mean both of them are here to stay I
would say at least my opinion is that
both are not not going anywhere anytime
soon so it really doesn't matter as far
as what I would choose I'm actually
using a bit bucket but I also use github
too so if I'm going to do a public
repository I'll probably just go with
github since it's free but if I'm going
to do some sort of proprietary project
I'm going with bitbucket for right now
since it is free alright guys thanks for
my thanks for watching my video and
please subscribe let me know what you
think or if there's any other
repositories you guys want to mention
I've heard of a couple of other ones I
just wanted to keep this down they're
just two frontrunners all right thanks
for watching bye
