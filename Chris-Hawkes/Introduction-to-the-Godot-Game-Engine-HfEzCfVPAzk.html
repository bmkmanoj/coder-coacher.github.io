some news with you in regards to
something I heard about yesterday this
Godot project is an open source 2d and
3d game engine and the reason why I
think it's awesome is that it's very
difficult to find a game engine that's
truly open source and you know free to
use for commercial purposes and
personally purse purposes and this is an
MIT license project and the reason why I
heard about it is that the Mozilla
Corporation gives out money to different
nonprofits through not just nonprofits
but you know open source projects
throughout the world and they've donated
to a lot of things like the Django
project and everything and they donate
it to this Godot project and I had never
even heard of it and I usually try to
stay up to date on some of the game
engines and everything but I've never
actually used this product but I just
want to make sure I give this give a
shout out because anytime I see
something like this I get excited behind
it and I'm not a I'm not a game
programmer at all in fact I suck at it
my arts even worse but I still like to
play with it I find it interesting so I
just want to make sure if you guys have
any sort of interest in this that you
might want to check it out but I'm gonna
go ahead and download it and just kind
of do a a quick run-through real quick
just to see how this thing all works and
I'm on Windows right now so we're
obviously gonna want to use the stable
release and I'll probably do a 64-bit
windows install here so it looks like
it's just an executable file so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna end up
extracting that I'll probably put it in
my projects directory so you guys know
if you've ever watched my tutorials I
put almost everything there and I'll go
ahead and I'll create a folder inside
the projects folder here so I'll say
make new folder and we'll just call this
Godot select that and extract it there
so I'm going to go into the Godot folder
where we extracted it and just run the
executable file so this actually brings
up the project manager so you're going
to end up creating new projects from
this screen so in order to create a new
project we need to go over here and
click on new project and we'll go ahead
and let's add a path here so we're going
to look at
so I should probably create a folder
inside here which I'll just call games
so we'll just call the file we'll just
call it first try and the project name
is games I don't know if I like that
that's not let's give it a different
name here well I'll say well just call
it a new game for right now create
alright so here's our new game if we
double click on it it'll open up in our
engine so this is actually our scene
editor and really it's not even just
scene editor it's the entire Godot
editor so when it says editor this is
what it's referring to
so everything in Godot apparently is all
node based and and nodes are like
basically like HTML you can think of it
like HTML where you have parent-child
relationships so if you're looking at an
HTML list item a list item typically has
a parent that is a UL so UL is a node
and a li is a node but the same thing is
going to be this the situation with
Godot you're gonna have a bunch of nodes
that are that exists inside of scenes
and you could have multiple scenes and a
project and you can have multiple nodes
and the nodes can link back to each
other and the scenes can link to each
other and everything else so the first
things first we're going to go with the
hello world example so we need to go
ahead and create our first node so on
the left hand side under the scene menu
if we hover over this blank piece of
paper icon it says add and create a new
node so we'll go ahead and add that and
then we want to actually look for a
label so you can actually use the search
box up here because there's all kinds of
different nodes that you can use but
we're gonna add the label and then just
click the Create button now one thing to
note is that when we looked at all the
different node types you saw that there
was a bunch of them but when we do label
it switches the actual product project
from 3d to 2d so if you've ever seen
Unity engine you know that there's both
a 3d view and a 2d view but label
switched it to 2d because labels are
only used for 2d so there's gonna be
nodes out there to only work for 2d and
ones that only work for 3d and some that
work for both so now if you've ever
development and visual studio you know
that visual studio is a very complicated
process but when you click on certain
features there's a properties menu that
pulls up so this entire thing under the
scene is actually called the the the
tree view or the it's actually called
the tree editor so you're gonna be able
to see all your nodes inside here in a
tree format but then on the right-hand
side and the inspector panel you're
gonna see all of these these properties
so these are all properties that are
exposed to you on the label so if we
wanted to actually change the text we
need to go in here we need to look for
text and we could actually even search
and it will search through all the
properties but here's the text so if I
double click on that that was a little
weird there but if I double click on
this I can say hello world and then type
it so here's our label that's in our
game alright so now that we've changed
the project what we need to do is
actually save this file so you can press
ctrl s and it's gonna know that we need
to actually save a DSC in which is a
scene file and it's gonna save it under
this resource so don't change this
because this resource signifies your
actual root resource of the project and
instead of label scene we're actually
going to just say scene one dot scene
and then we can click Save alright so
now that you've actually saved it you
can run the program by clicking on this
little icon or you can press F wait no
main scene has been defined select one
from the project settings
all right so we look at the artists
project settings under the application
category so if we go under scene and we
go into project settings there's
supposed to be some application category
here's main scene what is all this crap
so I believe what we need to do is click
on main scene and then if we go ahead
and we main scene and this gives us a
file that we can look for so let's go
and click on scene one so we're telling
scene one is the main scene to start up
and now we shouldn't have to save this
we should just be able to close it and
let's see if we can run it now all right
so it saved the scene automatically and
there it is boom our first game is
actually running so that's pretty
awesome
also you may get a firewall pop-up so
just allow access I should be fine so
this engine I can say that I haven't
spent a ton of time with it but I really
like it i mean i have used unreal engine
and unity and for some reason this Godot
engine just seems so much more
simplistic the the scripting behind it
all is actually very very basic so if I
wanted to add like a container and add a
script you can click this add a script
button and you can give it a name here
and just create and then inside here you
can see that it uses a scripting
language and it's very similar to Python
but it's not exactly Python so the Godot
creators were like you know Python is
great but apparently they they run into
some issues originally they were using
Lua and this game mentioned by the way
is actually written in C++ and C so a
lot of the very process intensive stuff
is actually being done in C so the
Python like syntax they call it Gd
script so you'll end up doing some of
that and then you can see a little
script button is added here and we're
just gonna exit out but you also have
ways to be able to like signal so if you
wanted to have the ball like here's this
ball here
if we went ahead and added a signal you
can see that all these different things
are the built-in signals that come with
the rigidbody2d
so if you wanted to listen for stuff you
could do that there yeah the whole thing
is relatively easy I mean if you want to
so everything is basically scenes that
have multiple nodes so here is a a
there's this this ball as its own scene
actually and the scene is being
referenced from this container scene and
to actually say what's teen scene you
wanted to start we obviously go to
project settings like I showed you and
when you click on this file you can
actually pick what scene you want so I
have a couple scenes that I've been
playing around with but here's this
container steam scene so that tells it
to use that as a startup but you can see
ball is actually its own scene as
referenced under the container so it's a
child node of container and if we play
this you can see that it has scene of
the basic physics and things that you
need you can adjust the items so if I
went to ball I can go over on the
right-hand side I know the text is kind
of small I don't not actually increase
the text on this editor yet but you can
increase the bounce so if we want to
bring it up to one we could do that and
then let's scale the gravity just a
little bit
I'll make the gravity too
so you can see it falls down a little
bit faster definitely has some more
bounce but that's a lot of hard work
that's already been written for you
another thing too is you can just easily
select this and press ctrl D to start
copying a bunch of elements
yeah bouncing and odd stuff so that's
pretty sweet
you can also obviously move them around
I didn't save it
also if you want to switch between
scenes you have these tabs up here so if
I save it now it'll actually run it the
way I wanted I just love how everything
is so self-contained and very fast so
this may not be the best engine for the
most advanced games in the world but I
mean for some simple you know Android
type games I mean it for like 2d games I
can't think of anything easier than this
so far I mean I've use unity quite a bit
but here when you have export you can
see that you can export to all the
different environments except for it
looks like the iPhone is missing because
you know I wonder if that's gonna
eventually be down the road I'm assuming
Mac means actual Mac and not not iPhone
or iOS so but either way at least
Android has the dominant market share so
I don't know man this thing's pretty
cool and obviously it's going to get
better Mozilla just added some some cash
to the project so that should be able to
help this community also I plan on you
know using it myself so I'll try to talk
about it raise awareness I think you
guys should take a look at it it's one
of the coolest things I've seen so far
for just basic game development and I'm
trying to see if I should share anything
else also if I wanted to well you know I
can just switch this say hello scene and
I'll set that as my startup I was just
basically doing some of the like the
labels and buttons so a lot of games are
very simplistic you know click here
hover this do that you can see that
there's a panel on the panel has a
script to it and the script just says
get node and it finds button and it's
not looking for the actual like button
type it's actually looking for the value
button so that this value can be changed
here by double-clicking it and changing
the name and inside your script you're
referencing the button so the node name
and it has to be a child by the way so
this button is a child of panel and the
script you can see it by this little
button this little script icon here is
attached to the panel so button is a
direct child of panel and that's why
it's found and it says connect so if you
press it it says on button press and it
fires this function here which once
again this is all very similar it's a
very basic language here and it just
says get label so it knows to get the
child label and then change the text to
hello and by doing that you click this
and changes it to hello so I don't know
man this is by far the easiest intro
I've ever seen to a gaming engine I
think it's I think it's pretty sweet you
guys should check this out and let me
know and once again I'm not getting paid
to say this by the way some people are
like oh your while you promoting this or
that and I would have to actually say
that I'm being promote or I'm promoting
some product on youtube if I was
promoting it but I'm simply promoting
this for free and I have nothing to do
with the project so hey guys let me know
what you think and take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
