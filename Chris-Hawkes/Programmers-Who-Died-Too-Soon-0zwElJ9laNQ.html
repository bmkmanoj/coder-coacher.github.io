is about programmers that have died too
early or too young and I tried to
comprise this list and just to get it
out there it actually turns out a lot of
my research into this the it seems like
most programmers live like a long
fulfilling life I mean I've saw a lot of
people dying and there's 70s and 80s and
60s in the even older now they're
they're you know obviously there's some
programmers they they died tragically
the number one cause of death and a
younger programmer what I've seen now
this isn't across the entire programmer
industry this is actually you know
notable programmers programmers that are
in the history books of programming for
doing this or that so it's not like I
can Colette you know collect data on all
of it but you know suicide is by far the
leading cause of death amongst famous
programmers that I've have often you
know themselves at an early age so it's
going to get into this list just before
we even start with just a few of the
items that I have here I do want to
mention one kind of side note so just
you know because there's a lot of
younger people that are watching me and
who knows man maybe if you know if it
saves one life and then it's obviously
worth it but this this programmer here
Nicolas from MIT he was apparently
according to some of the professors you
know he was bound for greatness was
finishing up at MIT and was actually
trying to climb a dome at him MIT and
I'm assuming it was some sort of like
you know college either you know not
really a hazing type thing but it was
like you know kind of leaving your mark
on the the the campus or whatever I'm
sure a lot of there's you know tradition
there and things like that he was trying
to climb the dome at MIT and it was
apparently a pretty high high location
but he ended up falling off and dying at
the age of 24 so he was supposed to be
bound for great things and unfortunately
you know he died early you know for a
simple accident so number one don't do
 like that number two you know just
know that you're not invincible in them
and really in any and anything you do so
alright let's go and get into this list
here we're gonna start with with
Danielle berry now she was a smoker she
died of lung cancer so now she didn't
really offer suffering like that but you
know obviously smoking is a
interests but she died at 49 so she
definitely makes the list but she worked
on things like mule would say really
before our time kind of thing but she
she goes down the history books as being
a good game designer and programmer and
somebody that really helped the online
multiplayer aspect of computer gaming in
the 80s and everything our next one is
Bob miner co-founder of Oracle so Oracle
now is still headed by one of the
cofounders which is Larry Ellison and
Larry Ellison is one of the richest
people in the world
Oracle is one of the largest companies
but this guy co-founded it but died all
the way back in 94 man and he actually
died of a speciose man as a mesothelioma
but asbestos man this stuff is like they
used to put that stuff in all these
houses and everything which was for like
insulation but even housing siding and
flooring tiles also contain asbestos so
it was like everywhere I began that I'm
dying from lung cancer it's caused by
that all right next one is Lynn Sassa
man so this guy was a PhD who did a lot
of work with cryptography and was also
big for I guess it's a non amaizing I've
never actually used it but I 231
actually committed suicide according to
his wife it's unclear how he died at
this point next one is going to go to
Ada Lovelace and she's actually
considered to be the first computer
programmer by a lot of people's
standards because while her and Charles
Babbage were working on the you know the
computer they call it the computing
machine or something but our analytical
machine they were never really able to
come up with you know their their full
realization or anything but while they
were working together she did come up
with like the first type of Co routines
and things are what we would consider Co
routines and and programming now or
functions and I really go to statements
and things like that so I know some of
that stuff was was in some of her
theoretical design of how you would
actually use the analytical machine so
but it goes down to being the first
computer algorithm and and her name is
attached to that so she died at 36 from
uterine cancer you know more of a
natural cause but still very young
so now this guy another actually he was
born not too far from me in Arlington
Virginia but he was one of Microsoft's
early employers he went to Brown
University I think he also went to
University of Washington here but died
unexpectedly of pneumonia at 53 so I
consider that to be relatively
unexpected I mean pneumonia to get you
know 53 seems relatively uncommon at
least to me I just but then again that
there's no research or educated opinion
coming from there that's just my
complete like out of the blue like
that's what I think but I'm probably
wrong all right next one is bill Zeller
so he created the my Tunes application
which is another application that I'm
just not too familiar with man is a
program that allows one of those users
and Alan music from an iTunes music
server nowhere else actually pretty cool
so I was actually thinking about
something much older but this guy's
actually younger than me and you know
died very young yeah so this one's
really messed up I mean this dude was
only 28 when he ended up hanging himself
and by the time they found him at
Princeton he apparently had oxygen
deprivation
so it was like brain-dead or took him
off of life support family he was going
to Princeton and created this my Tunes
application and apparently though he'd
the reason for him committing suicide
was actually because like he was
sexually molested as a young child and
couldn't like get over that and killing
himself so and another's well there's
actually a pretty morbid video I'm
putting together here anyway let's go
ahead and mention Steve Jobs obviously
so not really you know a programmer but
clearly very important to programming
and software and computer hardware in
general technology in general really
humanity or whatever so depending on who
you ask
Steve Jobs definitely gets mentioned out
there because I mean cancer took him
pretty early so he was there for 56 but
still that I feel like that was
definitely a huge blow for technology
everything for anybody that cares about
technology that Steve Jobs was probably
a huge blow all right so here's another
another lady programmer so we're trying
to be gender inclusive here Clara down
or down the bottom and I only was a
scientist pioneer programmer she died as
a suicide but it looks like wow she just
walked in the ocean and drown Wow
alright so she was like 52 once again
gets mentioned because you know she
because she committed suicide she chose
to you know to leave on those terms at
that point so you know who knows what
humanity history and everything else
lost when when these people decided to
move on anyway yeah so let's go ahead
and continue down our list next one is
Andrew flew googleman and he was
apparently a big promoter a pioneer of
the shareware business model for
software ended up most likely committing
suicide because apparently in 1985 he
was suffering from colitis and was
diagnosed with cancer so on the
afternoon of July 6 1985 he left his
office and his car was found a week
later and apparently they had a memorial
service needs presumed dead according to
Wikipedia but his body's never been
found
here's another suicide victim Tim
striker and he's best known for creator
major BBS a computer bulletin board
software package died at 41 apparently
shot himself Jonathan James he's actual
he was a hacker so he's still considered
a programmer but he ended up killing
himself and well yeah so he shot himself
he was actually facing prison charges
apparently for some for some hacking and
things like that and had no faith in the
justice system and decided to kill
himself instead of going through
the courts to try to prove his innocence
all right Ian Murdoch software engineer
known for the founder of the Debian
project found he had hanged himself
apparently not a hundred percent sure
that's pretty terrible though but yeah
obviously I know about the Debian
project so him founder the Demian
project actually hung themselves it's
pretty messed up Mike muss he died of an
automobile accident actually on the
highway that I hate more than any other
highway in the entire world and that's
interstate 95 which runs through
Virginia and it's it runs all the way up
and down actually the eastern seaboard
of the east coast of the united states
all the way from Florida all the way to
Maine so it's a terrible highway though
through the DC area this is always
jammed up anyway he died of an
automobile accident on that Highway
unfortunately this guy is author of the
freeware and network tool ping Johns
Hopkins graduate man like dude obviously
super talented died at 42 man that's
just pretty shitty and happened to grace
Maryland actually I was just up there
not that long ago yeah that's the
extremely morbid video it turns out but
I guess it needs to be said right I mean
if we're all programmers right so it's
we should probably understand you know I
guess what the risks are and and you
know and still honor you know the the
pioneers of the industry and things like
that but here's this guy Phillip Gale so
he was a another extremely young guy he
ended up going to MIT Earthling his
father died apparently started suffering
from depression shortly after his father
died and jumped out of a 15-story window
at MIT and ended up dying from suicide
obviously but uh yeah that's pretty
messed up I mean obviously he loses his
father and then just you know got bored
with life I mean he was incredibly smart
obviously at MIT and everything and yeah
step on its own it's it's unfortunate
man I mean people get in these deep dark
moods
and you can't shake him and depressions
a real thing so Jim why Rick Eric um I'm
probably not saying that way I apologize
but he created the rake tool which is a
popular build tool for Ruby and I'm not
really sure yeah I'm not really sure how
he died or whatever but I could have
been completely natural maybe he doesn't
even need to get mentioned here in this
list but obviously he was a good
programmer and important to Ruby so the
next one is pretty like you you look at
most famous programmers and Phil Katz's
is on that list and in many cases you
know creator of the zip file format and
things like that or co-founder of it
author of the pkzip so it extremely
important extremely smart 37 years old
and essentially drank himself to death
so he had battled alcoholism and
apparently had you know several duis
report is his death and everything and
like I mean just yeah 37 there's
terrible way to go according to
Wikipedia here coroner's report said
that the death was a result of acute
pancreatic bleeding caused by chronic
alcoholism all right next one Arliss is
another famous one which is Aaron
Schwartz and he's extremely famous his
case was like front and center and 23
2013 when he ended up hanging himself in
his closet and he was a huge advocate
for open source software lawrence lessig
if i'm saying his name right as i was
one of his what was Aaron Swartz was one
of his mentees and he had nothing but
like great things to say about her and
Aaron Swartz Aaron sports also invented
the RSS feed and popularized all that
and he also came up with the markdown
publishing format so incredibly sad man
this dude 26 decided to hang himself he
was also facing criminal charges
and in like apparently the judge was
trying to throw the book at him I mean
they said he was arrested Harvard campus
police so he released like documents
like college papers and things like that
he wasn't allowed to release and he
released them publicly and apparently
yeah it plead guilty at 13 federal
crimes so anyway they wanted some prison
time it looked like for for what he had
done and clearly Aaron didn't want to go
to prison and I don't know me the whole
thing was up completely and he
ended up killing himself unfortunately
so world lost a lot of great programmers
last time I'm gonna mention for this
morbid morbid video probably the most
morbid video I've ever done and then
that is the famous Alan Turing who got
criminally criminally prosecuted by his
government for being gay even though he
helped and was arguably one of the most
important figures in World War two to
help win the war for the Allies when it
came to breaking the German cryptography
machines and things like that that they
were using the Enigma machine whatever
you know what I you know I have all this
stuff if I if I planned out right now I
know all about it but when you're
talking you're just kind of going
through stuff I'm just to let you know
like a lot of times things come out and
you're like oh I didn't mean to say it
but like in your head like you know all
about the Enigma machine you've read
about you've watched the friggin book
with Benedict Cumberbatch and all that
like read the moon watch the movie read
the book you know what I'm talking about
anyway alright guys so then this this
this list is now complete make sure you
guys subscribe also vote up this video I
appreciate it it helps me make sure you
check out my sponsors and I need more
sponsors as well or donations if you
guys wanted yeah so I'm completely up to
you but it could definitely help with
the channel alright guys thanks for
watching have a good day bye hey guys so
a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching
this 12-week course is geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
