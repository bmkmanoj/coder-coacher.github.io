talking about this so I figure this
channels probably not really discussing
this type of thing but I think that you
know news like Donald Trump being
elected president does affect technology
and obviously it might play a part in to
you whether or not some of you guys you
think learning to be a developer a
programmer is still a good idea and I
can just quickly say that you know this
is this really I don't think is as big
of a deal as everybody makes it out to
be I did wake up this morning and I was
I was actually shocked that he won I
didn't expect him the win I don't think
most people expected them to win but
just kind of looking at like why did
this happen and just to give a few
thoughts on myself without you're really
just my own perspective just because
that's what everybody's doing and I
think I have a few key items here that
just kind of come to mind and I really
just sat down for like 30 minutes just
trying to think over the last few years
you know what are the things that have
kind of led up to where we are right now
to elect somebody like Donald Trump and
is it really you know something to do
with you know the Americans rising up
you know males rising up against a woman
leader and things like that so let's
talk about this for just a moment so
number one then when this tape released
four weeks ago or so from the Access
Hollywood tape where Trump was on a live
mic talking about when you're a star you
can grab them by the pone Tang they let
you do everything basically you know I
don't I didn't see how anybody could
possibly survive something like that so
that in of itself like the fact that he
didn't drop out leading up to the
election is absolutely amazing because
everybody i was talking to at the time i
was saying the guy has to drop out of
the race there's no way you can be
caught saying something like that even
in the privacy of your own home or
whatever and and become the president of
the united states it just didn't seem
possible and in the spirit of that i'd
like to play this video that i actually
saw the day with excuse me first
down the hall and grab him by the
thanks so I got to say you know this
down the hall grab a mother that's the
video from from YouTube there I thought
that was actually quite hilarious but
once again I never thought that he could
actually survive something like that to
me that's that was absolutely amazing
and of its of itself so there's now this
new Twitter blackout hashtag that's
trending people like Katy Perry lady
gaga they're you know they're basically
saying that you know they're part of
this movement that he's not my president
even some members of like a band that I
respect not base I thank goodness but
some band members are talking about
openly like you know riding protesting
in the streets and things like that I
mean it's not the way that it works in a
democracy or a democratic republic which
is what the United States is I believe
you know you Electra leaders and and
granted half the people probably aren't
happy with it but if that is the way the
election worked out then you know they
are your president you can't just not
like the president and say that he's not
your president there's plenty of people
that didn't like Obama or some of his
policies but you know they should still
respect him as the president call him
the president and things like that and
we've clearly seen that as soon as Obama
was elected you know there was a you
know the creation of the Tea Party and
things like that so you know Obama
definitely had a relatively raw deal
when it came to being elected and then
being under immediate attack from the
Republicans trying to make him a
one-term president and things like that
when the country really needs unity I
mean you need to actually be able to
work together on both sides you know the
way that presidents and the paths have
done I mean Bill Clinton did it even
George Bush did it to an extent you have
Reagan and going back to earlier
presidents as well I mean there's been
presidents that have accomplished great
things on both sides of the aisle dwight
d eisenhower comes to mind in the 1950s
and 60s who sent in the hundred and
first airborne into little rock arkansas
and at the time Little Rock Arkansas was
actually run by a Democratic governor so
a lot of people were like well you know
Lincoln's not the party of the
Republicans anymore that you know
Lincoln was a modern-day progressive and
they're probably right about that I mean
in this day and age JFK would be
considered a hardcore conservative and
Lincoln would be a hardcore liberal
progressive but eisenhower being a you
know military hero from World War two
and things like that you know he was a
definitely a conservative Christian
Republican who was relatively well
respected as one of the better
presidents and obviously Franklin
Roosevelt and the times that he led
through the Great Depression on the
Democratic side the point being is that
there there are good leaders on both
sides of the equation and there doesn't
have to be such fighting and bickering
and arguing over things like this now
one of the things that personally ixnay
is somebody like Katy Perry is an
entertainer I mean she goes on stage she
wears like you know outfits she's
hot I mean all admitted but you know she
also she never she never graduate high
school I'm not gonna hold it against her
anything like that but it's not like
she's some sort of expert in economics
or you know Foreign Affairs or how to
run businesses and things like that you
know it's just I think a lot of
Americans are tired of hearing from
celebrities about how they should live
their lives and how they should think
because they don't really live in the
real world I mean they're they're not
the ones who are sending their kids to
the the typical public schools you know
they don't really see the problems
day-to-day and they certainly don't
struggle paycheck to paycheck trying to
pay their personal property taxes you
know while you know like plenty of
people just soak up you know free free
wealth and welfare and things like that
so there's all kinds of issues that I
think some of the Hollywood and you know
the elites on both sides you know just
fail to see they they just become
completely oblivious to what's going on
in the real world so they say Hillary
Clinton lost because she is a woman at
least that's what some people are saying
but clearly that's not the case Clinton
underperformed compared to Obama with
Africa
Americans which is probably to be
expected since barack obama was the
first african-american president she
definitely underperformed with latinos
and that actually says a lot considering
the fact that you know Trump was
considered a racist and had said some
very very questionable things about the
Latinos when he was talking about you
know some of the people sneaking across
the border in Mexico were rapists and
things like that and he didn't say all
of them are raped rapist or anything but
it's definitely a it was a inflammatory
comment that got people up in arms and
immediately well you know got Trump
labeled a racist that an among studying
amongst among other things he was you
know he was equated to being a
modern-day Hitler and stuff like that so
as far-fetched as that is because if I
look back at history of World War two
and what Hitler was actually doing you
know I don't really yeah I don't equate
Donald Trump to being Hitler I feel like
people need to read the history books a
little bit more to to understand the
differences there but that's just my
personal opinion I don't see Donald
Trump being some sort of Hitler in fact
I don't see the United States ever being
a country that allows one person to have
so much control that they can just do
whatever they want and an example of
that is that the Republicans accused
obama the same thing that you know they
tried to accuse him of being a tyrant
some people said that he was racist
plenty of people said that he was Hitler
like I mean oh it's just there's just
hate on both sides and then if you look
at all so the final thing is that
Clinton also underperformed against
Barack Obama with young Millennials so
in all three ways I don't think you know
I guess you could equate the possibility
that the difference is here RB are you
know the fact that african-americans
Latinos and Millennials may have held it
against Clinton that she was a woman and
maybe you know maybe there is some of
that but I personally do not experience
like the glass ceiling type of thing and
in my experience in fact that I've
worked with quite a few women in the
business world and many of them make way
more money than I do and many of them
have been my boss so I'm sure that the
glass ceiling exists in a lot of
different places I mean how women
couldn't even vote I don't think
hundred years ago so you know they're
they're certainly held down in some
religious sense you know they are
considered you know to be like you know
this you know head or woman of the
household and respect to the man of the
house so you know I understand woman's
point of view when when it comes to like
basically white male corporate America
and things like that but it's not the
case everywhere but I'm sure that you
know it doesn't exist quite a bit I just
personally don't see it very much in the
DC metropolitan area of Virginia so the
FBI director James Comey obviously had a
big factor of this I mean just like a
week ago he announced that the
investigation was open due to the the
you know terrible congressman from New
York Anthony Weiner who is you know
can't keep his dick in his pants
basically I mean the dudes taking Weiner
shots of himself and sending it on
Twitter I mean who does that and how do
you get elected to public office with
that kind of you know activity going on
in your personal life I don't understand
that but the point is that his wife was
one of Clinton's trusted aides and comee
felt like it was necessary to say hey we
just uncovered like 10,000 more emails
or something like that and that that
there's a possibility that this could
affect the Clinton election and I feel
like if he you know he was in a position
where he was like you know what Clinton
was going to win and if if she wins and
it turns out there's some sort of
damaging email that I knew about then
you know the fact that I didn't say
anything is going to get me in trouble
but now it seems like the fact that he
did say something especially now that
she's been cleared he's going to get in
trouble no matter what so the wikileaks
thing was obviously very damaging I mean
Julian Assange tried to say didn't he
didn't intentionally sway the US
election but look the WikiLeaks was
extremely damaging the Clinton I mean
she she colluded with you know Dean or
at least the Democratic National
Committee people were colluding against
Bernie Sanders who was very very popular
in fact Bernie Sanders probably would
have won those Rust Belt states in the
United States that ended up handing the
election the Trump and the state's I'm
talking about as I
Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania and
there's a good chance that you know some
of these you know displace blue collar
white Americans that ended up you know
flocking the Trump what it probably at
least a good percentage of them would
have supported Bernie Sanders and
probably would have been enough to tip
the balance in the favor of the
Democrats but they did they certainly
colluded against him he he basically
just accepted it because you know he
felt like accepting it and going with
Clinton was a better you know a better
position for the United States then and
then you know electic Donald Trump but
it turns out none of that worked in
their favor so another thing is the the
Syrian refugee in the United States I
think was like a pretty big deal and I
find this interesting we hear these
states here were the governor's you know
based on their own personal support or
whatever from their states more against
Syrian refugees being allowed into the
country now this is in you know this is
post than the nice terrorist attacks and
France the Paris terrorist attacks the
Brussels Belgium you know bombings the
Boston Marathon bombings you're talking
about Orlando Florida shooting San
Bernardino California all kinds of
terrorist activity going on the United
States and really the most terrorist
activity that we've seen since nine
eleven at least on US soil and then you
know combine that with Isis beheading
people online and taking you know large
parts of Syria and Iraq and things like
that basically people were like yeah I
don't want a bunch of Syrian refugees
from a war-torn area coming into the
United States and it's interesting that
a lot of these states even some of the
bluer ones or at least the swing states
were clearly against that and pretty
much every one of these ended up going
Republican except for maybe New Jersey
and Connecticut here and Nevada
obviously so how is Trump's you know
victory going to affect Silicon Valley
well I mean we've already seen yeah that
Mark Zuckerberg Reid Hoffman Marissa
Mayer but you know these CEOs and major
tech firms that they are a hundred
percent for h-1b visa and you know they
say that the h-1b visa is all about
trying to get skilled labor into the
United States and that's what
intended for its intended for you know
being able to bring in the best and the
brightest from overseas to be able to
fill in positions that can't be filled
from within the United States but the
problem is is that companies end up
manipulating this system in order to
keep and suppress wages and sometimes
they'll post bogus jobs on job forum
sites and things like that asking for
the world knowing that they're not able
to fulfill it but that way they have you
know they have the necessary
documentation and say hey I had this job
open for like four months couldn't find
anybody so I imported somebody from from
India or Taiwan or something like that
in order to be able to fill it so
there's a lot of people that are against
you know the h-1b visa program being
expanded and you know that push back has
been on both sides of the aisle actually
but Trump was probably more outspoken
about about that program so here's just
you know some of the you know these
texts stories like anal anil dash here
is a business tech enthusiast and he
initially said he would be moving the
Canada of Trump one but now he's trying
to say that that he's not going to by
the way there's a lot of celebrities are
actually said they were going to move to
Canada because Trump won or that or if
he won like including Miley Cyrus I
think like cher samuel l jackson a bunch
of other ones i'll be curious to see if
they actually do leave the country or
not i doubt it but here's like new
Trump's inflammatory comments towards
Apple which is produced their devices
overseas and I'll going all the way back
to Steve Jobs days I mean they were
pushing all that that production for one
of the most popular and most profitable
companies in the entire world most of
those jobs and production opportunities
were being you know given over to
Chinese labor and everything to keep
their costs down and had you know Trump
has a pretty tough words called for a
boycott of their products and and he was
also pissed off about their encryption
stands for not on decrypting their phone
for the San Bernardino mass
mass shooting that took place ended up
being I believe a Japanese company that
ended up hacking the iphone in order to
be able to break their encryption and
get the information the FBI was looking
for but that was a big news and a lot of
people are pissed off because you know
the Apple you know being headed by Tim
Cook who is a part of the LBGT
communities a gay male in the United
States you know their their entire
position i mean just these types of
things I think are just you know they
create this divisive nuh swear it's like
you know apples sticking up for privacy
but at the same time they're also
promoting terrorists and not helping the
FBI and then you know iconically their
their CEO as a gay male and they you
know I mean they're just like all these
different things that that people can
just try to harp on and and just you
know you know good just tunnel vision
that's what they're going to harp on and
that's what they're going to you know
that's their bone to pick so here you
can see tech workers gave 60 times more
cash to Clinton and Trump so definitely
in the tech sector they were very
anti-trump for sure here Jeff Bezos
going back to 2015 was it was you know
arguing with Donald Trump over Trump
like criticized them over the purchase
of things like The Washington Post
newspaper and also you know the fact
that Amazon shifted a lot of their
customer service jobs over to India and
by the way their customer service is
absolutely terrible i bought the
telescope that you guys have seen in my
office originally from amazon and had a
hell of a time trying to cancel it ended
up buying it from orion directly and had
no problems whatsoever but the customer
service at amazon was absolutely
atrocious like you could just tell that
you were talking to people that just
didn't understand what you're trying to
say you know they had this specific seni
buddy in this corporate service
environment just sucks you know they're
given this this script and they really
can't deviate there's no common sense
there's there's nothing in either black
or white and you have to follow some
specific chain of command it's very
frustrating to try to get anything done
especially outside of the box so here's
some of the the news articles going on
about you know the h-1b so Trump is a
friend of India
but is he a friend of Indian h-1b
workers obviously most of the h-1b
workers in the United States are
probably from India or at least I would
think so remember the Disney controversy
that happened a couple years ago where
Disney ended up laying off 252 like 500
tech workers that were probably closer
to retirement than they were being fresh
into the industry in order to be able to
get them replaced by Indian workers from
you know a large company in the United
States that ends up gaming that system
and that was very very negative
publicity for for Disney and it just
brought to light that they weren't the
only company doing it you know a very
profitable company like Disney still
taking advantage of United States tech
workers and I mean it's just a shitty
situation and then here is um you know
even like the New York Times which is a
very liberal newspaper talking about
h-1b visas are designed to bring foreign
professionals with college degrees but
you can see like they're talking about
how companies game the system in order
to take advantage of it now here's
another situation in the United States
the manufacturing jobs have been rapidly
declining not just under George Bush but
also Obama some of it has to do with the
recession some of it is just simply
globalization and globalization hits
blue-collar you know white working-class
people pretty hard in some of these
places like Ohio Pennsylvania Michigan
Wisconsin and it's you know it's not
necessarily you know one president's
fault or anything like that but you know
one of the things that Trump focused on
was the fact that he was a businessman
and that corporate US taxes were
extremely high and that something needed
to be done about it and that it was one
of the highest corporate tax rates in
the industrialized world so that being
said you know we saw headlines and you
know things that Trump focus on like you
know carrier that makes a lot of the air
conditioning systems the United States
you move 14 under US workers are they
will they lost their jobs because they
got moved to Mexico Burger King ended up
combining with Tim Hortons and Canada
and ends up saving hundreds of millions
as a year into US taxes by moving their
headquarters to Canada there were there
were articles about walgreens
potentially moving to the UK and Pfizer
and all these other companies Nabisco
the maker of Oreo moved and they didn't
give a that they had a lot of
negative publicity they are actually
still in the in the process of moving
all their factories out of Illinois and
to Mexico and that's another thing that
Trump had actually harped on with the
tarp deal that was passed by Clinton in
the nineteen nineties saying that it was
extremely damaging to a lot of these
blue collar Rust Belt states that you
know these factory jobs that pay better
than retail typically were being shipped
overseas and that people just didn't
have the opportunities that they used to
have in addition to that we saw things
like Trayvon Martin you know we had
people accusing obama of flame baiting
the race war where Trayvon Martin was
killed by George Zimmerman who was i
believe white hispanic something like
that i don't know he was I think this
combination of the two Florida is a very
diverse population down there but he was
an unarmed black male gets into some
sort of altercation with this guy who
was basically following him around and
ends up you know George Zimmerman shoots
home but then the guy gets off like
major major anger over that and then the
Ferguson thing which led to the the
violence there that leads to the
Milwaukee riots because of a police
shooting there and in that particular
case it was a an african-american police
officer who shot an armed
african-american teen who had ain't
armed he was armed with a stolen ugh
handgun and and that still set off a
bunch of riots and in a place like
Milwaukee and then obviously that you
have the Dallas sniper attacks and some
of the other things so you know we have
all these these controversies going on
it just it doesn't surprise me that that
you know that somebody like Trump gets
elected I mean you look at the terrorist
attacks the Paris attacks were
completely atrocious I mean you have the
Brussels bombings the San Bernardino
attack like I mentioned before the truck
driving attack which was absolutely
devastating and France
the Omar mateen in orlando florida who
potentially sought out disney springs
which is a shopping district near disney
world one of the most popular tourist
destinations not just the United States
but in America you know a family place
and he was potentially going to shoot
that place up but he ended up shooting
up a gay night bar in orlando florida
would kill 49 people it's like I mean
just some some terrible going on
and then obviously just recently the New
York City bombings which luckily didn't
kill anybody but they were they were
intended to kill quite a few people and
and you know and while all this is going
on obviously the Boston Marathon
bombings who were two people that ended
up coming into the United States from a
war-torn area they sought asylum in the
United States that became American
citizens and then they committed the
atrocious active of placing a bomb at a
marathon and boston and i don't know
it's just a just terrible really
and then meanwhile all that's going on
obviously syria has some major issues
that i mean they're in a civil war
they've been fighting hundreds of
thousands of people have been killed men
women and children you have Isis you
have Russian involvement you have basara
sods regime all these different these
these different equations but meanwhile
millions of refugees are streaming into
places like like Germany and in Greece
and Italy and things like that and um
and for instance I know somebody that
was just in Germany he was talking he
was talking about the southern part of
the state and he was talking about how
much they they hated the the immigrants
that were flooding the cities and things
like that he was like you know it's a
major issue down there because they are
considered like it's the more of like
that I guess redneck section of Germany
there that he was describing and he was
basically saying that you know they were
very very unhappy about the immigrants
being brought in from Syria in places
like that and then he said he was also
on the train the day that some refugee
ended up attacking people with a hatchet
now these are very you know small
details but the point is is that you
have these countries are trying to deal
with you know the fact that like eighty
percent of the people that are streaming
into their country
you're completely undocumented you have
no idea who they are and things like
that and the United States brought in I
think roughly 10,000 hillary was going
to try to bring in 50 or 60,000 this
year a lot of people were up in arms
about that because of these terrorist
attacks they were like you know you got
to get that under control first Trump
was able to harp on that and I think
that rang true to a lot of people I mean
so no those are just my thoughts there
now here's I'm Jack Ma releasing a
statement today saying Donald Trump will
have to work with China or risk a
disaster so already jack ma who is
considered a spokesperson for China the
CEO and founder of Alibaba is now making
threats to Donald Trump and basically
the United States but it seems to me
that both of these economies are very
very tightly coupled together and that
if one gets hurt the other will
certainly get hurt as well so I don't
know I don't know what's going to end up
happening I think you know Donald Trump
is talked about taxing the you know
you're increasing tariffs on Chinese
imported goods so that way all the stuff
that companies like Walmart and stuff
sell you know a lot of this stuff that's
produced in China is going to have a
higher cost so you know it's supposed to
maybe influence more businesses to bring
their operations back overseas and not
import so many goods that are produced
elsewhere so I mean I that can have both
negative and positive n consequence
consequences I think and I don't know
that anybody really knows specifically
how that's going to end up working out
we've also seen that you saw the mexican
peso which completely dropped it tanked
against the US dollar as they were to
basically saying that this was a
hurricane i was gonna hit mexico's even
the mexican government didn't really
expect Trump to be able to win but you
know Mexico is very reliant upon the
NAFTA trade agreements like it like
we've already talked about with carrier
Nabisco washing machines and generate a
general electric and a lot of that stuff
is being produced over in Mexico and and
is brought in through these NAFTA deals
but it's also killed a lot of American
jobs so i'm not sure like you know how
that's going to end up playing out but
they've already said we're not building
your wall and all this other stuff and
I'm not sure how serious Trump is about
the wall I personally feel like he's not
going to build these or a wall and that
it's not feasible because people will
just go over the wall or under the wall
and I mean it's like they're doing now
there's fences all over the place and
they still are able to get through or
whatever but I don't know it's
definitely crazy times and then finally
you're seeing some these articles around
the world you know like I think it's
pretty much shocked everybody from the
UK but is it surprising i mean the
brexit vote was very very surprising
apparently there's a now far right
movement going on in France and a lot of
it has to do with some of the terrorist
activity that they're dealing with and
the immigrants and everything and then
like I said I mean Canada is now trying
to prepare for any sort of NAFTA traded
renegotiations and I don't know man so
there's there's going to be a lot of
shakeups I think in the United States
and this is just kind of a I think it's
just another thing I don't know that
it's the end of the world that people
are describing I think the tech sector
will ultimately be fine I've never been
a huge proponent of the h-1b program
because I know that it games the system
and keeps and suppresses wages but you
know beyond that like I don't really
have too much of an opinion on most of
this other stuff i don't i don't even
claim to act like i understand enough of
this in order to make the right
decisions i am baffled and shocked that
somebody like Donald Trump was elected
president but I think on the positive
I'm hoping that there can be some sort
of unity I looked at somebody like
Donald Trump and and this guy is like he
was a Democrat a few years ago he's
hated by many Republicans including
former Republican presidents who didn't
vote for him so he was hated by his own
establishment because he wasn't a real
conservative because he was a foul mouth
New York I because he bought and paid
for politicians you know most of his
life I mean he he didn't he's not a ver
he's not a religious guy a lot of a lot
of conservatives are very religious like
there's a lot of things about Donald
Trump that make
him like somewhat middle of the road for
instance in Virginia battleground state
there was a bunch of ads that they were
airing like all the time were Donald
Trump and it bleeps it out but they're
like he's like you can tell them to go F
themselves like and it's in like for me
I kind of giggled every time I heard it
I'm like that's it reminds me of the
idiocracy movie if you guys have ever
seen that with Herbert Alessandro
Mountain Dew Camacho the the president
and the idiocracy where he's just he's
like a WWE ultimate smackdown champion
and anyway wishes it's just funny to me
like it just shows you I don't know it
just shows you how crazy everything is I
think but anyway guys that's my thoughts
on the election and let me know what you
think I'm curious what you guys think a
lot of you guys watch my channel from
abroad from different countries and I'm
sure you guys don't have much of an
opinion on the matter but it certainly
is big news I think in the United States
and raises a lot of question marks
alright guys thanks for watching have a
good day bye hey guys so I've talked
about this a lot Deb mountain coding
boot camp they are my sponsor they're
one of the reasons why I'm able to do
these videos and they offer a 12 week
intensive course that teaches you the
technologies of the here and now they're
going to focus on a lot of things that
are actually being used and websites
things like jQuery and they're going to
be using stacks like nodejs the 12-week
intents of course is to try to give
people in the job market so that is our
entire focus we've all talked a lot
about on this channel whether or not a
college degree is worth it I'm not the
one to be able to answer that question
for you I absolutely think that college
degrees are great especially in computer
science I never want to convince
somebody to say that they shouldn't do
that you know obviously schools like
Stanford and MIT I'm you know I'm an
envy of all those graduates however
there is you know the bulk of developers
that don't necessarily need to be the
MIT graduates to actually have success
in the programming world I think I speak
relatively well for for that type of
person and with coding boot camps were
seeing them you know try to offer more
Skills more modern day
skills because a lot of times when
you're going to a computer science
course and a major university you're
learning technology that's already
outdated by the time you're learning it
with Deb mountain and coding boot camps
like what dev Mountain offers they're
focusing on really what is hot right now
so and they also focus on a relatively
you know small set of skills in order to
make sure that that they are teaching
you what you need to know in order to be
productive in a in a workplace
environment so make sure you guys do me
a favor do yourself a favor check out
the link and that in the description tab

boot camp thanks guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
