video we learned about a string this new
video we're going to go ahead and learn
about a list so I'm going to create a
new Python file here and let me just go
ahead and save this program and we're
saving everything under the training
directory so I'll just call this list
dog py for Python file and it's go ahead
and open up our command prompt by going
to the start screen type CMD CD /
projects see space training and then
you'll see that we have a list stop
people I file alright so in order to
create a list in Python you just need to
give it a name just like a variable like
we did with our strings so we'll give
this list or that's the name of my list
and then to make a list i go to his Open
bracket close bracket that's it so
Lister is now a list and in order to
insert something into the list we can
take a string x equals I'm going to say
this is a string and then if we want to
insert the list are the string end of
the list we'll just say Lister dot son
of a bitch dot a pen X and that's it so
for I n Lister actually not gonna jump
into that so we added the string to the
list so let's just go ahead and print
Lister and save our file go ahead and
run it from the command prompt list up
big one this is a string so you see that
it printed the list and its contents now
if we wanted to just well it's go ahead
and add one more thing to it and we'll
just say Lister dot append and then
inside of this bracket we can just
actually declare a string if we want
this is a crappy string
so we can do that and and print Lister
again save it and run it so it doesn't
have to be a variable that you insert
into the string or the list it could be
just like a hard-coded string put right
into it so you see both of those strings
are in there now if say I wanted to add
something to the string on the list we
want to loop over everything in that
list and this is a common thing that
you're going to do in programming
looping over a list because list can be
you know thousands of things millions of
things whatever you just want to go
through every single item in the list
you want to put it through a for loop so
you're going to say four and then this
next thing can be whatever you want it
to say sometimes people say item a lot
of the programming practice and python
is just a safe or I and then you just
say n list or so you want to then do a
colon and then underneath let's just go
ahead and start by saying print I save
our program and what it does here is it
went through and it didn't just print
the entire contents of the list it
actually printed each string item in the
list so if you want it to like add
something to that you could say for I
and list or I equals and will say I am
adding this string into the front of
each string and then if we want to add
this to the item in the list we're going
to say plus I so let's save it and
actually that's going to make sure we
print high because what we've done now
is we've changed each item in the list
and added this onto the front of it so
do that so you can see each list item
now has this text that we added on to it
so like I said if you had millions of
things in a list and you're like you
know I need to add a few words to the
front of it
back of it or in the middle of it or
whatever or I need to change the
formatting of each list item now that's
how we're going to do it so we you know
we quickly jumped into how to create a
list and deal with strings and things
like that so I'm going to kill the video
here and the next video we're just going
to talk about some numbers and i'll talk
to you guys in all right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
