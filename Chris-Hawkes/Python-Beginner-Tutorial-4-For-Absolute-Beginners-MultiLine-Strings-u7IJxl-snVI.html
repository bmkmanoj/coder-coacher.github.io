want to actually focus more on strings
because there's more to it than just
what I've showed you and one of the big
pains if we look at this original file
that we created where we were trying to
write out all this HTML we tried to put
it all into one line so as you can see
like the editor has a hard time reagent
reading all that stuff and there's
another alternative that we can do and
actually to make this much more readable
so I want to show you about the
multi-line string in Python and what you
do is you use actual three three single
apostrophes and I can actually remove
the double quote at the end and do three
apostrophes as well and that is is
enough to close off the statement so
this is actually called the delimiter so
if you ever were interested in the
proper term its delimiter but now the
interesting thing is that you don't have
to use a single apostrophe you could
actually use double quotes and use three
of them but the convention is that
you'll see people use three of the
apostrophes so the major benefit of this
is that you don't have to put your
string on one line so now I can actually
structure this like an HTML page and I
should be able to reason about it a
little bit easier as well so if you've
ever seen HTML this looks much closer to
what you would end up would end up
seeing here
so I can even have the indentation and
everything by writing it this way and
we're going to get rid of this this
length that bores me now and we'll just
say testing I wanted to change the title
so we know that we did change something
and yeah that's good so let's go ahead
and now and run this program again
another thing that people had pointed
out as well is that if we go into our vs
code and go into the launch jason and
we're going to actually want it to say
we change this stop on entry here and
we're going to change this to false so a
big shout out to the people that mention
that in the comment and there was more
than one and i don't have their name in
front of me and I'm sorry we completely
messed up my train of thought and
everything to stop what I'm doing and
try to find how who recommended that but
a big thank you they didn't mention that
I actually thought it was a bug because
I don't remember that ever being the
case when I first started using vs code
and then all of a sudden it started
doing that so let's let's go ahead and
go to our debugger just to see we'll
notice that it doesn't actually stop if
we put a breakpoint like down here you
can see it's not stopping on line one
anymore so that's good alright so um
let's check out the output of this file
though just to make sure that it did
write all this HTML like it did in the
last video now and one other thing too
when we created this HTML write
statement it's actually a good idea to
explicitly which just means like spell
it out and do it to explicitly close the
actual open file that you have because
depending on the operating system you're
running with especially with windows you
can run into problems there so let's
make sure we're running close and then
open and close parentheses because that
is actually an available method that's
on our file our file abilities within
Python so to read files or
right files alright so let's open this
up and we can see that we get the exact
same output you can see look at this so
see yeah I was going to say did I change
it to look at this okay so yeah we
changed it to look at this at first I
put testing so anyway sorry guys getting
a little bit discombobulated here
alright so that is the the multi-line
string and that's why I mean it's much
much easier to reason about something
like this you can do the same thing with
a like concatenation so if you need to
add something like here's our time very
in fact let's just make this a string so
let's say another string equals testing
alright and if I needed to add it here I
could say plus testing plus and then
another triple quote so you can do the
exact same thing like we saw where we
add variables into our strings and can
converge them together by doing that so
I'm not going to run that again you guys
can run that if you want but it
shouldn't be necessary the other string
thing that I wanted to focus on before
we move on because if we don't actually
concentrate on this stuff now and at
least see it and run through it then
there's going to be a time where you're
going to see it and you're going to just
be like what the hell is that like what
is it doing why why is it doing that why
didn't chris cover this in this tutorial
alright so what we're going to do is
reference another method of building
strings within Python that you're going
to see and it's going to throw you
through a loop every once in a while
when you see this but some people like
to do it this way they find it cleaner
to say okay %
I'm sorry double quote for your string
and then I'm going to say % s and this
Santa signifies a string placeholder so
I'll just let me try it let me all right
and we're going to change another string
we'll just call this we're going to
create a variable named animal call it
cat and then inside the this this
statement here what I'm going to do is
actually do a space and then a
cent sign and then if it's followed by
the actual argument of the variable so
whatever variable you pass in it will
will actually take the value of animal
which we know equals cat and it's going
to assign it to this placeholder here so
let's go ahead and watch what happens
and you'll notice down in the the debug
console it says cat ran over the hill so
python by doing it this way knows that
okay I have this animal variable I'm
going to find the first placeholder and
replace it with the value of of animal
now the thing is is you can have more
than one placeholder you could actually
have hundreds of placeholders it
wouldn't be very feasible usually you
don't see this with more than maybe
three or four but you can have multiples
that you just inject right into the
placeholder so I do want to cover that I
feel like that was a pretty important
concept another thing too that I'm not
sure I ever touched upon in my previous
videos but we know that variable names
can't have numbers on the front but just
so you know you can have numbers in your
variable name they just can't lead I
can't lead with numbers that's not valid
so if you want to play around you might
want to play around with just testing
some of the different things that you
can do another thing too that's I know
you can do it in JavaScript it'd be
interesting if you could do it here I'm
going to try to do a special character
all two zero two three three and that
does this - it looks like that will
actually accept it don't ever do that
don't ever do that you want to stick to
just the ascii characters that's like
don't make you have some fancy little
unicode symbol be your new alias for
your new javascript replica or jquery
replica basically just don't do that
alright guys so this is going to cover
the rest of really what i want to talk
about in strings
who knows there might be other things
that i can think of it along the way but
i just want to make sure we have our
bases covered before we move too far
into this series let me know if you guys
have any questions thank you for all the
viewers and please subscribe to the
channel it helps me out thank you take
care bye
hey guys so a lot of you ask me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here and now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
