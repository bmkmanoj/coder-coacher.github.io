we looked at classes in Python 3 5 and
we looked at how to instantiate a class
that's what it's called when you create
an object from a class class or
blueprints and they can just be looked
at as just a sheet of paper that give
instructions on how to create stuff from
it which and the stuff you create from
it is called an object so in this case
in this video we're going to be looking
at how to take those blueprints and
actually use another set of blueprints
but inherit the original set of
blueprints that's called class
inheritance and it's really important in
any sort of object-oriented language
that you can actually inherit a class
from another class called like a parent
class or a base class there's there
several names for it but ultimately you
have one class definition and then you
create another class definition and it
calls in the original class definition
to extend its functionality so the best
way to be able to explain that is by
giving an example so we're gonna go
ahead and create I'm gonna create a file
here just called classes and in here
let's go ahead and just create our first
class we'll say class a and then we'll
give it a method so this is gonna be
called parent print and then we'll say
string to print and just so you guys
know this self is referring to the
object that is created so when an object
is created from this class the object is
going to be self and that's it's weird
but that's just what that is so we could
say print string to print and then let's
go ahead and create a class B and the
difference is that Class B is actually
going to inside the parentheses it's
going to actually call in class a and
then we can have a separate method so
define we'll just a child print I guess
so hopefully this all makes sense what
we're doing here
string to print now in order to create
the object from the blueprints will say
my object which is just a name of a
variable and then we just say equals and
then just say the name of the class here
which is a actually no I want to do B
I'm sorry so we're gonna we're gonna
inherit this we're gonna create a object
from this class which also calls in this
class through inheritance and that's
called class inheritance so now with my
object I should be able to access the
parent method that's attached because of
the inheritance so if I said parent
print and then give it this is printed
through the parent and let's run this so
you can see down on the console here
this is printed through the parent so
even though the object was instantiated
through the separate class through class
inheritance were able to access
properties and methods and stuff that
are attached to the class for the
inheriting blueprints alright so then we
can also with my object just so you guys
know child print so I can do the same
thing this is child I'm sure I don't
have to explain this but just so you
guys can see that both of them are now
printed so that's really all there is to
class inheritance and me I'm just kind
of lightly touching on the object
oriented concepts of Python 3.5 and if
you have any questions feel free to
leave a comment and if you would please
vote up and subscribe to the channel I
appreciate it
thank you have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
