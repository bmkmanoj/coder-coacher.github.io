so now that we finally have the
application up and working we have a
restful api and you can see this is an
example of it this is the Django rest
framework version of it if I do Jason
you can see just the standard Jason data
that's being returned from the server
there's currently only one band on the
server named Bayside best band ever and
we're gonna go ahead and use react on
our index page the site looks real ugly
at the moment I'm really haven't even
designed what its gonna look like I'll
probably end up getting some sort of
bootstrap template or something along
those lines but for right now we're just
going to be working on react
fundamentals and in the next few videos
are going to be aimed towards that so
let's go ahead and we're going to start
by creating a react component a
component that will list all the bands
on this index page and I want to name
that react file index react and in the
previous video we had actually created
that file and we had pointed to it we
didn't actually create the file but
we've pointed to it here
index react a JSX so hopefully you guys
know but the preferred method of writing
react code is to use a JSX syntax which
is almost like its own language but all
it is is just basically what they call
sugar coated JavaScript so it's just a
way of making JavaScript a little bit
easier to read making it almost like XML
or similar to example if you've ever
used WPF or C sharp with the wind forms
or the wind form successor
so the JSX though is kind of a pain in
the ass to learn initially you're like
why do I have to take this extra step
but it's really worthwhile because
JavaScript can be real bare to try to
read and write with especially when
you're designing templates and component
hierarchy and everything and I'm trying
to visualize the JavaScript is very very
difficult so that's the reason why we're
gonna use JSX hopefully I mean I was
kicking and screaming with
in fact I've moved away from react like
on two separate occasions it was like
I'm not dealing with this JSX nonsense
but I finally came around I realized
that reacting JSX is good react and my
opinion is much better than angular or
backbone or any of that stuff or a
knockout
I think react is the best thing and you
see all these other frameworks like
ember and everything scrambling because
of what react is doing so they obviously
have things going pretty well for them
and they've done things really really
correct on their right so anyway that
being said we're new years I JSX so
let's go ahead and create that JSX file
now you're gonna notice a lot of editors
don't have JSX support since it's so new
I'm using pycharm right here and it
doesn't support JSX the few things that
do work like the latest webstorm sublime
text is probably the best bet to go with
because it's free to evaluate for as
long as you feel like the evaluation
process is necessary the other editor
would be Adam madam IO I think is what
it's called but that supports some JSX
but anyway you probably need something
though that isn't gonna throw a bunch of
errors at you when you start writing JSX
because any JavaScript compiler
intellisense is not going to work with
this JSX stuff unfortunately if you're
using Visual Studio like I like to use
you're out of luck at the moment and you
will be until Visual Studio 2015 comes
out so let's go ahead and create the JSX
file that we have talked about and it's
called index react and we're gonna put
it in the standard static JavaScript
folder so index reacts shoots I give it
a dot J's extension I needed to say dot
JSX so we're gonna rename that
in fact I'll just delete the damn thing
all right so now we have the index react
file first things first
whenever you're dealing with reactors
you need to go ahead and create a
component so the component is going to
be that most outer moat the outermost
component we're just we're gonna call it
just band component and the convention
is when you're naming the components
that they should be capitalized every
word should be capitalized so don't
don't camelcase it and we need to go
ahead and say react create class
and a few things that everywhere a
component needs is that it needs to have
a render function and the render
function is always going to return when
you're dealing with JSX is always going
to return something it has to return
something and it's gonna expect that
whatever it returns it's got a it's got
to return
a parent child grandchild type of setup
so you can't have something like this
you can't say give tests due and then
have another do because these are
siblings this isn't a true parent-child
relationship this isn't gonna work in
order for something like that to work
both of these have to share the same
parent so something like this would work
because they have one parent child child
these are siblings to each other these
could have children whatever all
everything needs to be encapsulated
though and one particular outermost div
within your return statement so that's
going to bite you at least one or two
times before you get used to that
and you're gonna forget what I'm talking
about and probably in like ten minutes
you're gonna do that and it's not gonna
work so anyway just forewarning that's
you have to have this thing wrapped in
an outermost div now with JSX it's going
to be interesting that when you're
giving a class to your component
hierarchy or to your component your HTML
is not exactly the same now this looks
like standard HTML right here but if
you're going to use class you can't say
class equals test class that's not gonna
work classes have to be referenced in
camelcase
so class name is however you actually
define a class which is weird but you're
gonna get used to it one of the good
things about react is that you can
actually encapsulate CSS styles so it's
almost like Google polymers project
where they have this thing called shadow
Dom where you can have individual
components that comprise your HTML page
and those individual components point to
their own
javascript and their own images are on
CSS so you can you can clap encapsulate
and truly encapsulate the entire thing
into a component which is really where
jQuery plugins fall short because jQuery
plugins you have to have all this you
know code and stuff and you have all
these variables and things that get
introduced into the global namespace and
you can have naming clashes and stuff
like that
Google polymers projects just trying to
do away with that with a hidden Dom well
react already is doing it they've been
doing it for a long time and they use
something called the virtual Dom so this
virtual Dom we're able to encapsulate
styles by declaring them as a simple
JavaScript objects and like it lets go
and do that now so there's gonna be our
variable test style and we'll say equals
and it's just a curly brace is just like
a standard standard object in JavaScript
now this is where you would define your
CSS styles but the things the way you
say them are different because you can't
have - so you can't be like font size 18
pixels you can't do that because this
isn't valid JavaScript you can't have
the - so just remember anything that has
a hyphen or separate words or anything
like that is it's all going to be camel
case so it gets easy to get used to
after a while but font size 18 pixels
and then each style here you would just
make a comma delimited just like any
sort of standard key value JavaScript
object so font size and we could say
like margin right once again that's
camelcase so instead of - we could just
say 20 pixels and you don't need the
these semicolons but anyway here is a
here is an object which is a
self-contained style for this particular
component and I'm gonna get rid of this
class name for right now and we can give
it the style tag and in order to assign
a variable inside of your return
statement
you have to wrap it in these curly
braces is another thing that takes a
little bit
get a hang of so in order to reference
any sort of functions that you made this
define inside the band component object
we're gonna get into functions here in a
moment but or any variables that you
create like you here you see here test
style is an object so in order to
reference out inside your render you
have to have that in the curly braces so
let's go ahead and do this let's put
some text in here
I'll say is this because it will be now
that we have that component defined
react needs to be able to actually
render that component somewhere so in
order to do that we need to go ahead and
say react that render and the first
thing it's going to do is it's going to
use this some xml type of formatting
where we can say band component and then
make sure there's a comma there and on a
new line we're going to need a standard
a document dot get element by ID which
is just standard javascript and we're
going to find a ID to attach this react
component to so content and the ID does
not exist in our template so let's go
ahead and add that now and since we're
dealing with the index page let's go
ahead and do it here so we'll just
create a div ID close content
now that we've done all that let's go
ahead and upload a few things need to
upload my index and my master page and I
also want to upload my JavaScript so
that it can have that development
JavaScript that we're working on right
now
so now let me get rid of this Chris Hawk
saying that's confusing
all right so you can see that react has
now rendered this in this div that we
defined and when we look at it and we
inspect element you can see that the
style is given the proper inline styling
so font size so we've encapsulated the
styles for this and you can see over
here it's definitely rendered at 18
pixels it's completely encapsulated so
you can never have this thing clashing
with another style or anything like that
and we could have defined a class name
like I showed you before before we
decide to go the inline style so I mean
I can point to a standard external class
I mean obviously most people want to do
that for for a lot of the markup and
stuff but inline styles are not indeed
like a horrible thing that they are of
the past because they're they're
encapsulated and the component itself
you know reuse as those inline style so
it's not a big pain you just have to
update your component and all the inline
styles for you know thousands of
components that may use that that style
object will be updated so anyway it's if
you've been you know told in the past
that you shouldn't use inline Styles it
really doesn't matter when you're using
react in fact it's good because like I
said it's encapsulated all right you can
see the react on creates this um these
IDs on here so it can keep track of all
its elements in the next video we're
gonna get into some additional functions
on how we add some basic capabilities to
this little plane react component that
we have going on right now alright guys
