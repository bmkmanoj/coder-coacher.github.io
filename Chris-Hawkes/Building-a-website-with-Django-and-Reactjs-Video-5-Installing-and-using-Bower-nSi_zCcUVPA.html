so in the last video we talked about
installing gulp and how we could use
that to minimize our CSS and things the
next tool that we want to look at is
Bower and you hear a lot about these
package managers like power it's a
simple thing where you can just simple
Bower install jQuery it'll install
jQuery probably a bad example but if you
have a library that might be dependent
upon other libraries like backbone
depending upon underscore J s if you
just did Bower install backbone and gave
it a specific version of backbone or
didn't give a version it will grab the
latest version but it actually installs
all the dependencies that backbone needs
so even if you're dealing with like a
typical jQuery plug-in or something like
that it's so much easier to use Bower to
keep track of your your plugins cuz how
often if you've had a development
website have you gone into a folder and
seen like 15 plugins you're only using
six of them but you're afraid to you
know delete a CSS file or J s file
because you have no clue number one
because it's probably not even named
properly whether but whether or not your
website isn't relying upon it's the end
up having this you know big-ass stack of
files you don't you don't need half of
them Bowers gonna solve that problem for
you because if you know you're not using
a plugin Bower is gonna remember all the
dependencies that plug-in head and it'll
remove them by simply using a bower
uninstall command so that's enough of
that let's go ahead and install Bower so
we're gonna use NPM to install Bower so
NPM install Bower and then do reports
like our - G actually I might do a sudo
command so if you're on Linux you need
to run the sudo command
all right now if everything went well we
should be able to say Bauer and you
should have these commands and things so
you can see that you can do like a bower
search and let's go ahead and look at
that so Bower we can do a bower search
and then just say react this is gonna
come back with a lot of results but if
you look at the top it comes back with
the react that we're going to be using
from the Facebook library but we could
even you know search jQuery and this
will probably have a lot of stuff to
that's a ton anyway you get the point so
if you want to search for a package of
our package just use that search command
let's go ahead and use Bower and we're
gonna install react so you can see that
it actually installed Bower react I mean
you see where I got it off of github and
you can see the version that an install
and that it put it in there Bower
components and reacts so if we go over
to our server where this thing was ran
you can see we now have a bower
components folder and inside of there we
have react and inside of that we have
everything that react needs like some of
the add-ons the JSX transformer the
minified version and the unmodified
version so all that which is brought
over and placed in this folder very
easily for us so let's go ahead and run
the same thing we're gonna grab jQuery
we're definitely going to need that and
for right now those are probably the
only two that I'm gonna use
but that is simply it so it makes things
a lot easier and you saw how simple it
was to install so it's like why do I
need our well why don't you need Bower I
mean don't do it the hard way - she's
Bower there's similar tools out there
I'm sure but Bower is easy so I don't
really feel like I have a reason to kind
of shop for other versions at this point
but I think it works great so anyway now
that we have Bauer installed and handle
jQuery any sort of plugins react will be
able to move on further in this tutorial
series all right guys thanks for
