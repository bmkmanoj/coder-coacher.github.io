be showing you how to set up django on a
low note server this is a abun to of
fourteen point oh four doesn't matter if
it's twelve point oh four or any sort of
Linux operating system you might have it
process is gonna be very similar what
we're doing with the Django we're using
one point seven Python two seven and
we're gonna have in genetics listening
as a proxy server for static content
so anything images CSS whatever is gonna
be handled by nginx everything else will
be passed on to Apache two for further
handling and we're starting with a blank
layout here so I have a web apps folder
inside my my server here which has a few
projects already created first things
first I wanted to make door I'm gonna do
post for the new post project and I'm
recreating them on a CDN to that post
and what we want to do is set up a
virtual environment so we can keep all
our Python modules and things contained
to one particular Django project
otherwise you run into headaches when
you have multiple sites on the same
server and the same Python installation
so this will make things much easier
when you need to to scale later on now
you need to have virtual environment
installed so if you don't have it you're
gonna say sudo pip install virtual env
and it'll install it I already have it
on mine so I'm not going to install it
again I want to go and run the command
virtually MV and we're gonna call our
environment post env and keep in mind
that we're inside that post directory
that we just created and I want to give
an additional flag here where it says no
site packages and this will ensure that
even if a package exists in your main
Python installed wherever that is in
your in your root directory that it will
still install that package so if it's a
beautiful soup if you already have it on
your main Python installation and you do
pip install when you're in your virtual
environment it's gonna go ahead and
install beautiful soup again so that
it's not sharing any sort of
packages at all all right so it's going
to create that and now to get into the
virtual environment want to go ahead and
CD into that directory that it creates
which is posting a V CD into bin and
then we're going to do source activate
and then you'll notice over here it says
post E and V so it means we are inside
of our virtual environment it's going to
create a few things here in our main
directory of post so I'm gonna create a
folder which is gonna be handled by
nginx which is going to be static and
that's where all that static content is
going to live and we'll go ahead and
just make the directories for CSS j/s
and then one for images so now we have
three folders inside of that static
folder now let's go ahead and create our
Django project so we're gonna call
Django admin dot py and we'll say start
project and then I give it a name which
is going to be post
it's a creative project
sorry I'm stupid I'm getting out of
myself it is our project we need to
install Django I've actually done this a
couple times
alright pip install and Django I'm sorry
I am tired tonight by the way so we're
gonna install Django it'll grab the
latest one which is Django 1.7.2 it'll
install it in the virtual environment
now that it's installed we can go ahead
and use the Django admin command and
we'll say start projects post alright so
we look here you'll see that inside the
post we have another post and we'll go
into that now we need to change our
whiskey file since we're going to be
referencing a virtual environment so I'm
going to say sudo nano whiskey and a
couple of things I'm gonna have to paste
the documentation and so you guys can
copy and paste because we did not want
me freeform typing this thing and then
running into problems in fact to avoid
any problems I'm going to exit out of
that I'm gonna actually remove the
whiskey file so sudo RM and now we'll go
and create the whiskey file and I will
provide this inside the comments to the
video so you guys can copy and paste
I've run into this situation before
where I start typing and if I type this
complicated stuff that I don't type
every day I'm gonna end up having a typo
and then it just confuses everybody so
what you can see here is that we have a
actual directory where it goes to the
post environment the reason why we have
to do this with our whisky file is
because we're using the virtual
environment but it's pointing to the
virtual environment site packages where
Django is installed then you have a few
things like the word directory the post
project and then the root directory of
the post module and then you have post
settings which is in any whisky file and
you also have the activate this which
activates the virtual environment as
well so all this stuff is necessary
I'm gonna do control X to save it Y to
get out of that now we need to go into
our Apache because Apache is going to be
handling any traffic on port 8000 and
you actually identify you set that up in
your Apache to config but I'm not going
to be getting into that in this video so
if you you just need to look that up
real quick about how to change what port
Apaches gonna listen to is I believe by
default it's gonna listen on port 8000
or 81 of the two and we want engine X to
listen on eighty and then I passed you
to listen on either 8000 or 80 80 80 it
doesn't matter they can listen on any
port really but those are the standard
ones that it normally listens to so I'm
going to go into sites available and I
want to go ahead and create a folder for
my domain name which is going to be I'm
going to create a file so sudo nano and
then the name of the file is going to be
the domain new post calm and then you
append a dot config on the end and here
is where we're going to also going to be
pasting some code so that we don't have
to write this and mess this thing up
alright so this is a virtual environment
here for Apache - for new post and I'm
giving it a server name with a www one
without it giving it the root directory
with a post project lives I'm allowing
all traffic and I'm also pointing to the
whiskey file which is extremely
important because otherwise it won't
work and then down here it's actually
giving reference to where the virtual
environment is first I'm sorry where the
root directory is person and where the
virtual environment is so let's do
control X to save that and I could
create a static link which is probably
the best thing to do but I'm not gonna
do that right now I don't want to get
into too much in this video but we're
going to create a the identical file
under sites enable so it needs to be
Nano for create the file and then we'll
paste in the same thing control X to
save it now if everything goes well
Apache will start
with no problem so we're gonna say sudo
service Apache to restart and that's
good that means everything went well
with the virtual environment now we need
to go over to nginx okay so just go
ahead and CD a couple of times and then
inside the e.t.c folder we're gonna find
nginx
and it's the same thing with sites
available so this time we want to do the
dot config so we're gonna say sudo nano
new host comm already have that sombitch
in there I guess we do anyway this is
all correct here what we do is we have
the server name it's listening on port
80 this information here basically says
if you don't put the www it's still
going to work like you can go to the URL
by new post com that will forward that
to WWE new post so I can handle that in
it this points to that static folder
that we created where our JavaScript
images and a lot of stuff is going to be
and then this is creating the proxy
that's going to pass everything else
onto 8080 which is what we told Apache
to to listen to so I can do control X if
everything goes well here I can also do
sir well actually you guys want to go
ahead and put that same file inside
sites enabled just like we did with
Apache so this will be the identical
file or you can do a static link if you
want to look that up so that way you
only have one file in one location and
just point to it in a different
directory so let's say sudo service and
genetics restart
alright so Apache 2 has been restarted
now the next thing you need to do with
your domain is whoever you're hosting
with they're going to give you name
servers that you need to tell your
domain company to forward that traffic
to those
servers so GoDaddy makes it pretty easy
when you go into manager your domains
even just forward your name servers so
once you've done that you also register
your domain name with your server
company that you're hosting with if you
guys need any recommendations for Django
and Linux I mean it - best nope no
questions is Linode number one and then
digitalocean would be probably number
two but I think Linode has a longer
track record of great service and I've
been using them for a couple years now
so alright let's go ahead and try to
visit the URL so now if you go to the
URL in question you can see it worked
and we have our first triangle power
page alright so then a few other
optimization things that we need to take
a look at is let's go ahead and pull up
our project in some sort of an editor
all right guys that's it with them
setting up django on linux ubuntu please
subscribe let me know if you any
questions or anything thank you for the
support and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
