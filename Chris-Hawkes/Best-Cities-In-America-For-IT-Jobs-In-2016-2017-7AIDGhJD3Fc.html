we're gonna be talking about the best
cities for tech jobs in 2016 and 2017 so
basically at this point what we feel
like is gonna be a good a good spot for
IT workers going not just into this year
but possibly in the next year too but
things change quickly and things change
you know they can change quickly but for
the most part I mean things don't change
that much you know over a year or two
period of time at least as far as I'm
aware now keep in mind also that this
entire list can be taken with a grain of
salt this is just one person's opinion
you know based on some data that I
looked up but you know ultimately
whenever you come up with a list like
this I've taught programming languages
or top cities or top universities or
whatever it may be people get all up in
arms about you know they're you know why
the list sucks and why it's not you know
accurate and all this stuff so you could
look at this list in a lot of different
ways and I will say that I looked at it
in a way of okay if I was looking for a
job in the United States and this is a
list for United States cities by the way
if I said if I was looking for a job in
the United States what city am I am I
going to be able to find employment in
the easiest so you know there's things
you have to consider when you look at
something like that you have to look at
you know the amount of the population
also the amount of jobs now the amount
of jobs is always you know a pretty
telling indicator of whether or not I
can get hired I mean if there's you know
a city with 20,000 jobs available even
if it has several million in population
there's still a pretty good chance I'm
gonna be able to get a job in that city
because obviously not all of the people
that work in that city are in the IT
industry so they're you know there's a
lot of things that you can look at in
this list and you could probably come up
with seen you know some problems with
them but either either way like I said
this is just one person's opinion all
the photos were taken from Wikipedia
which allows a creative commons
attributes as well so anyway let's go
ahead and get started here number number
10 on the list and I did do top 10 just
because I could go on for a long time
but I just decided you know just would
tend but Los Angeles makes the list
there's over 15 companies that are
actually headquartered in the Los
Angeles metropolitan area the amount of
jobs available like I said even though
the
a ton there's a crap ton of people
living in the Los Angeles area with over
13 million there are nearly 30,000 IT
jobs available according to indeed.com
the median income is 55,000 so you know
that's actually pretty low compared to
other metropolitan areas and that's
actually very low considering the fact
that the average home value is so
goddamn high there it's five hundred
sixty two thousand it's a lot and then
your average IT income salary is or a
programmer salary that's not IT that's
actually programmer salary 71,000 so I
put the growth potential in there is
average I mean there's not a lot of
businesses that are like flooding Los
Angeles to startup shop you know it's
it's it's a high cost of doing business
but there's already you know there's
just so many people it's a large city
second-largest city in the United States
so there's going to be some decent
potential there if you're an IT
programmer and then once again you guys
are probably like well what about you
know Utah or something like that this
list isn't going to include some of the
more I would say you know niche cities
that are on the up-and-coming but you
know I did mention I think a couple of
them but you're not gonna you're gonna
see a few left off the list cuz there's
only ten that I could go with on this
video all right so my next one is chai
town Chicago Illinois third largest city
in the United States and also you know
the first two on this list or you know
happen to be some of the largest cities
in the United States so you know granted
there is gonna be a lot of IT jobs just
because the amount of people and the
amount of operations that are there but
but chai town does make the list I mean
the median income is very low so it's
it's actually a very city that's plagued
with crime a lot of really crappy areas
in and around Chicago but ultimately the
downtown area does have a lot of IT jobs
ten million people the home values are
much more affordable and that probably
has a lot to do it with some of the
crappier areas that drag it down but
there's you know there is affordability
there are median income of only 38,000
while the average programmer is making
66 so your programmers are making them
you know quite a bit better living in
the Chicago metropolitan area than other
fields of study obviously you know based
on that that median
alright next on this list is Houston
Texas Houston is also a very large city
in the United States and from a landmass
perspective and metro area I think metro
its number fits at number five in the
country just recently got surpassed by
Dallas but it still is the fourth
largest city in the United States and
the amount of IT jobs available over
fifteen thousand a median income a
little bit more a little actually a lot
higher than Chicago with 60,000 an
average programmers making seventy five
so it Houston's the kind of city where
everybody's doing pretty well there's a
lot of a lot of industrial type
companies that are headquartered out of
Houston a lot of energy companies
manufacturing obviously NASA is located
out of Houston and Houston has you know
major universities like Rice University
one of the top universities in the
country and the average home price is
143 thousand now another thing that's
great about Texas and why a lot of
people flee to Texas is there is no
state income tax so you tend to make up
for that in the property tax if you own
a house but the average house is only
143 in and around the Houston area so
Houston's a very attractive city for IT
programmers with 15,000 IT jobs
available you know those are from a lot
of different types of companies so if
you're if you're not just doing you know
the hot Silicon Valley startup type
thing you're gonna be able to find a lot
of different IT table type of
opportunities in Houston and that's
definitely an attractive City on this
list now the next major Texas City is
Dallas it's caught it's called the
silicon Prairie Dallas like I said is
just recently surpassed Houston as the
fourth largest metropolitan population
in the country and as far as like land
mass or something like that it's
probably like six or seven I don't I
don't know but a lot of IT jobs
available nearly 24,000 median income to
56 thousand an average programmer making
68 growth potentials hot a lot of
companies are actually in and around no
Dallas Houston Austin
Austin's more of the hip you know hippie
you know culture you know San Francisco
type startup City
whereas Dallas's like i said is more of
a a business city I mean it's all about
business in Dallas and a lot of
different a a lot of billionaires living
in and around Dallas in fact I think
Dallas has more billionaires and its
metro area than any other city I heard
that the other day and I know I don't
have that stat available with me
unfortunately but you can see the home
price is very affordable in Dallas oops
home price very affordable in Dallas at
134 thousand population seven million
now these are metro area populations by
the way it's not just in the city limits
and I put the growth potential on here
as being hot because Dallas is is
continuing to become an IT hub because
of so many businesses that are that are
setting up in and around Dallas and the
relative affordability of actually
running a business out of the state of
Texas is is much higher than than other
states on this list and I'd already jump
to the next one on this list but it's
going to be Austin Texas so these three
cities are right and right in you know
in a close proximity to each other
within a few hours of each other in
Texas and Texas is just such an
attractive place to do business because
of the no no property or no state income
tax and it's just very business friendly
when it comes to bureaucratic red tape
and stuff like that for trying to get an
operation off the ground so even during
the Great Recession where the United
States went into a recession in 2008
where they dragged essentially the
entire world into the recession with him
because of the home value Houston and in
dallas and many areas of texas never
really actually went into a recession in
fact like half of the jobs that were
created in the united states after 2008
until about 2012 were created in texas
because even through one of the worst
economic downturns we had ever seen
texas just considered continue to hum
along with with jobs and men just you
know being a top area now one of the
reasons why this is ranked ahead of both
Houston and Dallas is if you look at the
amount of IT jobs available at ten
thousand it's not as good as Dallas or
Houston however Austin Texas is much
smaller so you look at the population of
1.25 metro area population of Austin
Texas it's it's very hot market right
now for IT a lot of Silicon Valley type
startups are being based out of out of
Austin the University of Texas is there
and that's a major University and
overall it's a very uh it's kind of a
very it's a liberal City Texas is mostly
a conservative state where everything is
you know it's more conservative
Republican leaning but Austin is is
definitely a more democratic liberal
type California type city and then you
have your average home values are much
higher in Austin compared to Dallas or
Texas area I'm not Texas but Dallas or
Houston so it one of those things you
might want to consider because you know
your average programmer salary is 63
which is less than Dallas and the home
prices are almost twice as much so that
is definitely something you got to
consider when when you're comparing the
two cities all right next one is Seattle
Washington home of Microsoft home of
amazon.com and a lot of IT businesses
are actually run out of this the Seattle
Washington area the average programmer
salary is a bit high at 72,000 which is
pretty good with a median income of 52
so a lot of people are doing pretty well
in Seattle area as well now you can see
the average home price is actually quite
a bit high it's a quote it's quite a bit
higher than and not just in Texas but
really most of these other places on
this list I mean hundreds it's
ridiculous for a home price but it is
what it is with a 3.7 million
metropolitan population 18,000 jobs
Seattle probably shouldn't be mentioned
ahead of Austin or even Dallas at this
point but you know this is definitely a
top ten City for IT jobs and what and I
am in the United States our next one on
this list is Raleigh North Carolina this
is arguably one of the top cities maybe
even top three and yeah so it should
probably be top three now on this
particular list I mean there's not like
a real real definitive order on the top
ten I just kind of figured out like okay
what type of city should be mentioned in
the top ten and then I didn't give them
too much
I guess wiggle room to try to figure out
where they should sit exactly but
Raleigh North Carolina
and can arguably be number one just
based on the simple fact there's only
one point four million people in the
entire metro area there's this area
called Research Triangle Park where
there is just a ton of IT companies that
are based out of there and from like Red
Hat to like IBM and there's there for
that type of population there are so
many jobs there's three major
universities from Duke University
University of North Carolina Chapel Hill
and then NC State and they're all in a
very close proximity to each other so
Raleigh is becoming a very hot market
for variety jobs median income of 62 so
a lot of people are doing really well
and programmers aren't doing that much
better than the other you know obviously
they're everybody else that gets lumped
into the to the actual income pool there
with sixty four thousand as the average
programmer salary
I put the growth potential is very high
possibly one of the highest in the
United States and then the average home
price 198,000 which is really affordable
so if you were looking for affordability
Raleigh North Carolina and you could
probably also mention Charlotte North
Carolina which I don't have on this list
or very very hot markets for IT and just
in business in general
Raleigh more and more an IT and then and
then you could make like an argument
like I said for Charlotte North Carolina
as being a very business friendly IT hub
all right next on this city is a new
city list list is New York City and if
you look at the IT jobs available nearly
51,000 median income of 50,000 you
obviously have you know people like if
you're living in Manhattan you're not
nothing less than a millionaire so this
is downtown view of midtown Manhattan
New York City New York City is
absolutely humongous 20 million metro
population average home value of six
hundred and ten thousand you're not
going to find a condo for less than a
million in Manhattan the growth
potential I put his average just because
you know there are a ton of jobs in fact
I like I get recruiters and stuff on
indeed.com a lot of them are based out
of the New York City area and it and
there's just there's constant growth in
New York City there's just so much
that's already there that you're gonna
have a pretty big attraction
for you know wanting to be in New York
City it's one of the most it's one of
the most major cities not just in the
United States it's the largest in the
United States but it's also one of the
most prominent cities in the entire
world but you have an average program or
salary of 91 thousand with the median
income of 50,000 and just a ton of jobs
there but not very affordable the
traffic in and around trying to get into
New York City and out is just absolutely
ridiculous I was in Manhattan a couple
of months ago and that place is just
absolutely insane I'm based out of
Washington DC metro area and yeah New
York City is it just absolutely insane
so the next one on this list is
Washington DC if you look at Washington
DC it's a much smaller city than in New
York City you look at the metro
population of nine point five million it
seems like a lot the actual city of
Washington DC itself only has about
600,000 people in it
it's the capital of the United States
the IT jobs if you compare it to New
York City it has half the population but
almost as many IT jobs available at 40
almost you know over 42,000 with a
median income of 90,000 so your actual
there's so many high paid people in and
around the Washington area that they
actually out they outpace programmer
salaries which this is the first one on
this list that we've seen where the
actual median income is exceeding the
average programmer salary so the DC area
is big-time money and the reason why is
because of the United States federal
government some of the largest IT
contractors in the world companies like
Lockheed Martin Raytheon Northrop
Grumman Booz Allen Hamilton a lot of
these major IT contracting companies
that come up with you know these you
know these defense systems that for
technology spending you know companies
that are based out of like Quantico and
Northern Virginia and all that stuff so
there's a there's a huge IT market and
and around the DC area you can see the
average home price is 497 that's about
in you know everything inside the
beltway see I know DC I'm pretty
intimate with I've been around the DC
area most of my life
and I can tell you that you know DC does
have a ton of jobs the traffic is
miserable around here and you can't you
can't work too far outside of the city
unfortunately because of you know just
the traffic is almost unmaintainable at
this point and then the top list that
this one's kind of a boring list to be
honestly there's a boring entry to be
number one on the list and like I said
there's not really a whole lot of
consideration about which one should be
put ahead of another one these are all
just you know really 10 hot cities in
the United States for IT but number one
in you know the last one in this list is
San Francisco California just because
it's been you know the IT hub in the
United States for what decades now
so really ever since the birth of IT San
Francisco is mentioned with San Jose you
know Google Facebook Apple all based out
of the San Francisco area average home
price is completely unaffordable as you
can see one point one eight million with
a population of metro area of only 7.1
million compared to like DC or New York
City I don't know why people want to go
to San Francisco to be honest with you
you're going to be paying a million
dollars for you know condo and once
again their traffic is miserable as well
just like DC so it's very difficult to
work out to work in the city and live
outside of it so when it comes to like
raising a family and stuff like that
like San Francisco probably has nothing
on a city like Raleigh North Carolina or
even DC for that matter but if you're
wanting to be in the IT world I mean you
can't go wrong if you're in some sort of
start-up in San Francisco there's
there's a lot of opportunity there they
they're the trendsetters in the market
typically you see a lot of the neither
cutting-edge technology coming out of
that area in DC as well just because of
the amount of military spending that you
see for technological advancements and
like robotics and aerospace and things
like that but anyway guys that's my list
and once again you take it with a grain
of salt this is my opinion I'd looked at
a few different data points and just
kind of put together what I thought was
a good top 10 live
and people are going to disagree feel
free to insult and and leave your
comments and if you do like this video
please subscribe I appreciate all the
support my channel has grown quite quite
well over the past like year or so and
I've been surprised by that so I
appreciate anybody who watches this
video it's a nice thing to see but it is
just my opinion and it's probably wrong
so anyway guys thank you have a good day
and take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
