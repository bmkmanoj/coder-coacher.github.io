installment of the Applebee's video
sorry it took me so long to get this
thing done but anyway what we're going
to do is the zip codes that we're
putting into the file right to the
website are actually showing up in this
little hidden widget thing so one thing
that you will notice is that this
address is displayed based upon your IP
address so it automatically does that
it's always going to display that there
but what we're really after is not being
able to feed in a zip code of a place
that's not near me so this is a Maryland
zip code and then we were able to find
these locations so learning is selenium
to be able to extract this data and the
purpose behind this video was just to
show you that this data cannot be
extracted from general HTML because it
doesn't exist in the source code so with
that in mind let's go ahead and our
program so when we have the the browser
updated we're gonna go ahead and search
for something so anytime you want to do
that where's the same browser
dot find element and the best thing that
uses a neck stop the expose are very
easy to use thanks to things like a
Firebug from Mozilla or chrome you can
just go ahead and I'm gonna just get the
expat here by just right clicking and
saying inspect element on the address
that we're looking for and then on your
browser you're going to pull up this
little this little thing down here and
it's basically it's like Google's
version of Mozilla Firebug but it's very
helpful so you can just right click on
the data that you're looking for and
just copy XPath and then put that right
in here which is an argument that you're
feeding this fine element by XPath
method so once we have that we're just
gonna go ahead and say print and we'll
give this a variable actually
we'll just call it address equals and
also you do need to specify that you're
looking for the text which means the
text that's inside of the HTML code so
we're going to say print address let's
go ahead and run this
and you can see when we run when we run
this year you'll be able to see the zip
code showing up in that text box
all right so the three items just ran
and then as you can see it out and put
in the address that we were looking for
for each one of these locations so
that's really the best thing that you
should do now a selenium does have other
features where if you just know if you
know the ID name that you're looking for
you can do the same type of thing
instead of searching by element or by
XPath there's an option here to just
search by the ID name so find element
yeah you can do the class name by CSS
selector by ID IDs better the thing with
the class name obviously there's can be
multiple tags with the same class name
so it gets a little bit harder to
pinpoint exactly where and the element
that you're looking for but Dom the
XPath also now has some additional
capabilities built into it where you
don't necessarily have to do there's
different ways of forming your XPath and
really I can't explain all of that in
this video but if you go to selenium
website it'll show you some of the
possibilities with XPath like
essentially you can freeform even in
your XPath search your own X Box not the
one that Google gave you but I can even
like basically drill it down by like a
certain ID name or I can look for a
specific text all within my XPath so now
all that stuff is possible the XPath
selectors are like basically an entire
tutorial in themselves but using the
XPath I would definitely suggest that
you get involved in that because it's
the easiest way to extract data so
that's really all I'm gonna do with this
particular selenium tutorial at this
time if you guys have any questions or
anything or if you have a problem
particularly wet site just give me a
call let me know I can try and take a
look at it or near that call me but
email me and other than that hopefully
this explains basically how to use
selenium so thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
