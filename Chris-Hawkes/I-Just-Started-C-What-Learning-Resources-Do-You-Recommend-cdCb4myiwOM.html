question and this person says I just
started in c-sharp are there any courses
that you can recommend and one of the
things that I'll tell you when I was
starting out with c-sharp is that it
drove me crazy coming from Python and
Perl that Microsoft has an entire like
terminology set that they use for
literally everything everything has some
specific Microsoft way that they they
talk about it whether it's you know the
context in which it's talked about or
the actual acronym or like you know just
it just seems like with Microsoft
there's so much proprietary stuff there
that it can sometimes be confusing
dealing with you know trying to you know
weed through all their documentation to
figure out the one answer that you're
looking for for a massive library the
size of dotnet so do I have
recommendations for you yeah basically
you know if you've been almost tripped
and fell down the stairs that stuck I'll
be a good video but if you could if you
can weed through Microsoft's
documentation without actually getting
all confused
then I think that would probably be the
best spot but you're gonna find that
their documentation the way that they do
everything on their website at least I
did I find it to be a huge pain in the
ass compared to something like if you
compare Microsoft's to like the Django
project like I feel like the Django
project does a pretty good job of laying
out demonstrations for everything with
Microsoft everything's you know
statically types so you have verbose
ways of doing things so if you're
jumping into c-sharp from nothing else
and you're probably going to be better
off in the sense that the dotnet way is
gonna be the only way that you know but
when you look at something that is
really
you know tight and compact into the
point like Python and then you compare
that to something like c-sharp and the
dinette framework it's gonna be a night
and day difference I do but I goddamn I
just wrote like 15 lines of code to Rita
Rita file like line by line like I just
why is there so much code that I have to
write why do I have to import all these
different things so a lot of people will
recommend like code Academy and stuff I
see that stuff getting promoted honestly
I think some of that is spam and
everything I don't know I never used
code Academy I'm not trying to say it's
a spammy site or anything like that but
I get spammed all the time on this
channel for people like trying to
promote this and that and all that stuff
and so I can't really recommend that I
can say that the best tutorial website
that I've ever seen is plural site
because plural site they'll go out and
they'll hire professionals and all the
different genres that they're talking
about so if it's Perl or Python or C
sharp or some library in C sharp they're
gonna hire actual experts to do in the
video series and you know with me I've
tried to do tutorials myself and I mean
a lot of you guys know that I've done a
lot of tutorials on a lot of different
things but I can safely say that those
dudes do a better job than I do some of
my best tutorial videos might have been
able to make the cut because I have
actually been approached by some of the
lesser companies like pack Publishing
asked me to do a video series on Python
requests
same with lynda.com lynda.com at one
point asked me to do something for
either Python requests or phantom
JavaScript and when I do these tutorials
for the most part you know I make
pennies or whatever on actually doing it
through ads because the tutorials never
really make that much money but I do it
more for the enjoyment of actually
teaching and also just learning myself
because one of the ways that you can
learn is by teaching others
and and also you know it challenge you
challenges you to understand what it is
that you're teaching more because
because it's funny because sometimes you
don't really know how much you don't
know until you go to try to explain
something that you think you know to
somebody else that doesn't know then
you're like oh damn maybe uh maybe I
don't understand this as well as I
should and that's something you'll
definitely get out of teaching others
and it's something that really motivates
me to continue to do tutorials even
though some of my stuff is not going to
be as good as other thing other
competitors that are out there so yeah
Pluralsight I would definitely recommend
that YouTube is probably I mean I've
seen some terrible c-sharp YouTube
tutorials out there like absolutely
terrible code code project I hate that
site that's another big site I think
it's based out of India there's a lot of
a lot of people from any of it that seem
to be writing articles for that web site
but I absolutely can't stand it and I
think it's just because it's so old
they're just the entire layout of it it
just sucks but yeah between Microsoft
and something like Pluralsight and then
you're just gonna want to dig into the
books man the books are gonna be experts
with something like that man you need to
learn from experts because there's a lot
of idiots that don't really know C sharp
and dotnet very well and they'll go out
and they'll try to teach you on that
stuff and I guess that's kind of harsh
saying idiots are not idiots but they
certainly don't know it as well as like
you know some of these MVPs and
Microsoft certified specialists and
everything so you know that that's my
advice man I mean it C sharp is a is a
tough tough pill to swallow just because
it is so large anything dotnet and
Microsoft and honestly it sometimes
feels like Microsoft goes out of their
way to make things more difficult for
you
just you know just recently like I
updated the Visual Studio 2013 update
update not 2013 but 2015 update 3 and I
had this massive memory leak so 24 GB of
RAM on my machine and this thing I was
just leaked it all up overnight and so
the entire system is crashing
but they fix that actually with an
update that I just installed today but
it just seems like Microsoft man they
sometimes their stuff doesn't work like
one of my buddies actually says with
Microsoft you know you don't get like
all these different little parts you
have to assemble yourself when you
compare that to like a Linux guy like
Andy showed this picture of a bike with
all these different parts and the
different parts were all broken out so
that was like a hundred and fifty
different parts and then he compared it
to another picture that he said was like
Microsoft and was like this finished
polished bike and I was like you know I
know full well that that's just not
that's just not the truth because I mean
you might get this bike from Microsoft
but when that doesn't work like you
have no idea why and and you're pretty
much out of luck when it comes to trying
to figure that out and you know with
something like you know with his
demonstration with Linux and the
different parts and everything but
that's some of the best best reasons to
use something like Python or a Linux
environment because you can assemble it
and tweak it to the way that you want
and not you know some opinionated
you know company's opinion on on how it
should be so anyway that's really all I
got man so good luck with those with
those studies man Pluralsight and books
those are the best things all right man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
