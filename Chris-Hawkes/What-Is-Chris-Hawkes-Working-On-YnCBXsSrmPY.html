sorry about spamming the inbox the other
day so I was doing some tutorials I was
releasing them every 30 minutes or so
and I think that that just kind of spam
the subscriber base email or inbox feed
so I apologize I don't mean to do that I
think what I want to end up happening
when I do tutorials in the future I'm
just gonna go ahead and and like and
upload them all at the same time that
way it doesn't YouTube doesn't think I
have like new content every 30 minutes
or an hour and then start you know
notifying people so thank thanks for
your patience there also everybody keeps
asking me about VJ s I think VJ s is
great don't want to hate on any sort of
technologies or libraries or languages
out there VJ s I think it's cool very
easy to get started I think that's
probably the easiest part about it or
the best part really and that's really
their selling point because in some of
the other libraries we've seen are so
complicated to get started
VJ s still kind of needs just a typical
file very similar to jQuery you know you
could do the same thing with react too
but um anyway yeah is it as far as VJ s
is concerned like if I had to like sum
it up I would say look it's not that
much different than what I've seen would
knock out knock out it's quite a bit
older but knock out you know did things
pretty well and I've seen it and had to
work on production systems with it it's
not a terrible terrible set of
technology so I think our react justice
is ultimately better than both of them I
think it's a little bit more powerful
but I'm just you know today I was
talking to somebody who was having some
issues trying to get trying to figure
out reacts render and he was having a
rendering problem where he was saying
that the state of his parent components
was not reflecting the state of the
basically he had some state weirdness
going on so without going into too many
details there I think it might have
something to do with the fact that like
react if a parent component react
changes then it's going to render the
Dom including all child components but
if a child components updates its state
it's not going to re-render itself or
it's not going to cause a parent
component to re-render itself so I think
you can get some some state confusion
there with
right now and then so with view Jas I
think it's great I think if you guys
want to use that no problem no it's I
don't know it's gonna be some sort of
unifying thing I don't think it's gonna
bring us all together and be like hey
this is the thing that we've been
looking for so you know that aside I
think it's great one of the things I was
trying to mess with recently if you guys
saw my tutorial series it was really
just for me learning and also trying to
help people out I think I'm the first
one on the Windows platform that even
bothered making a tutorial for it so I
know Windows makes a lot of you guys
want to throw up in your mouth but that
is you know what I'm used to and also
I'm done a developer I work for dotnet
shop so here's a lick sir and it's a
functional language built on top of
Erlang so if you guys are interested
check out the tutorial series but
ultimately what I was trying to do is
get to a point where number one I don't
want to write Erlang Erlang does not
really interest me for the most part
like I mean if I had a bunch of time
available I would probably use her lame
but elixir I think provides the best of
Erlang and and its new it's fresh it's
hip and all that stuff and it's also the
language surrounding the Phoenix
framework which seems to be relatively
up-and-coming I think so this is a
pretty cool framework for like parallel
like concurrent systems you know very
similar to what probably rust or go
could could provide or even some of the
Python stuff like sanic tornado and
things like that
I had no js' obviously alright guys so
that is really what I've been doing so
there's been a lot of busyness going on
with my life which hopefully everything
ends up going well and I can inform you
guys about all of that but for right now
I'm not really going to talk about it or
mention it as far as the channel is
concerned I do feel like I have a bit of
a saturated market at the moment so I'm
not really sure you know what the
release schedule is going to be
eventually like it might it might move
to like maybe maybe two videos a week or
something like that so I understand that
some of you guys can't consume all the
content and I don't blame you
because I try to follow other youtubers
when I can but there's just no time for
me to be able to watch all their content
and I understand that some people may or
may not be interested in actually
watching everything I produce so that
that's fine now
one of the things I did want to reach I
reached out to a couple of people I
heard back from a couple of people but I
wanted to see I wanted to do some more
collaboration with other viewers on this
channel I was hoping maybe even some of
you guys that have your own channels out
there you know maybe we could try to do
something because I just really I think
just having more than one person talking
into the microphone might make things a
little bit more enjoyable or interesting
one of the things I don't want to do
though is I don't want to create some
sort of let me try to test your
knowledge on the fly type of thing or
give you some sort of interview type of
a situation like I would much rather
just have kind of an open conversation
and probably pretty straight to the
point hey we're talking about Vijay s
what is your thoughts on Vijay s and
this and that
but but I mean not to like sit there and
have like an hour and a half
conversation and put it on a video and
expect somebody to consume all that so
really straight to the point type of
video so if you guys are interested and
doing something like that reach out but
also keep in mind that I have a very
busy schedule so I'm sure you guys have
busy schedules as well and then whatever
sort of you know hey like I bring this
up now but like I am NOT committed or
guaranteeing any sort of collaboration
time or even like a specific amount of
effort so hopefully I'm trying but I
guess what I'm trying to say is I can't
make promises on time schedules and
things like that so hopefully if maybe
like a Friday night a Saturday night we
get you know do a google hangout for
15-20 minutes something like something
like that that's really what I'm what
I'm after and that's why the more people
probably the better because that way
then if schedules conflict with one
particular person that there may be
other people that could show up and as
far as whether or not we try to break
out videos on multiple channels and
things like that then we'll have to
discuss that as well but I would be also
willing to do that yeah so that's really
most of what I have to talk about
tonight so to sum it up yeah if I do a
tutorial series I'll release all the
videos at one time hopefully it won't
span people's inboxes and then also for
any sort of collaboration videos feel
free to reach out make it and leave a
comment in this this description or you
know the thread comment below
and we'll talk about that and I'll see
you guys later have a good night bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're gonna need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding bootcamp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
