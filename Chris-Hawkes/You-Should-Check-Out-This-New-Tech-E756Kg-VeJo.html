this one image with you guys I think
it's hilarious this image is actually
passed around a lot and different IT
organizations I've seen and it's
actually it varies a little bit like
this one's a little bit different from
the other ones that I've seen but it is
it's so true that's what makes it so
funny once you guys are actually paid
programmers working for a business and
actually trying to deliver a business
product like like this is it's so true
so anyway you struggle like for me when
I'm dealing with a responsive website
one of the things that typically I run
into a problem with is if I have columns
like more than four or five column
tables inside of like a div or something
CSS grid layout is kind of like this new
thing and it's basically like bootstraps
flexbox but instead of being one one
directional this is like a two
directional sub rows and columns are
responsive so you can see that by using
CSS to lay things out it actually gives
you a look here so anyway look if you
look at this you can see that the water
here the div for the water is not on the
caret so if I wanted to move that over
to the caret you could just say grid
column start and then three like you're
saying in the example now we're watering
our carrots so you could do that you can
make it even dynamic you know it so that
the javascript is just changing this
stuff to be like there's all kinds of
options you have and then the big
difference is that the styling is done
with CSS as opposed to actual HTML and
stuff like that so I would definitely
say that you should be checking out grid
layout there's gonna be like the next
big thing for how we're gonna have
really responsive VY's I think so this
has a lot of support the downside is it
doesn't have a lot of actual browser
support yet so of course Microsoft is
always lagging in this game even edges
is having problems trying to keep up
with the latest standards of the
Internet but yeah this is something that
you can hit the ground running now if
you want good good good learning
resources I would definitely recommend
great garden
also there's CSS grid layout this is a
mdn Mozilla does an awesome job I think
documenting the standards of JavaScript
and HTML and CSS so definitely check
that out and then also CSS tricks has
been around for a long time and this is
also a lot of good information if you
wanted to get up-to-date on CSS grid
that way so you guys are probably well
chris CSS grid has been out forever
right well it has been but obviously the
browser support hasn't been there so it
just hasn't been a really good option
but I think in 2018 it is a good option
now and and then you're probably
wondering how this compares to
bootstraps flexbox which it's a
completely separate thing but the thing
about flexbox is like you can use both
of them in conjunction like you can use
them together there there's no reason
why you should have to choose CSS grid
over flexbox flex boxes is one direction
so if you have to have a bunch of a
bunch of columns and that's great you're
dealing with a bunch of columns or if
you're dealing with a bunch of rows
that's great use I use flexbox but if
you have these a sub asymmetrical
designs where you have certain columns
and rows that are varying and and you
know widths and Heights and things like
that
but you still need things to come
together in a in a decent way like we
saw with our little watering the plant
thing then then I would definitely say
that the CSS grid is much better can you
guys give me a favor and go check out
