this question of how do I get into the
industry and just so that I can make it
his pin point as possible in this video
because I've talked about it a little
bit here and they're all over the place
the fact that matter is is that you're
going to have to have some sort of
online portfolio for three years I was
developing and I was being rejected for
all kinds of different jobs and even
then I was I actually had an online
portfolio I had websites that were out
there that were on on the web I in fact
at one point I had new music was on the
Google App Engine and it was mostly
static but it was written on the web to
PI framework I was being rejected for
jobs that I had a blog that was called
new post for awhile and and there was a
point where I was getting quite a bit of
traffic I think I ended up turning into
a product review site which was a
terrible idea and that should be a
different video that I talk about that
but I had something kind of special
going on but just having this kind of
random blog where I was talking about
random things almost like a reddit
basically but I was coming up with the
topics myself which is kind of very
similar to what I do here were I do I
usually keep the top asan on tech but
sometimes I do stray a little bit but I
had this blog that was actually getting
quite a bit of traffic in August of 2012
and it was through that blog along with
the music site that I had actually had
for years at that point that was able to
get my foot in the door to become a
junior developer Mason mostly doing HTML
Javascript and things like that now when
I came in and I started working with a
bunch of senior developers ever doing
c-sharp I was one of the better UI
developers just being completely
self-taught like I was I was pretty damn
good actually I thought because the
websites that I had look just as good as
the corporations of the websites that I
was trying to apply to so Brendon I
didn't have the same amount of you know
backing experience and all that you know
obviously all the dotnet stuff and
Microsoft loves to make things more
complicated in a lot of ways they've
gotten better Witten with that I think
over the years and maybe it's just me
being better with reading into it but I
found Microsoft stuff to be very very
challenging going into a Microsoft shop
when I first started but but how do you
guys get into the
I mean if you're in the United States I
mean I can tell you that these jobs that
are paying you know roughly on average
across the United States eighty thousand
dollars but then there's JavaScript
developer jobs in DC where they're
paying a hundred and twenty hundred and
thirty so these kind of jobs though
they're taking senior level talent even
senior level talent that you know I may
not even be good enough for I don't I
don't really know I mean but I can tell
you that what you guys need is you need
that junior developer opportunity and
that it's not really going to happen
without without actually having some
sort of online verifiable portfolio and
and by doing that I can really only
speak to the website of things I can't
really speak to game programming or like
embedded systems and things like that
but if you want to be a web developer
which is where a good majority of the
programming jobs are at in this industry
the the thing that you need to do is you
need to go out and build a website you
can go to my favorite host lonoa you
could go to digitalocean those are two
very popular options to have linux-based
website you can now even use that in
that core if you want to go that route
if you're looking for my for my advice I
mean whether you use well so some of you
guys might well PHP okay so everybody
loves PHP a lot of people a lot of
people hate it actually but a lot of
indie developers and small shops that
they love to use PHP so if you're a PHP
guy I don't know that necessarily does a
lot for you with getting into a
microsoft.net shop I don't think they're
gonna be that interesting now if you
were to go and build a website in Azure
are using dotnet core or even asp.net
4.5 then you're gonna have a much
greater shot at getting into that
Microsoft shop so if there's a lot of
Microsoft shops where you live or the
country that you're in that's probably
where your focus should be or or Java or
whatever is popular in your area so how
do you find that out well you look at
the jobs guys you go to indeed.com you
look at even Stack Overflow careers you
look at anything that has technology
jobs and then you try to figure out okay
what where you know where are these
technologies being you know ask for so
people have mentioned Python well Python
may not be hugely popular and Andy
I can't really speak to that but it's
very popular in Silicon Valley and it's
been popular in the United States for
quite some time Google has used it as
one of their most popular and most
widely used programming languages going
all the way back to the 90s so you know
it's Python going to be a good idea for
somebody who's in India I don't really
know and so there's no there's there's a
lot to think about there but the point
is is that you definitely have to get
something out there you have to get a
product that you can call your own and
anything short of that I think is like
next to impossible now here's a website
hipster code so I have websites that
were like this and I was still being
rejected for jobs but eventually I had a
manager that was willing to be like look
dude I'm gonna take a risk a risk on
this guy because he you know he
certainly seems to know what he's
talking about and things like that so
you need that one opportunity and then
you need to make the most of that of one
opportunity and finding that one
opportunity for me to almost three years
or around three years so it was not easy
not easy at all but you know don't give
up I mean hopefully you guys just you
know stay out it this website here I did
make a video about the programming
certificates because people were asking
me about you to me and they were asking
about Coursera and I was pointing to
that hacker news article where they
talked about a article written by lady
that did 3000 tech programming
interviews and the three most popular
things that they looked at or that they
correlated to good developers was a good
school which is like Ivy Lee you know
good IT school and not just Ivy Lee but
good IT schools the the company that
they worked for and that means like
major companies that have a lot of you
know like big-time office politics that
you're gonna run into with a lot of big
shops and then the third thing was the
Coursera and udemy courses because to me
that indicates somebody that's willing
to learn and willing to spend their own
time to become better because there are
plenty of programmers out there that
don't spend any time at home trying to
update their skills they think that the
employer should have to pay for all
their training and things like that
and apparently that that's the way
things used to be at one point
but I can say that that's becoming a
thing of the past think employers want
their employees to be you know relevant
and up-to-date and they don't want have
to pay a ton of money for these
technology fads that change with the
wind they're looking to stay competitive
with other companies that are using the
latest and greatest and the only people
that can keep up with that kind of
ecosystem are the ones that are truly
interested in programming so for me if I
were an employer and one day I may be an
employer that's going to be one of the
major things that I look at somebody
that's interested in learning at a
program on their own do they hack do
they build stuff and Wednesday hack not
like for illegal or bad purposes but I
mean do they go home and do they try to
make things because to me that that is
the best type of programmer also
somebody that is uh you know there's
there's raw skills that is great you
know if I was building like a physics
engine I probably need people to have
some serious raw skills that I may not
have but if I'm not building that sort
of thing and I'm trying to maintain a
website I want people that are nice to
work with so I don't want to hire dicks
I want to hire people that are hungry
you know people that have slept on their
friend's couch for six months because
they didn't have any place to stay you
know those maybe I don't
that's kind of that's that's that might
be a little too far but you know what I
mean like people that that understand
life that haven't been fed with a silver
spoon off all their lives and went to an
Ivy League school and and got out and
and they're just ranted all this you
know venture capital money to implement
their terrible idea and that sounds
jaded I'm sure it does but unfortunately
the world is sometimes about who you
know and where you came from but that
can still be sidestepped with enough
hard work and ambition so I actually
have a writer that works for me named
Mark Allen who is uh he's writing for
hipster code and and some of the stuff
he writes about because I don't want to
create a circle sure nothing is worse
than a circle jerk where you got you
know the term is just a circle of idiots
that are all just kind of agreed with
each other and they're all just hashing
over the same just in agreeance and
and and that sucks almost as bad is like
trying to force somebody to have a
dissenting opinion just for the sake of
having a discussion because that's
actually something I see on the radio a
lot you'll have
- radio announcers and like one will
have a dissenting opinion that you know
that they're not passionate about or
even feel that way but they're just
trying to not have a circle jerk on the
radio so anyway so he was writing about
the programming certificates and he has
some decent amount of experience he's
the older programmer so he's at a decent
amount of experience as far as being in
the programming industry and what he
considers now he's been out of like you
know the latest and greatest type of
stuff for a little while but when he
talks about like programming programming
certificates he was basically saying
that they do have a value and that that
that the general rule of thumb is that
all of them are not worth the price that
is paid so 750 for a udemy course is
kind of steep because if you were just
if you just had the udemy course you
don't have that that portfolio to go
along with it then I really feel like
the money you paid for that could have
been you know probably better suited
into the portfolio thing I think the
portfolio thing comes first by a long
shot
and then udemy and Coursera or whatever
sort of you know certificates even Khan
Academy or anything is going to be like
an additional benefit that you could put
as like other you know some sort of
other mark but it can't be your primary
thing it can't be like hey I didn't go
to college for four years but I went to
you to me and I had this course and I
should just get this job even though I
don't have anything else to show that
I'm a programmer that you know so but he
was basically saying and and like he
does not agree with me on a lot of the
stuff that he writes about and actually
liked it that way but he says like says
one last thing companies like Coursera
which adds some sort of certificate to
the free accredited online courses by
major universities is profoundly wrong
these universities do not provide any
accreditation to the coursework that
Coursera is selling these are offered as
free college level learning tools that
can be accessed directly by visiting the
University website if the cost is over
ten dollars a year Coursera is
overpriced so I'm not sure I would agree
with you know that that cost analysis
but I would agree with the fact that you
know these these certificates don't
really mean anything and
in my opinion there in conjunction with
something else like they have to be you
have to have that business experience
and if you don't and I would say
Coursera and all those things combined
with an actual online portfolio what the
hell was that it should be all that you
need really papers was randomly dropping
from the other shelf over there so so
guys get out there man make a portfolio
and when I say portfolio I don't mean
you need to have some sort of manila
envelope with a bunch of papers that are
falling out as you're rushing to your
job interview I'm talking about get a
website if you're gonna go with dotnet
use Azure if you can afford it if you
really can't afford to use one of those
cheap shared hosting things and go with
C sharp or an asp.net we're down that
core even more preferably if you're
going to be like a sequel developer or
something like that and how I mean I
would think that really any any side
that you choose would be fine but who
wants to be a sequel developer that
would be my first question although
they're doing a paid quite a bit of
money I would never want to be that
sequel is one of the ugliest languages
possibly to ever exist so follow people
like me I have so many tutorials out
there and there's people like me that
are on YouTube that actually show you
how to actually get websites that you
create websites from scratch I even have
source code that I've shared on github
and things like that and get those webs
there's the Web projects deployed
they're not gonna cost you that much
money you can honestly host like 15
that's one a low-level traffic websites
on a $20 a month OneNote account so it's
not as much as you think it's like 10
dollars for a domain name but you have
to do what you have to do and I really
think that that is the best advice that
I can give you guys on this subject all
right thanks for watching make sure you
guys subscribe also check out my sponsor
that's Dead Mountain coding boot camp
and by the way let me touch on a coding
boot camp because I actually talked and
run this by a mark Alyn as well where he
was saying that with coding boot camp
said it's more of an intensive process
because granted he would be hesitant as
a hiring manager he said to hire people
right out of the gate with just a boot
programming bootcamp experience but he
was saying that at least it's an
intensive you know it's 12 to 16 weeks
of intensive courses and that you're
actually building things you're not just
watching a professor talk into a camera
and doing some coursework from an
unaccredited University you are actually
working with the teachers directly you
know they know you by name they're tell
they're helping you along and they're
just building enough skills to get you
into the door as a junior developer not
making you some sort of a machine level
or machine learning expert in Python or
something along those lines so our
coding boot camps worth it I mean
absolutely over any you know one of the
I would say the certificate programs but
they're also a lot more expensive so you
got to keep that in mind in a place like
you know dev Mountain they have on-site
location so you have to actually go to
Utah or Dallas although they do have
free free housing that they do on a
first-come first-served basis so you'd
have to check out their description tab
below but the thing is is like nobody
can guarantee that they that you can
just get a job it's going to take hard
work enough or in addition to all of
this stuff and if you guys work at it I
really think that you can do it but it's
going to take like a really really large
amount of effort and once again just try
to keep your head up guys and have a
good night take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
