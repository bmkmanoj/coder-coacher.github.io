video this is a video that is geared
towards people that are just getting
started with web development and with
web development I actually recommend
that as a great like really career
choice because there everything runs on
the web now every business has like a
website every legitimate one anyway and
now all kinds of business is conducted
via websites and web based technology
which you could spend all day learning
all the web based technology in fact all
day you could spend your whole life
probably learning it it changes so much
it's changed so much since just the time
that I've been doing it which is eight
years now so in this video is just
simply the kind of to keep your sanity
and to just give a demonstration on how
I think you should proceed if you're
just getting started as a web developer
and you have dreams of becoming a web
developer alright so number one you need
a place to put your project file what I
like to do is put everything in my C
Drive and my projects folder I'm gonna
create a new folder in here called
tutorial and then inside of here I'm
going to say just beginning web
development alright so now that we're
inside the folder we know that we have
the folder created we know where it is
and everything we need something to
actually write our code in so if you're
gonna be dealing with web development
it's important that you understand that
there's basically three different
languages that you're gonna be writing
and now technically they're not all
languages like HTML itself is considered
the skeleton like if you're equated a
webpage like a human body would be the
skeleton the thing that gives you a
structure and definition to the web page
that is what hTML is and it's
conservative syntax so it's not really a
programming language but it's very
weird-looking you have these these tags
and every opening tag has to have a
closing tag so you can see this is the
opening li and then the closing li has
the forward slash there are really the
backslash i should say and then that
closes off that particular element you
could have nested elements so this li
here has an a inside of it which is
anchor this is how you click on a link
and it takes you to another page so the
is all HTML and it's important that you
understand this you can actually write
HTML right into a browser like you don't
even you don't even need any other tool
at this point like if I wanted to go
into the body here let's just say if I
right click and say inspect using chrome
you know what let's just drill into the
body here so we have an image that's all
we have in here I'm gonna say you know
what I'm gonna edit this HTML I'm gonna
get rid of this image and I'm gonna put
just a title in here hello world now
this is a header tag so you need to get
started with with HTML this is a good
way it's nice easy that hello world is
is right there now it's in black so it's
hard to see it would be helpful if we
put a style tag on this and made it
white so that we can see it an inline
styling did not work it appears other
guys I must have just typed it wrong my
bad all right so now you can see that we
now have this HTML so this is actual
inline styling on the HTML element this
video is not about teaching you guys
HTML it's just simply how I think that
you guys should go about learning HTML
and learning about it first so what I
think that you should do is probably go
to a website like the w3c is a good one
for HTML here so I'll show you guys this
this is actually a good tutorial if you
follow through all these these
demonstrations on the left hand side
you're going to be in pretty good shape
when it comes to learning HTML and the
basic tags and everything that you're
gonna run into the next thing you need
to understand in web development is that
we use something called CSS which stands
for cascading style sheets and this is
another it is another what is somewhat
of a markup language type of thing and
not really a programming language but
there is quite a bit you have to learn
in order to understand how pages are
laid out and styled and everything so in
this particular case you can see that
these these little properties here are
CSS properties and those are what we
modify
using CSS in order to change the way
things are laid out and displayed so
once again if we go back and we end up
messing with our HTML here I'll just do
it inside the body all right so now we
have this this testing message once
again once again it's black here but
what if what if I right-click on this
and I can go over on my Styles panel
within chrome over here and I can click
on this new style rule and what its
gonna do is it's gonna add a new rule
for this new h1 so now I can start
writing CSS right into the browser which
is a great way to learn and to learn all
the different ways that you can style
CSS and things like that once again
another good site for CSS I think is
probably w3c I'm not going to recommend
the w3c for everything but w3schools is
a good option for CSS so if you go
through all this and learn about all
this CSS here you're gonna be in really
good shape you're gonna be an expert but
anyway let's go back over to the browser
you could actually start messing with
the colors now so if I do FFF that's
gonna be white if I click on this I can
start moving my colors around changing
the way things look all right so there's
our testing and is a good way to start
adding different styles and stuff like
that and just seeing how the page
interacts so if I'm like let's put a div
on here and we'll say id equals testing
adieu
all right so anyway if I could type okay
so now we have this div here and if I
went ahead and I right-click on that
make sure that I have this highlighted
go over click the plus button you can
see that's just going to target this one
div container so I'm going to change the
color of the font to be white I'm also
going to say display you know what will
change the background color will change
the width and I - so we'll say width and
this is all CSS here that we're using
and we'll give it a height of the same
amount make it a perfect square
basically and then we'll change the
background color to red yeah that looks
really ugly but anyway that's all CSS
and everything so now I can even change
my font size if I want that font size to
be a lot bigger I can say extra-large
and is a property if I wanted to do that
or I can give it actual an actual pixel
height as well so I can say like 36
pixels 50 pixels 100 pixels will keep it
at 50 pixels and then we're going to
last thing last style we'll look at is
the text-align:center all right there we
go all right so now that's how we're
actually styling everything which is
really cool alright so this isn't enough
information for you to build any sort of
large-scale project what I think you
should do is you should end up trying to
figure out a website that you want to
create and then try to replicate it so
what do I mean what I mean is I go to
YouTube and I look at this page and I'm
like hey I want to build a page like
this well there's a ton of stuff going
on on a page like this with YouTube you
have servers that are streaming actual
video data that are delayed that are
displaying thumbnail images all kinds of
different things
thousands of requests are being made for
a page like this to be displayed but you
don't have to have all the bells and
whistles that YouTube does in order to
create a YouTube type site if you want
to be a
UI designer you should be able to take
this an exact layout and be able to
apply it to your own project relatively
easily and there's there's going to be a
few tools that I want to show you that
you should be using I think to make your
life a lot easier to do something like
that so let's first look at how we would
do that number one we need an editor and
that's where we should go to Visual
Studio code and Visual Studio code is a
completely free open-source
cross-platform text editor that you
should be using to write your code I
recommend it because it's just so much
easier to get started with so Visual
Studio code is definitely a good a good
project so when you open it number one
download it install it and then when you
go to run it for the first time what you
need to do is you want to open the
folder that we just created for the
tutorials and your code for your project
should all stay inside the same folder
you don't want files in one folder and
and you know files in another foot like
basically you want one root folder for
your project and then subfolders you can
have as many subfolders as you want but
you should always have one folder for
your project so we already have that
here so I'm going to create our first
file which is just gonna be first file
dot HTML your file has to end in a dot
HTML in order for it to be actual HTML
and to have a browser be able to open it
so we're gonna have just our basic HTML
tags once again is not a HTML
demonstration or at least not an HTML
tutorial alright so there's our basic
structure our skeleton that every HTML
page needs it has its head and it has
its body and then inside the body let's
go ahead and put our hello world example
alright so now that we have that if I go
ahead and I right-click from within
visual studio code I say reveal and
Explorer it's going to open it right to
the location if I double click on it
because we saved it as a dot HTML file
windows knows to open HTML files using
Chrome since it's a web page and you can
see that we have our hello world so if
we wanted some more styling on that
I could just go ahead and start style
color red ctrl s to save we go back and
we take a look we can see that we have
red font so working inside the browser
is good if you want to see quick and
dirty results of what you're doing but
none of this stuff is gonna be saved if
i refresh we have the original stuff
that's back so we lose it all and that's
why it's not not really a good idea for
any sort of major web development now
the next thing you're gonna want to get
into is something called bootstrap and
everybody's using bootstrap these days
bootstrap still uses well you know let's
just focus on bootstrap for the moment
so here is bootstrap and bootstrap is
gonna make it so much easier when it
comes to laying out our pages and like I
said everybody uses it so by you using
bootstrap and designing websites using
it you're gonna be much more employable
to different employers and things like
that so let's go ahead and we're gonna
just download the entire source files
here and what this will do is it gives
us a bootstrap folder although this
stuff has way more crap than I want
actually one second we just want the
compiled version sorry alright so what
this is gonna do is it's going to give
you two folders here the CSS and J's
folder what we wanna do is extract it to
our project so we're gonna see projects
tutorials beginning web development and
we'll put it right there alright so
we've extracted it there so now if we go
back to our folder you can see we have
this HTML and CSS stuff so let's go back
to our our editor here and we're going
to number one we're going to add our
bootstrap file so now I could say link
relation equals stylesheet
and this is the location to where it can
be found so it's in our CS CSS folder
and then we're gonna have bootstrap dot
min dot CSS so that's all we actually
want in this particular link right here
so we're pointing to this bootstrap this
bootstrap file right here and this is a
bunch of stuff you don't have to know
what it means but we're gonna be using
it to get started with so once again
you're gonna take this piecemeal you're
gonna start with HTML you write it in
your editor or write it in the browser
go through this the tutorial series on
the w3 schools and then go on and start
taking that HTML and styling it with CSS
and then once you're done with that then
you're in a position now to start using
bootstrap so then you would want to
bring in bootstrap just like I showed
you and then you would start using that
now because we imported bootstrap
correctly we now have this different
looking style so that's that's good
that's what we need so now what I can do
is I can actually start using bootstrap
style so if I have a class I'm gonna say
container everything in bootstrap it
exists inside of a container it's all
containers and rows so we have a class
for our our row right and then we'll put
this inside of our row
and if we refresh it you can now see
that the container and everything we're
getting these styles that are coming
from the CSS right now I have source
maps turned on so don't pay too much
attention that but all this CSS is
actually coming from the bootstrap
library that we imported and everything
now there's a ton you have to learn
about bootstrap but it's gonna be
besties learn how everything's laid out
with columns and rows and everything
before moving into the next phase which
is what I'm going to tell you this is
basically the the third and final phase
for web development type technologies so
the next thing would be and remember to
take some decent amount of time to study
this bootstrap stuff there there's a lot
here that you have to actually digest in
order to get started with there's just
there's just so much there like but
there's gonna be styles and everything
for you that just tells you how to lay
things out like it will tell you okay
when you have the reason why our
bootstrap headings changed is because
they have all these Styles here that
dictate how headings and everything work
but all of it is well-documented is what
I'm trying to say so make sure you just
check that out for for more information
when you get stuff alright so the third
and final piece you want to learn about
with web development is going to be
actual JavaScript and this is the
language and it is a programming
language or a scripting language some
people will tell you it's not a
programming language but a scripting
language but anyway it's it is
definitely a programming whatever you're
gonna write it to program and so anyway
whether you call it a scripting language
is technically what it's what it's what
it's termed at but anyway this is here
we have a variable we have a variable X
that is assigned a value of hello world
and then we're just using alert to
display it using javascript and that's
what actually does to draw the pop-up
boxes as annoying pop-up boxes you get
that is people developers using the
alert statement to cause the browser to
alert you with that information
so where do you learn a bunch about
JavaScript well really this is the one
thing that I would recommend maybe books
on or you could look at some of my es6
tutorials there's a lot of great
tutorials that are out there you can use
it like paid ones like Pluralsight or
you could just use free ones like myself
but I think if you if you use free
resources along with maybe a book or two
that you get Mozilla also has some
really good documentation on JavaScript
which I think they have the best
documentation but you can really get you
can spend a ton of time in JavaScript
and I think just initially you want to
don't try to be a ninja don't try to get
into JavaScript frameworks like angular
or react or anything like that before
you get into any of that stuff I would
recommend that you you use jQuery first
because you need to know where we've
come from I think because if you're
trying to work in the corporate world
this is still gonna be something you're
gonna run into I'm not saying you have
to spend three weeks learning how to use
jQuery I'm just saying be familiar with
it enough to where you could say you
know what
what is jQuery let's look at a jQuery
CDN which stands for content
distribution network and what I can do
is I can actually just grab one of these
and like here's the minified version and
you can just pop this script right in
here so I don't have to to download
anything like we did with bootstrap I
can actually put it right inside right
inside the closing body here so now
we're pointing to this script and if we
go back to our file I can now you so
I'll go to my page I'll right-click I'll
say inspect and then I'll go into the
console and then inside of here I can
now start using this JavaScript syntax
to start selecting Dom elements so I
said body and it returned the body tag
now jQuery actually did that this dollar
sign is a special meaning and anything
inside these parentheses is actually the
element that we want to go after so on
so I know I didn't I didn't layout like
an exact step-by-step guide on how you
can actually make a youtube type page
like it's obviously not not as simple or
straightforward thing it's going to take
a lot of time to get right I think so
before you start getting into react
angular or even a server-side language I
really feel like you should be
comfortable enough to be able to lay out
a webpage like this now it doesn't have
to have the same functionality but
literally I could copy this video URL or
even I mean it's just so simple to get
like certain things like if I go and I
get the embed code so I get the embed
here's the iframe I'm going to copy that
go back to our page and we'll put this
inside of our container maybe and then
we'll just even call this the name of
the the song that is on that video there
so there we go
so now you look at something like this
since I oh well this this title is like
not all the way across to what we could
do we could tell this thing inside of
our header here that we want it to be
with 100% and then we're going to say
text-align:center and then with our I
frame like if I want to start styling
this thing I could say you know I want
it to be a little bigger just do it here
as well with five all right pixels
pixels so anyway you can see it starts
to to match this up and now our headers
needs to probably go back onto the left
you can even text indent it a little bit
if you wanted sorry but there's all
these different styles you can have so
like you would just start one to one
start designing your stuff out you know
make the page be able to work with just
HTML CSS keep it all local like I said
in your little folder and everything so
that you're not trying to bite off more
than you can chew there's no reason even
if you were like hey I want to build a
website I want to use MongoDB there's no
reason why you need a with MongoDB for
like why your shirts not listing on the
right port or whatever you don't have to
do any of that that stuff is gonna just
gonna lead you down a rabbit hole you
don't want to go down get familiar with
this stuff first because
if your jaw like if your role is is to
go to a boot camp or is to do this or
that to try to get into a web
development gig it starts something
small digestible by following advice
like in this video and then from there
you're gonna start expanding your wings
and it's really gonna do you a lot of
good because you're gonna be able to
gain experience the right way there's
actual wrong ways of going about
learning and I've actually made many
I've taken that route many many times
and just trying to get you guys to not
take that route with this video thanks
for watching guys and study with Vilma
comm he has a freelancing bundle that
he's come out with he calls it
freelancing and beyond is the actual
name of the e-book ace created but he's
not a lot of information on his website
and also in the e-book and he's selling
this this tutorial because he's found
success and his freedom freelancing work
that he's done he's been a programmer
since he was 17 years old so he's been
doing it for quite some time now he's
well and it was in adult years at this
point so anyway he's been in the
industry for a while if you guys could
check out his website and study web
development com forward slash
freelancing the link is going to be in
the description tab below and then once
again he's got an entire ebook that he's
looking to sell you that has a lot of
good information in there alright guys
thanks for watching have a good day so
this video was brought to you by a dead
mountain coding boot camp they're a boot
camp that is based out of Utah but
they're also in Texas in Arizona now and
they have very good reviews so make sure
you guys check them out the link is in
the description tab below they offer
courses in web development iOS
development UX or user experience design
Quality Assurance and just a few other
ones in fact they're even getting into
Salesforce as well now so they're
continuing to adapt their courses based
on what the market needs are and major
companies are hiring some of their
alumni so make sure you guys give them a
look they have great reviews and thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
