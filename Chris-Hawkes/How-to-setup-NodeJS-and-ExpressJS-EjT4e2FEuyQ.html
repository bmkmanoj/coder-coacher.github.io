this video we're gonna do a tutorial
series on how to get set up with node I
want to use the Express the Express
framework which is a very minimal like
framework for node should be pretty cool
and some applications are written in is
my space we're in Bo's Storify and ever
heard of it
bunch of these other sites never heard
of but they look good and I'm gonna use
it as I'm just gonna try to build like a
real simple website in order to show
YouTube videos on so that's it so you
need to make sure that you have node
installed in your Mystery Machine so you
can use NPM and NPM is a package
installer that comes with notes so just
make sure you download node for whatever
sort of system you're going to be using
it on and just so you guys I have the
link here I'm gonna go ahead and provide
it so that is not the link I was looking
for anybody just go to their main page
you can see that it actually detects the
version you have and works on Mac Linux
Windows I already have it installed at
least I think so so I'm going to run NPM
install Express and then we're gonna say
Ivan Ivan save
all right so it's gonna install this
crap might take a little bit longer for
you because I may have already had this
installed I don't remember all right so
we need to figure out where this
projects gonna live so I'm gonna
actually put in my projects folder so
let's go ahead and CD into that and you
just want to put it wherever you want
I'm gonna make a directory called post
because that's why I'm gonna call this
out so let's go ahead and see the end of
that new directory alright now once
you're in it we're gonna go ahead and
use a node command which is gonna be
called NPM I knit and what this does is
it creates a package.json file which is
really just a configuration file for
your application and we're just going to
go ahead and hit return so that we can
accept all the defaults in here
okay and if we go ahead and go you can
see that there's now a package.json file
now what we just did was we actually
created the nodejs project so that's
your your typical note procedure so what
we want to do is just go ahead and
install run the install Express command
again and this will actually save
Express in the configuration options or
configuration file that we just created
and you'll see that a complain no
description because we didn't actually
add any of that it was an optional thing
so you can just ignore those warnings
all right now guys that we have an
application going we need to actually
use an editor and my particular case I'm
going to be using Visual Studio so I'm
going to open up an occurrence of that
you guys don't have to use Visual Studio
you can use whatever you want I could
care less there's so many of them out
there everybody has a personal
preference and the way I'm going to do
this in fact I'm not even sure if it's
the preferred way in Visual Studio if
you happen to be using it I'm just going
to open the website and point to the
directory where we just created our
project and like I said I'm not even
sure if that is the a good process or
not
so I'll just open that entire directory
so I apologize if this is hard to see
but you can see my editor here that we
have a node modules and then one of the
modules in there the only one that we
have is the Express framework that we
just went ahead and installed and then
you have this package dot JSON file that
if we open it up but you can see all the
configuration settings that we have I'll
go ahead and add my author name in here
so the only dependencies that our
node.js application has is on the latest
version of Express which is the
framework that we're going to be messing
with here all right guys so in our main
folder here we're gonna go ahead and
create our JavaScript file which we're
gonna call just app dot J s so I'm going
to add a new JavaScript the hell just
happened there programmer error here in
one moment I decided to restart visual
studio there that sucked
alright let me go ahead and add a new
file now there's just gonna be a
JavaScript file and we're gonna call
this app and I just want to make sure
everything's working here so I'm going
to paste the example from the web site
here just to get a hello world
application running so just to pause
take a moment pause the screen and just
write this down if you if you would and
then we can go ahead and try to run it
and we're gonna need to run this from
the command line so where the
application is currently installed you
can see that app das is there now and
we're just gonna say node app J s and
now you can see that's actually
listening on port 3000 which is the port
that we told it to do listen on so now
we need to go to localhost so HTTP or
let me do it one change this to 3,000
and boom we have a Express nodejs
website actually up and running with
really minimal effort so you can see
this application does not do much here
but this particular video was just how
we get our feet wet with node and
Express and how to get everything
working hi guys thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
