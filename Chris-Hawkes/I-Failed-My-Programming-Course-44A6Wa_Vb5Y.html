Mountain coding boot camp I know you
guys know that I'm always pushing their
stuff but they've been my sponsor my
primary sponsor for about two years now
so please do me a favor look in the
description there's a link to deb
mountain coding boot camp if you are
interested in learning how to become a
developer you want to go to a coding
bootcamp you can't pick a better one
check out deb mountain they got good
reviews i appreciate it hey guys what's
up good evening youtube friends this
video i just wanted to really quick make
a video about this comment he's like
Antonio's like I've been loving your
videos lately just wish there was more
content because I've seen just about
everything on your channel
he says I'm currently working a manual
labour job but I don't hate it
I take manual labour over customer
service any day you know what I would
agree with that I'm still I'd love a
cushy programming job even better and
honestly that is the right mindset to
have dude so keep working at that one
person said that they failed their
programming courses like one person said
multiple times and and really I wouldn't
feel too bad about that I've never
personally have done well like in
academic settings because when I was
going to college at night while I was
working full-time had family kids and
everything I would put in minimal effort
just simply to get a good grade so I
like if I could get a B and put in
minimal effort I would do that over
putting in a ton of effort and getting
an A because I knew that the course was
 anyway so I guess it's harsh to
say that a course is teaching
you higher education higher level you
know concepts and everything is that is

but let's be honest it is like so when
you're going on online courses like why
the hell do I need to log in three times
a week to start these little threads on
these blackboard forums it's it's just I
don't know like I understand like the
whole online courses and you're trying
to get like more of like a classroom
type of involvement where you're dealing
with other students but I'm going to an
online course so I don't have to deal
with that like don't make me
log in three times a week just to put in
some stupid comment just to get a good
grade like it is so ridiculous what
about like the fact that every other
semester a new accounting book comes out
like so we have to have a counting
version 27.3 and have to pay $118 every
time a new accounting course comes out
because we have to have the new book
good it's all just it's just it's it's a
scheme so one like so
that is kind of the effort that I'm
talking about it's like why should I put
in a bunch of effort for that if it's
not if it's not returning the favor
I will tell you like firsthand like most
of my learning in education everything
has come from on-the-job and a lot of
the education everything that I've
learned while going to Community College
for my Business Administration degree
and I was I was in a full time a full
four-year university as well for a short
period of time but I can tell you like
none of those those things that I
learned have been anywhere is as
beneficial to me as like learning on the
job or even learning on my own accord to
become a developer like I did or even
learning how to do basic video editing
or even YouTube and everything I mean I
learned that stuff in my own I'm having
my own
I think Drive to do that makes it much
easier so I will say that in an academic
setting that I would probably fail too
if I was just forced to go into
programming I would hate it I
guarantee it because programming is one
of those things like math you can't
 you miss a semicolon your stuff
doesn't work like with math you miss
like one of your numbers like somewhere
your stuff is not right like you're
either right or wrong and and
programming is the same way so much love
to all my peeps out there that actually
want me to produce more content and
actually I do want to I want to do more
videos maybe I should do more videos
like this where I just simply read a
comment have inspiration to do a video
for a few minutes but in many cases it's
not like that in many cases I have I
have to do editing sometimes I have to
have a motivation actually sit in front
of a camera sometimes like well really
not every time I sit in front of a
camera but sitting in even in front of a
microphone and then sometimes I'm
sitting in front of a camera like I
don't necessarily want to do that all
the time
so maybe doing more videos like this
would help me kind of grow this thing
but I can't do full-time YouTube
unfortunately I would have to have about
three times the volume and revenue and
money and everything that this channel
is earning in order for it to be
full-time so it's not really a reality
for me at this point
but every once in a while though I do
read those comments and I'm like man I
need to do full-time YouTube so yeah
right now though it's just not happening
but anyway guys thanks for thanks for
watching thank you for subscribing and
almost a hundred thousand by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
