everybody's talking about Jeff Bezos is
now the richest person in the world so I
just thought I'd take a moment to kind
of talk about the same thing get my
thoughts on the subject and so I guess a
few things to discuss first is a lot of
people like date delay you know Amazon I
get you know want to create the next
Amazon or what it will actually no not a
lot not a lot of people say that in fact
I just completely made that up but it
seems like you know at least for a lot
of younger people including myself
looked at something like Amazon and
thought that it was attainable for
somebody like you know myself to be able
to do the same thing and in reality it's
probably not so that's like the first
thing I just kind of want to touch upon
now so Jeff Bezos has now actually worth
a 93 billion dollars according to Forbes
which is basically the authority on the
the richest people in the world here so
sorry I'm just trying to pull up a
little note that I jot it down on this
thing son of a bitch all right so I had
the exact figure it's ninety two point
three billion dollars is what Jeff Bezos
is not worth so he's now there he's the
richest person he's got the most
successful e-commerce platform no other
website as far as he Commerce is
concerned is pulling in more money or at
least more revenue in Amazon now Amazon
is not the most profitable company by
far in fact a lot of people tell you
that you know Amazon took a long time
like ten years or something close to
that
to actually make its first realized
profit but they so started Amazon in
1994 it was kind of thought up he was on
a trip from I believe it was New York
where he worked as a in the Financial
Field on Wall Street and was actually
driving out to Seattle and actually
wrote down the business plan for Amazon
you know they and famously is known for
he was on you know online books and then
now it's like it's mostly known for just
being you know Amazon Prime and
obviously Amazon
and demand the video I use it for a lot
of video Li if I'm doing video rentals
or even buying movies I typically do it
on Amazon now because it's someone you
one true retailer I feel like is going
to be around for quite a while that I
feel like if I buy a movie in their
cloud then it will be pretty safe but
then you also look at the amount of
money that AWS is pulling in so it's
like you know they're clearly a lot more
than what they were originally intended
to be so how did Bezos even you know
create this like and and one of the
things you kinda have to look at which
is which is uh and I'm not trying to
pointing fingers to kind of describe
anything that he did but it's like you
know he went to Princeton right so he
went to Princeton
he's from Albuquerque New Mexico which
is uniquely enough it is the you know
the same city where Bill Gates actually
founded Microsoft and Jeff Bezos has
recently surpassed Microsoft CEO Bill
Gates to become the richest person so
you know being based out it's like well
why was he in Albuquerque New Mexico but
it's actually he was there because his
grandfather was like one of the
directors for you know the atomic
nuclear agencies or it was like
something to do with the US government
and all the nuclear research and
everything that goes into you know to
that area well his grandfather was tied
to that and was actually a director and
ended up retiring pretty early and and
running a ranch that his family actually
had so his family comes from a we I
would say a wealthy Texas background so
they're one of the earlier Texas
settlers and this is his maternal father
at least his maternal grandfather that
they come from this wealthy Texas family
that has a ranch even now that's over
25,000 acres so if you're like well did
Jeff Bezos come for money well clearly
he did like he came from money because
his family was super wealthy they were
super well-off so I mean if you have a
twenty five dollars an acre branch I
don't care if it's in the middle of
nowhere like view of 25,000 acres
somewhere like you're worth a lot of
money
I was just looking at this plant that I
brought home from work a couple days ago
and like it looks way different right
now I think it's dying this is a
succulent so it's like a similar to aloe
plant and it's looking way different man
since I brought home I'm not sure what's
going on with it maybe it's like going
into some sort of hibernation or some
sort of reproduction kind of stage or
something but it's like way bigger and
it looks like it's like looks like it's
dying anyway getting getting back to the
point man so so Jeff besos uh you know
obviously comes from money you can't
have a twenty five thousand or twenty
five thousand acre ranch in your family
without being works from some sort of
money
you also don't go to Princeton typically
unless you you have a pretty good
financial I guess financial freedom in
order to do so and then also even when
he started Amazon he actually used some
loan from his father I believe to start
an Amazon so you know clearly like
Amazon still this is huge it's a huge
deal you know Jeff Bezos can be credited
as being the creator but he didn't
solely create the company obviously that
you know that takes a lot of effort from
a lot of different people and no one
single person can do it just like when I
was talking about grand theft auto 5
it's not possible for one single person
to build something like that but you
know through a lot of you know a lot of
different love trial error error things
like that you're going to eventually if
somebody will find success like that
also one thing that that's interesting I
wanted to point out as well as Jeff
Bezos is that has been a an early
contributor to a lot of different
technologies including things like that
are being used to the last two employers
that I've seen which is a workday which
is a product for Human Resources they he
was involved in like Airbnb uber a lot
of that other stuff so he's like he's
actually invested a lot of his money in
wealth and it has actually earned quite
a bit based on those investments for
instance like his most successful
investment that I actually know about
was $250,000 and he invested in Google
in their early stages like in 1996 I
believe and that's 250,000 that he
invested in Google is now worth over 3
billion
dollars so that goes to show you right
there I mean if you would have just like
if we all had the hindsight then you
know we would have loved to jump on
Google early on and invest you know even
a couple thousand dollars and still have
quite a bit of money but the thing is is
like the way the entire situation set up
with with venture capital funding and
angel investors and all that stuff is
like you have to be this thing you know
accredited wealthy person in order to be
able to invest in early stage startups
and things like that
and now the JOBS Act in 2012 was
supposed to solve that and it never
really did didn't really do to be
honest with you this is this you know we
saw kind of Kickstarter come about and
IndieGoGo and things like that but these
weren't actually using equity based
crowdfunding so it's like you couldn't
buy portions of the company you just
kind of got free stuff when you
contributed to things so it's not like
Kickstarter and IndieGoGo weren't
successful but this this clearly was
supposed to be able to give average
joe's like you and I the ability to
invest in companies like Amazon and
Google and things like that when they're
first getting started so that we have
you know some of that equity instead of
all these rich bastards they don't you
know it's like a ton of the wealth now
another thing I want to point out is
that Jeff Bezos is wealth is obviously
tied to Amazon and that's obviously tied
to the stock market and what Amazon is
actually being traded for so if we look
at Amazon when is their stock price
right now you can see they're down $6
David barely is not even a barely over
half a percent so you know 499 billion
market caps almost a half a trillion
dollar company and in Jeff Bezos owns
like you know something with a
ridiculous amount of shares of this
company so that's where as wealth
actually comes from so his wealth is
directly tied to Wall Street and for the
most part so is everybody else so as
Larry Ellison Warren Buffett Bill Gates
all those guys but one thing that I will
say that like if you compare Bezos to
like somebody like Bill Gates Bill Gates
has done a lot more with his wealth
towards like you know contributing to
Flint his philanthropy
anyway whatever like you guys want to
talk about he contributed to the
different organizations like to Bill
Melinda Gates Foundation which which
combats malaria in Africa and other
emerging countries and things like that
and he's donated billions and billions
of dollars so like you know how do you
been this self-serving person not saying
that Bezos is but like you know Bill
Gates probably could have done more with
as well he also got sued by the u.s.
federal government for you know
monopolies with Microsoft and everything
back in the 90s so you know a lot of
things kind of certain Bill Gates's way
to prevent himself from being like the
richest person I also saw a stat which
may or may not be a hundred percent it
might be a little deceiving actually it
was that Rockefeller john d rockefeller
if he were alive today he would be worth
about three hundred and forty billion
dollars now granted they come up with
that figure because apparently they look
at you know what his net worth was
compared to the GDP back in like the
time that he lived which was in the
early nineteen hundred and then you
compare that to how large the United
States economy is now well clearly the
united states economy has grown a ton
since I World War One World War two and
even now and it's the largest economy
still by far so when you factor in that
kind of stuff it's not really an apples
to apples comparison but either way
somebody like john d rockefeller would
have been more more wealthy than Bill
Gates or Jeff Bezos and possibly both of
them put together so I'll just kind of
summarize everything lay where does that
leave us where does that leave the
normal typical day-to-day developers
that slave away and write code for
Amazon to make them make Jeff Bezos the
richest person in the world I mean
really it's it kind of draws back to
like to me I think of Amazon I don't
even think of like the best UX or the
best product reading like that you know
they mastered logistics they master the
ability to be able to skirt obviously
you know certain tax laws that other you
know brick-and-mortar shops had to abide
by obviously being the first end of the
internet and the global economy fact
that Bezos comes from money also was a
wealthy Wall Street Wall Street guy
before even started Amazon went to
Princeton a lot of different things like
that in fact Jeff Bezos actually went to
went to Princeton and was actually
working
on projects I might have even been in
the same dorm room as one of my old
bosses a company that I worked for which
is costar group and costar group was
founded by this guy named Andy Florence
and he also went to Princeton was
actually buddies with with Jeff Bezos
and both have billion-dollar companies
so if you look at the market cap of
costar group they're just under nine
billion clearly it's not nearly as much
as five hundred billion that Amazon is
but that's still pretty amazing you have
two guys that there were buddies at
Princeton and they both went on to start
a billion-dollar companies that are
really game-changing companies like
costar group has done a lot with
commercial real estate and obviously
ecommerce Amazon did a lot for
e-commerce but the other thing is so
where is where does the everyday people
like we can still use two a week we can
write code we can write technology we
can you know we can solve business
problems but just because you're a
programmer doesn't mean that you're a
good businessman and in vice-versa you
can be a good businessman to be a
terrible programmer I kind of consider
myself in between the two like I don't
consider myself a great programmer nor
do I consider myself a great businessman
but I think that I do have a business
spin on a lot of programming and
technology and things that I've learned
including this channel that earns me
money and everything else so it's like I
feel like you know to me that's kind of
where I want to be I don't want to be
this expert nerd programmer that eats
and breathes code day in and day out I
want to make money with code I want to
have a good career with code and I want
to be keeping my eye out just like Jeff
Bezos did in 1994 when the internet was
starting to boom you know he saw the
writing on the wall he saw that it was
going to be big for e-commerce and
things like that and he acted and he had
a lot of resources to act and clearly
he's now the richest person in the world
but if we kind of substitute ourselves
and in his shoes and maybe not go you
know towards the the stars with our
goals but instead we're like hey you
know I feel like I can enter into this
market like look at Andy Florence with
co-star group like he he was like hey
nobody's doing this I'm going to do this
and he did it and he was one of the
first ones in the 1980s who now has a
billion dollar company many people don't
know co-star
so it's like there and that is that is
still asked
success that you really shouldn't
compare yourself to there's millions of
programmers and businesspeople that are
able to capitalize on on things in a
short time and make a lot of money
Palmer Luckey with the VR and and you
know the fact they became a billionaire
essentially with you know working on
something in an Suraj like there are
certain times in places for things and
if you have your on your ear to the
streets and your wits about you and
especially from a business sense you
might be able to capitalize on
technology where other people just don't
see it it always seems obvious in
hindsight so you kind of need to tell
yourself that like if something's
jumping out at you like you know there
it could quite be you know it could be a
legit business opportunity for you so
clearly I don't have that business
opportunity for Evan if I did I wouldn't
just give it for free on my youtube
channel but you know there have been
things that I've thought of along the
way that I feel like could make me a lot
of money and then sometimes I just don't
do it because I don't have the
motivation or I recognize that on the
skills or the resources and things like
that but yeah there's always money to be
made there's opportunity everywhere we
just need to keep our eyes open for it
