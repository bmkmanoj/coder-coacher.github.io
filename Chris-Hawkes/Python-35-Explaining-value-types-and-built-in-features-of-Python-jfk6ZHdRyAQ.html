tutorial and one of the things I didn't
want to mention is that I hate the
default location where Python 3.5
installs normally it always just you
know gives me a clear-cut path of where
I want to put it or usually I put it
right on the C Drive
but you guys saw in the previous video I
mean that thing was buried in like see
users friggin my username AppData blah
blah blah went on forever so I ended up
just removing it real quick and then
reinstalling it so now you can see I
have Python 27 34 and 35 right under my
C Drive which is where right where I
wanted so anyway you guys can do that if
you want I'm not sure why it installs it
under the users like that I really hate
that to be honest with you and another
thing too is that I did I went ahead and
I made the change so that when I type
Python you can see that it's finding the
3.5 like I don't have it I don't like
appetite path on 35 anymore because I
feel like that's just going to confuse
people that come along and try to follow
along here so anyway that being said
guys um we're able to move forward so
let's pull up our atom editor in the
previous video we did our hello world
which is the typical introduction to any
sort of programming language so now that
we have that out of the way we need to
go ahead and just explain a few things
python has some special words that they
refer to as keywords which mean that you
cannot use those keywords for any sort
of naming convention and when I say
naming convention whenever you're
programming you're going to create
things called variables which is really
just a reference to an object and it
stores some sort of value and the value
can vary so it can be a number it could
be a set of characters like letters or
it could be entire webpages or entire
stacks of webpages upon webpages
thousands millions of them all those are
going to be considered variables in the
Python programming language and when you
name those variables you cannot use
these special names released it's a
highly advisable or
I'll advise that you do not do that so
Python has a bunch of names that you're
not supposed to use and I'll just give
you guys this little example right here
these are all special keyword names that
you should not override they say
built-in functions what what that means
is that they ship with the Python
language so every one of these functions
does something and they sometimes do a
lot of different things but in this case
they're all special and you should never
name any sort of variable after them so
anyway and I'm not sure if you guys
noticed but the print is in there so
here's print which is just a function
now keep in mind everything in python is
an object so i represented the object as
this circle here so print is an object
and it has certain things that it can
accept and it which are called
parameters and what those parameters are
is the actual thing that you want to
print so it can be a number or it could
be like what's considered a string which
is just a set of characters like hello
world like we did in the example so
hopefully I didn't say that too stupidly
but anyway print is part of the Python
built-in library so you just have to
know that it's there it's provided to
you by Python and inside of the
parentheses is what it is that you want
to print so it can actually be and in an
integer which is one so you can see I
did not have to use these double quotes
I could also use single quotes and it's
the same thing anything in a double
quote or a single quote within Python is
considered a string stupid weird name
but all programming languages call it
that so this is no longer an integer
this is a string because of the double
quotes and you can see that the syntax
highlighting differentiates strings by
showing them as green and it's showing
integers as orange so you can see that
this is now
and integer in orange so let's run our
little program here and we'll say Python
now first program dot py and you'll see
that it printed out in the same exact
way but the difference between it though
is that print can print out integers or
it can print out strings and it did it
in the exact same way so the bottom line
is that print takes in two takes in
something in order to print it out so
print is considered a function that has
an argument and the argument is another
step of whether you're just going to get
used to and programming which means and
what am i passing to print and what
should print deal with it well print all
it does is actually just print whatever
it is out to the screen so it doesn't
really do anything more than that it's
one of the more simplistic built-in
functions in the Python library so the
thing that you pass to any sort of
function in Python which is inside of
those parentheses is going to be called
an argument so try to remember that this
is a string argument
so anyway guys that is considered an
argument try to you know remember that
because you're gonna hear that a lot
now we're not going to look at all the
different types that Python has but we
are we've already seen - we've seen the
string which like I said is that dumb
name for a series of characters and a
string just so you know can be a single
sentence it can be a single letter it
can be an integer
you know spelled out or it could be an
entire web source code so it can be an
entire novel or it can be a single
letter so strings are very very flexible
in that regard and they're very
important because pretty much everything
a lot of a lot of things that you're
going to do any sort of Python are
programming or any really any language
for that matter you're going to be
dealing with a lot of strings that's how
you write files it's how you read files
and that's all string related now you're
gonna also deal with a lot of integers
you're gonna have to do some sort of
mathematical calculations if you're
doing game programming or if you're
trying to do any sort of financial
analysis or you know biotechnology or
whatever it may be that you're trying to
do and python has the ability to just
simply print eight times eight which we
know that the answer should be 64 so
when we run our program you'll see that
it's 64 now that did a mathematical
calculation so what you'll see in just
like any sort of mathematical
calculation the star symbol means
multiplied divided means you know this
forward slash
and then you obviously can have eight
minus eight which is zero and then eight
plus eight so that's how you do all the
different amount of mathematical
calculations keep in mind when we talk
about values here that they are
different from one another so you cannot
say eight plus eight plus this is a
string this is where we're going to get
our first what's called an exception or
an error either way it's it's an
exception meaning something went wrong
and Python has built-in error handling
to give you an idea on what happened it
said unsupported operand type four plus
int and string so those are the two
things that I was telling you about
those are called value types so when we
had the value in green it was a string
and python has an abbreviation for that
called STR and then there's also the nth
and it's saying hey I can't add an int
in a string I don't know what that is so
the problem is here is that if you
wanted this to be one single line you
would have to do it workaround which
this is kind of jumping ahead here but I
could say turn this to a string so I'm
taking both of these integers and now
they're they're actually string types
and not integers so Python does that on
the fly when the program is built and
this will now compile and run and it
takes it all into one big string so this
is all just one printed out string now
those are no longer integers the term
for doing that and this is something
that you don't have to remember remember
right now but what we're doing is we're
actually casting a value type of an
integer to a string but anytime you turn
an object's value to a different type
meaning you know an int to a string or a
string to an int and that is called
casting and and that's how you do it
there so that's kind of jumping ahead a
little bit as far as um you know how to
how to accomplish certain goals but
that's fine I feel like it's pretty
relevant so let's jump into the next
subject then which is really going to be
variables variables like I said they can
be entire novels they can be a single
letter they can be an integer they can
be a string there's no limit to what
they can be and the value is never set
in stone it can be changed so to create
a variable in Python it's easier than
any other language out there at least
that I've ever seen and all you simply
have to do is just give your variable a
name so X is a name for a variable it's
a horrible name by the way because
nobody knows what X does so now if X
equaled X then that would be a pretty
good indication that x equals x but x is
a what's considered a horrible variable
name because your variable name should
be descriptive and this is not
descriptive at all so I mean nobody's
going to know that that value or
variable X has the value of X they just
don't know but that is how you actually
create a variable so we just created the
variable X and we assign it the value X
which is a string so X variable is now a
string type and it has a value of x so
let's change this value and we'll say
this is a crappy name for a variable so
it's still of string type and it has a
value of this is a crappy name for a
variable if I wanted to ever find out
what type a a variable is I could simply
say print and then inside parentheses
I'll say type and then inside another
set of parentheses I give it the
argument so my argument is the X
variable so this is actually interesting
because we have one function which
the print function which takes an
argument of another function that it
that takes an argument of the actual
variable a string type variable that has
this value so you really have to just
try this on your own so you can
understand it it's simple enough once
you actually see it a few times but it
is a little bit confusing if this is the
first time you've ever started
programming so let's go ahead and run
this program right now and all we did
was we said hey I want you to print the
type of whatever X is and you'll see
that Python saying hey it's of type
string now what if I wanted to try to
turn X 2 and int I could simply say I
could even cast it right here I could
say type and then int and then another
set of parentheses and I'm actually
casting it to an int now this isn't
going to work because this value can
never be an int it's not a valid number
it's not a valid integer so we run that
you can see it's not base 10 it means
dude that's that's a friggin like
sentence it's never gonna be an integer
I mean this this is math we're talking
about this isn't some craziness but what
if I took this and I turned it to a
one-hour 21 I just missed type table 21
will work and that is a string value of
21 but that can be safely casted over to
an integer so when we run the program
you can see that it is now of type ends
so that's why I need to pound it into
you guys his head that everything in
Python is an object and objects have
functions and the functions take
arguments and then they they pass back
values and everything every value and
python has a type and the only two types
we've looked at so far is either integer
or string and that's all I want to get
into in this video because honestly
it might seem like such a minor thing
but you really need to understand the
difference between functions what a
function argument is and then what a
variable is and the fact that a variable
can have a value which is in this case
21 which is a string value so it's of
type string so anyway those are really
just you know five special key words
along with you know the actual function
name which is a built-in type
I'm sorry built-in function that comes
with the Python language to make your
programming endeavors much easier
hopefully I did a decent enough job of
just you know kind of glossing over the
fact that like I said Python has
functions they take arguments variables
have types and they also have values so
anyway guys thanks for watching and
please subscribe and I'll get into some
more stuff in the next video thank you
