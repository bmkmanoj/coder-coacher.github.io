about just givin a shout out of
appreciation coding tutorials 360 he did
a video the other day to his audience
where he talked about some of the his
favorite YouTube channels and he
mentioned mine and there I was actually
number one even though there wasn't any
any particular order yeah I feel like I
was number one anyway now I'm just gay
but I was mentioned on his his favorite
channels list that was pretty awesome so
thank you to coding tutorials 360 in his
channel dude I don't really have like
yeah I don't know his real name like his
first and last name if he actually
shares that or not but anyway guys make
sure you guys check him out also just
you know everybody that's that's helped
me out along the way you know all the
really all all my subscribers and
everything I appreciate every one of you
guys also though coding phase he did a
video in response to a video that I
created so it's like it's pretty cool
you know like you could see like he's
he's answering he so he spent 20-some
minutes um responding and in providing
advice and had some pretty sound advice
and everything there so so thank you to
him as well it makes you guys check out
his channel also got a mention
traversée media so he's actually a fan
of my channel and it's pretty awesome
for somebody that has you know more than
twice the amount of subscribers that I
had I haven't and he's certainly blown
up like he does he does with tutorials
what I've wanted to do but yeah they
just I would love to be able to keep up
with with his quality and his you know
any of the amount of content he's able
to put out but I really can't so I'm
fully comfortable saying that traversée
media does tutorials right and that if I
could just kind of scope my channel to
be somewhat similar to him if I were
gonna do tutorials which is still I'm
kind of on the fence about and then you
know his channel would definitely be
something I would want to model after
and and by the way when I say you know
on the fence about the one satori I
think I'm never gonna stop doing
tutorials but basically what I've done
to date and what I feel like has has
worked well although it hasn't worked
with any sort of like uniformity is just
you know doing things as I see fit so as
I get motivation I'll do a video and
things like that the problem is is that
I've had
I've had a rough year like this has been
a rough year I think you know in 2018
I'll probably be able to reflect more
and talk about what's happened to me
this year
but there's certainly tidbits of advice
and things like that I can certainly
express to you guys which I'm trying to
give it some time though but there's
been a lot of things just going on in my
life you know from different jobs to
just dealing with a lot of different you
know financial things and things like
that that hit you all at once and it
just seems like it's kind of that when
it rains it pours mentality but I have a
lot to be grateful for it I think that
you know just I need to focus on being
positive and whatever not but I'll be
able to share more on I feel like you
know what has been my experience in 2017
you know more probably next year any
more time to kind of I think just kind
of focus on you know how to kind of
convey in a certain private matters in a
very public forum also thank you to my
my eight patrons so that is that is
awesome that I actually have people that
donate to this channel so yeah it's nine
bucks whatever dude it's still nine
dollars that somebody like somebody has
taken their their time and they're like
dude and this twenty five hundred a
month here this is something when I set
up when I first did it in fact I was
following John Thomas by the way John
Samas he was actually he shared a story
the other day about that he was actually
in Vegas and including at the Mandalay
Bay where the shooting occurred in Vegas
like 10 minutes before it happened or
somewhere near that but a simple
programmer is definitely a channel you
guys should check out as well in fact
he's the only channel I've actually
collaborated with you know across
channels and and I get those like to
Cody soil 360 and Cody phase and a lot
of you guys have have asked me to collab
herring herring as well
King herring his name in fact I
mentioned his channel as well because
he's also a fan so king herring is here
and he uh he everyone swell comment or
send an email he's like hey do you open
a club things like that dude no offense
to anybody out there but like I am
number one I'm shy number two I'm busy
as and number three I'm afraid to
say the wrong you know live I mean
it is as up as that seems like
that is just the truth of today
I've warned you guys about going on you
know if somebody asked me a
question like I might answer it you know
truthfully that's a problem you know you
can't be truthful in anything basically
you need anything that's controversial
you keep your opinions to yourself so
you're not gonna convince people to
think it you know differently and things
like that for the most part so just
don't even waste the time it's not it's
certainly not you know worth like you
know sacrificing your career over trying
to convince somebody that like abortion
is wrong or abortion is right or you
know it's just there's no time for any
of that like there's just you vote with
your conscious conscience I guess and
then you just hope for the best because
in this world in this day and age in
this world man is worse than 1984
because everything we do and say on
social media is amplified and like you
know thinks can easily be spun out of
out of context and out of control and
everything so anyway but with King King
airing just mentioning him because he
always asked me to kind of collab and
things like that so even features
my channel that's a damn nice thing to
do man I didn't even know he was doing
that damn
alright well yeah so dude you can't you
King Harry I should I should collab with
him you know I think once again that is
like those are the three main reasons
why don't it really boils down to the
first two like the thirds kind of kind
of you know kind of me throwing in like
an extra thing but any that really isn't
like the I don't think the make-or-break
type of thing like I know how to control
myself obviously I go to work every day
and I can avoid you know getting fired
for saying blasphemous things and this
is a obviously simple programmer I
mentioned him John some as this is this
guy I really like man and and our
connection kind of goes back to where
people started kind of connecting our
few channels a long time ago years ago I
mean I remember like when I first saw
John's channel like I just thought like
I thought he was like some weight lifter
or whatever I had no idea that like that
this dude like had you know multiple
like 50 Pluralsight courses where he
netted over a million dollars just on
Pluralsight alone and that he had worked
for HP and had a you know best-selling
book for soft skills in fact a book that
was recommended to me by a guy that I
work with and I'm like oh yeah that's
John yeah John wrote that it's my buddy
yeah we collabed on our channel says
that's cool man like it's just cool
there you know than anybody would be now
this is one guy
Stephen Misook I don't worry I'm just
fine yeah he's a good guy - man I've
checked out his stuff recently he
probably doesn't even know who I am
and but you know I've I've looked at his
stuff so he's on you know these related
channels or whatever so I'm just kidding
I wanted to throw in a joke there but
it's not really a joke I don't know
Stefan or Stefan anyway I've checked out
some of his videos don't know I
pronounced his name but I have checked
out his his his videos before I know I
think he's pretty good in the fact that
he's older off some of my guys so people
still pay attention to him even though
he's older you know as I get older like
eventually Hawks man he's not gonna look
for working 25 anymore he's gonna look
like he's 40 and what happens when
Hawkes looks 40 that's where I need to
start you know using all the years of
experience that I have to be like hey
dude I know how this thing works
like you guys watch me and I can you
know show you the tips that I've learned
and you know that's why I'm like man
like so with age right age doesn't
necessarily mean that you're completely
worthless right I mean like II like the
computer guy one of the reasons why I
love you like the computer guy is just
that like you could just tell he's got
so much experience like he's been in the
military things like that he's just he's
been around the block a time or two you
know unfortunately with Eli I think he's
you know he's he's battling this whole
YouTube ecosystem and trying to figure
out what he wants to do with it like he
kind of turned it into a full-time job
and and as we know that YouTube can just
pull the rug out under you at any moment
it's not really their fault like they're
just trying to do whatever they can to
keep their platform you know keeping the
the money rolling in with you know by
keeping avatar advertisers friends you
know being friendly to advertisers and
you know it's somebody like Eli gets
kind of caught up in that whole thing
because he doesn't do like a video a
week or you know like like fun fun
function like he'll do a video one video
a week and spend some time editing it
and things like that and and his stuff
can be can be really good - because he
does it that way but then there's like
you know the Eli the guy that can go off
the cuff into a webcam for two
hours and like talk your ear off for two
hours I've never once watch Eli for a
full two hours like I don't know who can
but I have like I have found myself like
coding away and stuff like that and like
listening to him for 45 to an hour you
know so he's the kind of guy I can put
on the back
I've been told you know people say the
same thing about my channel although my
videos are not nearly as long but yeah
definitely definitely
Eli the computer guy like finally there
is amigos Manny these this new rap group
man like we haven't seen a rap group in
forever right I mean what was the last
rap group we've had do you like I look
back at rap groups I'm like Bone Thugs
like what are we doing like I mean now
you got the migos man representing atl
like I mean they I don't know man like
for whatever reason like I do quavo
offset take off dude those three guys
that they they just like they
have ridiculous town they really do and
I'm glad that you know the masses kind
of agree with that because these guys
these guys are set for life like this
dude right here offset he bought his mom
a house and everything so I love seeing
people do well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
