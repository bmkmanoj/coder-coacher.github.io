basic application here just a button in
the center I want to go ahead and load
an image that I have in my project
folder right here this goes jpg image
and what we want to do in our define I
net you I method we're first going to go
ahead and create a container object to
which it will hold the image and we do
that by saying we'll call it h box
equals a QT GUI dot q h box layout and
then we'll just feed self as the
argument and i will create our image map
equals QT GUI dot Q and it's going to
pixmap for image and this is what we're
just going to go ahead and link to where
the image is located and it's right now
in my root directory so I can just say
goes jpg next we're going to create a
label and a label by default it aligns
left and also aligns a vertically center
so i'll show you in just a second what
that means but I'm go ahead and say
label is QT GUI dot Q label and once
again we're going to say self and now we
want to say label dot set pixmap and
this is going to be the image map that
we just created and then we'll say label
actually before I set the alignment I do
want to show you something so now we
just need to say to our layout object
which we called H box and we'll say add
widget and we'll add the label that we
just created
so when we do that you're going to see
that the image is on the left hand side
over here now if I want to actually and
like I said before by default layout
puts objects on the is left aligned and
then Center vertically vertically
centered so that's what this image is
showing here so now if I want to
actually move it on the top right in
order for that to be able to get move we
need to import something that you're
going to use a lot within pie side and
what it is is on we're going to say from
PI side import cutie core and QT core
has a lot of stuff that you can use to
actually align stuff so we can align our
label before we add it to the layout
object there so we're going to say set
alignment and there's all kinds of stuff
that we can set it to but we need to do
first is QT core which we just imported
cutie dot a line and you can see a line
absolute that would actually put Tom
left on line bottom Center horizontally
center at least I think that's what that
is honestly I don't know but I want to
go out in a line right
and when we start the application you
can see that the image is on the top
right alright guys thanks for watching
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
