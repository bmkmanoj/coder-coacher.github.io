should I be a programmer this question
has been posed or raised by a lot of
different people and they all have the
same question about whether or not you
know they can be a programmer if they
suck at math and what I'm trying to tell
you today is that you can be a
programmer if you suck at math but one
of the good things about math is that
there are many free resources out there
that you can learn from in order to be
good enough to be a very good programmer
even if you're doing complex
mathematical programming you could still
accomplish that goal one of the things
about math and my opinion is that when
it like when I go back to my earlier
days in grade school I was always one of
the better mathematical students in my
class because I followed the
instructions I understood how to solve
problems and I was able to solve the
problems no problem the kids that
struggled in my opinion were the ones
that tried to not understand the core
foundations of how to solve the problem
so that you know they they would you
know slack on that area and then of
course they wouldn't be able to solve
the problem correctly because in math
you're either right or you're wrong
the the thing about math is that not
everybody sucks at math in fact I would
say that nobody sucks at math the people
that suck at math are the ones that give
up and they stop trying there are
certain people that are going to learn
mathematical concepts faster than others
that's you know normal there's also
people that are going to be able to
crunch those numbers in their head
because they think more logically with
numbers and other people do in fact some
people some of the greatest
mathematicians were absolutely insane so
you could argue that you don't want to
be that way but the so there's visual
learners and then there's that you know
the logical people that are just you
know naturally good with numbers inside
their head and they just have those
gifts but the thing about math is that
you just need to understand the core
concepts right of how to solve the
problem now if you do suck at math
there's all kinds of different resources
and and you could get up to date as you
know as quickly as you want so one of
the resources I do want to share and
just you know you guys may already know
this but math comm has been around for a
long time it's a relatively basic
plain-looking website but the concepts
there you know they date back now
probably more than a decade or something
like that as far as when this site was
first put up and it's all very good and
it's very for
and you can't beat that so one of the
sites that I do want to mention you can
see it's actually advertised here this
is L in fact they're headquartered in
Northern Virginia this website is more
for I wouldn't say children but it's
more visually presented so people that
like colors and they don't like the
boringness of math comm this site is
very good now the downside though is
that it is not free so the if you are
some sort of you know somebody that
likes to you know the colors and it does
visual presentations and stuff and just
has the better UI that this is a good
site to check out we all know about Khan
Academy Khan Academy was started by
Solomon Khan the the Harvard graduate I
believe and you know he gets some
criticism for being a basically a
self-taught educator so even though he's
highly educated himself he never got a
teaching degree or anything like that
and he's actually teaching millions of
people how to how to program or how to
do math and and study history and things
like that and and you know I guess you
know in some ways you know rightfully so
people are gonna criticize that because
the internet allows you to be able to do
that but but here's a newsflash I mean
this is something that is is taking
storm across the entire web people are
teaching other people how to do stuff
YouTube taught me how to fix my car and
literally pull out transmissions out of
my car and things like that they teach
you how to fix boat engines it teaches
you how to fix electronics and how to
program and I mean and most of this
stuff is coming from people that are in
the trenches because if we're honest
with ourselves some of the professors
that are teaching some of these subjects
they don't even know what they're
talking about from a real business sense
like for instance when I when I was
taking business courses and IT courses
from my Community College business
degree some of the concepts there they
were talking about buzzwords and things
like that from like three and a half
four years ago and then they were trying
to apply those concepts in ways that
make no real sense you know and and the
from what you see in the trenches day in
and day out not just in business but as
a programmer so in some ways you know
professors you know they may be great at
teaching but you know if they're not in
the trenches with us in the real
business environments that you know that
there's nothing wrong with getting
education from the people that are in
that that field so
if you're programming some of the best
ways to learn how to program is like
peer programming you're looking at the
way your peers are actually you know
writing code and solving problems and
and your peers aren't necessarily
educated or have certification or
teaching degrees and things like that so
I think we're going to continue to see
this kind of revolution in fact the
writings been on the wall so much that
we've now seen Coursera get brought up
in Coursera has you know the backing of
venture capitalists and now you have all
these different major universities some
of the best universities in the entire
world are actually providing courses on
Coursera but the problem with Coursera
is that it basically says here you can
you can study some of this material and
here you can have all this stuff for
free but you're on your own we're not
gonna help you individually and unless
you pay like five or six hundred bucks
for the certification you're not even
gonna be allowed to take a test and be
graded on or anything like that so
Coursera is obviously trying to make
money to make this you know they're
trying to capitalize on this whole
education wave that's that's popping up
online and and for for the most part
it's still really good because you can
learn a lot of this stuff for free but
at the same time it sucks because of the
sink-or-swim thing and you're on your
own and you know even though you do it
pays six or seven hundred bucks for a
certification from Duke University it's
not a true certification from Duke
University it's like a Coursera
certification that you paid six or seven
hundred bucks for and some some some
companies out there may not hold the
certification any sort of high esteem or
anything like that even though they
should but the point is is that these
certifications are what you make of them
you know so if I created a class and
started doing certifications my
certification is going to be kind of the
same thing it's it's worth the paper
that it's printed on it's it's only over
a period of time does that paper become
valued and I guess we're yet to see what
kind of value Coursera is going to
provide but I do know that it's kind of
expensive and and that's kind of a
turn-off for me personally just because
I don't I don't feel like it's necessary
for me to spend that much time in a
subject pay seven hundred bucks and then
you know get very little feedback and
then have a certification that may not
be accepted somewhere else so basically
as far as certifications go I would hope
to have a cheaper certification than
what much
the certifications on Coursera being
offered so one of the things I do want
to just just yeah I guess make sure I
pronounce is that I don't think anybody
sucks at math math is a universal
language it goes back to the BC days the
people that suck in math are the ones
that just forgot how to solve the
problems or never learned how to solve
the problems right to begin with math
kind of sucks because you do have to
follow steps in order to solve problems
I hate math when it comes to learning
too I hate math in the sense that I hate
having to learn how to solve a problem
in math like so if I if there's some
specific way that I have to solve some
algebraic question or something like
that that's the kind of stuff that kind
of annoys me because I want to be able
to just skate through it and math is not
a subject that you can just skate
through and your way through
there are many courses I've taken in my
life where I can skate through it
literary analysis and things like that I
can just I can my way through
it and I can still get a good grade in
math if you don't know how to solve the
problem you're gonna be wrong most of
the time unless some sort of multiple
choice and then you have a 25% chance of
getting it right assuming there's four
questions so with math though I mean I
don't think anybody talks it's it's the
universal language of the web different
cultures you know we all have math and
and math has been driven forward by all
the different cultures and in countries
and civilizations and and you know from
ancient times to advanced times and
basically I would say that you can still
be a good programmer even if you don't
have some of those math concepts down I
don't think that you should just sit on
your laurels and not do anything about
it I think that you should try to take
advantage of these free resources and
try to make sure that you don't try to
run before you learn it and learn how to
crawl because programmers they love to
do that they love to start getting into
things just you know quickly try to see
how they can make money with it or how
they can make their product better and
and they don't truly understand the
foundations behind it because there's so
much there you know there's some new
framework out every day so you know with
programming we can sometimes hack
together a working solution and that may
be good enough for what we're trying to
do but in math you can't really hack
together your your understanding of how
to solve problems so I mean I would just
if you're gonna learn a concept make
sure you get it down you know spend a
few days with it make sure you have a
few days rest before you go back and
make sure you understand those concepts
before just trying to immediately jump
into the next thing because of math if
you don't use it you lose it
but you know it's it's a process so as
we I think as we spend more time in it
it'll become easier to relearn stuff and
learn more advanced subjects all right
guys let me know what you think and
please subscribe have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
