so one of the things I was thinking
about the other day is that all right so
say hypothetically there's this company
right and they're a small company you
know that they're a small operation that
they probably don't have a lot of money
but say they might be interested in your
services and and they want to hire you
right and you kind of know that they're
small right and and you know what you're
worth as a set as a as a programmer I
mean obviously you can base that you
know on market research if you're just
looking at the area that you live in and
what the jobs are paying or if you just
compare it to you know what you're
currently being paid whenever by your
current employer but so one of the
interesting things is like a lot of
people will tell you when you're
applying for a job in that situation
like you never want to mention money you
don't want to mention money right off
the bat because then it makes you know
makes them think that you're just all
about the money and that's all you care
about but if we're all relatively honest
with ourselves I mean who's working for
free like who's working you know who
like who doesn't care about money when
it comes to having a job like I mean I'm
sure that there's a couple of examples
but you know most of us probably aren't
like saving the world and feeding the
poor you know we may we may try or
whatever but the fact of the matter is
most most the time when you're thinking
of working for somebody like you want to
make sure that that they're gonna be
able to afford you right you want to
make sure they're gonna pay you what you
expect to be paid so you know is there
anything really wrong with bringing that
up in the forefront like if you have if
you have if you're a suspect 'full that
a company is not gonna be able to afford
you like shouldn't you just let them
know right away instead of you know
beating around the bush or going through
some sort of long drawn-out process
where they they then find out that they
they can't afford you on that they can
and maybe even come close so it's like I
really don't think in this day and age
with websites like glass or why is my
dog eating grass they say what's wrong
you got tummy ache
I've read that dogs do that because they
want to throw up
but I've also read that there's other
reasons why they do it too although
actually my wife was telling me that and
I didn't pay attention than what that
was but anyway so yeah so why you know
with companies and websites that exists
out there like glass door and indeed.com
and granted some of that those numbers
can be pledged by the people to enter
the data but if if all that data is
available to us and we know you know
what the market rate is for a senior
program or whether it's c-sharp or
JavaScript or something like that in the
DC area or the Richmond area C I live in
a city that's in between two major
metropolitan areas I mean Richmond
Virginia which is the capital of
Virginia which is pretty big I mean it's
definitely well over a million people
it's probably top 25 City I would think
or maybe top 15 but um and then you have
DC right which is a major metropolitan C
powerhouse city when it comes to money
because they're you know federal
government is up there and anywhere the
federal government is you're gonna have
government projects and those are
billion-dollar projects and and there's
all these you know major IT firms that
are in like military defense spending
like building missiles and radar systems
and everything like so you're gonna have
a ton of those jobs up in DC but so all
that information is available to us so
we want to find out you know what the
going rate is and for the most part you
know what people are filling out is
relatively accurate I mean I can see
that based on you know what I've seen
personally in the market but if you have
a company that has shown interest and
and you feel like they can't afford you
you might as well just get that out of
the way right away right so I'm curious
what you guys think about that
if anybody has experience in that I mean
I did I did some reading up on it and
read about you know some people's
accounts of actually you know hiring
managers and human resource officials
that you know that that said you know
they basically spoke for both sides of
the equation saying that you know it's a
turn-off for them if somebody
immediately asked about money and then
other people are like well it saves us
time I mean I don't say this saves time
but for both sides so I really don't see
anything wrong with it
you
now another thing too is like whenever
you're ever even considering the
prospect of leaving I mean the longer
you're with a company the harder it
becomes to ever to ever leave I mean a
lot of companies they have incentives
built in where you they started offering
you more time off from work so you'll
get more vacation your salary you know
typically increases each year if you're
doing a decent job and you know there's
just and then you start becoming
comfortable I mean with the surroundings
around you and everything so I think it
becomes difficult because a lot of these
companies they're not very forthright
with like okay how many days off do you
get I mean I've seen some companies
where you know the salaries are really
high but then they're like well you get
15 paid days off a year and 15 is like
for vacation for sick leave for personal
for everything and really when you you
know look at that that's not very much
compared to some of the larger companies
some of the larger companies out there I
mean they're doing three weeks right off
the bat and then you can earn like a
fourth week or even a fifth week and
then a lot of companies have like
floating holidays and then paid holidays
and and for the most part though when
you're seeing some of these applications
you're not actually seeing you know the
specific benefits laid out so that's
another thing too it's like well why go
through the entire process of talking to
some company if they number one are like
tens of thousands of dollars away from
the salary that you're looking for and
and then even if they could meet the
salary that you're looking for what it's
like the benefits are completely lacking
compared to what you have currently and
really the the whole situation seems to
be fixed more towards the people that
are out of work and desperate I guess
because whenever you're already employed
that you have so much greater advantage
of being able to talk to these companies
because I mean if you care less if they
can't meet your requirements then I mean
you already have a job so it's not a big
deal so anyway that's my thought I don't
I don't think that I think I don't think
anything should be wrong with just
coming up and being pretty forefront
about it and just being like look you
know this is what I'm gonna need
to even consider a move and you know why
not because both sides would benefit
from not having their time wasted
alright guys let me know what you think
have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
