just wanted to give you guys some
initial thoughts on a project that I've
been working on just something out of my
own curiosity to kind of discuss with
you guys number one I was just me I was
mainly curious just to see where we are
but what I did is that we've often we've
often talked about whether or not you
need a degree in the profession of IT
and and some of my initial analysis that
I've done is that I looked at jobs
websites and I looked at quite a few and
I looked at quite a few jobs so so far I
don't have any sort of finished product
or anything like that but what I did is
I searched over a hundred and eighty
some thousand jobs IT job is really with
the title developer in it so I suppose
it's not a hundred percent IT but for
the most part it's like probably well
into the upper ninety percent accurate
that you know it means an actual program
or developer and then I started parsing
through every single one of those jobs
to see how many of those positions in
the United States right now required a
degree so I looked for a lot of
different keywords like computer science
and well I like CS degree or bachelor or
just even degree and if it didn't have
any of those mentioning Xin it then I
went ahead and I store to the side so I
wanted to share some of the initial
estimates with you and so it's roughly a
hundred and eighty thousand jobs
searched and of those 180 thousand jobs
matches were in the amount of twelve
thousand five hundred and thirty-two so
that means all the jobs that I was able
to search just initially and obviously I
did this I automated it so there could
be some some bugs and everything we're
looking at twelve thousand five hundred
and thirty-two open developer positions
in the United States right now that do
not require a college degree now that
seems like it's good news because you
like 12,000 jobs across the United
States but it actually sucks because if
you compare that to the overall you know
180 or almost 190,000 jobs that I
searched then you're looking at pretty
much that's about
seven percent or so so roughly seven
percent of all IT jobs in the United
States are willing to hire without a
college degree at least you know they
don't specifically mention that you must
have the college degree so of the other
ninety three percent that does require a
college degree there's probably some
exceptions to the rule there I mean in
some cases they may have even stated you
know if you haven't like the equivalent
I didn't starch for equivalent this this
was just simply of of those 190,000 jobs
I say hundred eighty i think was a
hundred and eighty eight thousand i
don't know why the hell hundred eighty
eight thousand jobs okay so of that 188
there could be the situation where like
they're like you know the equivalent
which means that you have four years
experience or something like that so I'm
sure there's quite a bit of those cases
but either way if you just have just
simply the fact that only seven percent
don't ask for it all together that's
just not a very good figure I don't
understand it either because why would a
piece of paper be so much more important
than real world experience why would
just just because I don't have a degree
I can't crunch through 190,000 jobs
looking for jobs that don't have a
degree i mean could i have done that
better weather college degree maybe i
don't know i mean what if I automate the
entire process of sending out resumes
for other people and stuff like that ax
me does that mean I'm not good enough to
be a programmer to be able to automate
stuff or extract data from a database
because I don't have a piece of paper
saying that i took some computer science
courses I don't know man that's Nick
that kind of sucks i'm not sure where
all this has come about but it seems
like there is a definite definite i know
i wouldn't say hostility but there is a
there is a precedent being set that says
that if you don't have a college degree
you're not playing ball i mean and
that's in the IT field and maybe maybe
people are getting into positions that
they're hiring these developers and you
know they have such a bone to pick
because they maybe got their degree and
other people didn't and i think anybody
that went through and got their degree
for a hundred thousand dollars or
whatever they pay
and the time and effort to get their
education they probably don't want to
see somebody that used to be a truck
driver or a plumber doing the same thing
that they do even if they can do it just
as well as they can they don't want to
see it probably because they you know
they paid a hundred thousand dollars for
their education I'm not sure what you
guys this opinion is on that I would
like to hear back from you guys and I'd
like to hear from people that actually
have the degree like I'm not actually
saying that it's not necessary or that
you shouldn't get your degree or
anything like that in fact I've told
everybody based on like I said this
president being set by all these
different employers around the united
states that people should go out and get
their degree because it's not going to
get any easier at least it would seem
and i don't i don't agree with it and i
think its myself but I'd like to hear
from you know the other side because
I've also seen where companies are like
they don't give a shit where your degree
is mom it can be from one of the worst
schools in the Midwest you know and it
can be like bottom five percent of all
colleges in the Midwest and they still
care about that computer science degree
in some cases they care about a
bachelor's degree and a question
question what is that like with the
horses or something I've seen people in
business that I heard the degrees in
horses and horticulture and all this
other stuff and like like I said one of
the best programmers I've ever worked
with actually had an art degree so I
think people should lighten up just a
little bit if somebody has the
experience and they can show hey I just
gamed your entire system and I didn't
get actually get a degree or whatever
like maybe you should give that person a
chance that's all I'm saying anyway guys
i'll let i'll release more of this this
information to hipster code eventually i
plan on adding an entire jobs directory
essentially where you can search hipster
code for actual companies that don't
require that you have the degree among
other things too it's not like that's
only going to be the case but i don't
see any other job sites that say you can
filter based on that criteria i see too
many job sites that have so many
positions listed over and over and over
again and i would like to be able to
solve that problem but i don't have a
ton of free time in order to to to
handle this but I did write the scrapers
that actually went through and
parsed all these jobs in a relatively
short period of time I mean literally a
matter of like I thought I thought it up
yesterday I wrote the program in just a
couple of hours of you know debugging
and working through it and came back
today to find one hundred eighty eight
thousand jobs parsed and twelve thousand
five hundred thirty-two open positions
without a college degree being asked for
alright guys thanks for watching and let
me know what you think take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
