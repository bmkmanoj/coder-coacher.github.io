talking about being busy as a programmer
and it's one of those things that we're
gonna be faced with as professionals not
just as a programmer but you know
obviously any profession and this
channel kind of borders not long not
just programming advice but also general
advice that I've learned along the way
and you guys obviously love to hear me
blab so my thoughts though about being
busy is the other day I was talking to
my little brother and he's 23 and he was
um he's he's he was talking about going
back to school and and how stressful
that was because he ends up he has a
full-time job so he's only like 40 45
hours a week but no kids not married
still lives at home with his parents so
he doesn't even have half the
responsibilities that I had when I
actually decided to go back to school
after I got my first white-collar job
that's when I actually decided to go to
school for business and and when I did
that I I had to go at night so I would
work all day and then I would sometimes
have to hang around work for an hour
hour and a half something like that
waiting for my class to start and I
would drive over to my class in some
cases I had the class at my work but I
would wait you know hours to just get to
the class to then have to partake in the
class for you know several hours because
I always did once a week classes if I if
I actually met in person most of the
time I try to go online because I simply
just don't have the time but I would do
the you know at least one or once a week
meeting classes which means that the
class is longer but the logistics of
getting to the class is just once a week
versus multiple times a week and in that
case like it was just the longest day
though because I had a wife two kids a
mortgage pets long commute all that and
I was still able to go to work in fact
even at that time I was working
full-time and also owning my own
business so I'm not saying that it's
it's it's like perfect because it's not
a perfect situation from there I was
also able to self teach myself how to be
a programmer so that it's I was going to
school during that time but like there
was definitely like when I was teaching
myself how to be a programmer I was
spending more time doing that and I
did on school I was I was a good father
like there's no I don't have any regrets
about any of that stuff so even during
the time when I was at my busiest like I
I attended every one of my for instance
like okay my son played baseball a
couple years ago so he's on his team I
was helping with the practices so every
single practice I was there with my son
I was like third base coach first first
base coach just helping out but I was
there for every practice every game and
then in addition to that I also practice
with them in the back yard every night
so there are certainly times that I
regret you know things that I didn't do
with my children or I didn't do with my
wife things like that
but at the same time like I know how
hard the real world you know really is I
know what the struggle is like and how
difficult it is to not just take care of
yourself but also have to take care of a
wife and two children and things like
that
so it's difficult a lot of programmers
will tell you like don't don't get you
know don't get married don't don't
listen to that but so just like with so
many different professions being a
programmer is actually much more than
just writing code one thing I found
being a senior it's actually a lot of
emotional intelligence comes into play
when you talk about leadership
management maintaining projects being
able to just keep your composure
especially during like an agile process
where like the entire project is
completely up but like you just
kind of know that it's going to come
together over time and like I've seen a
lot of junior developers really
struggled with that scenario where it's
like the sky is falling I used to be
that way actually a lot of people can
vouch for that but the sky is falling
everything's nothing's working right
nothing's going to like we're never
going to meet our deadlines everything
seems completely hopeless and now I look
at some of those situations and I've
been in projects where like it has been
it seemed it seemed hopeless and it
turned out it was hopeless
and then there's other projects where
like it seemed hopeless but it wasn't
like we just needed some more
information and and things started
coming together a lot of the times too I
found as a senior developer compared to
when I was junior I now look at the team
and what they can contribute
and I don't try to take on more
responsibility than I need to I spend
more time making sure that other people
have responsibilities instead of
actually me trying to take on everything
whereas I still see juniors around me
and I was the same way where I wanted to
be able to try to control and maintain
as much of the project as I could and
here like I need to rely upon like now
in my senior status I feel like I rely
upon experts from the team like if I
have database questions I want my
database expert to be involved somehow
someway if I don't have a date a
database expert then I'm going to get
probably the most senior person I can
find to be responsible for dealing with
the data and the domain model and so you
know I just I look for people that have
expertise and I think that you know
that's clearly what you want to do in
like a leadership or management role but
it's um it's definitely something that
I've learned along the way
so being busy as a programmer is going
to it's going to be something that just
follows you around in this industry
you're gonna be busy I can tell you
though if I can balance a full-time job
a business a mortgage kids and when I'm
talking about kids I'm talking about you
parent-teacher conferences I'm talking
about medical bills and doctor's office
visits and stuff and having to take off
time from work to be able to deal with
that stuff I'm talking about you having
to deal with your own personal issues
and health issues and stuff and
 I can hit that out of the
park
so the thing is is like you can let it
get you down and and you can start
getting caught up in the moment of all
the of all the things that you have to
do and I can tell you my life is way
busier than it's ever been but I still
feel good about everything I really do I
feel sometimes like there's too much to
handle and when I feel like that I
literally just don't don't ponder it I
don't even think I don't even think
about all the stuff that I need to be
doing when I'm in that position I'll
write down one particular task or I'll
look at my little calendar and I'll say
okay I mean let me try to knock this
thing out or you know what I said I was
going to do this today I'm gonna do it
tomorrow
you know it's like you don't want to put
off tomorrow what you can do today but
sometimes you enough to do that so
anyway that's just the day in
life of Chris Hawkes man it's a busy
world it's a busy life for me and I'm
sure you guys are just as busy as well
but the thing is is that I worked my ass
off and it's paid off and I definitely
appreciate that if you guys work your
ass off to like there's gonna be some
sort of payoff in the end all right take
care Mike so this video was brought to
you by a dead mountain coding boot camp
