want to talk about why concurrency is
hard and concurrent based programming
just so you guys know is that processors
nowadays have multiple cores right so
you always get like your quad core i7 as
like four cores or something like that
so processors themselves as a as a unit
on a whole are not getting faster
they're not getting more and more
gigahertz like they were you know ten
years ago that we saw you know core
processors continually got faster and
faster like single processors so instead
of making a single processors faster and
faster there's been more of a focus on
just adding more cores to the processing
power of the computer so just so you
guys know the CPU is processing power
it's like the brain of your computer
it's how many concurrent processes that
can be run at the same time and things
like that so typically with like a quad
core if you write programs in a
concurrent manner where each you know
each processes is or each thread is is
spun up and is operating on a different
processing core you could run you know
for complicated tasks simultaneously so
I love this this this this comment here
that I found off of a programmer Stack
Exchange right here he says you know so
why is concurrency hard this guy you
know he says bring three people in the
room preferably with different accents
and have them explain different
overlapping parts of a problem of
concurrency concurrently so if that
makes any sense
basically concurrency is very very
difficult and I have a demonstration I
just kind of want to show you based on a
situation that often occurs and you may
you know think that it doesn't occur
very often but it ultimately does
because programming is hard programming
is complex and as larger programs get
built this most certainly comes into
play if you're not careful in designing
a multi or a parallel a good parallel
processing program so let me go ahead
and get into my demonstration
so to explain a race condition and how
this can be complicated with with
multi-threaded concurrent program that
you hear so much about with languages
like go and I'm using a sink in a weight
and you know multi-core concurrency me
here that's all you hear about it's the
rage nowadays right well one of the
issues and this is a good demonstration
that I think at least visually for me so
you have these three sandwiches right
and these three sandwiches are managed
by their own threads so that they can
run concurrently meaning that the
processes that make the sandwich
whatever sort of code is doing that you
could run it three times and it's run on
three separate cores that is building
three separate sandwiches at the same
exact time so you're obviously three
times faster than what you would be with
a normal you know sequential programming
order that you see in most programming
languages that aren't built in a
concurrent way and they're only making
use of one process or one core of your
CPU at a time however the issue comes
into play when you have a situation
where you have shared resources and
that's why I was just explaining so this
is a knife it's a terrible looking knife
but this is a knife and then this is a
butter tray so say these three
sandwiches that are built eventually
they're gonna need to access a shared
source so a shared memory location as
well and so this guy is gonna call the
knife while so let me let me do it a
drawing here all right so this guy is
gonna call the knife while this guy
calls the butter now once this guy calls
the butter he's gonna be like okay
where's the knife oh it's being used I
need to wait for it to be released this
guy's like where's the butter
oh it's being used by my partner down
here and I need to wait for him to
release the butter and then you run into
a situation where just nothing happens
so to prevent some of the problems that
occur with that model that I just
demonstrated a lot of people are
starting to give way to this actor model
right and the actor model there's a
project and net called a canet which
is relatively new but they use the actor
model that go programming language is is
pretty much using the actor model as
well so it handles concurrency for you
goes considered to be a higher level
than rust so rust is more of a lower
level systems language but that is also
handling the concurrent nature for you
as well although I haven't actually
messed with any of these languages too
much to actually give any sort of
educated opinion like from you know an
academia perspective but I can say that
if you are going to get into multi-core
programming you may want to check out
rust or go or the actor model and you
know whatever sort of like if you want
to use dotnet or C sharp or something
like that but you're in for a heck of a
time I think and ultimately if you want
to get good at parallel processing
you're going to be in the top tier the
top echelon of programmers if you're
able to to be a good data systems
architect and designing programs in a
way that are concurrent where you don't
end up having these race conditions and
situations like I just described so yeah
if you guys can figure it out you know
this is somewhat of a future wave of
programming and assuming you can get
there you guys can make major bank
somewhere alright guys thanks for
watching have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
