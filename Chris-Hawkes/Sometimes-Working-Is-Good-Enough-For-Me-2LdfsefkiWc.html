just wanted to take a moment to talk
about something that actually crosses my
mind quite a bit this is an example of
where I have a web pack in order to
compile all of my stuff down really it
doesn't compile but what it's doing it's
a module bundler so it takes all this
different code and it bundles it and
just conjoins it all into one big ass
file and in order to do that like you
have to set up a web pack config you
don't really have to be in most cases
people set up a web pack and fake to
actually give it the exact of the extra
arguments you need like babel loaders so
that way i say babel its babel so that
we Babel will babbles the actual
transpiler that takes modern-day
JavaScript and makes it work so it
changes it and then you end up having a
few of these plugins like es2015 which
is you know equus script 2015 which is
all the latest standards of JavaScript
so if you're writing in modern
JavaScript using classes and promises
and stuff like that then it'll be it'll
work because you have this this plug-in
and then obviously react will be able to
also work with um you know by having
this setting I could work with j sx code
so i can write and react jsx and all
this stuff and and have it all work and
it just bundles it down to one
javascript file that works now the thing
that i wanted to point out is that as
you can see my lazy ass has two separate
configs here i have one that's like a
quiz maker and then one that's like a
quiz and the quiz is the one that gets
displayed as the quiz and the other one
is just how i actually make was so it's
it's my own separate little private
thing that's not publicly accessible but
the thing i wanted to touch upon tonight
is that i think there is a trade-off
between how well do you need to
understand the tool in order to be an
expert with it vs let's just make a
temporary band-aid approach and just get
this bitch going so the example here is
that you can see that i have to once
commented out and one is not that way
when i run webpack watch depending on
whatever one is not commented out that's
going to be the one that gets built now
there is probably a way in web back that
I can bundle multiple modules at the
same time and and put them in their
place
and everything like that I'm sure that
there's a way but when i was looking at
this code tonight this was something i
wrote four or five months ago and I
remember when I wrote it I said head I
was thinking to myself that I I'm not
some webpack expert webpack is still
relatively new to me I'm not going to
spend a bunch of time trying to figure
out how to do what it is and I'm trying
to do because I've talked about it on
another video where I talk about
identifying the problem is sometimes a
problem and of itself like so
identifying specifically how to even
phrase like what I'm trying to do is
obviously something that's going to take
time I have to look I have to search the
documentation and you know it may be
beneficial I don't know but it's also
not very difficult to sit here and go
like this and press ctrl forward slash
and uncomment and control forward slash
and uncomment so is it really that big
of a deal do I need to spend two hours
trying to study webpack 1.18 you know so
i have to relearn how to do it or the
new way and one in 2.1 or whatever the
latest standard is there are certain
trade-offs that i find in programming
that it's not really widely discussed
there's going to be people that you end
up working with that are obsessive
compulsive types and I can be obsessive
compulsive about certain things as well
but the the I guess how do you phrase it
there are people that are just
douchebags really I mean and they want
to spend most of their time trying to
identify some sort of perfect standard
that that either strokes their ego or
that just you know clicks right in their
brain has to be like the one way of
being able to do it and then there's
people like me that's like a fuck it you
know I just need to get this thing
working like and ultimately ute typical
you want it working you want it bug free
but something like this is a very very
it's a very very minor thing so like how
much time do we possibly have to do we
need to spend in order to learn this and
the only reason why I'm talking about
tonight is like the amount of time I've
spent talking about it I could have
probably maybe found an answer I don't I
don't know or it could take me two hours
or six hours or six days
I have no idea you never know with
programming it couldn't even be a
situation where it's just not even
possible with webpack I would I refuse
to believe that you know something as
popular as web pack I'm sure has some
sort of easy way of doing this but the
point is is that I run 11 webpack watch
and i don't really i didn't really find
it necessary to have to compile down
multiple modules if i was working on the
quiz maker i'd be i would be watching
that one and if i was working on the
actual quiz i'd be working on that one
and watching that one so so for somebody
like me I'm not anal to the point where
I feel like it's necessary to have to
have everything perfectly set up and
working all the time sometimes if it
just works that's good enough for me so
I think you know that comes it's it's an
argument that can be made probably for
any situation but or it's it's not
really a valid argument for every
situation i should say but it's
something that every once in a while you
have to just make the decision to just
get the job done and move on right i
mean and besides how long is webpack
going to be around i'm sure the next
thing is going to be coming right around
the corner here any moment so those are
just my thoughts / tonight guys let me
know what you think have a good night
goodbye hey guys so a lot of you asked
me how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12 week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here and now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course is
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding boot camp and
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
