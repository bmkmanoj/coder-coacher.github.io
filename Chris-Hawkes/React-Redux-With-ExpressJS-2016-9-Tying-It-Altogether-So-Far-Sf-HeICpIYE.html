is the ninth video of this tutorial
series so we finally have redux
communicating with react and and all of
that is good and we're actually
displaying the current state but how do
we change that state and have everything
work the way of supposed to and in this
video we're actually going to talk about
that so in the first or in the last
video we actually created this this test
click dispatch method which actually
uses redux as dispatch to call the
counter actions that we imported at the
top and once again counter actions are
defined here which only has one action
type that can be called which is add and
if you call that then it's going to then
change and mutate the state of our Redux
application and add one to the counter
so that's what's going on here but how
do we actually get all that done first
things first let's add a button to this
JSX code in order to actually fire the
onclick event so we're just say on click
and then here we'll say this I'll click
and I will just call it click and then
just say find and then we're binding
this so this is the new way that we have
to actually call our or click methods
using the new class-based system within
react you have to use to bind otherwise
there is no context of this it'll be
lost
so we'll say click mean and I'll just
say button alright so now we have this
button on our page and we're gonna
create the actual function that we call
click which is a terrible name but we're
going to call it would just say click
open and close parenthesis and then
inside here we're gonna say this dot
props dot and this is what will
reference the name of this function that
we added to our dispatch props so I
could say this stop props not test click
and then here I need to pass in the
argument which is add so I'm telling
this that
actually you don't even need to pass
that in I'm sorry another pass in Jack's
right there my bad
all right so it's gonna call test click
which is down here and then it calls
this dispatch function passing in the ad
and that's gonna end up going to the
action the actions then gonna
communicate with the reducer it's gonna
modify the state react is gonna pick up
on the change state and it's going to
update this value here if everything
goes well otherwise I'm gonna throw a
temper temper tantrum I'm just kidding I
won't do that but here it is here's our
button and here's the moment of truth
let's click me and see if react Redux
and all this stuff that we've talked
about in this tutorial series ties
together in a dozen because counter is
not defined that sucks I was really
hoping that would work and um I know
exactly why that is but it's just it's
just funny because I was like I expect
that to work and it didn't work but
alright but that's just programming for
you the reason why is because it's
saying hey I don't know what counter is
right here counters actually attach the
state so I need a say state doc all
right you know it's not there god damn
it it's here where a counter is not
known says I don't know what counter is
I need as a state that counter so I
promise this should network that was
very anticlimactic all right so now when
I say click me and it works finally we
have react redux working together there
was a ton of boilerplate there is a ton
of work that is involved in getting web
pack and Babel and all that stuff
updated but this is the basic gist of
where I wanted to get you guys up to
date so that we can start you know
building react and redux projects things
get a lot more complicated from here
obviously but I think you have you know
the basic understanding of at least how
these things communicate you have the
reducer you have your actions you have
your actual components that are react
based that are also using some
additional things like dispatched
state 2 props and then also using things
like the Kinect which is part of the
react Redux project and then you have
how everything is like you know
referencing this stop props and yeah
just your simple your class-based system
so this is actually bleeding-edge I mean
it's it's using yes six standards to
build react components as opposed to the
es 5 standards there's not a lot of
documentation on this stuff in my
opinion so yeah we're there mistakes
made along the way so far yeah
absolutely but this is something that
you know like I said it wasn't for the
faint of heart I said that in the first
video and if you were able to follow
along all this time then I congratulate
you because you know I wouldn't have
blamed you if you would have just said
you know what this day does nobody's
talking about I'm outta here but you
know good luck you know finding out you
know a perfect document because I think
even Redux as documentation is
absolutely horrendous the way that they
try to tell you to get started on
everything so anyway guys thanks for
watching and hopefully I'll be able to
add more to this series but definitely
won't be able to do any more this
weekend thanks - have a good night bye
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in the Suevi course is geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
