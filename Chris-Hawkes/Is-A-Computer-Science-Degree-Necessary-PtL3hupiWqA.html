one that last video was grainy as a
mother I'm not going to say it
it was definitely grainy the video
sucked I'm sorry I actually realized
what I was doing wrong there another
thing too is that I've tried to see I
have this mic and like if I put it on my
desk sometimes you can hear the techies
tapping a little bit better so I got
this mic stand but at the same time the
mic stand the way my shits all situated
right here is that it becomes a little
bit more difficult to talk directly into
the microphone because it's kind of
sitting on the side so I know a few of
you guys have reported the sound seems
to be more on the left or the right side
or something like that so if you guys
could let me know if that's the case on
this video if you're actually watching
that would be awesome alright so a
couple of things I want to touch upon in
this video number one alright so a lot
of you guys responded that's awesome I
appreciate it one dude actually said
from Hampton Roads that's a shout out to
the weeping crane Joel Crandall
something like that anyway dude thanks
for watching the videos I appreciate it
but he says I live in the Hampton Roads
area of Virginia I've been working on
getting my comp TI a security plus
certification or to hopefully get my
foot in the door at a base level job for
just about any company I can find I want
to be a web designer as an ultimate goal
but I don't know if these certifications
will be enough I have connections with
certain companies out of VA Beach but
I've had no time to sharpen my skills in
html5 or j/s or CSS or any language that
would be somewhat necessary do you have
any ideas on a help desk IT job that
could let me get my foot in the door
without all these crazy certification
qualifications so number one okay so you
talked about the comp TI certification
I've never actually taken anything like
that in fact I don't even know what's
involved in that to be honest I should
probably look that up but I'm assuming
it's like learning Active Directory and
so I have no idea I'm just guessing but
the question is are you currently
working like and we talked about these
connections I mean can any of these
people get you in your in the door one
way shape or form doing anything in IT
for the company in some cases you can
get a job with a company
where you're not specifically doing IT
but they still have an IT operation you
can try to transition over to an IP IT
position you're within the company that
you're working for so if you can do that
I mean that would obviously be great but
I'm assuming you know you would have
already probably tried to get that going
if you could but one of the things I had
actually responded to you on this about
was that I don't know a whole lot about
Virginia Beach I was actually born there
which is which is cool you know
interesting I was born in Virginia Beach
and moved to Houston shortly after but
so I do go to Virginia Beach every so
often I I like to city down there I
actually thought about moving down there
at one point but one of the things that
keeps me in Northern Virginia is the
fact that there are a lot of jobs in
Northern Virginia I mean there's a lot
of companies headquartered in and around
the DC area so DC is considered somewhat
of an IT hub so there's a lot of IT
opportunity out here right but another
good thing about specifically Northern
Virginia is that depending on where you
are in Northern Virginia you can either
be halfway between Richmond and you know
in DC so I would think that there's a
greater IT presence and not just
Richmond and certainly there's a greater
IT presence in Northern Virginia and DC
and stuff like that so if it were me and
I was trying to get my foot in the door
like I'm curious whether or not you're
tied to the area you obviously probably
like Virginia Virginia Beach or the
Hampton Roads area but the question I
think is going to boil down to you do
you have like family and friends or kids
that are tying you to this area or can
you really start expanding your search
and trying to get you outside of this
this this comfort zone where you live
and and trying to find something that
you know whether it's in Dallas or some
other you know Austin or somewhere else
that that might have a greater
possibility one thing that I think
remains clear and I've said this before
just just the other day like two days
ago I heard on the news in the DC area
for this news channel I listened to and
and they were mentioning that like
something along the lines of 600,000 new
jobs that were created actually I don't
remember it I think it was much larger
than that don't remember but basically a
fraction of the new jobs that were
created
and IT were actually fulfilled by people
that didn't have a college degree so
most of them went to people with a
four-year bachelor's degree a
significant amount went to two years a
two-year degrees and then a much much
lesser percentage was apparently no
degree at all so you know I've said this
before but I think it's complete
 it really is I mean it's about
whether or not you can get the job done
and whether or not you're a good
programmer if if I was hitting the open
job market I have a pretty good
possibility that you know asking for the
salary that I would be asking for I
would I would imagine that I'd have a
hard time getting it number one because
you know maybe they'll look at my age or
number two they'll you know they'll be
like dude you don't have a degree what
are you doing asking for a hundred
thousand dollars like who do you think
you are you know so I think I think it's
complete I think honestly one
of us or all of us should get together
and start figuring out which companies
are you know are not hiring people
because of you know strictly a degree so
are you a you know incredible developer
that's created projects and run open
source projects and run websites from
your home and and have all this
real-world experience and still get
denied a job over some asshole who has a
degree I mean if basically we need to
identify I think you know the companies
that are actually discriminating against
people just simply based on that you
know and not at you know based on what
they can accomplish and what they're
able to do because if we had a list like
look at indeed calm indeed calm is
supposed to be the number one jobs
engine if you go to like zip recruiter
they have an app and all this stuff and
none of them have the ability to be able
to sort through it all and be like okay
I don't even want to consider these
companies because they don't offer or
because they discriminate against people
that don't have a degree now I know that
people that have a degree I and do
that's great
in fact I've always recommended that
people get the degree if you can get the
education do it but the product the
problem is my phone keeps
going off the problem is is that if you
if you are capable of doing the job and
you get discriminated against
because you don't have the degree even
if you've been in the industry for like
five years or you know 10 years or you
created some great project that
everybody's using if you're being
discriminated discriminated against for
that reason like would you want to work
for that company like do you want I mean
so I think that even if you do have a
degree whether it's a two-year or a
four-year degree you probably want to
work for a company that respects their
employees and respects what their
employees are able to accomplish and it
would be nice to know beforehand whether
or not this company is really not going
to consider you because you don't have
the degree you know I mean so and maybe
it even builds like and changes the way
companies look at people that don't have
degrees because who's who knows I'm just
speculating here but what if you know
people that even even the people that
did have a degree were like you know
what I'm not going to work for that
company because they're not looking for
the best talent that they can find
they're just simply you know crossing
off checkmarks and finding excuses of
why somebody might not be able to do you
know whatever it is that they're trying
to hire for so I don't agree with it I
feel really bad for all of you guys that
are out there that are trying to get
your foot in the door for you weeping
cray angel' I would probably if you
don't have things tying you to the area
I would try to broaden like you know
more the the geographic area of what
you're looking for at least you're
already in the United States I mean
there's plenty of opportunity all over
the place but if you're limiting
yourself to just a Hampton Roads
Virginia Beach area a place that isn't
really considered an IT like hub as far
as I know it's going to be difficult and
I think even in Northern Virginia it's
difficult to wade through all the jobs
that are being posted because we've
talked about this before but some of the
job sites out there you have these
headhunter communities and and the
headhunters are literally posting jobs
from other headhunting firms which are
posting jobs from other headhunting
firms sometimes they're posting jobs
that don't even exist and a lot of times
you're not seeing that the company that
actually is hiring even going to indeed
and all this stuff so I think it's
really interesting because you know if
these jobs don't really exist like how
much time are we wasting looking at
 listings right
apparently I tdum
and is through the roof and all this
stuff but but really it's not I mean
we're wearing somewhat of an IT slowdown
right now like Silicon Valley's
definitely slowing down with venture
capital funding pouring into all that
stuff and things are going to be
tightening up a little bit and I don't I
don't think that there's nearly the
demand that people say that there is I
think that you we know that companies
are gaming the h-1b system and they do
that by saying that they can't fulfill
jobs and stuff like that but meanwhile
you have a shitload of Americans who
aren't working a shitload of Americans
who have stem degrees and things like
that and they still can't find a job and
I think like I can't believe my phone
keeps my loan
I thought I'd turn this thing off I
think that if turned off the wrong thing
anyway you know I think that if a stem
person can't get it you get a job or
what I think like in the DC area there
are companies that are almost like
there's government stipulations and
Northern Virginia there's a lot of IT
contracts and government stuff like IT
operations that work for the federal
government and some of the federal
government contracts dictate that the
person that is working on this
particular project needs to have this
level of education and part of that I
think is you know just simply that you
know the you know the President or the
administration's trying to fulfill you
know the American dream the kids who
have already gone out and spent you know
a hundred thousand dollars on a college
education and they want them to be able
to find a job before somebody that
didn't go that route because if
everybody realizes that college is
 and you can learn everything
you need to know on the internet and you
know find mentors and certifications and
small courses for the things that you
need to make up here and there which I
believe is the case I think we're headed
into this new online education thing
like I taught myself from the internet
it wasn't just programming that I taught
myself to know how to do I bought a car
for 250 bucks the 2000 Mazda Protege
this sprayed smoke like it
was on fire everywhere you went the
clutch was slipping and it was just it
would smoke everywhere apparently that
the shop said you know what don't fix
the car this was like 2000 and
six or seven that I bought this card it
was a 2000 they said you know it's not
fixable in the car you know just pour
oil into it everyday it's leaking oil
out of the rear main seal and it's not
worth it just don't fix it but what I
did I bought this car for 250 bucks I
drove it back home or smoking everywhere
and everything and then I took it apart
in my gravel driveway at my old country
home in the first house that I ever
bought and using YouTube and other and
Mazda Protege forums and stuff like that
I learned how to pull out like I mean it
was a big repair like you have to pull
all like all the motor mounts off you
had to remove the transmission which
means obviously I have to remove the
control arms and the half shafts and all
that stuff and you have to pull off
eventually you get the transmission out
you pull the clutch off and replace that
while you're down there you pull the
flywheel off obviously before you
replace the clutch and then there was
this $28 part a $28 see a little round
thing like that that I bought from the
dealership and I put that thing on there
and it was only 28 bucks I did all the
repairs myself and I put everything back
together and it started up it didn't
leak oil and I drove that car for over a
hundred thousand miles and only paid 250
bucks on it why did I like why did I do
that or how did I be able to figure out
how to do that I wasn't an auto mechanic
or anything like that I had never done
major auto repairs at the time but I did
it based on YouTube not just YouTube at
the time in fact YouTube wasn't even
really that popular for the most part I
was using these old-school forums like
if you've ever seen like PHP my PHP BB
or whatever it's called but basically
the old-school thread forums that you
still see in existence today but not
nearly as popular at least not for the
sites that I go to but a lot of that you
know was people sharing images and stuff
like that I was able to do the timing
belt on that same car at one point in
fact I should go back and find that
listing but when I was doing the timing
belt in a different repair I had taken
off all the I lined up everything
perfectly and the car wouldn't start
like it would try to start it wouldn't
start like the timing was off I thought
I ruined the engine I had taken this
thing apart four or five times trying to
line up everything if you ever done the
timing you know timing but you have to
line up all the gears where that all the
points are pointing in the same
direction and stuff where you can
pletely screw up your engine but I'm not
putting all this stuff back together and
the the thing wouldn't start right so it
took like four and finally boiled down
to the fact that there's this thing
called a crankshaft sensor and the
crankshaft sensor sits there's this
little gear on one of the exterior parts
of the drive belt that's exposed but
apparently this thing like just barely
was supposed to be like a couple
millimeters away from you know this gear
and there was a magnetic tip on it and
it had like I guess you know there was a
wire to it and everything said the
computer since the magnet yeah I guess
the magnet pull of the you know the
little gear piece but you know it turns
out this small little part with a magnet
on it was my problem how did I figure
that out after like three or four months
singing that my my car was shot and
wasn't really three or four months but
was a long time like the car was out of
commission for a long time and because
each time I'd have to take it apart ever
done time about you're taking off the
alternator all that stuff and having to
you know then take off the casing to get
to the expose gears of the timing belt
and everything and I had done that
several times and was pretty much giving
up but eventually somebody helped me on
the internet they were actually showing
me pictures of how theirs were lined up
and everything I realized that mine was
perfectly fine so it wasn't that and I
was a happy happy dude when I finally
figured out that that magnetic tip of
the crankshaft sensor was the problem
but the internet helped me do that the
internet helped me get books and you
know for Python and all these other
things that I could read in PDF format
and some of this stuff was shared freely
I mean and it's all just free knowledge
and I soaked it all up and I did you
know I did what I had to do and I think
that the opportunity is there for all of
us and now there's even more resources
when you're looking at like plural site
and you're learning from experts why are
you going to go to your college
professor who says the job is going to
be everything you need to do when you
couldn't go to a plural site and learn
everything about Java or react or
whatever it may be in plural sites gonna
cost you twenty nine bucks a month you
start soaking up that knowledge you're
going to be just as good as anybody in
the corporate world it really is going
to boil down to motivation and in
college you know shows that you you are
a dedicated person you went through all
that and you paid $100,000 for your
education that's great that's fine
but if somebody goes a separate route
they shouldn't be penalized for it if
they're just as capable
I call on that and I think that
we need to come together and if I had
more time in fact you know I've thought
about doing a jobs website but there
should be a jobs website that excludes
companies like that and hopefully we can
try to convince some of the best talent
in the world to say you know what don't
go to that company because that company
discriminates go to this company because
this company is actually going to give
you a shot based on your potential and
not some paper so those are my
words there I know that um once again I
know College is important I'm not saying
don't get it but it does kind of piss me
off when when people get turned down for
that another thing they think so a coat
there was a couple comments in here too
I was going to try to address them all
but I've been ranting for 16 minutes now
another thing to ww7 you always got
great educated in the comments and some
of that stuff is way over my head with
some of the technology you talk about
that's pretty awesome another thing
here's one dude who says that he uses
you know being he says I used to improve
every bit of myself by using criticism
as motivation and I became good people
don't criticize me any more I am out of
motivation why I don't know that you
should be out of motivation I mean it's
good that people don't criticize you and
whatever it is that you're doing but I
have a hard time believing that you're
not going to face criticism in every
facet of your life based on where you're
at right now people are going to
criticize you everywhere another thing
too about the crane JAL's a guy he's
like it's nice to see somebody out of
Virginia a fellow Virginian that is a
relatively popular on on YouTube and I
think that's funny I mean I I think like
my popularity on YouTube I think is
great but I'm not that popular I'm not
even like I'm not even a blip on the
radar compared to so many of these other
guys another thing too is he said
another person asked me and this is a
fellow Bayside fan so that's awesome
Bayside's the reason why I'm a
programmer he says thanks for all and by
the way when I talk about Bayside I love
Bayside and I met Anthony Ranieri
several times I think he's great but
when I talk about Bayside like the
Bayside that motivated me was like
sirens and condolences like their
self-titled album shudder walking
wounded those are like that is like
classic badass based I never get tired
of listening to that and and like Sam
would like let it unfold you but it was
Senses Fail I mean that's some of the
you know best rock music I've ever heard
when I was at Woodstock 99 that should
be a topic for another day too but I've
been you know involved in in rock music
and and and even rap and stuff like that
and but you know for all the musicians
that I've ever enjoyed in my life
something hit strikes home when it comes
to like you know the underdog story of
Anthony Ranieri and and you know Bayside
as a band and I think honestly some of
that just speaks to my career you know
being rejected and and Bayside's never
going to be a mainstream band it seems
like but you know they work hard at it
and they haven't given up after all this
time so I don't either but you asked
about all this stuff about like you know
invoicing and quality' and quarterly
taxes that's like that's got to be like
almost an entire video series but in
case you guys don't know everything I do
on this channel in my business and
everything is all part of my business I
don't actually like all this that any
revenue that this this channel generates
and somebody that is through the
business it's not personally going into
my checking account or anything like
that so that is a completely separate
story but you know I would recommend
that if you are going to be doing stuff
on the internet you want to make sure
that you know that you're you're doing
the right thing there so I can talk
about that in a separate video
unfortunately I don't have time to
address that right now another thing too
is this month it says very motivational
I'm currently a network tech myself and
I make a pretty decent wage for working
a major telecom but I'm struggling to
transition to a programming career so I
would say do it if you're doing that
right now is there no like if you're
working for a major telecom company
there's no opportunity within that
telecom company whether it's Verizon or
AT&amp;amp;T or something like that to be able
to transition over to a programming gig
I mean like what kind of what kind of
connections can you make within the
company that you're in because you're
gonna have a much greater time
transitioning to a program within the
company that already knows you then then
actually transitioning from from the
outside because it's expensive for
companies to take a take a risk on
somebody that they don't know it's
probably all I have really so yeah
that's it let me see if there's any
other responses no not really
yeah that's about it guys
so let me know what you think I know
this video is running long here I could
really rant about this all day long and
I'm gonna continue to rant about this
but we need to talk about trying to get
a jobs website together that doesn't
discriminate based on decrees and it's
not like you want some company that
hires employees you know I'm not
saying that but if they're if they are
discriminating strictly because of a
degree maybe we can try to raise some
awareness and hopefully get you know
some of the biggest maybe some of the
biggest or arising developers to say you
know what you know this college is
not you know things change right the
Internet is a new thing the Internet is
bringing a new horizon to the way that
information is disseminated to way the
way people learn and and if education is
free like things like Coursera even what
I'm trying to do with hipster code and
all this stuff like it's free knowledge
and if people are willing to soak that
up to me that signifies just as much as
a piece of paper saying that they went
through all these required courses to
get their degree in college the only
difference is somebody didn't pay a
hundred thousand dollars to do it anyway
guys so thank you for watching have a
good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
