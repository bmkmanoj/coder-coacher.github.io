there's enough skill or really value
placed on the skill of being able to
search google for answers when it comes
to programming we constantly see in the
programming field that you're jumping
from one thing the next whether it's
like JavaScript where then bouncing in
the Python and C sharp and like if I'm
bouncing between Python and C sharp and
I'm putting parentheses around my my
function or my if statements and things
like that which aren't necessary from
within Python and just little minor
syntax differences like that aren't that
big of a deal because you know you type
it and your editor immediately tells you
hey that's not necessary because you're
not coding and c-sharp you're doing
something in Python and and those types
of small differences are no big deal but
when it comes to like react or redox and
then you start doing react and maybe
you're looking like es6 versus just
standard es5 you know those differences
does it really matter how well we we
memorize that stuff like say you have a
decent amount of experience in es 50 s 5
which is JavaScript the older JavaScript
and ER and you're used to using react
components that don't use the class
keyboard because classes don't even
exist in JavaScript but starting you
know now and in the future we plan on
having it be more of a class-based
language so is there is it truly
necessary that you remember the exact
construct for creating a react class in
es2015 just so that Babel can compile it
down to an older version of JavaScript
that actually works and browsers of
today which are typically just for the
older standards of JavaScript so my main
question here is like why isn't the fact
that programmers spend the majority of
their time google searching and quickly
trying to come up with answers for
complicated problems more of more of a a
skill set desire like why would you need
to master some sort of algorithm or even
that syntax which is only going to be
existence for like maybe six months or
so before you have to relearn it and do
it in a different way so my point is
simply just the fact that that
programmers should have more value on
how well they search stack overflow and
how they how well they search google to
finances because ultimately we're just
researchers trying to find a solution to
a problem it's rarely a requirement that
we have to come up with some sort of
abstract algorithm that hasn't already
been solved before because if you're
just reinventing the work wheel with
your own crappy solutions there's a
pretty good chance that you're crafty
solutions are compared to like some
sort of industry standard that already
exists and it's well uploaded and
documented on things like stackoverflow
or a Google Group or somewhere along the
way you know github wherever it may be
and the fact that matters is there there
should be more of a skillset desired for
somebody who knows how to find those
solutions as quickly as possible so the
whole I didn't remember what some sort
of syntax change was that has only been
in existence for three months to have
absolutely no bearing on whether or not
somebody's an actual program or even
whether or not somebody has experience
in something like react if I were asking
for a reaction developer to to try to
hire them then I think that if they knew
how to do it in twenty fifteen or twenty
sixteen that that would be good enough
for me especially if they did not do in
2016 and I was able to just quickly
judge how you know how fast they were
able to find the solution by giving them
a computer and a browser and letting
them search for an answer because like I
said let's just be honest I mean most of
this programming that we do we're not
solving life-and-death problems and if
we were we probably shouldn't be coming
up with those solutions on our own
without some sort of community
feedback and what about what do I mean
by that i'm talking about simple things
like what is you know in python one of
the best reasons for using that language
is that there's typically one way to do
it in python it's it's called the
pythonic way of doing it there's
obviously multiple ways that you can
solve all kinds of different problems
from solution and from simple to complex
but with Python there was pretty much
one community way that everybody does
things and and that was the the part
that I loved about it the most when I
compared it to something like pearl
where there was like multiple ways of
doing something and that was kind of the
whole status quo is that you can't you
come up with the most clever douchebag
type way of doing something put it all
in one line so nobody can read it and
then you know everybody thinks to your
clever including yourself and tell
either you or somebody else has to come
in and try to figure out what the hell
you did and for me that's why I didn't
really like pearl and in a lot of ways
javascript is the same exact way you can
do all kinds of different clever stuff
in JavaScript which makes it very
difficult to try to figure out you know
what to hell the codes knowing
especially when you have this in this
extra compilation step like taking
es2015 code and then compiling it down
to an older version of java script and
then you know packing it all into a
25,000 line file and having to debug
that file inside of it your chrome your
chrome debugger you know it's just it
it's it's a difficult process if you try
to be crafty and try to come up with
your own solutions to all these
different things so I don't know man I
think that that programmers one of the
biggest features of a programmer is
number one they should be interested
hopefully they have enough interest to
try to learn on their own they shouldn't
have to be trained on every specific
thing because there's a lot of
developers you'll talk to that have been
in this industry for a while and they
expect if a company is going to adopt
some new language or framework that they
have to be trained on it and and really
the companies these days it seems like
are taking the stance like no dude you
go to youtube you go to this you go two
that and you learn how to do it
you know and sometimes they don't even
give you the ability to do that on
company time they expect you to go home
and do that which is one of the
downsides to be in a program or
depending on the company that you work
for but if you stay interested then that
stuff is not such a hassle because you
enjoy doing it and you're going to do it
anyway so so that's the thing man I mean
that we shouldn't be true programmers
for the most part aren't just writing up
their own crazy to do something
stuff has to go through code review and
typically more senior developers are
doing it or in some sort of group
environment they're spotting issues and
you should be using community standards
and best practices and how do you know
what those best practices are you go
online and you start researching so
programmers job is just as much research
as it is just being able to to come up
with abstract algorithms and things so
I'm sure in some industries that does
vary a decent amount like but even with
gaming and like unity and stuff like
that I'm not even a game programmer but
I can go on unity and if I'm trying to
figure out some sort of you know some
sort of even if it's an not even
specifically an algorithm but like okay
how do I use the raycast or rave
whatever the hell it's called 22 when
I'm pointing at something with my mouse
to be able to click on that item or to
figure out what item I clicked on when
there's all these different objects in
your scene and and you're not going to
just come up with that off the top
of your head and I mean it may be the
first person did or some but usually the
best programmers are the ones you know
they have the most experience in that
that framework and they're going to come
up with these solutions and and those
are the solutions that all the newbies
should be trying to follow off of and
when I say newbie I'm talking probably
less than five years of experience oh
you know dealing with you know game
programming specifically so I'm not a
game programmer if I tried to write my
own raycast pointer type you know logic
it's probably not going to be any better
than anybody's out there that is already
doing it now that's not to say that it's
not ever but there's going to be
exceptions to the rule but it's good
it's a rare thing I think it's a rare
you're a rare breed of programmer
everything you touch all of a sudden
becomes the industry best standard or
best practice because you're that good
and there are people that are that good
but I said this wandering the John saw
meds interview when I'm talking about
you know the vast majority of
programmers fall in between you know the
elite and you know the not very good you
know that there's just there's a vast
majority of us that are right in the
middle and that's kind of where I feel
like I'm at my best days I'm probably
right in the middle and I'm good with
that to be honest with you because I
went to school for business and I'm
about business and business practices
and how do I use technology to further
business and not just my own interest
but with companies i mean i feel like i
have a pretty business centric mind and
and to me I'm good with that I'm not
going to be the guy that creates the new
physics engine that unity ends up
adopting because I'm so good at math and
I love complex you know complex
algorithms and like that it's just
not it's not me in it it's not most
people so i don't know like i said the
simple fact of the matter is is that the
answers lie in the community and there
there are going to be rare exceptions
where somebody just everything they
touch turns to gold but i think that
that's actually i think that's probably
of you know probably not even accurate i
look at somebody like jon skeet who is
the most highly uploaded answer on stack
overflow and the guy is extremely good
at java and c sharp but he doesn't know
all the answers to python now this guy
could probably code the hell out of
python but i've heard him saying his own
answers that he doesn't know anything
about python python snob or his
interests lie and he doesn't do it but
if he had to he could easily he'll
figure it out and probably be one of the
better Python programmers but even a guy
like him jumping into the Python
community with as much programming
experience as he has and the fact that
he's a brilliant guy smart very good
programmer much better than I will ever
be he still doesn't have the community
best interests in mind or the you know
he doesn't know enough about Python to
just jump in and and be able to say that
he you know he knows more than you know
Martin something or another who's one of
the most highly uploaded answers
on stack overflow or Daniel Roseman for
you know for Django to specific
questions so I don't know man if I'm
Daniel Roseman I feel pretty confident
that I have some Django or yes some
Django specific answers and I could
probably I wouldn't have to really seek
the community's guidance on all that
stuff probably for most of the things
that I do but once he starts deviating
away from Django and maybe into other
areas of Python he's not as familiar at
or if he jumps in the c-sharp he can do
all that stuff once again but there is a
certain skill set and being able to
identify community best guidelines and
compute community best answers to get
the job done so and arguably in my
opinion that's one of the most that's
one of the most important skills man
that I've actually developed along the
way I start I feel like I have a much
greater capacity now to start perusing
through answers and when I see answers
that don't make any sense I feel like I
have a much greater ability to be able
to spot stuff where it's like I I see
how they're doing it and I don't agree
with that way and I'm not going to do it
that way I'm going to do it some other
way and I'll continue searching but if I
find something that seems to be you know
legitimate are good enough then you know
I'll go with that no I feel comfortable
enough knowing you know that I have a
decent amount of research skills and you
know that should be good enough just
based on previous experience so I'll
boil it all down to just saying that
actual actual searching and analyzing
and problem problem solving by seeking
out answers through our online resources
are one of the most important aspects of
programming in today's day and age and
that we shouldn't be so caught up in you
know somebody who can come up with
crafty solutions off the top of their
head because those solutions may not be
the best solutions you know depending on
what their their particular background
is all right guys that's all I got today
man let me know what y'all think and uh
thanks for watching guys have a good day
bye
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12 week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here and now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding boot camp and
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
