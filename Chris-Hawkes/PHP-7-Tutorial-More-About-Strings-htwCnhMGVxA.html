third video of the PHP tutorial series
for hipster code comm and in the last
video we looked at all the different
types in PHP and this video what we want
to specifically focus on is the string
type the string type can be relatively a
complex thing in most programming
languages and there is some complexity
with it inside of Python
so we'll say string complexity equals
this is a new string now you're going to
notice in this new string that we just
declared there is double quotes so we're
declaring a string with double quotes
but we can also do it with single quotes
so if I said echo which means print and
we're going to say string complexity
you're gonna say this is a new string so
in double quote or single quotes acts no
differently than double quotes for the
most part you would think anyways so
they both display the same way but
here's the difference if I were to put a
/n this is in fact I don't wanna put
that double first of all so this is some
more jank and you can see it's all one
line and this new line has no has no
understanding because if we look at the
value in an h1 since we're displaying
this in an h1 new lines don't mean
anything in HTML but you can see that
there is the value on two separate lines
so that becomes more important if we
were going to be using if we were going
to display this in something a
difference so let's actually put this
inside a pre block and pre is actually
going to display and it's in its raw
format basically so now we can see that
the two lines are being displayed the
two lines of text are being displayed
differently because this end causes that
line break to occur so if we remove the
end you can see it's all on one line now
if
to do a forward slash in on a single
quote the difference is that this is
going to be it's going to be explicitly
converted to just a forward slash in and
it doesn't mean newline it means just go
ahead and escape it just display it as
is
we don't need special characters /n is
considered a special character as well
as T like T is a tab so forward slash T
on a single quote is just going to be
its raw format there but if I did it in
a double quote and I do that now we're
going to have a tab separating the two
characters so now there's this this big
old tab right there so if I double click
you can see that is one tab character so
now what if I had two separate strings
because a lot of times you're going to
be dealing with multiple variable
strings so we'll say let's create
another variable separate string equals
holy crap Batman if I wanted to add two
strings together what I could do is I
could actually do double quotes here and
with the dot operator which means
concatenation I can actually reference
this separate string and do another dot
and all that means concatenation means
taking two things and combining them
into one concatenated so that's what
we're doing here we're concatenating two
different variables and if we look at
this we can now see this is a new string
holy crap Batman so we took two
different string variables and we
combined them into one string by using
this this dot operator for concatenation
the second thing I want to show you is
that PHP does some auto magic stuff
which is really considered
craziness and a lot of different
languages but what I could do is I can
actually simply say plus which actually
means in mathematical formulation
actually add two strings together so
what is the value going to be in most
languages it would poop
you can't add two strings and create
some sort of new value but you can see
him and PHP it tries to automatically
define what it is that you're trying to
say there and it makes it a zero so
that's actually really weird PHP is
dynamically interpreted it will do
weirdness like that if you want it to in
most cases you never want to do
something like that and you would want
the error to be thrown but you need to
be cognizant of the fact that PHP allows
you to do that kind of crap which is
really weird in addition to that I
wanted to mention that PHP is a
dynamically interpreted language so what
that means is that the compiler is
running through the code one step at a
time as it's running and it will puke on
the first time that it tries to compile
compile something that doesn't actually
work so the execution happens from top
to bottom left to right so the reason
why I mentioned that is in programming
you're going to get slipped up a lot of
times when you try to reference a
undeclared variable so the reason why is
because this this statement is going to
be executed before this statement so
this statement is referencing separate
string which hasn't even been defined
yet so when this occurs you actually run
into a problem because of the order of
execution you can see undefined variable
it's defined down here but it wasn't
defined when PHP tried to interpret it
so dynamically interpreted languages you
run into that problem so the order of
execution is absolutely important in PHP
now another thing I want to mention
whenever you're printing off values
in PHP is that a lot of people use echo
but there is also a print statement so
you can simply do print and the output
is the exact same so print and echo
essentially are the same thing for
beginner purposes and PHP alright so
like the print keyword there is actually
several other type of built-in functions
that are available to us in PHP that can
do things with strings one of the first
I wanted to mention is in many cases in
programming languages you need to take
an entire sentence you need you need to
make it uppercase so what I can do is I
can take string complexity and actually
use a built-in string to upper which is
another thing I want to point out if
you've never used PHP before there is no
camel case or anything and with some of
these these function names it's
absolutely terrible but eventually it
will grow on you that STR to upper like
there's no separation and in most cases
you would see make in JavaScript you
would see st to upper you would have you
know this camel case which is where the
each subsequent word is a uppercase for
the first character which gives the
appearance of a you know camel's hump
back but there is none of that in many
cases with with PHP it's it's just kind
of all over the place so what you would
pass into the argument here is the
actual I'm passing in the same variable
that we've already defined here so the
variable is going to be re-written and
overwritten and it's going to reference
though what's already been declared and
it's going to turn the entire string
uppercase so now you can see the entire
string is uppercase another thing that
you're gonna find in PHP a lot of times
people need to measure the actual length
of a string like how long how many
characters are in this string in order
to do that it's actually very easy
there's another built in string length
our string ling-ling which is short for
string length and then you pass in your
string complexity or whatever it is that
you're
you're looking at and it's gonna spit
out the amount of characters that are in
that string let me zoom in I should have
zoomed out a long time ago but you guys
can hopefully see that the next thing I
want to show you guys is the string
position argument or function and the
first argument that you pass to this
function is the actual you know the
value of the variable that you're
looking at so string complexity and then
the second thing is where in the string
does this occur so if I said let me do
something wrong here but if I said is
the first occurrence of is should be
right here
oh if we go ahead and we look at this
you can see that it returns null it
didn't find it the reason why I didn't
find it is because it is case sensitive
we took this entire string and we turned
it upper case in this statement right
here so now it's upper case so if I said
it is you can see that the value it
spits back is two now written the reason
why it's like well why did that happen
well it looked for the first occurrence
of is in the string and that actually
occurred right here so it didn't matter
that is is not its own word like over
here it found the first occurrence so if
I said string
so if I change this to string make sure
it's uppercase it's going to return 14
so if we said PHP starts counting at 0
so T is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
14 so you can see that it returns where
in the string the match started so not
where the match ended but where it
started so s is the 14th character over
counting at 0 and G would not be so it
doesn't matter where it ends it matters
where it starts with a string position
so the next one we want to look at is
string replace and one of the reasons
why I said in PHP there's a lot of slack
for the way that it names some of these
built-in functions like this string to
upper there's no camel case there's no
separation same thing here but then the
string replace is actually used like
this so it actually separates to the
keywords with an underscore there wasn't
much thought it seems like with planning
out some of this stuff but it's just the
way that it is and the argument isn't
the value or the the object first or
variable first the first thing is going
to be okay what and do you want to find
in this case we'll say this and the
second one's going to say what do you
want to replace it with and we'll say
chiz News shares a schism is and then
the third argument is going to be string
complexity so we're saying okay look and
string complexity and what I want to do
is we'll say we'll create a new thing so
let's say replace example and then we're
going to echo replace example
and we have an error message part syntax
error unexpected string replace and
alright so the error message says on
line 13 and the reason why is we're
missing the equals because we're
creating a new variable and we're saying
it needs to equal this value wouldn't
have to equal there so it messed up so
that's good that PHP will immediately
tell you when something is messed up now
here's the thing this gets printed out
and we see that our change didn't happen
why didn't it happen oh because it's
case sensitive so strings in PHP are
case sensitive
there is no this and under in lower case
so if I said this in uppercase this will
now find it and it will change it to SH
isness and it's not going to be
uppercase because the upper case was
already called when we said hey now
replace this with shiz nez so definitely
there are case sensitive issues that are
gonna eventually end up stumping you at
one time or another so just know that
you know that is there to trip you up
all right so the final character the
defined function and PHP that we're
going to look at for Strings is the
substring function because a lot of
times when you're dealing with placement
and things like that
you'll see that the integer where an
occurrence occurs is important so let me
give an example here we're going to
create a new string from string
complexity complexity and we'll call it
in this replace example so I'm going to
say this equals and then we're going to
use the built-in keyword substring and
the first argument is going to be string
complexity sorry string complexity which
is our variable here and then the second
argument is going to be an integer of
where you want to start so we're going
to say start at 0 and stop at 4
so this says start at 0 stop at four and
then return this value it's going to be
a sign
replace example so now let's go ahead
and take a look at the code and we have
an error and that's because we're
missing a semicolon again once again
it's very sensitive about semicolons at
the end of the statement and you can see
it returned this now why did do that
because PHP starts counting and zero as
do many programming languages so
counting at zero this is zero one two
three three and then four so this four
is where to stop so it's going to
capture everything after and then before
so if I said five this would actually
capture this white space right here and
stop at this character and you can see
the white space is here like if so you
can see this whitespace character right
there and if I said six then it would
actually grab the eye from the is is
word now if I wanted to go backwards and
actually start at zero and grab let's
see one two three four five six so
negative six
then it's going to start at zero and
then work its way backwards to grab and
return the entire string all the way
from zero to wherever we we chopped it
off so if I wanted to actually say zero
six to let's say zero
so the reason why that didn't work as
expected is that the first value should
be where in the execution should it stop
so basically the first value here this
should be let's just say negative one
and then the second one should be
negative one two three four let's just
say five I guess we'll try that so it
looks like we need to get this needs to
be zero so negative five and zero that
doesn't work so obviously we need to
have some we need to have some monkeying
around with this stuff so there's some
weirdness with the strings or the
substring function but you're not going
to really mess with it too often I mean
this is something that's available in a
lot of different programming languages
but it gets a little bit confusing when
you start counting backwards and
counting forwards and trying to you know
figure out the starting point and the
end point to get to cut the words that
you're looking for and in many cases
you're not going to actually see integer
based positions being subtracted maybe
sometimes you're like oh I just need to
get rid of the last character of this
sentence or something so you know that
could be a helpful thing to just go back
and just remove the last character or
something like that but ultimately
that's probably going to be the extent
of what you're using substring for and
PHP all right guys thanks for watching
