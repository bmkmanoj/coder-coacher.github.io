you guys have heard of virtual
environment and the purpose behind it
and it's best to use it to try to
contain your project into one particular
directory so typically when you have
multiple websites on the same system and
the websites are gonna rely on certain
packages and you might even have
different versions of Python that you're
using and in order for the packages not
to conflict with each other the virtual
environment idea was created so that way
your entire project can be
self-contained so I just want to show
you the best way to be able to actually
set that up is after you have virtual
environment installed you want to run it
with an additional flag so that virtual
environment is not sharing common
packages which is a common problem so to
say to create the environment just say
virtual environment and then space and
then you just call it whatever you want
and in my case will be called music
environment and then you need to go
ahead and set this flag by saying no
site packages and what this does is it
will just like I said make sure it
doesn't share any sort of common
packages with other projects because you
can run into conflicts and things as
well when it does that so anyway that is
the the best way to get it working once
you have it in the virtual environment
created after running that you can see
it says it installs set up tools and pip
for you so in order to be able to
activate the environment you need to go
ahead and CD into the directory that was
created for you in the virtual
environment and then CD into the bin
directory and then just say source
activate and then if you're inside the
virtual environment you'll see the
parentheses over here with the name of
the environment that you just created
so now that you have this self-contained
environment you can go ahead and install
anything you want like I'll install
Django here and it'll grab the latest
Django and this Django installation will
only apply to this music virtual
environment alright guys so that's
that's all in this video thank you right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
