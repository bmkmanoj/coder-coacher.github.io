NES sit in the es6 tutorial we're gonna
be looking at default function arguments
and the reason why they're beneficial
we'll get into that just a second but
this is something that is new so a lot
of you guys might not be all that
impressed with it but some other
languages they already support this but
Java scripts kind of late to the game of
doing it but it's as simple as saying if
we had a function name test and function
test takes in an argument that we're
just going to say you know it's gonna be
a and then it's going to say no in
console dot log a plus 10 so we're
hoping that a number gets passed in as a
in order for this calculation to occur
but what if I were to just call it
without actually passing in anything so
a is gonna be undefined and a plus 10 is
gonna return not at number because
anytime you try to do a numerical
computation on like you know something
that is not a number and doesn't return
a number then you get not a number which
is actually a unique type to object well
it's not really a type actually I take
that back it's a unique object to
JavaScript but it's not a unique type
and I'll explain that in just a second
so if we go over here and we fire this
function then we get not a number so the
reason why I was saying not a number is
not a type if we were to say n a n and
then underscore or underscore underscore
proto to get its prototype you can see
we actually get a number back so not a
number is actually up type number it's
not some sort of undefined it's
basically a number type but it doesn't
know what the hell it is it's it's a
special number that means it means that
it's a special number that means hey I'm
not a number and it's so weird it's a
weird thing with JavaScript but anyway
so in order to prevent that sort of
thing what we can do is say you know
what we don't want not a number to get
returned so I could say a equals zero
that way if I don't pass in anything
I should get now ten so I shouldn't get
any sort of not a number of problems or
anything like that I'm gonna get ten
because we have now a default function
argument that says worst case scenario
some asshole doesn't pass in a function
or an argument like he's supposed to we
have it covered we'll take care of this
asshole and we're gonna assign a value
of zero
I shouldn't cuss sorry now if I went
ahead and passed in an argument of 10
and hopefully you guys know what ten
plus ten is then we're gonna get that
value back which is 20 so there you go
so the default argument will get
overridden when you pass in an actual
value that will be you know supplemented
or replacing that that default argument
but though that is like basically an
example of where you would need and a
default argument so you don't run into
some weird side effects and things like
that if somebody doesn't actually pass
the right arguments to your function all
right guys so that's really it with the
default arguments in es6 thanks for
watching make sure you subscribe and
vote up the video thank you right hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in the Suevi course it's geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
