the last video we saw how to create
classes and we looked at class methods
and things like that and we created this
person object in fact I drove on here
and we created this this person that has
all these fields and everything and what
we want to do now is look at sub
classing so all this stuff exists inside
of the person class but now what if you
were like you know what I have a person
but now I want to create a an employee
and an employee is uptight person but an
employee has a few separate things that
we need to keep track of like an
employee number and a hire date or
something like that so how do I actually
do that like I could create a new class
now and I could call this new class I'm
going to define it right underneath this
file just to make things easier so we
don't use import statements but just as
a record if you were going to have
multiple classes you should probably
have them in separate files a lot of
people are very particular about that
and then you would import whatever class
you need it but we're not right now I
don't want to have to deal with the
complexity of importing to throw anybody
off that may just be getting started so
we're going to create an employee class
and now in order to actually sub to be a
subclass of person we have to actually
pass in the person class by saying
person which is right here so now if I
say person class person and then we're
going to do a define ainít file and
then it's gonna be self and then we're
going to say say self and then we'll
just say employee ID
and then we'll just say self dot
employee ID equals employee ID all right
so now we have this employee ID on the
class person which ends up subclassing
our employee I'm sorry is the name of
their class and it's so classes person
now one of the things that's going to
end up tripping us up here is that if
you notice person when you instantiate a
person object you have to pass in data
like name hair color and height or at
least it expects you to do that because
that way it has all that information
already defined from within the class so
if I were to run this without that you
could say it's missing the three
required arguments named hair color blah
blah blah so let me do a ctrl Z to bring
all that stuff back and I can create a
Chris class no problem now it's not
going to do anything but it didn't throw
any errors so that's fine so now what if
I said Chris or I'll just say Billy the
employee equals and there is a employee
and then here we say the start dates are
ups our employee ID will just say a one
two three all right so now let's go
ahead and we'll just create another
method on this that says print employee
ID and it's me self to print self died
employee ID so if any of this stuff
doesn't make sense make sure you see the
video just prior to this one we're
talking about classes and methods right
so now if I were to do this I'm going to
then say Billy the employee dot print
employee ID called a parentheses and I'm
going to run this
you can see a prince a one-two-three but
now how does a billy and get information
from like print name and all this stuff
how can I print Billy's name I didn't
actually assign a name to Billy so what
happens when we want to then say Billy
the employee because the purpose of
subclassing is that you're supposed to
be able to get all the functionality
that you need from the class that you
subclass from the the lower class so you
can see it's subclass in person so I
should have all the person's
functionality from within the employee
object but here inside the ability the
employee if I were to say Billy the
employee started in type it out Billy
the employee dot prints you can see it
actually finds like print hair color but
here's the problem when we go to run it
we created a employee class here and
those values only get assigned when we
actually create a person class so that
is a problem so let me just get rid of
that so there's no confusion we created
an employee class it has all the
functionality of the person class but
the person class needed you to pass in
data that it gets assigned that then
gets used from within its methods and
here we referenced a method that existed
in the person class but though that in
it but the value wasn't there so it says
there's no object attribute named hair
color so how do we fix this problem now
in order to do this there's a new
feature in Python 3 called super and
super is supposed to be able to take any
number of arguments and apply it to
parent classes so that it fulfills in
the parent class contract essentially so
I could use the super keyword but we
haven't touched upon a few things like
keyboard args and arms within Python in
order for me to really address that in
this video so instead I'm going to use
an alternate implementation that some
people say is better including some guy
named Martin I can never pronounce his
last name but he's from the UK and the
the most highly upvoted Python answer on
Stack Overflow he hates the super
keyword and he but basically the super
keyword is is some magic that is
performed within Python 3 to solve this
type of problem and the reason why we
want to get into that is because it's
important when you run along with that
and some people in the community say
that it is sufficient and they use it
and you see it used in projects but
we're not there yet and you can get by
just fine without using it so let's go
ahead and look at how we would solve
that from within our person class and
what we would end up doing is we have to
actually we would have to implement and
this is the part that kind of sucks we
have to change employee to accept all
the parameters that that person needed
when it got instantiated so we would say
name what's the second one hair color
and height hair color and height and
then from within here we would actually
say person dot ein it and we would then
have to pass in name hair color height
so that kind of sucks because this is
where we have to explicitly say ok
employee has to pass in all this crap
even though these three things are used
by the parent class this is the only
thing specific to employee but I need
these ainít values to be passed on to
this so that these these methods work so
I could do that I could now do this and
now employee when we instantiate it we
need to pass in that stuff so we're
going to say Chris ox brown 6-1 and my
employee number so now when I do this
let's go ahead and run it
sorry guys oversight we need to actually
pass itself to the parent on it as well
I'm sorry about that so we're going to
pass himself here this is just this is
why the super keyword was created to be
honest with you but now it works and
guys I'll admit this is not this is not
the most ideal thing and it was it was
the reason why super was created I can't
explain super right now without getting
too complicated we've already gotten
into some pretty complicated stuff in
the last couple videos here and I don't
want to lose you on something as stupid
as the super keyword so this is how you
would manually solve the problem that
super is trying to solve for everybody
and what super does still fall short in
some sense because people like Martin
who is like like I said the highest
upvoted Python person in the entire
world on Stack Overflow says don't use
super use it this way
you know explicitly and verbose Lee
write it out so that there's no magic
going on everybody knows what the hell
is going on the weird thing about this
compared to other stuff is just simply
the fact that when you're calling ein it
you have to pass himself which is it's
that's the weirdness because normally
when you just instantiate a class you
don't have to pass himself but in this
one particular example you did and
that's where I feel like I really might
confuse you guys so hopefully you guys
can just watch this video a few times if
you ever run along this situation in the
future you nuts you guys know you can
come back hopefully and try to get
filled in on that information now a lot
of times the ein it is going to have a
bunch of different functionality it's
not going to be just assigning
parameters it might even be making
database calls it could be doing stuff
like reaching across the web you never
know what is being done in this I knit
file so that's why sometimes it's better
to call it this way because if in this
case we're just assigning values and
it's very easy to just basically
replicate it we could comment off this
line and I could actually self assign
all this stuff myself name
equals named self dot haircolor people's
hair color and self height equals height
and now because we're assigning all
these values from within the employee
class it would still work it would work
the same way that it did before without
having to call the ein it but the reason
why it's important to do it the other
way and not do this this verbose way
like I said duplicating the
functionality is number one you're
duplicating functionality number two if
there's a lot of shite going on inside
the eye net then you don't want to have
to duplicate all that stuff in every
class that you use just because you're
so classing so a lot of information
there to swallow I know it is guys let
me know what you think hopefully I've
explained this relatively well and
please subscribe please share please
upvote thanks bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
wanna take a moment to mention dev

jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
