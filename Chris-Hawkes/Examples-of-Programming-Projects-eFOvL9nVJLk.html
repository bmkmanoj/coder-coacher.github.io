from Zig pranks he says Chris can you do
a video showcasing some of the projects
or give examples of typical programming
projects he said I'm struggling to grasp
the scope in which someone can be
considered a programmer maybe a short
list of some of the most challenging
projects you have been run away than
give clarification he says do
programmers typically write software and
I said I don't actually write software
application in the sense that I'm not
building GUI applications and something
like C++ or C sharp where you know you
download and install software like a
Photoshop type application if you were
going to build something like Photoshop
I mean it's an incredible amount of work
this is obviously the result of probably
thousands of programmers over really
decades at this point you know it's
solidifying this product so that there's
tons of code there at one point I think
Microsoft's operating system of like
Windows 7 I believe numbered in the
millions of lines of code and stuff like
that so if you're a software developer
working at Microsoft and working on
those pieces you're going to be given
small
small pieces of work that take a
tremendous amount of effort because all
the testing everything you have to do to
be able to contribute to it so if you
have an established company so whether
or not you're doing GUI development or
web development you're typically working
on smaller pieces you know there's
things that you're going to bounce that
they're going to be bounce around like a
rest service or a soap service or
something like that in many cases when
when you're given a task where it's like
okay some other team is developing some
sort of rest service that I'm going to
communicate with and I need to know how
to communicate so a lot of your time is
working with that team to say okay I
send you this data you return me this
and and you spend a lot of time doing
that where another team might be like
you know what we're going to take this
data that is returned from this service
that we're building and we're going to
then do something with it and maybe
they're focusing on the UI side and when
I say UI I'm talking about like HTML CSS
JavaScript stuff so yeah did the probe
the projects can be really really
humongous but in large IT organizations
there's typically there
basically drill down into you know
different teams that are working on
different smaller pieces of the
functionality now where things get
complicated in my opinion and some of
the most complicated stuff I've
developed personally I've been the ones
that the projects that I've gone on my
own time where I have to be responsible
for every piece of of the architecture
and setting up everything and for
instance here's a simple website that I
created and this is just a simple nodejs
application so it's using node and I
believe it's Express and then it's also
using react so it's using isomorphic
JavaScript but it's essentially a single
page there's not much here it's just for
a it was a it was to help out a buddy
and do a just simple page for him so I
basically used a bootstrap theme use
react on the expressed gif side with
nodejs as the the server side and it
renders this so it looks relatively you
know relatively professional but I
didn't do most of the hard work there so
the project this project is relatively
simple but this is a simple node.js
application here's one that I made a
couple of months ago and this was
something that I actually spent about
two or three months trying to perfect
and I was trying to build a product that
was going to have tutorials basically to
be something along the lines of what so
many other tutorial based websites are
trying to do although I'm not a huge fan
of the code that the name I chose
hipster because of the the changing
trends in tech and all this stuff and
then as far as code try finding a domain
name with code in it and it's very
difficult I didn't want to have multiple
I didn't want have more than two words
in my name so I ended up choosing
hipster code but you know these are just
basically tutorials that I created on
YouTube and I want to be able to profile
them but there was quite a bit more that
was going on here there's an entire
profile system there is the the login as
far as you know being able to log in
with with your you know your name or
being able to use one of these social
platforms to be able to log in so I had
to implement all that stuff or you could
register for a new account so I wanted
to be able to register through the
social media sites or just be able to do
it through the site so obviously that
took some stuff
in addition some of the more complex
functionality with this particular
website was actually building the quiz
system so if you choose one of these
quizzes this quiz is being rendered
using react and then with react it's
also using the flux architectural
pattern and in the data itself for the
actual questions is coming from the
Python Django server and it's taking all
the questions and it's randomizing the
order of the questions so you don't get
the same questions in the same order
every time and and then it's also doing
a whole grading system so you know that
was you know a piece of complexity on
its own when I was trying to learn but
you know this this quiz application is
there was there's quite a bit more than
meets the eye there I probably made it
more difficult by using react instead of
just going with what Django was doing
but I was also trying to teach myself
and get back into the react swing of
things also this certificate like how do
i dynamically print a certificate with
people's names in the course that they
completed as well as the date well
that's all using python so i used that
was another piece of functionality that
i had to create where I was basically
creating the certificate in photoshop
and then cutting out pieces and then
pasting pieces in using a library out
there that people typically use on
remove the name of it for Python and PDF
development so you know that entire
process and then as far as like if you
want to get your certificate and pay for
and things like that then you have to
you have to you know I was making it so
you have to pay so if I was going to
print I could print a certificate and
you can see if I opened it up so even
the whole downloading displaying writing
the certificate all that stuff that
takes programming experience basically
if I take the quiz again if I took a new
quiz I could show you guys the example
of how you purchase it or whatever but
the point is is that this entire project
probably took three months why did it
take three months it was because I was
working on it here and there and I
wasn't working on every night and it was
quite a bit of different things that I
wasn't quite familiar with including
enabling HTTP which I usually don't do
so I ended up going out and buying an
HTTPS certificate through komodo and all
this stuff and like
I understand there's now free resources
to do that a lot of people pointed that
out after I'd already done this so would
have been helpful for me to know that
before
here's another website it's just some
this is a flask website actually so this
is using flask and not Django by the way
this is Django Python Django this is
Python flask why do I use Python
probably because it's much cheaper to
host it on my Lenovo virtual private
server than it is for me to use
something like Amazon AWS or Microsoft
Azure but this was mainly just to try to
raise awareness for the heroin and
opioid problem and the United States and
I was trying to build an interactive
live ticker for deaths and things like
that roughly based on statistics of the
past couple of years it was like four
deaths an hour or something like that so
this thing goes up no daily really it's
it there's a timer built in there it's
not refreshing automatically but I'll
refresh on page reviews or whatever but
like I said roughly a death every 15
minutes in the United States somewhere
around there so there's a so really all
of these projects where they have in
common they're all web-based projects
but I've also done gaming but just based
basically scratching the service doing
games and unity I build a lot of scraper
spider projects like here's a this was
funny because I was going down memory
lane
this was an Applebees spider that I was
trying to build I don't remember what
the hell I was trying to do but this was
years and years ago so I was um still
relatively new to programming and it's
funny because like um this is all
written in Python and you can see like I
created a list here that's called I
don't know why I would have created a
list called but apparently I was
you know deleting things out of them and
pushing stuff into my my list so I
don't know I want you I don't even
remember this is one of those things
were commenting of even trying to
comment what this program was being used
for would be a good idea because I don't
remember anymore
another thing that I've just recently
been messing around with is here's an
app that I created using the tornado web
framework and it's not really a
framework but it's a a synchronous
framework in in Python where it's
non-blocking so
can take as many requests that you throw
at it so it's very similar to way nodejs
is non-blocking but this is pythons
non-blocking but there's not a whole lot
of documentation on this but essentially
I did get the index.html working there's
a bundle JS file so it's using webpack
to actually handle module loading it's
also using react and then in addition to
that it's using Redux and stuff like
that you can see I have reducers and
stuff and that's all this Redux
architectural stuff which I'm not a huge
fan of by the way not at the moment
so yeah dancers so the long long story
boiled down here is that there's all
kinds of different topics if you're
going to build a project from scratch
yourself then you're gonna end up doing
a lot more stuff because even with
hipster code here there's more than
meets the eye there's a database some
using Postgres okay there's also a
servers I have two servers that are
handling this on the first server
handles all the images and CSS and
JavaScript files and that's all being
delivered by nginx which is its own
separate server and then I have another
server Apache too which is then taking
and handling all the Django specific
stuff and there was a learning curve
behind all of that there is obviously
the CSS there's the simple theme that I
use for the website which is a bootstrap
what else and a lot of the stuff will
seem daunting your leg off but really
all you got to do is you start with a
framework so use python or gentile use
Django or flask or use another
programming language not you know Python
related then get your templates
rendering and then once you get your
templates rendering pick out a theme a
JavaScript theme or bootstrap theme and
then just download that to your website
start plugging and playing stuff that's
specific to your site so that we don't
to be a UI expert from there you need to
be able to communicate with a database
so you need to learn how to set up your
database and there's going to be
instructions for each framework you use
and then from there you're going to need
to then get a server someplace you want
to host your content you could choose a
shared server which would probably be
easier to set up or if you wanted more
flexibility and Bill
to grow you're going to use your own
server or a virtual private server which
is what I went I went down that road so
you have to then learn how to set up
initial stuff and this is all going to
take you several days maybe weeks months
but eventually you know these larger
things come together and you realize wow
I built a pretty large project you know
just you know just doing things piece by
piece and it's the same thing with the
software community for a large
corporation you end up building
humongous things by taking things piece
by piece so it's always a piecemeal
approach in programming nobody just
starts writing out and then all of
a sudden have some masterpiece because
anybody that starts coding without
proper planning you know that's that's
how we get into the whole death march
situation that I've talked about before
because you're just doing and not and
reacting to you know things as I come up
as opposed to planning them out properly
so if you have a project idea the idea
number one you need to figure out what
it it what am I trying to create and
then when you try to do that you need to
figure out okay I want to create this
but now what is going to be the best
programming language to create that in
because we've talked about this before
programming languages are like tools
there's better tools for individual jobs
in some cases the Python may not be the
fastest language for web development but
I can save a crap ton of money on
hosting so those are some of the
analysis things that get brought into
okay I'm building a project how do you
host this project where am I gonna host
it and a lot of this stuff is also just
trial and error as well so I'll be
perfectly honest when I'm building an
entire site like this from scratch I
don't usually plan out things in great
detail not like I would if I work for a
corporation and I was helping them you
know I'm working on a scrum team and
things like that so there's a big
difference between your own personal pet
projects and actual humongous software
applications when you're working in
enterprise development and really
enterprise development is easier because
you don't have to you don't have to
handle so much of the different stuff
the only thing is you can get
shit-canned if if you don't do a good
job
but in most cases it's fine did you
you're on your goal you'll end up going
in to companies and realizing that
they're not the greatest programmers
that you thought they were and that
a lot of people just you know we're
learning things as we go and it becomes
painfully obvious that some of the
programmers and in companies that you
interact with or not like you know these
geniuses that you might think that they
are anyway guys um thanks for watching
have a good day bye oh and by the way
please subscribe and like I need to
start asking for that because the
channel is not growing as much as it
used to all right thanks guys bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
