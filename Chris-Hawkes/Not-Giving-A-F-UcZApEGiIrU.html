reap lugging in something can can do for
you it's amazing because uh I have this
logitech like webcam and it's never
given me any problem so I got this new
PC and all of a sudden it was like
choppy as hell if we saw one of the last
videos the the webcam was like really
really choppy I couldn't figure it out
why that was I ended up her like
downloading drivers and installing it
trying to mess with the settings like
what the hell is going on like I know
this computer's faster but then all of a
sudden I just you know I'm plugging it
from the USB plug it back in and it's a
miracle it works but what I'm going to
talk about this video so I'm talking
about in this video and I wish I had the
book to show up and I have an e-book
that I bought and it's called the art of
not giving a or something along
those lines and it the book is actually
funny I think it's meant to be humorous
although there is a lot that that you
can take you know you can allow you can
get from it right because a lot of times
we just care way too much about
different things like social justice
warriors and all that like you know all
the different issues in life you know
what I mean like certain people care
about certain things way too much and
other people don't and and but the point
is is that like you can only give so
many in your life that you have to
choose the right ones in order to to
live in happiness fulfilling life so I'm
going to put a link to that book and the
description tab below because I think
that that is a I think I think it's
something that I would recommend more
like three chapters and but you know
even the first three chapters have been
pretty solid which is kind of you know
just kind of you know a little bit eye
opening with some of the things that I
am definitely guilty of like one of the
things that I'm guilty of and really I
shouldn't be is basically not being good
enough to do the job an order or caring
that I might you know fail at a
particular task there's just you know
you go into work day in and day out and
like every day as a new set of a set of
problems that you're dealing with like
and you combine that with life's
problems and just like any other job
that you're expected to solve those
problems and the fact of the matter is
like no matter how quickly you solve
this probably you're just going to get
new
right and then you could worry about not
being able to get everything done but
ultimately once you get everything done
or even if you miss your deadlines or
whatever you're just you know you're
getting more work I guess the whole
point that I'm trying to say is like
when programmers try to compare
themselves to other programmers we all
should just not give a you know
what I mean like maybe a little bit less
and I think that that book has has it
right because so many of us like
including myself or like you know I mean
I have to compare myself to other
programmers like I should be doing this
as reference or open-source framework I
should be using view j/s and I should
know about angular 2 and I mean like the
book is pretty spot-on like who gives a
 right I mean there's going to be
some new technology that you're going to
have to deal with all the time learning
as you go somebody left a great comment
the other day where they were like focus
more on you know the architecture of
what you're trying to build design
patterns and the things that remain true
amongst you know frameworks libraries
you know tools languages things like
that so I think that there that you
could really you know I think that would
be helpful like for me
there's too much technology that we have
it's almost like there's too much news
to consume like I mean we get so caught
up in our daily news for from something
that might be local or it might be you
know for instance an American issue like
maybe with the election or something
like that
meanwhile the car bombs going off and
Baghdad or something and my 60 people
are killed and it's just like like I
said there's only so much you can do and
even as a programmer there's only so
much you can actually concern yourself
with before it starts becoming
detrimental so I've actually gone down
this kind of rabbit hole where like I
feel like I'm not good enough that I'm
not gonna be able to figure things out
that I have to like live up to some sort
of expectation that I've built up into
my own mind whether it be like a senior
program or anything like that it's just
like sometimes I put on more under my
shoulders and what I need to actually
carry around and at the end of the day
it doesn't do any good for me or for
anybody else and and I think that you
know some
just basically understanding that I'm a
good programmer that I'm going to
continue to learn I'm going to learn in
my own space I'm not going to be as good
as other people I'm going to be better
than some others you know it's just it's
just how it is and like I'm going to
practice doing that more because
honestly I feel like I put myself on
some sort of pedestal at times or it's
like I feel like I have to be better
than other people and and that's
something that I don't like I don't like
having to deal with that you know
mentally or physically or whatever so
that is something I'm going to work on
I'm curious to see what you guys had to
say out there so I'm a self-taught
developer when I was getting started I
would come home and I would I would
learn I spent a lot of time sacrificed a
lot in order to get around that and back
in those days it was a little bit better
because like I didn't understand the
expectation of what was going to be
expected of me day in and day out I was
building a product like I was learning
how to program to be a business owner to
build business products I had website
ideas and like it was all about just
learning what I needed to do to
accomplish this task and I was a big
dreamer man I saw that I could build the
next Facebook I thought I was going to
build rock music website based on my
favorite bambe site that everybody was
going to go to that the rock music
musicians would thank me for for
building it to promote their music and
everybody would understand you know that
there is awesome music out there and
there's so many avenues these days you
know when ever since the invention of
the smartphone and the iPod and really
any sort of online music like there is
just there's this perception from people
that listen to like rock music and
from like the 80s and 90s I like good
rock music doesn't exist anymore but
it's just a matter of like of them not
ever finding it because there's you know
there's so much media to consume and
like I was going to try to solve that
problem now back back in those days this
was like oh nine like I had no idea what
I was talking about I had no idea what I
was doing but that dream was really
awesome like if you fast forward to
today
even my jaded ass you know at this at
this stage of my life like I'm now
successful I make a lot of money on the
senior developer I've had multiple
corporate gigs I'm doing really well I
have this channel
this channels got millions of views like
things are going pretty well for me but
what have I done I've learned along the
way that through all the failures that
I've had all this like perception all
this worry that I had leading up to that
point was all it really was
like it's all and even my
worries now are worst case
scenario you fail at your task you get
fired you find another job like if
you're a programmer in the United States
of America you can find a job you should
be able to find a job anywhere that I
mean and I say see that's that
that's the same you will find a
job anywhere and that's and that's the
mindset that you have because otherwise
like who gives us up right you're going
to be you're going to be one way
or another right if you end up being
where you can find a job where you can
but the thing is is over those years I
learned from failure that that I could
succeed and that you can dream and still
find success so I shop for the stars
right but where did I fall like I ended
up not ever producing that music website
in the capacity that I ever wanted to
it's not online now but because of my
favorite band because of Arad music
concert in Baltimore that talks about in
previous videos I now have a channel
with 60 some thousand subscribers I have
several corporate jobs I've been a
senior developer for for many years now
I'm doing some of the most complicated
code I think that is in existence as far
as front-end web development least as
far as front-end web development is
concerned and I'm still able to I think
you know to succeed and that's you know
somebody that has as much responsibility
and everything else on my shoulders
these days so did I ever achieve this
this dream of you know building this
rock music website no not really but I
did end up having major major success
over having that dream so I've learned
along the way what simply won't work but
the problem is is that lay by simply
saying that oh that idea is not going to
work based off of seven years of failed
experience like of trying to get ideas
off the ground that could be detrimental
to somebody that
just getting started that would have
been detrimental to me seven years ago
and the best thing somebody could have
told me back then was to not give a
and just to go after my dreams because
it got me here it's if you're like if
your dream is to be a corporate
developer maybe eventually you get there
and you're in or there maybe you end up
just starting your own business and
having success there maybe you get into
the business side of things and and
you're able to be more of a business
analyst like I don't know where you're
going to be but I don't think that it's
going to be detrimental for anybody to
have lofty dreams and to try to achieve
them because it worked for me man it
really it worked for me so the one thing
that I need to work on right now though
is simply not caring what other people
think about me it's something that I
have a hard time doing but when I work
amongst peers and things like that I
sometimes feel like I have to achieve
like greatness and I feel like it gets
them in the way of what I'm capable of
doing and and for those reasons like for
somebody like me like it's simply caring
a little bit less it is something that I
think to actually take me along you know
take take me very scholarly and then
that's not a knock against like you know
developing or anything like that it's
just simply that you know adding stress
to your life is never going to make
things easier so I think though my lofty
dreams and what other senior does that
I've worked with you know a most you
know multiple places I've worked with
lots of different types of senior devs
and things like that there was a there
are many and that would be like hipster
codes a waste of time your YouTube
channels a waste of time you learning
how to you know to do it rock music
website is a waste of time
buying a telescope that's probably not a
waste of time that's actually pretty bad
I was actually but the thing is like
people will try to tear down your dreams
man they will try to belittle you and in
this field is like it's particularly
rough though because day in and day out
you have to be sharp as a tack otherwise
like you're known basically for for
minor mistakes for minor bugs for things
like
you can you can end up being you know
labeled as such you know what I mean but
all I'm simply saying guys is who you
know who cares accept it for what it is
do your best
learn don't don't don't listen to what
other people have to say if they tell
your dream is and all itself
including myself man I've even I even
did that a couple weeks ago where I was
talking about business ideas that that
just simply didn't work how ideas are
worthless still stand by that I still
stand by it and behind that you need
more than an idea but if you have an
idea and you have the ability to help
achieve that idea man dream big you know
what I mean you could end up having the
next big thing man you could or you
could just end up having $150,000 your
salary somewhere and still have a good
life but I would also say I would try to
keep in check like what it is that
you're actually trying to achieve when
you're trying to achieve like financial
freedom
you've really liked a code do you want
to work with a bunch of other developers
much other geeks and nerds everyday like
doing corporate type stuff or are you
more interested in like more like a
freelance marketing type gig you know
what I mean like there's all kinds of
different options that you have in the
IT field and I would say from like a
programmer perspective like you know
being a corporate programmer is clearly
not as fun not nearly as fun as actually
running your own stuff and building your
own product that's why there's so many
entrepreneurs
however there's so much baggage and
stuff that comes from like running your
own company like even mine my historical
website is more than I can ever handle
like you know I have something to write
for me like there's just too much that's
going on even there that I'm not able to
pursue it or do anything and there's so
much work and effort that's involved in
any sort of product to get off the
ground in some cases you might be like
that's not for me like you know who
gives a I'm just going to get a
salary and live my life because I'll
probably be able to have more time with
my family or more time doing with the
hobbies and things I want to do if I
simply collective paycheck and in most
cases that is what you know people end
up doing they they go on their work and
they collect that paycheck so I'm not
badly enough rambling tonight man just
saw just do your best
checkout the book if you're interested
if you're not don't worry about it I'm
not even trying to promote this book I'm
really not I just simply bought it today
I was it just kind of I thought it was
very I wouldn't say eye-opening but it
is um
it is something right you know I know
that I have that problem where I care
too much every every now and then and
caring a little bit less can actually go
and take it pretty far things so alright
