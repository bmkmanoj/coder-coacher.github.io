today the House of Representatives had
passed a law that is essentially
allowing Internet service providers to
be able to sell your data to the highest
bidder so this is a link from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation who has
been at the battle the front of the
battle lines for Internet privacy and
just privacy in general and you know
they're relatively a bipartisan group I
would say so that means in American
speak it's not like far-right Republican
or far left liberal Democrat so this
group you know I you know I do
appreciate what this group does and um
the you know they tried to raise
awareness that the house was getting
ready to vote on this but it's all over
the news now that Internet service
providers have now passed the House
passed a law that that has now said that
they can effectively sell your browsing
history or you know everything you do on
the internet that can now be sold to the
highest bidder and in a way it sucks and
another way it's like well you know
these companies are doing this anyway
it's like have you ever noticed how that
you'll go to certain sites and they have
internet ads that are like catered
directly towards you based on your age
group your your your your gender your
demographic whatever it is you know they
have all these different things and a
lot of that is based on your browsing
history so the browsers and providers
like Facebook and Google and things like
that they opt in to be able to read and
read your cookies and it's actually a
setting that you have to effectively
turn off within your browser so that you
know your information your browsing
history can't be sold to the highest
bidder but with the Internet service
provider there was a you know law of
stating that they couldn't take that
information and be able to sell it so
the issue with an Internet service
providers they clearly know every
website you're going to what time you're
going to them and you know what sort of
weird things that you're interested in
or maybe commenting on that maybe you
know that maybe the general public
doesn't know about her that other
companies don't know about and it's you
know the last thing you want to do is
get you may be unwanted phone calls or
uh no
did mail yeah there's basically it's
just it's really because there
are certain things that I hate more than
other things and one of the things that
I hate in life a lot is basically any
telecommunication or your wireless so
the cellular network you know company
like I hate all of them like I hate
comcast I hate verizon I used to hate
Adelphia before those guys went out of
business and and ended up going to
prison some of them like cox
communication your name anyone and like
they're just they're a terrible
experience they usually hire terrible
they have terrible customer service
they're overpriced to have a monopoly
they're just they're the worst man like
that and like either they probably are
the worst actually i hate verizon i hate
i hate comcast and i do have verizon
fios myself and fios is a great service
but i paid way more than I want to for
it obviously I mean we have to pay what
we have to pay but even with fios being
a good product i still hate verizon and
i'll be the first one to tell you that
so the thing that sucks to most about
this law and basically the similarities
that I find with what facebook and what
Google and other companies are able to
do with your data based on browsing
history is that you can opt out of those
things and you can also use ad blockers
and things like that to prevent you know
that that sort of unwanted attention but
with this law effectively what what it
was was the Obama administration was
trying to pass a law that was making
sure that ISPs and her internet service
providers we're not able to sell your
data without an opt-in like an explicit
meaning you specifically signed
something or electronically signed
something to say that you are
authorizing them to sell your data and
do with it we know what they did you
know really what they want to do with it
but the House voted today to repeal that
so while they're not necessarily voting
on a law to say hey this is what we want
you know to happen they effectively
stopped the the measure to prevent
something like that from occurring and
where that like I said that sucks
is because you can't opt out of it and
brought you know obviously these
internet service providers and they
don't even need the browser to know
which sites you're visiting and things
like that so it gives them a lot more
power to be able to sell your data they
can even sell you know maybe personally
they could sell things I can affect you
know effectively be used against you may
be threat of hacking attempt or just you
know maybe just you know through you
know exposure that you don't want you
know based on you know certain sites
that you might visit or whatever I don't
know but you know the bottom line is
that the more data you give to these
large corporations it's not like these
humongous telecommunication companies
need need more money I'm you hit
something like Comcast I mean I think
they merged with NBC or they wanted to
and they're like me talking about liking
what a 50 to 100 billion dollar company
you know we just want to give their free
reign on all of our browsing history so
they can make even more money and get
more of a monopoly on the data that they
have based off of you know they're
they're monopolies that they've had on
the cable you know type of cable markets
for what for decades so I don't know man
I think it's probably it's probably a
shitty thing i'm not an expert on it and
i consider myself an independent too so
I am middle of the road that's that's my
political views but I don't want people
spying on me and if you're going to spy
on me I at least want to be paid for it
or have the option to opt out all right
guys this video was sponsored by Deb
mountain coding boot camp so make sure
