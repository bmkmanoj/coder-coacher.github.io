elixir tutorial in this video I want to
look at how we actually combine two
different strings because this may not
jump out at anybody as being completely
intuitive it's relatively different i
would say compared to other programming
languages out there but let's say we do
we have variable named chris which
equals chris and i wanted to say you
know what I want I want Chris to I want
to add to Chris so how do i add to chris
do i do like Chris equals Chris or do I
say Chris plus more so that's how you
might think to do it but that's how you
do it in Erlang or elixir for that
matter so in order to be able to combine
these two strings like if I want to add
more decrypts and I'm going to say Chris
equals and then we can go ahead
reference our crisp variable and I can
give it a space and really I could just
even say was here and now you can see if
i type out Chris you get Christmas here
so essentially if I wanted to add two
different strings i could say Chris
equals and then here's my first nervous
sort of strange this is my first screen
and then I could go like that another
thing and then another open or another
less than and greater than sign and then
some more too tight so that's actually
how you can catenate a bunch of
different strings together in the elixir
language there's other things you can do
as well like there's an actual email
Moines method from within within elixir
you could actually use that if you
wanted to so using the enum join method
I could say something like genome which
is a built-in keyword within the elixir
language i could say join and then
inside these square bracelet resistors
where I could have my first string chris
is a and then another shrink big jerk
and you can see it returns chris is a
big jerk so if I want to sign that to a
variable X a X equals Christmas a jerk
and as I type X you can see that that's
what it get it and gets returned and if
I want to see what data type eyes x is
now you can see that's just a standard
string so even though we use benim join
it still is just say a way of actually
being able to join multiple strings so
it's interesting I mean because you
could have more stuff in here if you
wanted and this is this is helpful maybe
if you had a bunch of different strings
within like a list and you wanted to
actually take all the values in the list
and append them all together because
ultimately that's what enum that joint
is here this is just a list of values
now another thing to keep in mind is
that even though you can pass in other
values that are not strings but it will
be concatenated to a string so like if I
said space and then put in a number here
you can see that this all just gets
inserted as a string so X is still a
string it hasn't changed even though you
added an integer in there so just keep
that in mind when you use the email join
that it will actually just take all your
integers floats whatever it may be and
it will put them right into the string
and it would even do the same thing for
a goal which is our true and false so
it's somewhat interesting but those are
the two main ways of actually being able
to take strings and concatenate them
together within the elixir language our
guys thanks for watching make sure you
subscribe and have a good day and by hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intent of course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here and now for web development some of
the things that are actually teaching in
the 12-week course it's geared to get
you into the industry by focusing on
things like jQuery no jf react angular
how to use github so a lot of the things
that you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
coding boot camp and the entire goal is
to be able to get you into the industry
within 12 weeks so if you guys are
interested in learning more information
about Deb mountain coding boot camp just
check out the link in the description
tab of this video thank you for watching
and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
