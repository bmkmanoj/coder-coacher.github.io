second video of the beginning JavaScript
tutorial series for hipster code comm
and anytime you're writing code you need
to have something to write your code in
and that's called a text editor or it
can also be called an IDE which stands
for integrated development environment
an IDE does a lot more stuff than just
helping you write code it actually can
help you debug code and a bunch of other
things and that can sometimes be
overkill for somebody that's just
starting out so I recommend just using
the atom editor because it's completely
free it's open source it gets better all
the time and it works on multiple
distant different systems so just go
ahead and download this and install it
the next thing we need to do is we need
to actually be able to put our contents
or our our actual code into a directory
so that we know where it's going to be
housed and I'm gonna put everything in
my projects directory I have a hipster
code folder and then I have my beginning
JavaScript folder so all my JavaScript
files for this tutorial series are gonna
go inside of that folder so with your
atom editor once you have it open yet
you should have this blank page so if we
just said open folder we can select the
JavaScript folder where we just were so
go to our projects hipster code
beginning JavaScript and then we'll
select that folder now the first thing
we want to do let's create an HTML file
so an HTML needs to be used in order to
load your JavaScript HTML is the
skeleton of any sort of web page and an
HTML page always has a head and HTML
brackets always need to have a closing
by closing tag so if you have an opening
tag you always have a closing tag and
this is just your basic site so it's
just very very simplistic so inside of
our head let's go ahead and create a j/s
folder inside of our beginning
JavaScript folder here so I'm gonna say
I'm gonna right-click on this and say
new folder and I'll just say Jas which
is JavaScript for short and then here
we're going to say
I'll just call this video one so video
one I'm sorry Jay s because it's the
JavaScript file so javascript knows that
a JavaScript file is a JavaScript file
because of its extension so the
extension is the dot J s if it's an HTML
page the extends extension is a dot HTML
browser knows how to open it a dot HTML
and a browser knows how to execute
something that is a dot J s so there are
several ways of writing JavaScript code
a drama script code always goes inside
of a script tag if you're gonna have it
in the HTML page so it goes just like
that just an opening and close script
tag and if we said alert hello hipster
code
and then if we go to the folder where
our beginning JavaScript is it all we
should have to do is just double click
on the index and if Chrome is your
default browser or whatever your default
browser is this page should
automatically be open and we'll see that
that code executes so you can see hello
hipster code so just like we executed
inside the console we actually executed
right inside of our HTML page so that's
one way of including javascript in your
code is just having it inside a script
tag inside your HTML but it's actually
unlikely that you're gonna see that very
often in most cases you're gonna have an
external style sheet which is being
referenced by your HTML because it just
makes things a little bit cleaner to
deal with actually makes it a lot
cleaner to deal with so it's very easy
to do that we just have to say source
equals and this is gonna be the location
to where your your file is whatever
javascript file you're trying to link to
and then you just have to close off your
script tag like that so this is going to
reference this j/s fold and file that we
just created over here
and actually it's supposed to be video 1
so that wouldn't even be found because
we're missing the 1 so if we go into
video 1 let's go ahead and execute some
code in here
and now when we refresh the page hello
this is an external Jay s page so this
actually executed just like it did when
we had in our script tags inside the
HTML page but instead we're able to
isolate the code into its own file
making it a lot easier to deal with the
development of that net code this is
called an external external reference
now just to let you know how javascript
is loaded when the HTML page is rendered
it loads everything from the top to
bottom so it starts reading you know
this HTML tag and the head tag and then
it hits this script tag and it stops
what it's doing and it has to load this
page so if this page is really really
big or it's on a different server and it
takes a while to download your entire
page is going to be just blank while
this is loading up and the page has to
load and then it has to execute it's
going to execute everything inside this
page which in our case is just one alert
statement and then it's going to
continue with the execution of the page
so a lot of times what you see as you
see people they reference there there
they put their external references down
at the bottom just before the closing
body tag that way the entire HTML page
renders before it starts trying to reach
out and request a bunch of documents and
things that might take a little bit
longer to download so you'll constantly
see the external scripts at the bottom
of the page and that's the reason for it
now while we're in the JavaScript file
here this entire line here is called a
statement so statements exist in every
single programming language and they
basically just mean you know one it's
like one sentence basically and every
statement always ends in a semicolon
there are certain cases where the
semicolon is not necessary but those are
a rarity and in many cases it doesn't
hurt just to close the statement whether
or not you think it needs to have a
semicolon or not with a semicolon
because in many cases the page will
execution won't work without the
semicolon and then in a few you know
edge cases where you don't need it you
know you should leave that to you know
you're a very experienced JavaScript
developers or the people that try to be
crafty but ultimately you should just
have the semicolon when you're getting
started because it's just not worth
understanding you know when and where
you might be able to withhold it it's
just one single semicolon switch you
know you might as well just add it
because it'll save frustration so a
single line is that ends and a semicolon
is going to be considered a programming
statement in JavaScript there are things
called variables and variables can have
different values but let's look at a
variable that we're going to say
variable X equals 5 and we're going to
put a semicolon there and then we'll say
variable y equals 5 we'll say to put a
semicolon there this is a statement this
is a statement but what's interesting is
that this could also be said that it's
an expression because an expression in
JavaScript as any valid unit of code
that resolves to a value so we have this
variable X and we say it's value equals
5 so it's it's a statement and it's also
an expression statements can exit it can
contain multiple expressions and that's
something that the terminology will
sometimes be used interchangeably but
ultimately you just need to realize that
an expression is any valid unit of code
that resolves to a value so I could say
variable Z equals X plus y and then if
we alert Z to get the value we're
obviously gonna have a value of 7
so you can see seven and gets outputted
to the screen so in JavaScript these
expressions there can be multiple
multiple expressions in one statement so
if I wrap this in parenthesis which
means and just like it means in math it
means take precedence so solve that
first before you do anything else and I
can say times 3 so what's 7 times 3 21
this is two expressions here's one
expression here's another expression but
this is all one statement and you could
arguably say it's an expression to by
that JavaScript definition that we had
stated because ultimately this
expression uses two expressions to
resolve its value so it could be thought
of as an expression as well or a
statement but either way it's either
either phrase it doesn't really matter
but you will hear both of them used now
having the parentheses make this take
precedence is actually what it's called
in the language itself it says it's
called operator precedence and in math
and in JavaScript and most other
programming languages things like
multiplication is going to take
precedence over addition and subtraction
and if you have if you want like an
addition or a subtraction to be done
first and you obviously wrap it in the
parenthesis that way that expression
will be evaluated and before anything
else executes in JavaScript just like
that HTML page that we had looked at
before everything is evaluated from top
to bottom left to right so as this file
is read in it's gonna go this statement
first
this statement second this statement
third the statement fourth and it's
always going to read top to bottom left
to right so being that it's left to
right if we didn't put this in
parenthesis why would multiply by three
before ever trying to add you know these
two together so let's go ahead and look
at the outcome here and see and confirm
that it is 21 so you can see it's 21 and
that's because of the operator
precedence within our expression here
now if we remove
the parentheses we can see that the
outcome is completely different the
outcome is 11 and the reason why is
because the multiplication precedents
took place before the addition ever did
so you're going to see multiple
expressions that exist inside of a given
statement and if you want values to be
done first and that's how you do it you
need to keep in mind that everything is
top to bottom left to right and then you
can use the parentheses in order to
dictate who has precedence over what now
one of the things you may have noticed
is that we use the funny star symbol to
actually indicate multiplication so
that's one thing you're not to get used
to also there's the divide symbol which
means to divide and then you have the
plus symbol which is obviously addition
and then minus would be subtraction so
you have all these different these are
you know the different mathematical
values that mean addition subtraction
and those are called JavaScript
operators and JavaScript consists of a
ton of different operators that we can
get into but you have the modulus
operator increment and the increment and
then you have addition subtraction
multiplication division and then there's
a few other ones but let's go ahead and
just look at a few of these in action so
if we wanted to say Z equals we'll say Y
plus plus so the plus plus means
addition so just add one so you can see
the outcome is two and if you've ever
wondered why that is the case the reason
why is because this is an operator so
we've actually effectively said that Z
equals this this operator if we wanted
to use the the operator itself we need
to just simply say Z plus plus so Z
equals two in fact I could just simply
say two just like like we did with Y but
Z plus plus is actually going to
effectively use the operator to increase
it by one so now it equals three now you
don't have to use the plus plus operator
if you don't want to I mean you could
have simply said Z equals Z plus one and
you would have gotten the same outcome
of three now if we use the Z D increment
operator we would just say Z minus minus
and you can see it's now back down to
two we could say Z equals Z times four
so then we're getting confusing on what
Z is let's just keep it at two so two
times four is gonna make it eight
so hopefully you get the point here so I
would suggest that you go to the
operators and just check these out but
if for the most part you're going to be
doing a lot of addition subtraction and
multiplication division and then you're
gonna see occasionally the incremental
operators and then you'll see modulus
relatively uh I would say fairly rarely
in the real world depending on what you
do but for a typical web development I
rarely run into it all right guys I'm
gonna wrap up this second video and the
beginning JavaScript tutorial series for
hipster code comm and in this video we
looked at expressions statements what
the differences are technically also we
looked at what an operator is and what
order of operators were precedence takes
place when it comes to using those
operators whether it's addition
subtraction multiplication
and we also looked at some basic values
in the next video we're actually gonna
look at value types and JavaScript and
why they're important so thanks for
watching and please subscribe have a
good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
