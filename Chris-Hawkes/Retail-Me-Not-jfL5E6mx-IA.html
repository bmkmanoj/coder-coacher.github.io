their minds dude it's it's crazy
this company retailmenot I've known
about them for quite some time I've seen
them on the web and I actually despised
their product mainly because they like
there have been times that like when I
was first checking them out you know it
was like thinking oh great you know it's
like a coupon company I can go here and
get coupons and stuff like that but the
amount of spam and garbage that's on
their site like immediately turn me away
from using it because it's just it
seemed very spammy most of the coupons
were expired it didn't work most of them
are like misleading coupons like
people's affiliates and affiliate deals
and things like that so it's very
similar i would say that to like the
livingsocial and the groupons of the
world and where they try to almost like
force with force you know ZZ i would say
the business owners like the actual
stores restaurants and things like that
to take the product costs while they end
up you know scrape the money off the top
trying to send them traffic and and in
that regards I retailmenot apparently
did a pretty good job with that because
they're all over Google's so you search
for something and you see RetailMeNot a
lot of times when you're looking for
like you know the best deal on a
particular product for the most part so
I actually go to the companies
themselves now I'll use things like the
price line or I've used hotels com and
things like that I think those are
decent products but like when it comes
to like travel for instance a lot of
times i will just like i will just book
directly with you know the airplane
company whether it's like american or
even with the hotel chain I mean I
suppose like there's nothing wrong with
things like Priceline but at least was
like Priceline kayak and things like
that they're like legit sites for giving
you legit prices and you know a lot of
times you'll end up being sucked in and
and you'll end up you know having some
fees and stuff like that like that's
something that I would say a lot of
vacation resorts are very good at
they're like you can stay here for 3699
and it's four hundred dollars off and
then when you go to actually book it
there's like a thousand dollars in extra
toe
is that you know that if they don't
mention so that's the kind of misleading
stuff that I absolutely hate on the
internet because there's really there's
no need to do it and it's one of the
reasons why I hate buying new
automobiles because like they always try
to rip you off I mean everybody tries to
review i'll just give me the price let
us shop around that's why all these
comparison sites get brought up
everywhere and retell me not is
essentially the same thing they're
trying to give you like you know the
best deal and stuff like that to certain
places but their product sucks in my
opinion and it pretty much always has so
the the company itself i mean apparently
they go back quite some time i'm
surprised and the reason why I'm we've
been talking about them is because an
austin-based company actually I think
they're based out of San Antonio Texas
has just announced that they're going to
pay over six hundred million dollars to
buy retailmenot and I'm just like
immediately I'm saying I was like wow
like this is one of the most worthless
sites that i know of on the internet and
and they're going to get you know bought
for that type of money maybe people find
value and i'm clearly they have 249
million dollars in revenue but maybe
you're on front page of google for
almost every single search for different
retail stores and restaurants and things
like that it's not going to be hard to
make that kind of revenue even if you
have a terrible product so once again
I've never been a fan of this company
it's probably obvious at this point but
a couple things I want to really mention
the whole front page of Google thing if
you're on page one like you're going to
make money just on as you really are I
one time had a product review site i
really need to tell you guys a story
about this thing but i was making almost
one hundred dollars a day on ads around
christmas time just like because i was
on page one of a lot of different
products and things like that so there's
no question retailmenot to make a lot of
money even look a terrible product if
google's putting them on page 1 number 2
i'm a big fan of the washington capitals
and tonight i searched washington
capitals on my google screen this is
doomed and not a hundred percent on on
chrome here so you can see it's a
hundred percent right here and i'm
looking at like a bunch of blank white
space over here to the right and then
literally like the entire page as
google's content
this is there there add stuff that
they're being paid for from the
providers and then as I scroll all the
way down here then you get the number
one result which should be like the
number one it should be like at the top
you know what I mean but it's not then
you have this information that you
google is giving you the quick and you
know the quick and dirty about the
washington capitals and things like that
so why am i mentioning this i mentioning
it's because it's like the entire media
of like making money on on ads and
things like that is is just a complete
mess it's messier than it's ever been
adblock it certainly threatened
companies like like like Google even
YouTube I mean youtube revenue is down
across the board according to a lot of
different YouTube creators that I hear
from mines pretty much flat all the time
so it's not like it's anything to like
write home about or anything like that
but a lot of people that have made their
living on YouTube and stuff like that
like they're constantly being affected
by different of different plans and
things but I honestly like I think that
in the long term like we're so
accustomed to what an advertisement is
that like we just don't we don't click
on we don't we just don't care but yeah
this whole retailmenot saying man this
is this is insanity so it really it
shows you though that you can have a bad
product and if it's popular you can
still make a lot of money now i'm not
sure what the actual deals are they are
publicly traded company so i'm sure like
you know some people at the top are
going to get really rich and then you
know the ones that either typical your
associates and things will probably just
be absorbed by this new company and this
new company is most likely just buying
them for the ad space or just really the
easy search engine you know placement
potential because there is a lot of
money valued in that if google is going
to put for instance yelp comes to mind
yelp was recently complaining because
google was dropping some of their search
results and they rely upon google to
basically place them page one for
everything but if you've ever seen yelp
man yelp is another website that i
really don't like and the reason why is
because it's like seventy percent
just you know people ranting and people
that have a bad experience are much more
likely to leave a review than those that
have a good experience so Yelp in my
opinion is not nearly it doesn't it
doesn't paint the picture of what a
typical restaurant or a business in my
area should be and of course Yelp being
out of San Francisco California the only
thing cold I'll yell from my opinions
that they use Python but just another
product like I said that I'm just not
overly impressed with like we need
better products out there and you're
probably what products are good for us
well there are some good products out
there like you look at like the website
for for Disney like it if you go at
disney's website like for their resorts
and things like that i think that's a
very good website now I do think kayak
does a very good job of doing the actual
price comparisons and things like that
and giving you accurate pricing I think
like I think YouTube does a pretty good
job obviously of providing a platform I
wish they had more competition to be
honest with you sorry I have to think
about it for a little bit know a whole
lot comes to mind tonight I am
unimpressed with Google Maps there's a
lot of really good products out there
there really are and the web everything
but one of the things i want to point
out is just that this top like literally
what used to be like google would tell
you if you're doing ads and stuff like
that not to put a bunch of stuff above
the fold it's what they talk about or
like more than fifty percent of your
your your front page can't be like ads
and stuff like that but that like
they're breaking their own rules now and
I think the reason why they're doing
that is just simply people don't click
on ads man it's just it's just the way
it is like I have this hipster code
website I even pay people to write for
me and stuff like that this website gets
thousands of view is a week and doesn't
nobody clicks as it doesn't make hardly
anything like it's really just it's a it
doesn't make hardly anything so it
doesn't it doesn't make cost i can i can
assure you of that so so why don't
people click on the adds and to be
honest with you when was the last time
you click on an ad like I don't click on
ads because I know what an ad looks like
I don't even need ad blockers because
unless they're like pop
full in my face type of thing like I
really don't care I just kind of ignore
them like I'm when the internet was
first getting started like literally now
decades ago people weren't accustomed to
what an ad was and what regular content
was so you were always trying to be like
crafty about where you place your ads
and like sometimes now people are even
so crafty that they're almost like
deceitful where they place it on an area
that people click on I know I've seen
that I've seen that from major news
publications where they place an ad in
an area where like I did not click the
add but it still went and they got
probably a couple dollars on next flick
or something but that's just the kind of
deceitful stuff that we're kind of doing
in this whole modern modern way of
marketing and it's tough man the guy
obviously I have sponsors everybody's
trying to market their product everybody
wants to get their product out there the
company I used to work for Geico they
spend over a billion dollars a year and
advertising so it's like companies spend
a ton of money trying to get their
product out there they want you to think
of their product when when it comes time
to you know being in the market to buy
whatever it is that they're trying to
sell the problem that I see what the
internet though is like you read the
sequel companies like and then maybe
they're not exactly to see what I
probably shouldn't say that but
companies like retailmenot they
capitalize on hey we're going to give
you this free deal but then like they
don't stand behind that deal and if that
deal is incorrect it's not like retail
me not going to take some of their money
and be like you know what we falsely
advertise that we're really sorry look
here's five dollars off it you know Papa
John's or something like that on us
because we play we display something
that wasn't factual and that's the kind
of that's the kind of that's the kind of
world that I'd like to live in where
people literally like they stand up for
their product and they're they're like
hey if we're going to mention some stuff
on our on our website it's going to be
accurate Owen or we're at least going to
try to make it accurate especially if
you're kind of you're you're living off
of people's like dashing people's hopes
and dreams like to a lot of people
fifteen percent off at an amusement park
or something like that could literally
make or break whether or not they could
go on that trip and if you're giving
them coupon
like you're talking about maybe kids
that were excited to go with their
family on pain like this picture of like
a terrible company that's trying to be
deceitful but if you get my point the
point is is that there are certain
industries where it's like you can prey
on people and the dream of like making
money or getting like a special deal a a
few things come to mind with that really
there's these penny bid auctions if
you've ever heard of that it was one of
the biggest scams on the internet that
was a I wonder if they even do this
anymore so q bids in fact I believe
Cuba's at one point was even bought by
google they're probably not even around
because like how they are so here's look
at this Spanish like people are
paying a dollar to barter against other
products so every time this thing goes
up by one penny somebody paid a dollar
so if you can sell something for three
dollars you made three hundred dollars
and the item could be fifty dollars and
somebody could win it for a couple
dollars now it's a complete game of
chance that's gambling it's garbage
another thing is the whole make money
online like that whole entire genre like
I made a bunch of money doing this and
I'm going to teach you how to buy you
know how you can make a bunch of money
you just have to buy my book for 599
like it was a guy that was talking about
how he ended up making money like by
giving out a free DVD worry apparently
he did like eight dollars and shipping
and handling and he would make a few
dollars on each shipping and handling
deal so people you know they get a free
DVD but they'd have to pay for shipping
and handling heat you know sprayed the
dollar to off the top you do that to a
few million people you're a millionaire
so it's like those are the kind of
stories that come to my mind when I
think of you know products like
retailmenot or even even piracy like
there's a lot of piracy websites out
there that we're selling content you
know selling movies and streaming
services and things like that that
weren't even legit or legal and getting
people to think that you know the day
that they were and and it's kind of the
same thing like you're preying on
people's your natural natural want to
you know to purge
to purchase more things and you know
live a better life basically and if
that's your like your intention in your
like legit site and you're saving people
money and stuff like that that's great
but for me like I've tried retailmenot
several times and every time it was like
outdated coupons or the coupons were
expired all together or completely bogus
or some sort of an affiliate type thing
or like you know the same type of
coupons that existed on the company's
website anyway like you spend a hundred
dollars off you get you know you spend a
hundred dollars you get free shipping or
something like that so not on my list of
favorite companies man so customer
service has been dead for a long time
you know the industry is ripe for going
back a few decades and maybe putting the
customer first you know the customer
experience being loyal to your customers
like I feel like I'm relatively loyal to
my fan base for the most part I try to
like I do make money on my advertisers
like my sponsors and things like that
but you guys know you know that this is
uh this is what you know youtubers do in
order to make money and also to try to
expand their channel and to you know
honestly money motivates people and if
they're going to make money makes them
more enticed to try that you know to
produce content stuff like that so
that's just the realities of the world
but you know good good further
retailmenot people for making six
hundred and some million-dollar zhan a
product that i find pretty deplorable to
be honest but alright so that's just my
thoughts now here's a time for my
sponsors guys dead mountain coding boot
camp these guys are great I'm just
kidding no Deb Deb mountain is is a good
reputable company for boot cancer people
are having success and I don't have a
hard time actually saying that a lot of
people are you know they questioned like
my motives when I try to do something
like this but clearly dead mountain is
my sponsor I get money from them but I
recommend their product but they do have
a good product I work with two people
that have graduated boot camps and that
didn't have a college degree they went
to boot camps they were actually
bootcamp instructor is both of them and
they're both high paid professionals now
so I know that this is
working for people and honestly I hope
that it does because this in my opinion
is better for a lot of junior level
developers that are going to end up
learning a lot of skills and then having
to go to a four-year computer science
degree to make you know the next package
manager for for JavaScript or something
like that instead of you taking their
computer science degrees and maybe you
know doing some machine learning
artificial intelligence something that
requires a little bit more you know my
opinion advanced skill advanced math
type of type of type of work I would say
so for the most part web development
dominates the industry and web
developers make a lot of money it's very
difficult to be a web developer but at
the same time it doesn't require like
advanced physics and mathematics and
things like that so it's like why not
have boot camps out there that are
training people for the technology now
instead of all the clauses you
don't need at a four-year university
combined with a bunch of advanced math
you're not really going to use either
and then combined with a bunch of
outdated like Java courses and things
like that when everybody should be
learning about a reactant angular and
type script and es6 and things like that
so that's what buchan's do that's what
Deb mountains doing they have 12 and 16
week courses they offer online
assistance or not online assistance by a
housing assistance so you guys can check
them out of their description I always
say description danna it's the
description tab below and their link is
in the description down below my other
sponsor for this month is a site 123 so
these are another guys that I have an
arrangement with and they provide the ez
platform of being able to build a
website so if you're sure looking to
like build a website literally within
like an hour and have your product out
there to have your name out there on
some domain something that describes who
you are maybe a basic e-commerce
platform or you're like I said your
hands or your uncle is asking you to
build a website for them for their
landscaping business and like you don't
feel like dealing with that nightmare
you could refer them to side 1330 Billy
a you know moms you guys just pay ten
dollars set up your site hosted with
them I'm not going to do it for you
because I'm going to charge you 2500 but
say one two three you can get it done
yourself and granted you're not going to
have as much flexibility as writing
yourself we also not having spent two
years learning how to be a programmer
set up servers HTML CSS JavaScript mail
servers DMS forwarding domain purchasing
things like that all that says that the
fun stuff with being a website developer
and a business owner in today's day and
age so that's how to sponsors guys
thanks for subscribing you guys have a
good day and peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
