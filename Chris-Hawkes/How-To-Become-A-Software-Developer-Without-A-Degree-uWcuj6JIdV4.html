answering the question of how to become
a software developer without a degree I
get that all the time I know other
channels get that same question a lot I
think we've all tried to address it at
different times I've never personally
100% try to address it but this is more
of like 2018 where I'm at now as a
senior developer so I've actually had
the experience of hiring four associates
in fact one time I even interviewed a
developer that was going to be a manager
who would have been in charge of me
actually so that was an interesting
setup we ended up not hiring the guy but
they just like so I've had some
experience with actually hiring
candidates and things like that I've
seen how I've seen how people are
evaluated and it's not just about school
but I'll get into a few ideas here on
how you can actually get your foot in
the door without the degree obviously if
you have the degree you're not even
watching this you know this video you're
gonna apply and you're gonna get a job
eventually somewhere and then you build
experience from there but this is for
people that don't have that ability to
get their foot in the door so they have
to do much more work in order to get
that opportunity now that's what I did
and I was able to excel with it and I
never looked back so let's go ahead and
get into this here so how do you so the
simple fact that matters companies need
to know that you know when you what
you're doing college graduates they
actually don't provide that guarantee
but at least it does show that that you
know people have some sort of brain in
their head that they were able to go
through a four-year university and
finish something that they started I
think anybody that's gone to school and
myself included that didn't finish knows
that it's a tremendous amount of work
and you know people should be very proud
of that accomplishment but anyway
companies want to know that you know
what you're doing so how the do you
prove that and it's simple these days
you're gonna look at github and there's
gonna be even websites like Stack
Overflow
you're gonna have personal websites you
can easily go to you know something like
Wix calm or like building your own
website a virtual private host or
whatever the node AWS Asscher having any
websites like personal blogs on an azure
or AWS platform is going to be so much
more beneficial than
a wordpress on some sort of shared host
or something like that
but I would recommend like a wordpress
or Wix comm for the portfolio website
because there's no need to like reinvent
the wheel and build some huge
architecture just to have a basically a
single page app where you're showing
some projects and things that you've
worked on to try to make you more more
hireable and things like that obviously
you have other things you can be
creative like in my case I use YouTube
and after a couple of years I became a
relatively popular on this platform
closing in on a hundred thousand
hopefully one day and then there's other
things too so like Twitter once again
like you having a Stack Overflow profile
where it shows you're actually
interested in coding that's that's where
things I think can really be beneficial
as well because companies will take a
look at what your personal projects are
they're gonna look at your Facebook page
they're gonna look at your Twitter and
things like that they're gonna try to
figure out whether or not you have a
general interest in programming all the
best developers have an interest in
programming and it doesn't matter if
they have a degree or not that's the
simple fact the thing is is like not
everybody loves the program 24/7 even
programmers themselves don't like to
program 24/7 they don't eat and breathe
this stuff they know how to do their job
well enough to go home each day most of
the the cutting-edge companies they're
looking for kids that eat breathing and
you know just dream of this stuff 24/7
anyway so what else can you do you focus
on technologies that don't have a ton of
competition like I mean react is already
starting to have a lot of competition
but there's there's certain projects
like when react first came out like if
you were one of the first ones in the
door with that you started doing some
tutorials out there or writing some
blogs about how to use react or
answering some questions on Stack
Overflow that stuff is going to get
noticed and eventually you start to
become somebody that the companies are
going to reach out to because they're
gonna need talent and unfortunately
there's just not enough developers out
there that know these cutting-edge
technologies and because we're such herd
animals we're going to jump on those new
technologies and that's just the way
that this industry works and to be
honest with you it's it's very
beneficial for self-taught developers
and also people that have ambition to
learn
their own because you go out and you
build some websites using view j/s on an
azure platform or an AWS platform you're
gonna be hireable regardless of your
degree so that's that's that's my
opinion
focus on easier technology web
developments gonna be a lot easier than
like machine learning you're not going
to be jumping into tensorflow and
like that you're probably not going to
get an entry-level position using
tensorflow
even if you were like you know really
good at it like you'd have to be like
writing the book on that in order
for companies to hire you to work with
physicists and things like that and
other PhD candidates and things like
that so you focus on you know the
technology that doesn't require such
advanced degrees or age you know I guess
you know theoretical concepts and things
that that is just going to take you a
long time in a lot of structured
environment to actually learn the ropes
web development something you can jump
right in you learn some basic sequel
stuff that hasn't really changed a ton
since the end of the 70s 80s and things
like that and you're just gonna have a
much easier time getting that
opportunity so why is it so hard to get
your foot in the door once again it's
because companies simply in fact most
college grads coming out of college that
I've seen that that started working for
a company they can barely code it takes
them usually six months or so before
they start hitting the ground running
they usually know enough about coding
though and have done enough coding to
where when they're doing it day to day
six you know six months in they become
pretty good and you can see some some
major advancement and things like that
there's still nowhere near like a senior
developer or an architect or anything
like that but but right out of college I
mean they they simply just send out a
code most people aren't coding and doing
a bunch of personal pet projects and
stuff in college so that's at least the
experience that I've seen in the Queen
and the cooperating on fortune 500 world
environment so hiring software
developers at Nero or excess of a
hundred thousand years very costly for
companies they want to get it right and
once again college grads you know they
want to know that these these kids can
learn on their own so that being a
college graduate I think kind of implies
that they do have the brains to be able
to learn on their own but even junior
developers are being hired at rediculous
rates I know an
I have a friend of mine who has a
daughter that recently graduated college
and ended up getting a job at Amazon in
Northern Virginia and had a base salary
of 90,000 right out of high school so
I'm not high school I'm sorry college
but she ended up hating it over there
but play she had that opportunity at
ninety thousand years so even Amazon
obviously can afford it but you know if
Amazon is paying ninety thousand even if
Joe Blow you know calm or whatever is
trying to compete and have good talent
he's gonna have to pay that same amount
of money if Amazon right across the
street is paying that kind of money and
a lot of times they can't so they'll be
five or ten thousand less and then they
have to come up with more creative
solutions to to try to you know work
from home whatever things like that but
the fact that matter is it that that
they certainly can't afford to miss out
and having an employee that works for
them for six six months makes fifty
thousand dollars and doesn't do jack
 you know so that's what they're
trying to avoid so what other options
you have you can check out coding boot
camps like my sponsor Deb mountain
coding boot camp they're had it's at the
end of this video their link is in the
description tab below and they are
building an entire courses that are just
simply built for newbies getting their
foot into the industry they know what
these these these companies are hiring
for these companies are actually working
with them to say hey we need these
people to know this this and this and
that's what they're focusing on so that
way it's enough for them to be
self-sufficient when they first start
and then they'll be able to expand and
grow really really quickly just like a
college grad would be able to to grow
and a lot of times you know with these
coding boot camps - they're finding
people that actually have a great
motivation to learn but not everybody
does in fact I have known a few I have a
few buddies of mine that were coding
boot camp instructors and one of the
things that they didn't like was that
some of the people did go in there just
thinking that they could pay ten
thousand or whatever for a coding boot
camp and that they were guaranteed a job
and that's actually not the case so if
you're going to go to a coding boot camp
you still have to have an interest in
programming and you want to be serious
about it so I would make sure you have
that interest before you pay ten
thousand dollars and find out it's not
for you
so certification is an online web site
such as Coursera also and
the opportunity Coursera has a bunch of
free courses I've seen people list those
certificates on and LinkedIn so and and
I've actually seen companies evaluating
those certificates as well when it comes
to hiring people so those are just some
of the opinions that I have in 2018 on
how you can become a self-taught
developer or get your foot in the door
and thanks for watching guys make sure
you subscribe bye
so this video was brought to you by Deb
mountain coding boot camp they're a boot
camp that is based out of Utah but
they're also in Texas in Arizona now and
they have very good reviews so make sure
you guys check them out the link is in
the description tab below they offer
courses in web development iOS
development UX or user experience design
Quality Assurance and just a few other
ones in fact they're even getting into
Salesforce as well now so they're
continuing to adapt their courses based
on what the market needs are and major
companies are hiring some of their
alumni so make sure you guys give them a
look they have great reviews and thanks
