we talked about what state is and I
mentioned that properties and state are
different state is when you're dealing
with mutable data meaning data that can
change and that needs to be monitored
for updates you would want to use state
any other type of data that is static
and doesn't change you would want to use
properties now properties are immutable
so you cannot change them once they've
been declared so please keep that in
mind in this video I want to go ahead
and add a component to the previous
component that we had created and we're
going to show you how to render that
component inside of another component so
just like we did before in this
particular case let's go ahead and we're
create the actual band component so
let's go a variable band equals react
create class
remember it always has a render function
and then this is going to be let's see
you know I'm going to the return like we
talked about before and this will just
return an h2 was this stop props that
name and then an image
and then once again you can't these are
two siblings to each other so you have
to have that wrapped in akin an outer
outermost div or at least some some sort
of outer most content block alright and
now you'll notice that these are
referencing this top props and props get
passed into the component from the
parent so in order for that to happen
what we're going to do is we're gonna
have this band component underneath this
event here we're gonna actually have it
render a band component here just like
we did with this on our react render so
let me go ahead and demonstrate that
this is going to be band and now since
this thing is referencing properties
that aren't there that's going to be a
problem so it's looking for a name and
an image property so since we're
referencing this band component that we
just created we need to go ahead and add
those properties in there so we're gonna
say name equals for right now let's just
say Bayside and then image equals and
then this should be like a link to an
image for right now I'm just gonna
actually you know it a second let me get
in it alright so I'm just gonna point an
image to the lead singer of Bayside
since that's the only band that we have
in our database right now and you can
see here that this is an actual band
component so let's go ahead and take a
look at what we got going on here
so you have the title and the image that
was passed down to it based on those
properties that we just defined so if
you look at this element here that got
displayed this is part of the band
component here that got declared with
the HT that we defined in the image and
the data that was passed to it was
passed from its parent which is located
up here and where you can see that we
had the inline style object that we had
attached to it so it's pretty cool you
could have you know tons of elements and
things like that we basically define
your template so you pass in the data if
the data doesn't change then you can
just use props if the data is going to
change you want to use state and once
again this image and all that stuff
didn't have to be rear-ended because of
the component changing the component had
an internal component that was listening
to its state and it didn't have to
re-render this stuff which is pretty
cool so makes your page very responsive
and very awesome when it comes to making
dynamic stuff
alright so most of the time though
you're not going to pass static data in
like this you're actually going to be
passing you know like JSON data or
something like that so like if in most
cases you're gonna call an API and we're
gonna get into that in a different video
but for right now it's go ahead and just
say variable
bands equals and this is gonna be an
object where we have a bunch of stuff so
we're gonna have name base eye image
so I went ahead and I just created some
fake Jason data and this actually should
be in square brackets so this is just a
jason list of individual objects here
that are defined so it's three different
bands and if we wanted to iterate
through that and normally like I said
this would be coming from like a Jason
call returning a bunch of Jason data but
that we'll get into in a different video
but if we wanted to go ahead and render
this like in a list and a for statement
then we can do that but since we're
calling JavaScript code we have to
actually do that inside there curly
braces like I showed you before and the
way I can reference is I can actually
reference it with it some global name up
here under bands and I could say bands
dot map function and we pass in band
and then we can actually do the same
thing we're gonna copy in this band
object
and instead of referencing this static
data we're in a reference band name
and this is Van Daan image in fact on
this needs to say this stop props that
bands not map and you're gonna notice
that right now there is no that would
actually give you an old reference error
because there is no props and in order
to actually get the data to the band
component what we need to do is we need
to give it a variable just like we did
with the band we're gonna say bands
equals bands so we find the the bands in
the global namespace up at the top and
we just pass it into the band component
since the data's it doesn't need to be
changed it doesn't need to subscribe to
its state or anything so we just want to
reference that as property so we pass it
in as a simple data object and then we
reference that as a property that was
passed in and hopefully this will work
oh and I did some sort of type over here
oh yeah I actually broke my rule that
I've been telling you guys about forever
with the curly braces this needs to be a
curly brace I knew I was going to do
that
and the final thing that we need to do
now that we've passed in the band's
second component and we're iterating
through it we actually need to wrap this
in a return so this is a standard
JavaScript and it's calling this with a
separate react component and it's
passing in the data for each band so
anyway once we wrap that into a return
and we upload this it'll iterate the
reach band inside the Jason list there
and show the bands inside
all right so it's pretty cool
and we're gonna wrap up this video here
but that is the basic explanation of
properties properties are passed down
from parent to child child references
them properties don't change if they do
need to change then they need to be
stored in state and I probably should
have said this in a previous video but
if you're wondering where states should
be stored typically you want to do most
of your state manipulation and the
outermost component as possible so you
know I try to keep it all within the top
parent component and then just pass pass
it down through the children as needed
but anyway so we're gonna go ahead and
in the following videos we're gonna
touch on how to actually connect to our
database and pull that information down
via an ajax call and render the
components from the adjacent from the
server as opposed to static data typed
into the the source code alright guys
