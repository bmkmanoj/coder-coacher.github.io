titled isomorphic javascript is
overrated the reason why I feel that way
is that I have a website here that i am
using it's a django based website so we
know that django doesn't really use
isomorphic javascript because it's
written in python it doesn't need to it
doesn't need JavaScript it runs on the
server but Django has a built-in
templates engine so on a typical Django
website you're getting a template that
is a bunch of HTML down so when the when
the search engine like Google goes out
to try to index your page to see what
the content is about they're going to
get the full HTML and text and odd stuff
from the Django server now if you have a
django server that that sends down a
bare-bones template though that has
maybe react code like react components
and things that are going to end up
being rendered once the java script
executes then that's where you have a
problem because then you don't have your
typical paragraphs inside of P tags and
Google doesn't ought to read emphasis
and all this other things so Google
though has been saying for a long time
that it has the ability to execute
JavaScript so that it knows what your
content looks like after the JavaScript
has rendered and that's very very
important a lot of people were very very
suspect of that they didn't think that
Google really had that ability I mean
whether or not being or yahoo has the
ability on their own nobody really cares
because yahoo is pretty much done and
nobody uses bing everybody is using
google but for those who probably do use
Bing you're probably fine there as well
but that's a Google is the one that is
most important because they provide
modes like sixty seventy percent of all
search traffic out there so they're
saying that they can execute the
JavaScript and actually I'm going to
show you an example of something that
proves that they actually can at least I
think it does so one of the things I
want you to take a look here if I
actually view the source code to this
page you see that on the page itself
that there are paragraphs and things
like that this is all you know it's it's
an HTML format so if I right click and I
inspect in this just to show you guys
it will take me to the source so you can
clearly see that there are P tags and
everything in there now if we view the
source of the page the actual content
everything you see is right there div ID
blog that's it there's not there's
nothing else there there's no HTML or
anything like that so people said well
search engines can't read JavaScript and
when they get the page they're going to
get div ID blog and they're not going to
know any of this content they're not
going to know what this article is about
they're not going to read all this stuff
or anything so they think that it hurts
your search rankings and the truth is
that it actually doesn't because what
ends up happening on this page is that
once it's loaded javascripts going to be
executed and then the body of the page
is going to end up getting turned into
all of this stuff so this HTML and
everything doesn't need any sort of
isomorphic rendering on the server to be
passed out Google indexes it just fine
and here is an example of something that
proves that so here is how when I tell
Google to request this page it shows you
what the visitor sees and also what the
Googlebot showed so when we look down
and we see the Googlebot you can see
that the Googlebot doesn't actually
render its own adsense or anything or
even it's the YouTube video so that's
fine but you can see that the exact text
here is actually being indexed by Google
just fine it's the same text and
everything that the user sees so so that
is good news for all website owners out
there you don't need any sort of
isomorphic complication added to your
server side stack in order to execute
JavaScript on the server and pass it
down there's no need for it and when I
say that there is complications there
truly is I built a landscaping website
for somebody and I did I decided to do
it in no jjs and then I use them react
and I was like well let me look at all
this you know this isomorphic hype and I
was you know this before I was like
getting really burned out on some of the
JavaScript at hype but I went ahead and
I went through the motions and I
installed some additional plugins for
expressed in order to actually execute
the JavaScript I change the template
handling so that it new ad
handle the j sx and everything and I did
all that and the site was it was super
fast which is good it was actually
probably faster than your typical Django
sack with and again there wasn't nearly
as much going on with that site it was
just a Content site there was no
authentication or quizzing or anything
like that and it was a single page
actually was it doesn't get any simpler
than what that website was but the point
is is that I went through all this extra
headache and when I had to go ahead and
service that thing the other day I
looked at it and I'm like well never
would have been like a year since I
touched it and then number two I'm like
oh damn what is all this stuff you know
I'm like I had all this crap that I
added that I didn't need to add and now
I have this website that I built for
somebody for free which never do that by
the way and then number two like I just
it's now a headache so eventually I'm
going to end up you know pulling all
that out and i'll probably do it a
different way in fact I might even use
my own base ijs framework but you know
this this whole isomorphic craze i think
is just another hype hype buzzword that
we really need to just pump her brakes
for a moment and ask ourselves is it
really necessary that my stack has to be
and something else or that I need to
execute my nodejs before passing it to a
the person requesting the page all right
guys let me know what you think and
thanks for watching make sure you vote
up the video and I appreciate that take
care good night hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
wanna take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12 week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here and now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp and
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
