examine the the this keyword and the
JavaScript programming language this is
something that actually trips up newbies
a lot in many cases you're not gonna
have to deal with the disky board too
much when you're using just basic jQuery
or implementing a plugin or something
like that but as soon as you start
getting into complex JavaScript
development sooner or later the this
keyboard and a lack of understanding is
eventually going to bite you so I have a
jsfiddle session pulled up but before I
even type into jsfiddle I want to go
ahead and just right-click and inspect
I'm using the Chrome browser and inside
my console panel I just want to go ahead
and type to this keyword you're gonna
see that this keyword is going to
actually return the window object which
is the global object so whenever you
hear a pollution in the global namespace
and all that stuff that's what it's
talking about whenever you're adding and
attaching things to this global scope so
in this particular case and this is the
window object and the this keyword guys
is always going to be an object so if
it's not an object and and the one
example of it not ever being an object
is if you're in strict mode so let's go
ahead and take a look at an example of
what happens with this keyword when we
actually create a function so we're just
going to create a variable named my
function and the function is just going
to return it to this keyword
all right so now when we execute my
function actually you have to call it as
a actual method there it returns the
global scope so you can see even though
because we actually created my function
and it's attached to the window object
so if we looked at the window object and
we score all the way down to the bottom
you can see that there is my function
defined there so we've attached this to
the global namespace and we polluted our
global namespace so by doing that though
you can see that because it's executed
from the global namespace that actually
returns the window object as its this
now this can actually change though and
that's where this actually trips people
up depending on how its executed which
is called the context of how it's
executed so let's go ahead and create an
object in JavaScript and we'll just call
this JavaScript jack equals just a plain
JavaScript object so curly braces now we
can attach something to it so we'll say
JavaScript object and then we'll say X
and we'll attach our function to it so
we're gonna say func my function so what
I've done now is if we look at
JavaScript object and then we can see
it's an object we created it but now
there's this this x value and the x
value is a function so keyboard x value
function and the function will return
this so when we execute this now we're
going to call it a javascript object dot
X and then we call it as a function
because that's what it is so the
interesting thing to note here is that
when we call this that the this object
that's being returned from the function
that is the x value here is the disc
actually changed to something else they
actually pointed to and the the the
object from which it was executed in so
that's so but if we would have just ran
that from the global namespace or from
the window object then it the this value
would have been assigned to the window
object but since it was executed from
the JavaScript object that is the object
that gets returned to us with this
keyword so one thing to note which is
something I'm going to borrow from
Mozilla is documentation that this
keyword since it's excellent and this is
definitely a part that throws people
through a loop but we're going to look
at a exact example that they have where
we say variable o equals and this is a
JavaScript object with a value F and F
is a function and the function returns
this dot a plus this dot B and then we
close off that so variable oh it was an
object and I'm going to say variable P
equals object create now object dot
create in JavaScript actually is is
going to fire the constructor of the
object so it actually fires that it news
up the object and it will set its this
value so now that we've created this
this P object if we say P dot a and if
we notice here P dot a is obviously so
we're adding this this you know this
value to the P object and you can see
that F actually references this dot a
and this dot B and so we're going to go
ahead and we're setting those now so
that's that's what we're going here and
we'll just say 1 and then P dot B equals
4 so we now have these two values 1 and
4 and if you look at what F does F even
though it's attached to the o object it
returns this dot a plus this table dot B
so when we go ahead and we run this from
P will say P dot F and then execute it
as a function and it returns 5 and
what's interesting to note is that this
dot a and this not be obviously it
wasn't even defined at the time that
this object was created so that's one
interesting thing another thing too is
that o has a F value which is obviously
the function that uses those two values
when we create a P object from our
objective is not even attached
to our our P object but it can still
reference it so we we attach to values P
dot a and P dot B so a and B to the P
object and then we call P dot F and P
dot F was able to reference this you
know a and B which we defined down here
and it's really it's really interesting
feature of how JavaScript uses its
prototype inheritance in order to be
able to find values that are attached to
this object but more importantly it's
interesting to note that this refers to
the method of which the the function was
called so it didn't matter that P didn't
have an F F exists on an object that's
that's not even attached to P it exists
on this Oh object and the fact is is
that even though there's a there's a
prototype in chain that links to the o
object from P and the method is being
called on that o object that this is
still assigned to the p value or to the
p object because p was the meant of the
object of which the method was called
and not where the method is located so
that is hard I think for a lot of people
to wrap their head around because look
let's look at the p object here there's
no F so that means how did it find F
okay well let's look at the object okay
let's look at the prototype now remember
everything in JavaScript or objects
stamped out and they're all connected to
each other in this you know this this
complex tree through their prototypes so
if we look at the prototype of this
object which is P its prototype has the
fi you can see that's where it's
actually getting the F object it's
getting it from its the prototype which
points to the o object that we defined
up here so even though o o object
actually holds the method that was being
executed it didn't change the this to
the O and most people think that this
should change to the O because of the
first example that I showed you guys so
that's actually not the case
it's it's the the method of which the
object is
or the method it's the object of which
the method is being executed so I know
that that is complex it's it's it's
difficult to wrap your head around but
in the next video I actually want to
talk about why this is significant
because we're going to look at a new
feature of Xmas crate at miskova script
6.0 but it's the latest standard of
JavaScript which is being adopted
through all the the newer browsers and
they call them evergreen browsers but
chrome is always an evergreen browser to
always support some of the latest stuff
and and it supports this new syntax that
I'm going to show you in the next the
next video and it relates to this this
particular example so that this keyword
is is a bit to wrap your head around you
should play with it in a console window
I think because it's definitely
interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
