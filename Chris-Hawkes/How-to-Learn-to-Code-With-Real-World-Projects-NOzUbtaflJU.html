question here from max and I think it's
a pretty good question so I went ahead
and tried to make a video out of it and
he says thanks so much for your hard
work knowledge share and you're welcome
I look forward to with great interest
your frequent video content I was
wondering whether you could offer some
counsel on two points of interest number
one age and your professional experience
are people over 40 less likely to get
coding jobs than their younger
counterparts
number two real-world projects all this
learning is fantastic but the struggle
seems to be taking this newfound
knowledge and actually doing something
of value with it in a real-world
environment outside of vanity website
projects learning is often or he says in
a real world a real world environment
outside of vanity website projects I'm
not really sure what that is but he says
how learning is often a solitary pursuit
how can one get involved in a community
or social initiative in order to start
writing live code in context with
real-life application or purpose truly
appreciate any thoughts you might have
on these topics Cheers max so thanks for
the question max and I've actually
talked about this in quite a bit of my
videos but we look at age and whether or
not that does get you know play into
whether or not you can get a job and
some people have even said it sounds
like I'm against like younger younger
ages and younger programmers and things
for what we call you know this you know
you know this hip startup community I'm
really the post Facebook community where
everybody wants to be the next
Zuckerberg the next you know
billion-dollar youngster who starts a
social hot website a lot of people don't
really look into you know some of the
lock-in some of the factors that go in
there's somebody like Zuckerberg you
know getting to that success status but
you know ultimately everybody wants to
be like him so we have all these
entrepreneurs and a lot of younger guys
and I mean girls obviously too and and
then you have like the programmers and
stuff where it's like now hip and cool
to be a programmer and like I mean so
you look at all these different things
and there's this entire image that you
know you have to be young and hip to be
a good programmer and that's actually
not true so if we look at um like
different so we've talked about
different you know reasons why younger
developers are more attractive to a lot
of different
companies one of the main issues that
I've talked about in the past is the
fact that younger programmers are more
expendable there you can pay them less
amount and then a more experienced
developer they'll tend to work more
hours for less money or for stock
options sometimes they can be taken
advantage of sometimes it is the simple
fact that they are you know I mean I
wouldn't say smart or anything like that
but you know they might be more
well-versed in some of the latest
standards like web standards and and you
know being fresh out of college maybe if
they're doing a lot of you know complex
mathematical crunching you know maybe
there's some sort of appeal there but in
most cases I think what we see is that
we see program companies they they go
out and they hire the younger developers
for those reasons that I mentioned they
don't have families they don't have the
experience and you can pay them a lot
less and and you know that's one of the
main reasons however our valued
developers if you're a good developer
you're gonna be able to get a job or be
able to make money in this industry or
at least you should be able to with no
problems at least I think so so I'm 34
so in a way like if somebody thinks that
I'm you know I'm hostile towards younger
developers it's really not the case but
anytime you have a situation where there
is like a a mindset that you know as of
like as a 40 year old that you're
somehow old and that you can't code
anymore is it mean it's absolutely
ridiculous so if there's a mindset out
there then obviously I would be against
that mindset and I think that that
mindset is real I think it does exist
and I think that there are companies
that are definitely ageist and and they
don't even hide it I've mentioned before
that Zuckerberg when he was younger when
he was first starting Facebook he
actually went on record to say the young
people were just smarter I actually did
a video about that but we know it's not
the case and and for all the reasons
I've talked about yes ageism does exist
in the workplace and you know what if if
people want to be pricks and just hire
younger developers and you know it might
be a good opportunity for the older guys
to get in and and show these youngsters
what's up I guess but you know there's
there's money to be made for everybody
the social success that we see from like
Facebook and snapchat and that kid who
raised like 800 million dollars per
snapchat I mean you
you hear about all that stuff and you
and you hear about it every day so it
seems like every company's like that but
it's really not there's niches all over
the place that you can make money
some people say niche I say niche some
people say niche
I don't yeah I call it niche but anyway
there is opportunity to be had all over
the place so are you a good business
person do you have any sort of business
ideas and yeah I think you you will be
able to find a job and you know what you
know start a competitive competing
company against some of these younger
companies you know they shouldn't be
able to to dictate and call all the
shots on where technology's headed so I
think that you know ageism exists but
you can work around it number two real
world projects all this learning is
fantastic but the struggle seems to be
taking this newfound knowledge and
actually doing something of value with
it in the real world environment so I
guess what you're saying you're saying
is that when you read maybe blogs or
you're reading out of a programming book
that you're not getting the whole
higher-level concepts of programming but
I can tell you that that's not unusual
so for the longest time like I remember
one time when I was first getting
started in Perl I had this you know Perl
by example book or something along those
lines it was a pretty good book but it
essentially each page in the book was
teaching about in the independent
concepts like lists and hash rays and
things like that
and and from an individual page level
perspective when you're reading it you
know say you're just you know sitting
down at your desk and you're happen to
be reading it and you're like oh yeah
okay so yeah that's how you do that
and it seems like you know you make it
makes sense so then you move on to the
next page and you're now you're like you
know 10 15 20 pages in you've learned
all these different concepts you're not
really taking any of those concepts and
actually you know putting them to work
because you're not actually coding
anything so what do you do well I mean
you start by having a goal every every
programmer should have a goal of what
they're trying to accomplish so that way
you can you you should be able to say
you know I want a webpage and when you
talk about vanity web pages I'm assuming
you're talking about like content
related sites and there's nothing wrong
with that so if even if your your goal
was like you know what I'm gonna start a
wordpress blog and I want to get it
online and I so I mean as a programmer
there's it this is more of like a DevOps
you know programming
but there's no reason why you as an
individual developer can't do this but
there's a definite process there where
it's like even if that is your goal you
still have to figure out hosting you
have to figure out domains
you know DNS forwarding there's a lot of
stuff there that you have to figure out
you obviously have to you know so then
you have a place to upload your codebase
and you can obviously download WordPress
and apply some theme or something like
that and ultimately your vanity website
is up well maybe that you know that's
your first goal okay so now I have a
wordpress blog up there that I can you
know showcase and be like you know I
have this website it's mine so that
doesn't make you a great developer no
but you know there is experience
involved there's and then the next goal
would be like you know what let me use
something like Django or Ruby on Rails
now I'm going to now use this to build
another website and instead of relying
on WordPress to do so much for me I'm
gonna you know focus on on doing this or
that so you know there's a lot of
different small steps that you should
have but you should have a goal in mind
so when you're first getting started
programming though it's really difficult
to try to grasp grasp those higher-level
concepts of how to design and structure
your software in fact that's a lifelong
career development thing and you know
even for me seven years in I don't look
at I would say that I have a lot like a
ton to learn when it comes to
architectural development so in many
cases like yeah I make design mistakes
all the time and and and it's just
natural but once you get your feet wet
and you just start trying to achieve
individual goals you'll see a lot of
growth so for instance just recently
I've been working on this hipster
koat.com website I threw it up there
like weeks ago and then I haven't really
done anything with it but I do have some
plans for it because I like to keep
myself busy and just today I went ahead
and you know I uploaded some of the
stuff that I've been working on over the
last like a couple weeks just you know
here and there and and come a couple of
the things I needed to work on is like
for instance I have this log in so I
needed to figure out okay how do i
integrate with Google login so that is a
task in of itself you know so if you've
never done oh oh or something like that
there's tools and and and tutorials and
everything out there that will help you
through the process
but there is going to be some
head-scratching moments some you know
cussing and swearing if you're the type
to do that of trying to get everything
set up and working correctly because
there's a lot of different concepts that
have to come together to just even be
able you know to log into a website
using Google so I added something like
this now I have this profile system so I
extended the Django off system and you
can see that I got some issues I
definitely have some issues going on
with this thing but the code base here
there's um there's a lot going on with
this website now so I recently added a
whole new feature where I'm gonna be
doing quizzes and things like that and
there's going to be certifications on
the website and it's something just kind
of a higher level concept that I plan on
developing more and more but my goal was
okay how do I get a quiz application out
there that allows me to you know to
basically how do you even build a quiz
application but I was using react and
then part of using react is that I
decided that I was going to use
something called web pack and web pack
was going to create my bundling and a
lot of this stuff you're never going to
know when you're first getting started
but the thing is is that as programmers
we always try to challenge what we knew
before and what you know and how do we
extend it and take it further so let me
just give you a demonstration of what
some of this code here does so basically
if I show you what I was working on here
this is just some you know basic test
here that was just playing around with
just a sample test but I built like a
tool to actually build a fill in the the
test and that it posts to the server and
lets you know what you did wrong and all
this stuff so if I submit it you can see
it's I got a score of 40 just guessing
and then if you look at highlights the
questions that you have wrong and stuff
like that so I've never actually done
anything like that before and from a
user experience perspective it looks
like crap so I'll admit that you know
definitely looks like crap but
functionally I was just trying to look
at you know how do I build a quiz how do
I actually post it up how do I do it in
react I'm using webpack actually you
know using Babel and stuff like that so
the point is is that you have to have
small set goals that you should have and
you start off very small and it
it's vanity websites you're speaking of
which I'm like I said I'm assuming it's
content related sites you start with
that and be happy with that and then
build you know data scrapers how do you
get your data how do you start sifting
through data maybe build a simple
application where like you're putting in
commands from like just a command line
so learn about commit argument variables
that you can pass into your program that
do certain things like you know check
your email for you or you know basically
you should just you know find some sort
of thing that you want to accomplish and
then set out to do that and it's gonna
be hard and difficult but I mean that's
where you learn and grow the most all
right so I mean you asked about how you
get involved in a community or a social
initiative in order to start writing
live code well I mean I don't know that
you really need to have a community in
order to do that if you don't have
enough skills and you're really not
gonna be able to jump into some complex
project on github it's not like you're
gonna be able to join the react team or
something like that and I think that
you'll probably just be spinning your
wheels even trying to look at some of
those code bases and trying to figure
out what those guys are doing but as far
as like meetups and stuff like that I
mean there's always you know these
youtube channels like myself or many of
the other youtube channels you can try
to view to look for motivation there's
always like meetup comm like if you're
trying to look for certain areas where
there might be meetings if anybody wants
to get something together
I mean I would be interested in working
with not just other youtubers but
probably with the community itself and
trying to do some maybe collaborations
and just discussions and everything but
ultimately you have to find the
motivation from within yourself to you
know try to set these goals and to
accomplish your goals don't set them too
high that's well it's something that all
developers seem to do they try to you
know do way too much and and it just it
never really helps anything you want to
dream big but at the same time you set
those goals very small to you know to
show that you are making
you know accomplishments because even if
it does seem small and insignificant it
really isn't and any sort of growth is
good so anyway guys let me know what you
think and thanks for their question max
I wish you the best and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
