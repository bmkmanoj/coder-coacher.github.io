thought I'd take a moment to address
some of the questions you guys have
regarding my latest video so a lot of
you guys were surprised that in my top
10 programming languages for 2017 that I
chose to put c-sharp on top I believe
last year's video I don't remember
exactly where it was I think I had
c-sharp at like 4 or 5 I believe it was
4 however what I wanted to just talk
about a few of the things as far as why
I put c-sharp there and it's not because
I'm a Microsoft fanboy or that I do
everything in c-sharp because I really
don't if you guys know I mean I've done
a lot of Django work in fact my newest
website hipster code is all written in
Django and Python so I love Django and
Python I love the money that it saves me
to be able to run a full stack on a
Linux host and just you know not have to
worry about Asscher or licensing costs
and things like that that are typically
associated with a company like Microsoft
not to mention Microsoft pisses me off
day in and day out like every day I
usually curse Microsoft at least once so
this is coming from somebody that gets
just as frustrated everybody else when
it comes to like their program is just
not working the way that they're
supposed to for probably 10 years now
the ideal solution whatever Visual
Studio starts acting up is just to
restart it that's always like the
highest upvoted answer on Stack Overflow
oh it doesn't work it's doing some crazy
 just restart it it'll be all fine
again you know that's that's
unacceptable but you know if you're a
Microsoft Visual Studio developer over
the last decade that's just par for the
course that's just what we do so why did
I put c-sharp at the top of the list
well it boils down to really two
languages that I think deserve to be on
top this year as opposed to last year
really it's Java or C sharp so I know
that that's like the age old crap that
we've been talking about for decades now
but the point is is that there's a lot
of enterprise development being done in
either dotnet or in the Java world so if
I were going to choose between the two I
personally
for c-sharp much better now all of this
is just one man's opinion
however I've done some research into the
matter I've actually written a decent
amount of Java and I've written a ton of
c-sharp and I find c-sharp to be head
and shoulders better than what Java
provides but they're both very very
similar languages they're both they're
both statically typed or which you can
consider strongly typed they are both
object oriented languages like
completely object oriented not like both
procedural and object-oriented like a
Python language on they are strictly
object oriented languages they both have
their own runtime environments like the
Java has the JVM and the C sharp or
dotnet environment has the CLR common
language runtime so they're very similar
in the fact that you're supposed to be
able to write regarding you know with
the.net language like if you're writing
in c-sharp then it should just work
wherever you have dotnet installed
ideally but none of that stuff ever
works all that well there's always some
headache especially when you start
getting into packaging software you're
going to always run into some you know
situation where it's like oh I don't
have the right version of.net installed
in my customers machine and it's messed
up and all this stuff but that's not
just a dotnet thing that's actually
something that that happens quite
frequently with a lot of different
programming languages okay so if I was
going to use C sharp or Java right I
mean the situation is that a lot of
companies use those two frameworks or
those two languages because of the tools
that are built around them the massive
amounts of libraries the massive amounts
of corporate support when things go bad
one of the things I wanted to talk about
in a separate video is that once you're
big time it becomes your job becomes
much more difficult if you're a
architect on some big team for a huge
corporation and your systems go down
depending on how big the company is it
could be costing the company millions of
dollars an hour sometimes it could be
millions of dollars a minute
on you know how much work is being lost
as a result of the systems going down so
that said a lot of companies are willing
to pay the premium for things like Asher
and AWS and and you know they'll choose
something that's tried-and-true that so
many other corporations are using like
Java or C sharp because they just feel
more comfortable being able to call up
Microsoft on the phone or call up Oracle
or something like that and saying hey I
have a problem and I pay you a bunch of
money you guys need to fix this problem
and they also rely upon you know the the
corporations that back these projects to
be there when patches need to roll out
for any sort of security alert a lot of
the trends now with cyber security is
that companies are trying to talk about
sharing threats in fact I actually I
spoke to a representative from from a
company that handles cyber security for
defense contracting and they were
talking about a product that they were
making where they're essentially in real
time trying to establish threats
globally but they're almost doing it
through a crowd sharing process where
proprietary monitoring just can't be
done in real time not as well as you
know like a social aspect to it so
that's probably another topic for
another day but the point is is that the
larger these languages are and the more
corporate support that they have the
less or the more secure that they are
and the better you can feel about using
them as a company that may do with
millions and billions of dollars so what
a pic C sharp will see sharp has Visual
Studio Visual Studio is the best text
editor it's better than Eclipse Eclipse
really sucks ass compared to Visual
Studio I granted the complaints I had
about Visual Studio earlier about having
to restart it that's one of the few
complaints you have with it if you're
going to be getting into a big
development environment team team
foundation server is a pretty good tool
in order to deal with source source
rado repository also being able to
dual out like tasks and things like that
for an agile type of development
environment and a lot of these little
subtopics I can discuss in different
videos I don't wanna make this one too
long but like you can see this is a
simple little program here which is
actually sniffing out browser traffic
it's all statically typed so the ability
to be able to just jump around into your
source code and things like that is much
easier with something like Visual Studio
if you compare this to something like
Python and you have hundreds of
developers writing something that may
have millions or hundreds of thousands
of lines of code Python doesn't have
near the the amount of tools and support
that Visual Studio and c-sharp provide
for very very complex applications also
just you know the interfaces that the
way object-oriented the way it's
object-oriented just the entire design
of the language is really it's really
fantastic it really is for larger
development environments on the way
c-sharp I mean the Andrews Helzberg I
mean the guy who designed this language
he's designed typescript he also had a
lot to do with like turbo Pascal he's an
amazing guy a lot of people behind this
this project are really amazing I think
it's C sharp as of 6.0 is absolutely
fantastic so another thing is that if
you want to get in the game programming
why are you going to use C++ C sharp and
Java both have garbage collection
garbage collection and memory management
is not something that a lot of newbie
programmers and what I want to get
involved in it's something that is
typically over their head with something
like C or C++ and and with the tools
available to you and c-sharp to build a
step through and be able to see stack
traces and add watches and and I granted
some of these other languages do that
but a lot of the hacker communities like
PHP and Python they're not using the
tools that are available to them and
something like c-sharp in the.net
environment that you absolutely have to
use in order to be able to truly write
some of the more complex stuff so if
you're going to write a complex GUI app
the C sharp is probably the best option
out there I mean if if you're looking
for something for like software
applications like I mean Windows is
still the number one operating system by
for
our c-sharp with its new genetic or is
promising not just in an asp.net core
but with the hold on neck or framework
it's promising to be open-source that
you can actually run it on not
open-source but also cross-platform it's
open-source as well but it'll run on Mac
Linux or Windows and and that's really
going to open things up so for the
longest time Microsoft was basically
saying screw you open-source community
we're not getting involved and then
we've seen languages like Ruby and
Python all these things spring up
because people are like well you know
screw Microsoft I'm not if they're not
going to open up their stuff and they
want to charge us in nickel and diamonds
for everything because they're a huge
Miam hundred billion dollar company then
you know they moved away and then for
the longest time Microsoft realized they
needed to change their ways they get rid
of their old CE is CEO the new CEO comes
in he starts changing a lot of things
that are being done so dotnet core is
just one of the things but then working
with unity is another thing and the
purchase of xamarin is something that's
that's really important as well because
this c-sharp and Microsoft wasn't
competing very well on a mobile and
tablet market even though the surface
pro is relatively okay and the Windows
Phone isn't like a terrible product it
certainly didn't you couldn't compete
with with Android and apples so they
went ahead and they purchased xamarin
which is a billion-dollar platform here
in order to build mobile apps that you
can build just using the C sharp and
Visual Studio so in Visual Studio 2015
they include you know all these tools
that you can use with Ameren to write
c-sharp and actually have it poured over
to iOS you can have you know hit the the
app market or the Google store if you
wanted to go to the Android route but
you can see a lot of major companies are
using this product but now it's owned by
Microsoft there's also the fact that
they just purchase LinkedIn so I'm not
sure where that's going to go but I
think you know that's never going to
hurt their brand or awareness and 2017
now that they own you know basically the
Facebook of business networking and and
obviously they have a shitload of cash
guys I mean these guys were sitting on
almost a hundred billion dollars in cash
they spent over 20 billion all in cash
to
by LinkedIn like it was nothing they
paid two and a half billion for the
Minecraft like it was nothing if you
look at the history of Google when
Google brought in Eric Schmidt the he's
known as mr. Google the CEO that ran
Google for the longest time when Sergey
Brin and Larry Page were just young you
know young wings and didn't really know
how to run their company they brought in
a guy that was very experienced had
experience with Apple and a couple of
other companies but the first thing he
warned Google about as they were getting
popular was to do everything they could
to fly under the radar to avoid
Microsoft because they were worried when
they were first getting off the ground
in the late 90s that Microsoft was going
to swoop in and crush them before they
could actually gain their market share
so Microsoft has been like the kingpin
and and in development I mean along with
IBM and I mean but they've never really
gone anywhere they lost some market
support and and then some of the trends
even as of late still show that C sharp
maybe in a low lie mean it certainly has
been in a low over the last two years
it's not it's not expanding like we've
seen with Python however when it comes
to a sheer amount of jobs and the
Fortune 100 and 500 that are ad that are
applying the Microsoft technology it
still blows away some of the smaller
companies like Python and Ruby and stuff
like that so even though we're seeing
tremendous growth with some of those
those commute those languages and the
startup communities and things like that
you know real business from some of
these major corporations I mean they're
still going with the tried-and-true
proprietary stacks where they know that
they can get you know dedicated
resources for training for a fear for
you know security and monitoring and
things like that so I don't know there's
a ton of reasons why guys Microsoft and
c-sharp is a pretty good language to
learn I understand that you know I did
that video where I was talking about the
fact that I was dying and I didn't even
say that it was dying I just simply
asked the question is it dying I said if
it wasn't dying it felt like it was in a
low but I mean really that's probably
overstated if you look at Asher Asher
continues to grow it's going to continue
to compete with AWS
I mean it's really I have no desire to
run a stack on Azure but if I was truly
going to be running a major major
company I would probably consider Azure
but I don't have anything big enough to
worry about having the host on the cloud
not not in my opinion on at this point
so anyway guy said that's just me kind
of defending the position on why I put
c-sharp as the number one language
definitely check out unity engine if you
have in unities is a pretty badass
product like I mean I love game probably
fact I wish I had more time to do some
game programming I'm not very good at it
but unity is a blast the problem with
with game programming in my opinion is
just simply that like if you look at
what's going on here in that video I
mean that that is like that is a you
know 3d animation so companies are using
probably 3ds max or Maya or something
like that to create those awesome
animations and then you export them into
your into your game engine so it's not
like unities creating that but unity
could certainly run scripts that that
play those those cutscenes and things
like that but like it's looking at
something like this really all you don't
want to do that but like I lack the
artistic creativity to be able to come
up with anything even remotely close to
that in fact I don't understand how
anybody can do that that's that's just
baffling to me but um you know this
that's why we have artists in the world
and I'm definitely not an artist anyway
guys let me know what you think so I
appreciate you guys watching that video
I appreciate you watching this one
everybody take care and have a good
weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
