all right so I'm going to try to add
some stuff out of this image over here
my images it's a BG jpg I'm gonna try to
add this in my header see what kind of
result I get inside this background blue
I do like a background and then just URL
Dada images and BG jpg and then we'll
their site repeat this joint let's just
see what this looks like real quick so
go to 127 not sure about that one let's
see here
I think I'm gonna do is try to pull up
Photoshop here and when I'm dealing my
website I'm going to go ahead and just
print screen real quick pull up
Photoshop control V actually I got to
start up a new joint so just go new spy
control V it's going to show both
screens but I don't care about that
right so I try to get a little color
grab on this thing whatever color that
is we'll grab that now our header is
like 150 pixels in height I believe
create a new image 150 height really
didn't need to be 150 and wit but you
know what i shouldn't be a problem I'm
just gonna go ahead and what we're going
to do is we're going to go ahead and
just fill this in kamal
oh yeah what we got to duplicate this
let's duplicate that I'm going to take
this this thing is not responding hi
there we go all right paint bucket fill
that in now one go back to the gradient
go and give this gradient something
something like that and then we're going
to take a little sliver of this like
that and we're going to save this save
for web change it to a just go with PNG
24 save it now we gotta go and put it on
our PC go to the project strike rule we
have this thing located it's not there
it's not there either yeah we're in here
okay my project static images and we're
just going to call this PG dot PNG okay
now let's go back over to our file here
and change this to PNG I think yeah we
have a 150 pixels and then we just
repeat it so the result then we'll do
something like that not a hundred
percent ideal I don't think but I may do
an improvement on that later on
yeah I may have to do an improvement on
that later on all right let me try to go
back over to the base at HTML I want to
put another dr statement after the nav
element which is right right here I me
to go do want to do a br I so that's
better all right now I think we want
these links to be black so let's go
ahead and change the color of red joint
go back over here main.css change the Li
to just a color pound 0004 black go back
over here refresh it that didn't work
probably have to change the a color I
would imagine all right so we'll just
copy this paste that a color pounds
there was 0 0 really we could take this
out and we're going to take the text
decoration off this thing to text
decoration 9 and then we're going to a
font size 16 pixels
okay what I wanna do is on hover I'm
going to go ahead and change let's take
the width and make this one hundred
percent I believe that should if we make
the anchor display block make it a width
of one hundred percent let me just make
sure that doesn't break anything yeah it
doesn't okay so that's good let's give
it a height I know which to say 30
pixels and that looks like and then
we're going to change the on hover of
this so we're going to go just copy this
entire line go down here paste it do a
pseudo code hover and then we're going
to change the background color to this
Photoshop color that we were messing
with earlier which is here someone
copied that and then I'm gonna paste
that right down in here and you can give
it a little pound sign okay and then
we're going to change the color of it on
hover to white so we'll do pound zeros
or FFF white and let's see what the
result looks like now alright so that's
that's about what I wanted something
pretty simplistic I don't like the gap
their work to figure that I was because
of the width of our Li elements let's
see if we can go ahead and resolve that
issue now the fact that we had 940
pixels I think this should be 188
but let's see it's not giving us enough
room because of a tiny bit of a marg in
there so that would be a margin of the
Li element I guess which shouldn't have
a margin I don't think because we have
the margin set at zero I can't imagine
this has anything to do with it either
alright so let's go back to the thing
let's go and take our Li and go float
left and go back into the results now
alright so now we have this we have a
little bit of extra space here so I do
want to add a br after the nav again to
make sure that this nav is taking up
more space and we try to add it here and
see if that solves it alright so that's
about what I'm looking for right there I
also want to add a clear statement after
the Li since we're floating that well
now you know what that won't be
necessary don't worry about that alright
so that's good enough for right now
we'll we'll tanker would like to the
specifics later on as we move along so I
want to change the line height because
you can see that the text is not quite
vertically aligned in the middle of the
highlighted portion so it's good and
change that by going to our main CSS and
we're going to change the line height of
a so the line height should be about 30
pixels which
is the height of its parent Li element
and that that aligns things in the
center like we want right I'm gonna go
ahead and have some sort of a border but
below the nav element here so it's go
ahead and add a border I'm actually
going to add the border before sets the
end of the wrap this into the header so
I'll just see if I can accomplish what
I'm looking for here so I'll say do
class and we'll just call this a border
and we'll create the class and it's
starting here border and then we'll give
it a width of 9 40 pixels margin 0 auto
to Center it it's going to be border
bottom thin solid and it's going to be
black 000 and we'll give it a margin
below to a margin bottom of 20 pixels
and see what this looks like alright so
that's about what i was looking for here
i just want some sort of a separator
between where our navigation items are
and then where the rest of the page is
going to say now I think it's time to go
ahead and add the footer I'll probably
just make the footer like a solid black
color i think but i'm going to do that
well actually that's go ahead and finish
up the footer in this video and then
we'll we'll move on to other stuff in
the next video alright so let's go ahead
and add the footer if you go back to the
base HTML it's going to be after all
this content it's going to be after the
wrap and we're just gonna put the footer
the footer is going to be after
everything and we're going to say their
class equals footer
and then once again inside the footer
we're going to give class equals rap and
our content inside the rap will be
centered inside the foot or the footers
gonna have a hundred percent width let's
go ahead and add that style now just
make sure where's one other sex height
we're going to give it a height of 150
pixels and we're gonna give it a
background color this and then the font
inside the footer is going to be font
color pound actually don't need phone
color that's not right so color FFF for
white look over here it's going to see
what the results are now I see see that
we have a nice little footer their
footers after other content not much
stuff in the content but for right now
we're not worried too much about that
let's go ahead and add after all this
stuff let's add a put it down here
actually I'm gonna have a Content since
we do have a content block we'll just
give it a minimum height right now let's
just say 700 pixels that way the footer
looks a little bit more normal normal
you're gonna have enough content and
there to push things down but just for
the time being and make it look a little
prettier let's add a minimum height
that's actually a little too much let's
just say let's say five hundred and
seventy five hundred but let's just say
500 and I'm going to refresh this now
you see our footer is nicely sitting at
the bottom and I'm going to go ahead and
end this video at this point and the
next video we're going to continue on
with getting everything situated all
