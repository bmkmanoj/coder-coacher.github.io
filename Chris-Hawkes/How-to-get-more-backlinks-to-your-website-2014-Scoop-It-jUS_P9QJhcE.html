to show you a another website it's going
to be a tutorial series on how to get
more backlinks to your website or blog
which is always a problem that everybody
faces in today's day and age Google
makes it very difficult to get a website
off the ground because you need to have
backlinks to your website in order to be
of any relevance and one of the waves
Google fight spam is to actually try to
limit the amount of exposure a new
website can get so even if you have a
great website if you're not going out
and you're not trying to build links and
networking and everything to try to
promote your blog or website it's really
not going to take off anytime soon it
takes years so one of the new websites
out that is gaining a lot of attention
is I'm scooping so it's WWE scoop it I
mean you register for a web for an
account and you just have to verify your
email address once you do that you have
the ability to just click new scoop and
you can link to like you're like in this
case i'll just link to my youtube
channel and here's a playlist for a
python tutorial series that i have and
then here it already says on basically
what my channel is about but i'm gonna
go ahead and put some text in here in
regards to the the specific tutorial
series that this is aimed at all right
and just for good measure I'll even put
the link in there again
all right na just simply click publish
and it goes on to this like main
dashboard page that you have on your
home and each one of these topics that
you end up publishing like you can have
multiple different they're almost like
Pinterest boards or whatever but you can
have multiple scoops that you're
scooping and pointing back to your
website and each one's about a page rank
of a three you don't want to overdo it
obviously this is really just a
promotional tool to try to just get an
additional boost but it's not it's one
of the freeways and 2014 that hasn't
died or I've been beaten to death yet so
the next tutorials next video in this
series I'm going to just continue to go
through additional options that you have
in 2014 to try to get more backlinks to
your website or blog alright guys thanks
for watching please subscribe and feel
free to leave any comments or whatever
in regards to whatever blog is anything
you're trying to promote all right talk
to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
