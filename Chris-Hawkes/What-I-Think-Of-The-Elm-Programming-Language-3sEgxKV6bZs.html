question what do I think of the elm
programming language and you know I'm
just forewarning I don't have a ton of
experience with Elam but I have played
around enough whether to get installed
on my machine they built some basic
components and and use the built-in
actually even used an editor for visual
studio code for it but uh so I think
things are a little bit complicated
number one let me just go and explain
what Elm is is Elm is a programming
language that is literally like its aim
is to replace both the entire HTML
Javascript CSS way that we currently
conduct all of our websites and build
our web website so as an example if I go
to the website that I created which is
hipster code com and the reason why I go
to this website is actually one of the
few that actually I'm running nowadays
so if I go to this website though that
there is a whole lot of different
technology that is all being brought in
here number one you have a web framework
like Django but let's just focus on
really what Elm aims to solve so the CSS
here their CSS there's an HTML and
there's JavaScript in addition to the
JavaScript there's there's languages and
plugins I mean at one point this thing
is using react and redux it's also using
like bootstrap and jQuery and all these
different things and it's not really
modular or component based outside of my
react development so the thing is is
like when people ask me like okay album
solves this problem of HTML CSS and
JavaScript and then you know the first
thing that I think that comes to my mind
is that I don't really find it to be a
problem the way that we've been doing
this for you know two decades now or
longer so the and what about you know
what I mean by like hTML is not a big
deal like I don't let me give you an
example so one of the things that if we
look at like a radio button within with
an elm here's the documentation here
from and what it says here is it's like
okay we want to get HTML that looks like
this so elm guys it compiles down
through HTML CSS and JavaScript
and it's a purely functional language
which obviously that immediately strikes
chords with the hipsters out there that
thing everything needs to be purely
functional these days and they could be
right I don't know they could be right
but it's a purely functional programming
language and it's going to take
something like this and say okay this is
what you need in HTML and instead you're
gonna write it this way
and by writing it this way it's going to
end up when you compile it in everything
you're gonna eventually get this sort of
outcome and maybe that's being a little
bit too simplistic but as you see here
if you want a little bit more than just
this and you run into some difference
you know different I guess you know
different you always you always run into
things that the documentation doesn't
cover right I mean when we're getting
into angular everything looks great on
the to-do apps and stuff like that then
you get into the really the complication
you start to really understand that
there is no golden tool or no there's no
golden ticket that's going to just make
business processes easy and things like
that I mean you're always gonna run into
situations but this is kind of the part
that I really don't like I mean we're
writing something new that is
essentially replacing HTML where it
probably in my mind doesn't need to be
replaced so the main appeal to something
like Elm from what I can see is that
it's all about modularity so you're
gonna end up building this might be a
pain in the ass to build you know for
all this code to just simply build this
HTML it seems like a real big pain in
the ass yes but once you do that pain in
the ass you didn't have like almost like
a reusable type of component but the
problem with that approach and I've
actually been burned by this in the past
is that when I try to build components
and say okay I think the component needs
to do a B and C but then you get new
requirements where it needs to do de and
F as well so then you have to end up you
know rewriting the component or you add
more and more complexity to it where you
end up having all this programming code
and things like that and all its really
doing at the end of the day of saving
you from having to type this in HTML and
there's other benefits as well I mean
the entire component based system is
like almost like what react does with
its virtual DOM
trying to replace and fix some of the
defense the deficiencies of our HTML
browsers in the way that they interpret
HTML and with Elm you know this is all
about modularity and then you compare it
to stuff that has been coming out lately
like Google polymer which doesn't even
really know anymore and I haven't heard
too much about it these days but polymer
is all about also baking in HTML CSS and
JavaScript into reusable components so
that everything is self-contained
everybody's been talking about for quite
a few years now that we want to go into
this web component model and why do we
want to do that we look at things like
let's look at a jQuery plugin like
magnetic pop-up this is an awesome
jquery plugin and and definitely don't
mean to i'm not bashing on this plugin
at all because it's really awesome but
let's look at what this does here so
it's a it's a photo viewer so it's a
lightbox a dom you know makes images
look really awesome and you can even do
slideshows and things like that so it's
a very good plugin it's very easy to
work with definitely recommend it
but one of the deficiencies that
something like Elm or polymer web
components is trying to solve what they
don't like and what they feel like makes
the web a little bit more of a mess is
that too many files have to be requested
for something like this to work you have
to have in many cases multiple CSS files
you have to have multiple JavaScript
files you have to have references to
jQuery there's you know so you have all
these different these HTTP requests that
are having to be made just in order to
display you know one particular plugin
and what you know something like polymer
and elm is trying to do is like okay and
why I have a component and the component
itself can be this entire photo plug-in
and I expose this API and you basically
have to to you know to work within a
specific set of ways but the problem
with working in it with it in a specific
way is that each component is going to
have its own specific way that needs to
be interacted with in order for it to do
what you what it is you want it to do
and that's the same problem we have with
jQuery at the moment like widget query
and the plugins and stuff you have to
drag in all the dependencies and you
have to end up on some sort of script at
the bottom of your page
sure after everything's loaded that
you're then instantiating some sort of
code that's going to tell Magnifico up
to work or whatever plug-in you're
working with and the thing is is that
that's a little bit of a hassle yes and
every plugin out there has its own you
know its own dependencies and things
like that but the thing is is I don't
really see a web component based system
being any different because it's been
years now and number one I don't see
this being widely adopted number two we
have to completely relearn all of our
own stuff you know the stuff that we've
already been using for decades now like
HTML and CSS and JavaScript in the
traditional way that we write it just to
simply kind of do what we do already and
in a way this kind of sucks ass I made a
joke the other day that like in modern
web development we love to reinvent the
same old wheel and then it almost seems
like every time we reinvent the wheel
we've added this new piece of complexity
where it just doesn't roll quite as well
as it used to and and as technology
advances there's this thing called this
productivity paradox that they've been
talking about since the 1970s where our
technology and our you know the amount
of you know the sheer amount of data on
the processing power that we have is so
much greater than it used to be but now
human capital is so expensive and we
don't see humongous preferred increases
in productivity that you would expect as
technology advances and and in addition
I really feel like some of that is
obviously human capital is expensive
whereas it used to be that the hardware
was expensive now it's much more
expensive to pay a programmer than it is
to buy extra terabytes of data storage
but with this productivity paradox I
also think a piece that plays into it is
simply creating so many tools on top of
other tools that are kind of doing the
same old you know it's like we need
to we need to do they good there's
nothing wrong with this this jQuery way
that we've been doing it in fact jQuery
has been the most successful JavaScript
library I would I would argue of all
time and JavaScript I mean so far I
don't know that anything has come close
to replacing it all the buzz we hear
about angular or elm or react or any of
those other things none of them have
come close to the amount of
option and the amount of heartache and
tears that jquery saved to developers
across the world so somebody made a
comment the other day they'd like its
2017 and they said the exact same thing
is that hipster article that I was
referencing about how it feels to be a
web developer in 2016 and you know they
said the same exact that was talked
about in that argument they're like
jQuery why would you recommend jQuery
it's 27 dude everybody's still using
jQuery and if they were smart they would
continue to use jQuery so we'll see what
ends up happening but my initial
thoughts on Elm is like damn that's a
hell of a learning curve to relearn how
to write HTML javascript and CSS and
then if I really wanted a web component
based system a number one I would
probably you know stick with like react
because react can be very very
self-contained when it comes to baking
in your JavaScript and CSS
I mean able to reason about something
like react a lot better because it's
JavaScript as opposed to you know this
crazy stuff that we're looking at on you
know building a radio button list using
this you know sort of give array type of
thing going on so from what I understand
that you know this becomes a joy to use
once you learn it and you but I just I
guess I look at the end game and I look
at the end goal and I'm just like okay
well it's been a few years now the elms
been out since roughly 2012 it was
written by a young programmer that
probably didn't have a tremendous amount
of experience in the IT world at least
on the business side of things because
he was only like 22 when he was writing
his doctoral dissertation at I believe
it was Harvard which is what Elm ended
up coming out of so I don't know man I I
try to keep things simple I understand
that that's not that's not like the
popular option but I think as I age and
development and I try to focus on
solving business problems as well like I
like making money I like I like spending
my time on things that I feel like are
gonna be able to benefit either my
career or you know me monetarily or
whatever it may be like I want to be
able and the very least it needs to be
fun so when I play around with Elm and
things like that it's not like I'm blown
away
with the fundus behind it to me I'm just
like this is quite a bit different than
what I'm used to and and that's not
necessarily a bad thing because you can
be a better developer by trying out all
these different things but here's the
thing
what I I was actually in one project
that I had
I built a ton of reusable controls is
what they were and in the entire UI was
built up and in a and a bunch of
different reusable controls and each
control had its own API and when I say
API was a very minimalistic API was
basically it's an application protocol
interface so it is okay how do I get
this control to do what it is that I
wanted to do so you know each control
had probably four or five different
variations roughly and and that was
really all you needed to do because I
wasn't trying to build something that
could just be turned into anything it
wasn't like some sort of Minecraft
sandbox world where you could create
these you know marvelous works of art it
was essentially like okay you got
different UI things like navbars and you
know photo viewers and things like that
and you know we're gonna have roughly
four or five different options you know
you need to do the data stream you need
to do that and that was basically all I
was trying to do because I was solving a
specific business problem and it
actually was very very successful and I
think in a way you know I see this web
component based system and we're trying
to do the exact same thing you know
we've tried it with polymer now and
obviously react in an elm and it's
trying to it's trying to I guess allow
us to be a little bit more you have to
deal with a little bit less maintenance
I guess and and be a little bit more
creative and sometimes I just think
verbosity is better than magic and you
know I'm kind of like I think it kind of
sucks you know some of the tools that we
have where we have to compile down to
something you know this this or that and
you know before we can actually see our
output and things like that so I don't
know man there's a lot of different
tools out there that are coming out
where it's like hey why don't you write
it this way and compile it to the old
way and then you can then see it in the
old way and debug it in the old way even
though you're writing it in this new way
and like
I mean and then you're like well
that makes it more difficult so now I've
started using source maps and things
which source maps are great but so guys
my thoughts man on Elm I never want to
bash any sort of project or anything
like that and I certainly don't feel
like I have the experience to say
anything negative about Elm but I guess
where my opinion of the entire project
is I look at the end game and I'm like
well the end game isn't anything that I
feel like is going to make me a better
developer or even somebody that solves
business problems better than them what
I can do on my own
I think Elm is a hell of an investment
in time and effort to do what we can
already do and I also I think I I'm a
little bit hesitant about not really the
purely functional aspect but there's
also a learning curve and purely
functional languages but just the fact
that there isn't a whole lot of adoption
in the community right now so I don't
know of any like major success stories
of elm hell I was waiting for the
longest time to hear major success
stories and angular and things like that
before we decided to have to rewrite
that entire thing into angular 2.0 so I
missed the success stories of something
like jQuery maybe I was just more young
and naive back then but when jQuery did
when jQuery was hot dude that was that
was awesome because it was like there
was no effing question that that was
what you needed to work on that jQuery
was where you were gonna go and now
there's it just seems like we're kind of
waiting for something we're waiting for
that same thing it almost feels like and
we're not quite getting it with some of
these projects and I think react is
relatively close to where we need to be
when it comes to web component based
systems and things like that but yeah I
mean it's a good it's just it's really
it's a tough question because like I
feel like I'm waiting for the next thing
and you know as chrome gets better like
whatever sort of recent chrome updating
this kind of a side note my youtube
every time it crashes all the damn time
now I don't know what it is I don't know
maybe if it's some sort of plug-in I'm
like if you actually I disabled all the
plugins on my chrome but you know maybe
I installed
sort of program that somehow messing up
a chrome most likely chrome did some
sort of update we're at Auto updates and
now it crashes all the damn time and
they'll end up fixing it I'm sure
eventually but anyway guys that's my
thoughts man thank you guys for watching
make sure you subscribe vote up - video
I appreciate all the support and have a
good night my hey guys so I've talked
about this a lot deb mountain coding
boot camp they are my sponsor they're
one of the reasons why i'm able to do
these videos and they offer a 12-week
intensive course that teaches you the
technologies of the here and now they're
gonna focus on a lot of things that are
actually being used and websites things
like jquery and they're gonna be using
stacks like nodejs the 12-week intensive
course is to try to give people in the
job market so that is our entire focus
we've all we've talked a lot about on
this channel whether or not a college
degree is worth it i'm not the one to be
able to answer that question for you i
absolutely think that college degrees
are great especially in computer science
i never want to convince somebody to say
that they shouldn't do that you know
obviously schools like Stanford and MIT
I'm you know I'm I'm an envy of all
those graduates however there is you
know the bulk of developers that don't
necessarily need to be the MIT graduates
to actually have success in the
programming world I think I speak
relatively well for for that type of
person and with coding boot camps we're
seeing them you know try to offer more
skills more modern-day skills because a
lot of times when you're going to a
computer science course and a major
university you're learning technology
that's already outdated by the time
you're learning it with Deb mountain and
coding boot camps like what Deb Mountain
offers they're focusing on really what
is hot right now so and they also focus
on a relatively you know a small set of
skills in order to make sure that they
are teaching you what you need to know
in order to be productive in a in a
workplace environment so make sure you
guys do me a favor do yourself a favor
check out the link and that in the
description tab below for more on Deb
Mountain coding boot camp thanks guys
