about the top 10 job websites for
programmers so it specifically speaks to
programmers and there's also a us-only
kind of slant on this so I can't really
speak for the best job websites that i
know of for Europe and in Africa and
other places that I just I don't have
much familiarity with unfortunately but
if you guys want to fill me in leave
descriptions or leave about comments and
I'll try to add those to the description
tab because I'm actually curious of any
other programming job websites do you
guys know about there so let's go ahead
and get on with this list number 10 and
I'm not trying to be a smartass here but
I'm saying directly reach out to the
employers this could arguably be number
one because one of the best ways that
I've ever found interest with dealing
with potential employers is to just
simply reach out to them directly
whether it's a manager or whatnot if you
can get the contact information for
somebody that holds a position a hiring
position from within a particular
company then you know that's that's
going to be a very effective way to get
your number your name on the top of the
stack it could also be an effective way
of being treated like a spammer so you
know be very very cautious with how you
approach something like that because you
know nobody wants to hear you know
another or see another spam article or
hear some you know crazy person trying
to short you know drag them down to tell
them what a great Python guy they are
even though they have no online profile
and never went to school so you'll be
very very cautious about how you do that
type of thing because you don't want to
burn any bridges either so number nine
is definitely us only but this is us
jobs so USA Jobs any government job and
contracting position is essentially
available on this website it's a
terrible website they've done a lot of
good things with it recently to make it
not so terrible but it still is a pretty
painful process but if you're able to
get your foot into the door in the US
government job you're going to get all
kinds of days off every year it pays
relatively well and you can essentially
never be fired so government workers and
the United States have a label of being
you know relatively lazy people that
hold positions that they shouldn't have
but it doesn't mean that they're all
lazy and that they're all terrible
positions you can do some pretty cool
things for the US government number
eight is monster issues to be top of the
list really but they've
certainly slipped down especially from
the IT side I never really go to monster
but they are still a relatively large
job searching a job posting website so
they deserve to be mentioned although I
think it could you could argue that they
shouldn't even be as high as eight
number seven is simply hire this is a
relatively new comer in my opinion I
haven't heard a whole lot about this
until recently but simply hired is
definitely a website you should check
out number six is diced this used to be
and still touts that they are like the
number one IT jobs website out there
they've been around the block for a long
time they were around i believe even
before the internet was a thing so dice
is the thing i don't like about dice is
that i don't find that their their
figures are all that accurate like they
always say that they have like thirty
six thousand pearl jobs available that
seems really really unlikely especially
considering the fact that it's roughly
the same number for python and other
positions that it just doesn't seem
accurate whatsoever i think that they
have a lot of duplicate listings on the
dice website it's very it's not very
good in my opinion but there is high as
six just because they've been around so
long and that they do have a lot of IT
connections number five is also a
newcomer Stack Overflow careers so this
is a very unique way of being able to
attract developers based on a website
Stack Overflow that a lot of programmers
go to to get their programming questions
answered they can now also get potential
job listings those job listings can also
see with their stack overflow scores and
see how you know relevant they are on
that community just because they're on
that community though doesn't mean that
that you know that they're not or if
they're not there it doesn't mean that
they're not a good programmer if they
are there doesn't mean that they are a
great programmer I think that's up to
everybody's individual interpretation on
how much you should base somebody's
credibility off of their stack overflow
store but that's another discussion for
another day number four is LinkedIn now
this is a website where I get all kinds
of spam from recruiters and things like
that but I've also had some genuine
interest from companies that have
reached out to me through LinkedIn
because you know they know you know who
you work for where you work things like
that LinkedIn it has been a relatively
decent website really the best one out
as far as trying to find out where
people work and things like that so it
has a lot of flaws no doubt but
hopefully with the new acquisition of
Microsoft taking over the company and
buying it it starts to get better with
time but you can actually and this kind
of goes back to number 10 if you're
trying to figure out you know who isn't
a hiring manager at a particular company
linkedin is probably going to be your
best bet in order to go onto that
website the reason why it's number four
here is because you can use LinkedIn's
platform to specifically reach out to
these companies not only that they do
have job listings as well so they are
definitely high on the list number three
is glass door I love this website
because this website does a very good
job at comparing what is a good company
to work for compared to another company
companies are very cognizant now of
their glass or they have their glass
door of score CEO is want to know and
and they want to have a high approval
rating on glass doors the glass story
certainly emerged as like the number one
website out there to give you inside
inquiry into a company that you could
potentially be working for so now that
they've moved into the whole job posting
thing you know you can find their job
listing as well as the company rating
and they do the best job of that company
rating to date so they're definitely
number three on this list number two is
indeed and this is by sheer force this
website is very old-school looking and
it looks like it was built in nineteen
ninety eight but it has a ton of
listings and it can make it very easy
for you to apply like if you upload your
Linkedin sorry not linkedin but you're
indeed resume you can easily apply to
different companies with just a few
clicks of a button not all of the
companies accept that but the problem
with indeed though is that there's a lot
of duplicate listings so i've seen the
same job listed from like 10 different
contractors on there so weeding out good
results from bad results is very
difficult on indeed but just the sheer
amount of jobs they're making number two
number one is hired and i really like
this side this is a new site they take a
unique spin they basically work for you
it's almost like the IT recruiter that
works for the company that they're
recruiting for this is kind of the vice
verse of the opposite end of the
spectrum where they work for you they
have some direct communication they only
accept people that they feel like they
can get hired so if you have a row
tively good profile they will work with
you and if you don't they might not work
with you but if you can work with hired
all you have to do is put in your
information you have actual physical
humans working for you trying to land
you a job somewhere so it's very it's
much like a temporary agency or just so
you know like a Robert Half type of
thing however it's it's much more broad
I think so that's my top 10 list let me
know what you guys think if you guys
have any additional recommendations make
sure you leave a comment so i can add
them to the description make sure you
please like and subscribe to the channel
i appreciate it and take care guys hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do i
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and i just wanna take a
moment to mention dev mountain coding
boot camp is a 12 week intensive course

here and now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
