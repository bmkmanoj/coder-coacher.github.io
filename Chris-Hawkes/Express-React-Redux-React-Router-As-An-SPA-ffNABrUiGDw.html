this series and then this series what
we're gonna do is get react and a few
other tools installed and running on our
expressed jeaious node application and
the reason why I'm using react is
because I know it I want and number two
I want to know it better and number
three I really just don't feel like
Vijay s is gonna be able to do what it
is that I want to be able to do I
essentially want to build is just a few
components and the few components are
gonna manage almost everything on this
website that's the plan there's not
really much of a plan because I haven't
taught this out too well but you know
that said just follow along and we can
get react working just fine so we
already have our package a JSON a couple
things to note I changed the name of
Appius to start dodgiest I'm not sure
why also I changed the port number to 90
81 where in the previous video was 3000
the reason why is I had conflicting
applications on the 3000 port so I
needed to change that and that's why I
did that so let's go to the folder where
the package that JSON is located and if
I open up command prompts okay so we're
in the right folder now so I'm gonna run
a few npm installs in order to get the
tools that we need to work now in order
to run modern-day applications and we
need a way to be able to load modules
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
install it with webpack that's gonna
help us do that so we're gonna say npm
install and then say save - dev and then
we're gonna solve web pack so web pack
will allow us to break up our JavaScript
modules and all these different folders
and then we can just simply import them
using syntax that's not supported in
browsers or in JavaScript yet but web
pad web pack makes it possible
in addition web pack can do things for
us like you know minifying bundling and
other things that you might want to do
when you go to production and you'll
learn about those things as you come
along but web pack is by far the most
popular module bundling application or
library out there right now next we need
to install babel now babel is going to
take our JavaScript and
going to allow us to write in modern-day
JavaScript using things like constants
arrow functions let variables and things
like that and it's going to compile them
down to older versions that still work
inside of the browser so that's what
we're doing that so we're gonna npm
install save data but now this is gonna
be just follow along whereas a babel CLI
which stands for command-line interface
we're going to say babel for babel
loader babel preset es2015 since we're
gonna be using babel with react we also
need to say babel preset react now that
will I be able to be able to I'm sorry
babble not damn it it will allow babel
to compile JSX code which is what react
uses finally we're going to say hey
react react react Redux react router
and react router redux and finally the
last one it is Redux so we're gonna be
installing a ton of stuff but if
you just follow along you type all that
stuff in I know it's gonna be
mind-boggling you're gonna get it all
running and eventually you'll be able to
learn it
what redux does is it allows you to
centralize your state between multiple
components so I'm trying to build this
entire application in a series of
components and really just json data is
going to be passed down with the
components and the components in
addition you know we're gonna have
client-side routing in a single-page
format that is all going to be done by
react so not just react with obviously
there's a react router so it's it's own
separate product project there's quite a
bit of projects that are gonna be
working together in order for us to get
all this stuff working but I think
you'll you'll see that that it works
quite well I just the moment all right
so now let's go back to our editor and
one of the things that we need to do is
we need to create a web pack config JSON
file and that way web pack knows how to
compile our code so I'm gonna say web
pack config j/s and here we want to say
module exports and this is how we
actually export all functions and
classes and JavaScript using the node.js
way we're going to give it an entry
point and the entry point is going to be
a file that we're just going to call app
KS and then our output is going to be
it's an object we're going to say path
equals surname plus actually not their
name plus you know what the we just keep
it burned gurney and then we're gonna
say file name equals bundle and badge is
all right down here we need to define a
module actually we're gonna say watch
true that way when we run web pack it's
gonna automatically watch now we're
gonna say module and here is where we
actually define our loaders and this is
a little bit confusing but we pass in a
list of objects to our loaders command
and this actually tells us we can say
exclude so we're not bundling or trying
to we're not trying to minify and bundle
applications that we don't need that
don't need it so we're saying exclude
anything in our node modules folder
which is where all that install stuff
went next we need to specify a loader
and we're just gonna say fable or babble
and that's for that babble loader that
we installed finally we're gonna say
query and this takes a an argument
called presets which takes in a list of
values and the first one is es2015
this tells babble to say hey if you are
using modern day JavaScript that doesn't
work in older browsers convert it to
something that works in ES yes 2015 and
then finally when it runs into JSX code
it's going to be using that a babel
react thing that we installed and this
is what tells it to do that right here
so this looks good for our web pack
config the next thing we need to do in
order for us to be able to run web pack
we need to go into our package JSON file
and under the scripts command we're
going to put a comma here and add a new
argument which we're gonna say web pack
and then you just have to save web pack
again and double quotes and this allows
us to actually execute web pack in a
local way and I know that a lot of this
 does not make sense guys but you
just have to follow along this is
actually relatively advanced stuff
if you can get this down then you can
compete with the big boys and web
development right now and obviously
their stuff changes with the wind but
for right now if you can do all this
stuff and you'll be just fine
all right so if you can't do it don't
worry about it
trying to shake it off do something else
do whatever makes you happy anyway so
now that I've done all that we
can now say from our package we say NPM
run the web pack and NPM is going to run
from the
but so far you missing script webpack
okay so it didn't
well for number one we also don't have a
starting point so let's go ahead and
create that in fact um my starting point
is gonna be in let me thank you
this alert I'm gonna say starting point
is in static folders Jas and we're gonna
create an app folder in our Jas so in
here this is kind of ugly but we're
gonna create an app folder and here wise
of you in there as the viewers old okay
so inside my app folder I'm gonna create
our app dot J's file which is being
referenced right here so we're telling
it that this is the starting point in
here we're just gonna test by doing a a
simple list one two three that way we
have some Java Script in this file and
it can make a bundle file this should be
fine right here
so I think I was typing things wrong
because when I say npm run webpack if I
save it this thing should work just fine
you can see it's now running webpack and
it's it's bundling it's also remaining
running because we said watch equals
true so now if we look over here we have
this bundle file but this is a terrible
location for our bundle files so I
actually want to remove that this
recycle bin because you also remember
the Express application is is built to
deliver a static content from the static
directory so I want bundle to actually
build in the static directory so I can
say here static j/s alright so let me
run this again press control-c to stop
it
all right so now there's the bundle and
if I look inside my J's folder I now
have my bundle J s and you can see down
here that this is our code here so it
bundled it up for us alright so now we
have a web pack and babble and all that
reiax stuff that we need installed so
we're good there now I want to
centralize all my react stuff within
this app folder so I want everything to
go in there
so first folder within my app I want to
create
let me think so I think I want a
components folder so I'm going to say
components components folder and inside
the components all right inside my
components folder there's a few things
that every component should have
especially if you're using redox in
order to maintain the component state as
opposed to react way of handling its
State the first one is going to be an
actions
folder well first let's name our
components so we're gonna have a
component the first component since this
is a movie website we're gonna say let's
create the movie component okay so now
we have our first component and then
inside here this is a folder right and I
think I created a file box and I'm going
to delete that
I want a folder inside my components and
I'll call that movie so inside here this
is where I'm going to say actions j/s
inside of our actions file what we're
gonna do is we're just gonna export one
function we're gonna say export function
now this is gonna be the counter so I'm
gonna do just a simple counter as an
example for starters I'll say return
type all right so in redux
when it calls an action an event should
happen in your component which calls an
action which returns an action object
which then calls a reducer and then the
reducer updates your component State so
seems like there's a lot going on there
but that's just the way it is and then
let's go to movies and we're gonna say
reducers j/s and here we're gonna go
ahead and define a constant variable and
we'll just say initial state equals
counter zero function counter app this
is going to take in the states like it's
passed to it as well as the action and
we're going to say if type of state
equals undefined
returned initial stage so that way we
always have a state and if one isn't
defined if it's being repressed it for
the first time and then it's gonna go
ahead and and instantiate that now we're
gonna do a switch on our action type and
the by default actions within redox
always have to have a type so that is
the one requirement it's an object and
it has to have a type value on it and
right now we only have one action which
is going to be add and then here this is
where we're going to then return a new
state so we're gonna say return object
that a sign this is where it takes the
empty object in an assigned state and
then it only updates one specific part
portion of that state that we wanted to
update so in state counter and I'm gonna
say state dot counter plus one so
basically I'm taking whatever the
counter value in state is currently and
I'm adding 1 to it it starts off by 0 as
default
but as this keeps getting called it's
gonna be incrementing we could put yeah
we don't really need a break but default
we will put a default here and we're
just gonna say return state all right so
now we have our components reducer we
finally need to export it though so when
we import this from somewhere else we
have the this we're gonna export this
this producer function all right so now
we're gonna create our store and this is
going to be the main portion of our
application for this this movie
components aware and say storage is an
inside here we need to actually import a
few things when I say import react from
react by the way this is the new way
that you import files within JavaScript
a es6 standard but it's not supported so
web pack actually does the importing for
us another thing too is we need to say
import
render which is just a piece of from
react react when I went ahead and they
split out the the actual Dom
manipulation from other areas finally
we're gonna say import provider from
react Redux oh crap I need single pull
react Redux
and then we're going to say import
create store and combine reducers from
redox this is part of the Redux project
now we need to import now we're reducer
because we're going to be using it with
our combined reducer function so we're
going to say import I think we call the
counter app from four slash reducers
now since we're going to be handling
routing from within our application we
need to import a few things that we're
going to need so we're gonna say m4
router routes browser history and index
routes from Reax router
and then finally in order for all this
stuff to mesh together we need to import
from the reactor router readouts project
async history with store as well as a
router reducer and that allows react
router to also work friendly with
reactant and redux so we're in say sync
history with store and router reducer
from react router redux alright so now
we're using pretty much all of our
applications that we had installed at
the beginning of this video and we're
gonna say constants now we're gonna eat
create our actual store object we're
going to say equals create stores so
we're using the function that we
imported now we're gonna be using our
combined reducers and this is actually
going to be beneficial too especially
when you have components that may have
multiple reducer files to keep things
clean we're gonna create a global value
which is going to store the counter app
which is essentially the counter State
that's all there is to it at the moment
but we also need to have routing stored
in States so we're gonna be using the
router reducer and then so that should
be it there one of the things that you
will want to do though is you want to
define window dot redux dev tools
extension
- - and a window dot redox casual
extension
that should be it right there I could
put this all on my mind there that
should be good all right so that was
really confusing but what we need is we
need this read out step tools extension
to be installed with Chrome and I'm
going to show you that right now
so within my extensions here there is
this react developer tools number one
you should have the react developer
tools installed and enabled just go to
chrome dev tools you can install that
also Redux dev tools is absolutely
required as well so with those two
extensions turned on this is actually
going to make it work within Chrome when
we're debugging the applications so just
you know copy that verbatim line by line
now we need to define our history
because for browser backspacing and
things like that
that's not you know it's usually
something that you really struggle with
when you're dealing with single page
applications but just makes it a little
bit easier for it to remember what the
users browser history is as they use the
the typical browser buttons to backup
and things like that
so we're just passing some arguments
here now we need to use the render
function that we actually imported from
react dom and we're going to say this is
what we're spelling out some actual JSX
when I say provider store equals and we
sign into value store now this is we're
going to define our router and history
so we're gonna use router which we
imported right here and we're gonna say
history equals history which is the name
of the value here that we defined inside
router we're gonna be using our route
paths and if it routes path equal this
is what we actually stay what path is
being you know requested if it's the
forward slash if it's just like the root
directory then we want to deliver a
component which we're gonna call our
main component for right now I'll
probably rename it something else look
right now we're gonna say main component
now break we have not defined main
component yet but we're going to do that
in just a moment finally ready is our
index route so that way
by default there's always this index
route that's being being assigned to
this route path actually know what to
keep things a little bit simpler we're
gonna close off route at the moment
we'll get to that other stuff in just a
second so we're gonna leave route like
that and we're gonna close off router
then we're going to close off provider
okay I'll say to a comma here though and
we're gonna say document dot get element
by ID name app all right so that means
when we actually insert the bundle into
our template we need to make sure that
there is an ID named app assign so it's
going here and I might actually have one
already so I actually had this from a
redox thing that I was not Redux but V
UJS I was considering using VJ s but for
right now let's go ahead and just below
the header of our big template that i
downloaded or you could put it anywhere
you want your template but we need a div
ID of app and in other things too is i'm
at the bottom of the file let's go ahead
and import our bundle and javascript
which got put inside of our j s and it
got put inside here this ji bundle - yes
and let's go ahead and reference that
here so make sure you have a script tag
that is referencing your bundle yes that
way when we run the application it can
be found all right and going back to the
app
if we go to the store though we can see
that we have this main component and the
main component has not been created yet
so let's go ahead and create that real
quick we're in same main component
that's probably a terrible name for it
to be honest with you
in fact I'm almost sure it's a terrible
name we're gonna say import react as
well as crop types from react now we're
gonna say class main component extends
react component now this is using modern
es6 classes which actually are not even
supported in the language itself but
it's a new way a little bit cleaner as
far as how we instantiate and it's much
more object oriented like but
constructor props really we call super
props if we need to reference props from
within the constructor
you always have to call super props
right now we're not referencing it but
it's probably a good idea to just call
it anyway just in case you ever do need
to access props from within your
constructor they will work because you
called super otherwise it wouldn't work
so I know I'm not biting you and it will
cost you hours to just do do that now
we're just gonna simply return some
basic JSX for this component and I just
want to say this not props not children
and then close that off so really this
main component is responsible for just
taking any sort of interior components
and rendering them finally just like
with all other es6 modules in this
modern JavaScript world we need to say
export default main component which is
the name of the component that we
decided to find up here all right so now
main component will be found but we need
her since we're referencing it here we
need to actually m4
so let's go ahead and do that and we're
gonna say employers main component from
dot forward slash main component all
right so now that's going to be used now
one of the interesting things is that if
we create sub components inside this
main component we can just place them
inside of here inside the route and they
will be rendered just fine and the main
reason is because we used the we used
that this not props not rendered
children all right so there's been a
hell of a lot of that you guys have
had to deal with I understand that this
is once again not an easy thing people
get paid hundred you know hundred
hundred and thirty hundred forty
thousand dollars a year to do this kind
of so it's not gonna be easy you're
gonna be like what is all this
but eventually you do it enough times
you watch this video enough times you
subscribe enough times you get enough of
your friends to subscribe click my you
know check out my sponsors my paypal my
you know I'm just joking but make sure
you guys just follow along and don't
give up alright so now that we've done
all this stuff let's at least go ahead
and try to open up her app and just see
what kind of problems we have after
writing that much code there's no doubt
you something up now the problem
is if you something up that I
didn't up that it's gonna be hard
for me to figure out what you messed up
so I'm sorry too
sorry to say about that for sure but it
we probably should have rendered some
more on our main component as well
because right now I don't even show that
I have any sort of errors I just
right-click and view source and I want
to see at the bottom if it's referencing
the bundle and it found the bundle just
fine but it looks like ok yeah alright
so we need to go ahead and um and
actually tell our web pack config that
we want it to actually know what we can
do
since this is our main okay so we need
our store
all right what I want this thing to do
because this is the main part of our app
that actually gets rendered I want to go
ahead and import this into our app
dodger house so this might get a little
bit hairy actually so we're gonna say
imports
you know what actually I'm not gonna do
that I'm not gonna do that
I want to instead I want to just tell
webpack that the entry point is going to
be the main store so I'm gonna say J ass
app and then the next folder is
components movie and storage is so I
want that to be built and by webpack
because if this gets called all this has
to be brought into the web pack bundle
file all this is gonna be rendered while
we're in here let's go ahead and just
say testing this mother all right just
so that we have something in there and
now that we've made that change we're
gonna have to actually stop web pack and
rerun it because we change this config
file now there's a good chance this
could blow up and give us a problem if
we didn't do something right but it
looks like everything did go right and
you can see it went from 1.4 to KB to
980 5k because it's obviously compiling
and bundling a lot more stuff it's like
12 projects now bundled into one file so
if we go ahead and refresh this all
right now we're getting a redox dev
tools extension is not a function so
that means and most most likely I need
to restart my browser so that the the
redox stuff works
close
so I'm restarting Chrome's that way the
dev tools should be working if I say
inspect and I go over to you can see
Redux is now working so that's cool and
if I paste my web server address it
still says that I have a problem that's
not cool all right so obviously we have
something wrong in our store like I said
there's no way you write that much go
without screwing something up now let me
take a look at this
oh I see so I had to there should only
be two underscores here and you can see
there's three so that's enough for it to
get confused and if I now refresh this
testing this mother F so you can see
it's working alright but now we're not
really seeing what we're seeing is we're
seeing that react is now being rendered
in our expression AS application but
we're not actually seeing it do anything
with like a redux state or anything but
i can show you that it is working so if
I say inspect and I look at redox then
you can see that the state does actually
set the state and there's a counter of
zero so let's go ahead and add some more
functionality to this here so you guys
can see that it does something so what I
could do I'm gonna create one more
component which I'm going to call my
counter component there's just an
example so I'll say counter dodge yes
and in here we need to do a few things
we're gonna import once again it's out
import react and then prop types again
from very I will say imports
and next from react readouts
by the way if you're ever wondering what
is the difference between importing like
a react and importing inside of these
curly braces these curly braces give you
further control over what you want to
import you can import certain features
of a library instead of the entire thing
so that's what those curly braces mean
now we're going to import our actions
and we're gonna say counter actions from
forward slash actions and this is from
this file we're importing these counter
actions now we're gonna create a new
class so we're just going to call this
class calendar extends react component
and we're gonna call our constructor
again with our props and call super
props once against they don't get burned
later on we're gonna create a function
of click function that's actually going
to fire the action and we're gonna say
this stop crops dot test and then we're
gonna call the render function and
return the JSX code that we want to
return and I'll say hello redux and then
we're gonna have our little button which
they're gonna fire the on click and the
on click event is going to fire the
click function that we just created
we're gonna say this doc click but now
we're gonna say that bind because we
want to combined our this context and
that's because actually if I explain
that's gonna be beyond the scope of this
but if you need to learn about the
Biscay word within JavaScript and how
did this keyword can sometimes change
and if you want greater control over the
this context you can use the bind
keyword
all right now at the bottom of this we
need to use a few things that allow us
to use redox so we're gonna create a
constant that says matte dispatch two
props let me say it equals a dispatch
this is gonna be using the new arrow
function this is another thing once
again that's not supported in most
browsers the babel allows us to use this
modern-day stuff and we can say test
click and then we assign it an anonymous
arrow function which is really just an
anonymous function within JavaScript and
we could say counter actions and then
call add alright then we need to say
constant map States to props and this is
going to equal there's gonna pass it and
take the state from the component and
for right now we're having to do much
whether we're just gonna return it
finally we're gonna use the connect
function which allows the component to
connect to the reacts to the Redux state
so we're gonna get to say a constant
and you thank you
so I think instead of that I think I
could just say and I'm gonna try this
out I don't even know if this is gonna
work let me say export connects so we're
using our connect function that we
brought in and I really want to say
export your faults connect and then here
I'm gonna call map state two prompts as
well as map dispatch the props and then
here since we're actually in the
function I want to pass in the name of
my application which I call counter all
right so now when we import counter it's
going to call this connect function
which is part of redox or route reactor
redox actually it's a but it connects
the two projects together and it sends
back you know a component that is now
connected to its redox state so I think
all this should work but one thing
that's important is we do want to
actually display our counter so we can
see the state in action and we can just
say counter and then we'll say this
props dot global counter
this is all very confusing but if we
remember from our redox state when we
looked at the the tool here you can see
that we defined our redox state as
global so we look you can see Global has
the counter in there and to take a
moment to step back at all this we can
say okay our initial state is set up in
our reducer of our component but then we
take that and we assign it we combine
that reducer with other reducers that
are used for like the routing and you
can see that we took the counter up
state and we assigned it to the value
global so that's how it shows up in
there but then in our counter
application we're then referencing this
dot products that global dot counter
well how does it know about the global
counter it does because it's passed down
to it via this connect and assigned so
that's really the all the magic and
everything that's going on there in
summary now let's go back to our store
here because what we're going to do is
we're going to make reference to the
let's say we're gonna make reference to
the component here that we just created
inside of our our store so let's go
ahead and create a think
you know I don't even care about this
main component here instead I want to I
want to I want to see if I want to see
if the index route works because I'm
gonna have by default I want to see if
we can use this index route and we're
gonna say component equals and we're
going to sign instead of main component
we're gonna bring in counter and I'm
gonna reference that right here so this
by default should say okay when you
request this page this main page that I
want you to render this this counter
component so let's see what happens real
quick make sure you pull up webpack it
should be automatically re re bundling
every time stuff changes
okay so says location forward slash did
not match any routes index route does
not make sense at the root of your route
config all right Jim bastard all right
you bastard I guess I guess we have to
define it route path there is a route
path equal forward slash components
equals
I guess I'm not gonna use the Internet
sprout you I don't want to get down
on that tangent or whatever and not
understand what's going on here so let's
uh let's avoid that for right now I'll
look into it later
but now you can see that we do have
because we're requesting the forward
slash which is by default the root
domain we have this counter and I start
clicking it's updating the state so if
we look at the state over here you can
see the counter is being updated so
Redux is maintaining the state even
though we have multiple components now
within our application so if I wanted to
create a separate component with a
separate path I could do that here and
we'll even have something that says
mother F and we're gonna actually use
our main component again and we then
have to also import it
all right so we've imported it so now if
I go back to my application and I go
forward slash mother F it does not get
found but the reason why is because
Express is actually trying to deliver
that that URL so we need to tell Express
hey let read and let react handle all
the don't don't try to do anything
so let's go over to app and we can
actually delete this app by the way -
all right so what I want to do is I want
to go to the start J's file where I have
expressed to find I think if I do a star
every single URL that matches is going
to I believe that's what's going to
happen I believe every single one will
match the home page but we're about to
find out
all right boom
so the problem now is that it's always
rendering the index template
all right so the reason why is we
actually don't need the forward slash on
our path we just need to simply say the
name of the path so if I go over here
and I refresh it you can see it is
working now so I take it off mother F
and I go back here we get back to our
counter applications so now we have
routing that's being done via react
using Express and Express is actually
saying every request I get I'm just
going to handle it as index page and
react is perfectly fine with that
because they're like hey I'm handling
this so at least react router is
actually doing all of that magic so once
again guys we are coming to an end to
this tutorial video let me know what you
think I know it this is like this is not
for beginners and some of you guys are
beginners out there you're gonna
complain you're gonna be this
shit's too hard and I understand so this
isn't really catered towards beginners
at all I would say this is more advanced
and and I think that if you follow along
you know enough times maybe have to go
through this couple times then
eventually it will start clicking but
you know this initial setup is the
biggest pain in the ass I think once you
have it working though it actually
starts to really do a lot of wonders for
you especially we start building more
and more components and things like that
so that's really it for right now so I
just wanted to show you guys the full
working example and then eventually I'm
going to start making components that
are more to do with you know movies and
things like that and and rendering them
in this way alright guys thanks for
watching take care bye hey guys so a lot
of you asked me how do I get my foot in
the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
