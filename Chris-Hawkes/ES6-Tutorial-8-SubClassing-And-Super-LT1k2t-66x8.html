series in this es6 tutorial and we're
going to be looking at so classroom and
javascript or the es6 brought us classes
we can also extend the classes by using
subclasses and interview that we're
going to create a class called member
which extends the band and actually does
it it's like somebody that describes
itself a class member extends band and
then we put it inside curly braces so
now here I could actually like do
something like overwrite print name so I
could say you know this is going to
implement its own version of print names
so I could say console dot log this is
an override all right so now if I were
to go ahead and just say down here
Bayside we're going to do if a member
instead of a band all right and then we
could say print name and then just for
X's and Gables we're also going to print
the parent function that is not being
overwritten which is print origin you'll
see that that also works the same so
let's go over here and you can see this
is an override and then Origin Queens
New York so we were able to carry on
with the functionality that we need now
one of the interesting things to note is
that you can see that member since it
extends band it still needs to pass in
the arguments that are needed for this
you know for these these are these
values to exist so like if I were going
to say you know what let's create a
constructor on the sub sub one so we'll
say constructor and we'll say origin
this isn't going to work here let me
show you why okay so we could say you
know what this dot origin equal origin
and we'll go ahead and know that the
 thing to do let's do John run for
genre window we're gonna say this genre
equals genre so now let's go into a
print genre function that only exists on
the subclass whilst a console download
this all right so what's happen if we go
ahead and we say you know I looked past
in the third argument and we're going to
say alternative is the genre so we would
expect the first two arguments here to
be assigned to these two and then we
would expect to be third to be a sign
right here so let's see what happens and
we're going to go ahead and print the
genre to participate side French Jean
wrong all right go ahead and try this
you can see we get nothing so we
obviously had a compilation error and
you can see one of the issues right here
it says this it doesn't know what this
is in the subclass and the reason why is
because anytime you're going to try to
reference a property from within a
subclass you need to call duper before
you can do that so you need to say
stupor and then this is weird but yeah
you call super that way you can
reference to this property from the
parent class so let's take a look at
this and now we get this is an override
origins undefined and then we get base
time so why is the origin of the find
damn wise annunzio because the subclass
didn't get it so the subclass needs to
actually take in all the same values so
I would have to do name origin genre and
then we'd have to go through this
painstaking process for being like you
know what was the supporter but we would
say this dot name equals name
and this coercion equal origin I
supposed to explicitly you know Safety's
out and take these in and now that we're
taking a man this should all just work
fine you can see we now get all three
now the interesting thing you're
probably thinking of we should probably
label down that substance like why do I
need to call super then
well technically at this point you I
think you still do this trip into this
yeah you do still okay so you always
have to call Cooper anytime you're going
to do this from a subclass but in
addition to that it's all we're going to
if I didn't have to have values to sign
through the valleys being passed into
the constructor like you could have this
dot let's just say car equals Honda Fit
all right so now if I were to say you
know this this car is like the only
recipe that I could yeah look at this
top are equals now you know winters will
just console.log console dot while
you're this rock farm let's do that
feel like my example getting a little
bit too complicated here but here you
can see it can get Honda Fit if we
didn't have super it wouldn't work so
let's just look at this real quick get
rid of all 3d so I'll use let's pretend
it doesn't need any values at all it'll
actually ignore the valleys type in so
this time we're not assigning anything
so we shouldn't have but it's the same
situation like even if we're trying to
reference something that's assigned to
the parent like this is it's a
statically assigned to the parent class
it's still not going to work without
super super has to be there so we have
super back and you see it back so the
fact that matter is here guys is that
super doesn't have anything to do with
your home constructor arguments being
passing super is all about do I need the
reference this do I need a reference
properties on the objects that I'm
inheriting from and if the answer is yes
you need to reference those properties
then you have to call super so that's
all about sub classing and super in your
six let me know if you guys have any
questions make sure you vote up and
subscribe I appreciate all the support
and have a good hey guys so a lot of you
ask me how do I get my foot in the door
to become a programmer and I just want
to take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12-week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here-and-now for web development
some of the things that they're actually
teaching in the 12-week course it's
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
