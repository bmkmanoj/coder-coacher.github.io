again and looks like it might rain on me
right now but uh I read a quote the
other day and I remember hearing about
this a long time ago and it just
recently brought back some memories when
I read about it but Mark Zuckerberg the
CEO of facebook you know the
20-something year olds startup founder
of facebook who dropped out of Harvard
and became one of the youngest self-made
billionaires of all time had once said
that uh that younger people were just
smarter and you know at first I I hear
something like that I'm like what I
can't be true i mean look at you know
somebody like Isaac Newton I mean when
he wrote his uh I mean when he wrote
though the laws of motion that Principia
mathematics or something like that I
matematica I don't know what it's called
but I believe he was like 40 money wrote
that or somewhere around there but I
think of you know these these different
you know the scientists and
mathematicians and I'm my god well some
of them had you know they had big
breakthroughs and later on in life you
know even like Copernicus and the Dutch
astronomer who discovered the moons of
Jupiter and the rings of Saturn and
maybe there's not as much smarts
involved in something like that I think
that there is but you know I immediately
think you know defending myself that oh
yeah there's got to be you know plenty
of examples of older people that have
that have made major technological
breakthroughs you know even later on in
life and that that can't you know it
can't be true and um and I think that a
22 year old prick you know probably
thinks that you know but I also think
that and I guess what I worry about is
that you know that 22 year old prick
might have been right you know he might
be right it younger people might be
smarter there is one thing that is for
sure though when it comes to younger
people and Silicon Valley startups is
that younger people are or desired
because you know they will put in the
major hours they don't have families
they don't have you know a ton of life
experiences getting in the way you can
sell them on on your vision and feed
them your kool-aid much easier than you
can
tried and true you know tenured IP
associate who's been spending 20 years
with with IBM or something I mean you
know so so even if you know if that's
what you know what he believes and and
maybe he believes that because he wants
a bunch of younger engineers working for
him because he can pay them less money
then you know even if that's the case
the question is whether or not there's
any truth to it I don't think any of us
are ever going to know the answer to
that I think that if you look around at
some of our younger generation them
especially like you know United States
and what you see on social networks and
you know the comments of news articles
and things like that I think you can
easily see that some of the dumbest
people are the younger ones you know but
that's just my you know my opinion and
that's an observation that I make from a
father so our young people smarter
possibly will young people work more
hours will you be able to sell them the
vision of your company much easier than
yeah the answer is yes definitely I
think younger programmers and most
important of all for a business owners
that you're going to be able to pay them
less money to be able to do this and and
develop your products and and uh I mean
I think a lot of is because you know
young people they haven't necessarily
you know enjoyed what you know would
like offers right i mean they're working
their butts off you know to get through
college to get their first job to
impress their employer because they want
to have what everybody else around them
has but once you have what everybody
else has and you have that big home and
and you know a middle-class neighborhood
and you have you know that boat and your
dog and your Finch and all that stuff
like I think at that point you start to
change right i mean you start to look at
okay now i'm looking at like retirement
right or i'm looking at like you know
how am I going to get my kids through
college and stuff like that you're not
looking at okay let me work for the next
snapchat so that I can build you know
some some new product that deviates from
it I do another product that exists you
know by the slightest bit but you know
we're gonna we're going to change the
world and we're going to we're going to
push that forward and everything so I
don't know I mean is that why is that
why these entrepreneurs are saying that
young people are smarter because you can
sell them on your vision a little bit
easier I personally think that there is
some some truth to that probably and I
think that in some cases young people
can probably learn faster than than an
older worker but but more than anything
I really just feel like you know ageism
is a major problem in the IT industry
and I think it's unfounded I think
people are just conveniently looking for
it out to pay somebody less money I mean
we see it all the time we're seeing jobs
get pushed overseas we're seeing workers
get brought and you say companies can't
fill roles and stuff so you have guys
that literally have been in sequel for
for 25 years who can't find a job but
somehow you know that that's the sequel
developers that the companies are
looking for exists overseas I mean I
don't know about all that but i think i
think it was definitely a crappy comment
and he did apologize for it and i think
that naturally young people are going to
believe stupid things and i don't know
guys I mean I don't think young people
young people are smarter i really don't
i think that there's there's plenty of
evidence showing that there are masses
of young people out there that are some
some of the probably dumbest of the
previous generations you know by far so
anyway guys let me know what you think
have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
