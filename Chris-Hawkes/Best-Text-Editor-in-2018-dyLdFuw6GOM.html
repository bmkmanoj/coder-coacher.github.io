video I'm going to be talking about the
top ten text editors for 2018 since it's
the new year and might as well do these
top ten lists they're pretty popular
they're obviously opinionated so there's
really no sort of science or magic
behind it just the fact that I've been a
programmer for like what eight years so
my dad 109 years and this is just kind
of what I see in the industry and what
people are using one of the things I
want to mention though is that I'm not
including the 2 most popular editors
which you're going to find and you know
in the coding world like so you're gonna
have Visual Studio first for c-sharp 8
or you know Visual Basic so any sort of
c-sharp you're gonna see a lot of Visual
Studio but it's not a text editor it's
actually an IDE which is antegrade a
development environment so it's not
quite the same thing this is going to be
way overkill compared to just a typical
text editor and while we're mentioning
it we should also mention Eclipse which
is basically java's version of Visual
Studio
once again that's an IDE so we're not
including the IDE s in this list alright
so the first one number 10 on this list
is going to be coda and the reason why I
have it is number 10 is it only works on
Mac so I don't know a whole lot of
Deveaux I know there's a ton of
developers that use a Mac but I've never
used a Mac for my development but I
still will go ahead and mention coda now
obviously they're talking about Kota two
already but anyway code has been I've
been around for a while so check them
out if you're in if you're doing Mac
development then that's probably a good
text editor for you so the next one I'll
mention is Jeannie and this ugly
bastards been out for a long time
actually it looks like I think 12 years
ago was the original release date it's
written in C and it's just very fast so
if you need something very fast and
lightweight Jeannie like it's still
being used by a lot of developers even
12 years later number eight on this list
is the Komodo edit product which is
actually made by the guys my friends
over at active State and this one they
have their Komodo editors so that can be
a little bit confusing but Komodo edit
is edit is the text editor and then
Komodo it is actually there there
development environment so that can be a
little confusing for beginners but the
only downside with comodo is that it's
actually not not not free in fact most
of these commercial products obviously
wouldn't be free and this is one of the
few on this list that is not a free
product or an open-source project
alright so number seven on this list is
actually going to be a tie between them
and Emacs and these are both products
that I'd never use I've used them a
little bit I don't like it I don't like
a lot of old-school guys though they
love this stuff they love customizing
the hell out of both of em and Emacs and
I'm probably never gonna be in that
crowd but it definitely deserves to be
listed because there's obviously still a
lot of older developers around I don't
know of any too many young people that
are new into the industry like ten years
or less that are using vim or Emacs but
I could be wrong on that I just I don't
see it too much you could even see that
even the website for van looks like it
was made back in like 1994 and then and
then here is Emacs here so a lot of
people just love the flexibility that it
provides and they have all these like
they can use our keyboard they don't
even use our mouse and a lot of cases
and they're just they're just tabbing
all over the place and doing crazy
that I just can't even fathom but I have
both of em and Emacs tied at number
seven on this list alright number six is
gonna be notepad plus plus and this
might actually I think it number six is
a pretty good spot for it I feel like it
might be you could make an argument that
it should be a little bit higher because
I know so many people that are still
using notepad plus plus so from a
personal experience I try to keep it
like not too personal even though it's
still opinion I definitely see notepad
plus plus being used quite a bit in
multiple places that I work so if you
ever needed a quick editor it's almost
like this is like the first thing a lot
of developers think open it's like oh I
need some sort of quick text editor let
me just go ahead and download notepad
plus plus so it's completely free and
everything
again I think comodo head it's gonna be
like the only paid one actually and then
the next one on this list does have a
paid version as well so number five is
going to be sublime text and they
actually started this entire color
scheme that it like now there's that you
can download extensions for visual
studio visual studio code all this stuff
even eclipse and he'll even you can even
download an extension for
for Chrome development to have this
color scheme so this color scheme was
made popular by sublime text at least as
far as I know I've never seen it before
sublime text had it out but it's their
default color scheme and like everybody
seems to love it
at least people that prefer the darker
themes but it's very very dark you know
very dark and colorful and everything so
then sublime text is also great because
when it first came out it was one of the
first editors that that existed that
actually had support for JSX when JSX
was a new syntax like it wasn't
supported anywhere this was before
Visual Studio code or before Adam and
and yeah sublime text it was like the
first person to offer JSX support so
that's why I got involved in it now it's
not it's not completely free it's
actually free for evaluation purposes so
you can evaluate for as long as you want
but there's a certain you know there's a
certain level of I guess moral sir that
if you're just like evaluating it for
everything you're probably an asshole
like because you're not gonna pay the 50
bucks either that or you're broke as
hell you can't afford it but maybe
you're not an asshole I don't know but
anyway alright so number four on my list
here is brackets which I like this
project here it actually has almost 350
contributors on github there's like
nineteen thousand commits or something
like that so it's a popular project it's
all about being lightweight it's about
not trying to give you so much stuff
that you're not going to use like a
visual studio or something like that and
it's about being able to see your
changes relatively quickly so it's
really it's really the benefits of that
but I like how it's also open source and
once again it's a pretty strong and
stable product so we're gonna see
brackets get more and more popular in
2018 so the next one number three on
this list is neo of em and and I
probably have this a little bit too high
but what I was excited about the fact
that it was like a drop in early it's
not even it's not even a replacement of
them it's just an extension of them but
it makes them so much more usable to me
so that's why I'm excited about any of
em and I expect to see this to gain more
traction as like more of the older
developers kind of exit out of them and
either move over to neo them or like I
said it's an extension but it kind of
the entire functionality and everything
so definitely check out any of them if
you're interested alright number two is
atom this is still one of the definitely
the popular editors out there it's
actually using it's it's it's it's a
web-based environment so like it does
very well when it comes to being able to
step through web-based code and stuff
like that so if you wanna be able to see
your changes real quick or step through
your browser using source maps and
things like that there's a lot of built
in support for them to work hand-in-hand
because like I said it's a it's a
web-based project both this and the
number one on my list are actually using
the project called electron which is it
was normal it was it used to be called
atom shell but now it's called electron
but it's just a framework that allows
for cross-platform development I'm using
chromium so Google's chromium engine and
nodejs so it's definitely an option it
can be a real memory hog like slack is
written using it obviously atom visual
studio code and I think Spotify as well
but it is a memory Pig I understand it's
got memory problems and stuff like that
a lot of people pointed that out but it
is a newer technology so it's it's you
know it's going to get better over time
but atom editor is certainly a very very
popular Tech Center there's so many
packages and everything for atom it's
it's unbelievable so number one on this
list and it's awesome my personal
favorite but I've also seen it gaining a
lot of traction if you read hacker news
articles and things like that a lot of
people were talking about Visual Studio
code last year in the year before so
there's so many different packages and
everything like I said that make both
this and atom a great option I think
these two are clearly the frontrunners
when it comes to a text editor and it
seems like one either prefers one or the
other so it's like I think there's
really not much of an argument between
one and two here on as far as text
editors are concerned but whether you
use atom or Visual Studio code it's
gonna be a very similar thing I prefer
Visual Studio code just because like I
just I like the coloring I like the
packages I like I don't know it just
seemed like I had to install less tools
and things like that because it was
built after Adam so I think it did it
probably took some cues off of what
well and expanded upon that but I'm not
you know once again this is all just
personal opinion but those are my top
text editors for 2018 thank you guys for
watching have a good day bye hey guys so
a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in the
suevi course it's geared to get you into
the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
