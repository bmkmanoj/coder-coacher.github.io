to talk about this for a little bit
because I haven't really understood the
purpose of some of these things that
come out and I kind of questioned you
know in some cases like you know what is
this product where they offer and I must
be missing something but medium comes to
mind with a product that comes out that
everybody seems to like talk about and
say it's gonna be the next best thing
and and then I look at it and I'm like
well you know what is this am I looking
at
like blogspot or something or I you know
I don't really know what medium does and
even to this date like I don't
understand why people are so attracted
to using medium this medium website is
essentially a blogging platform which to
me it reminds me of like WordPress or
blogspot or any of these you know many
other platforms that were built to help
bloggers out but the problem that I see
is that many bloggers are trying to make
money with their blogs like they write
about what they're passionate about and
then they should be able to in turn
you'll be able to monetize and
capitalize on the the traffic that they
receive and and obviously that's given
rise to like WordPress and one you know
when WordPress can WordPress still ours
at our power so many blogs out there
that you know I feel like it's still a
pretty legitimate platform even though
I'm not a huge fan of the PHP language I
think that if you were going to be a
blogger why not use WordPress and you
know medium has come along now and you
know it gives you this there's no
ability it's a little bit prettier I
would say then some of the WordPress
themes that are out there but at the
same time it's also very plain so I
think this is like overly plain but some
people may disagree with that but here's
an article that's been written and the
commenting and everything I think is
terrible so this commenting forum is
absolutely awful it looks like just a
subpart comment system if you compare
this to discuss I just I don't know man
it looks it looks very plain I don't
understand the whole reply options the
heart yeah it's cute but I mean is it
that unique I mean I don't know like I
guess I'm not trying to say that medium
is a terrible site I really don't I just
don't understand why if I were a blogger
I would go
medium and use their platform to try to
drive my visitors and things like that
personally speaking any sort of content
type site you might as well just create
your own if you if you don't have enough
skills to create your own and use one
that's going to give you as much control
over your monetization options making
sure you don't lose all your data if if
medium decides to drop your content or
something like that you know I mean
there's so many different reasons why
you would just want to set up your own
stuff and right under your own database
and everything else because then nobody
can just take that stuff away from you
unless you break the law of course and
like you know some of your country or
something comes after you but the fact
of the matter is if you're posting to
something like medium you know they own
that site even my youtube videos and
stuff like that you know I make the
decision the decision to to post at
YouTube and they control my content for
the most part now I have backups of my
videos and stuff that I do so I could
technically take the videos that I make
and take them to another platform and I
still have that option and I suppose you
could do the same with medium you just
want to make sure that you are saving
these blog posts wherever you know
whenever you write them but um I you
know I choose YouTube more than just a
content platform to try to give me more
viewers I choose it because it provides
video streaming which is not something
that I can reasonably do on my own when
I compare medium to WordPress or tube
just building like a Django website
where I control on my content I'm trying
to figure out what does medium supply me
that I can't get on my own now some
people will say well medium is gonna get
you you know new exposure and all that
stuff but I have a hard time believing
that because you know some of the best
written articles that are written by
people that are you know highly
intelligent on a matter and they post a
medium they would probably get just as
much relevance you know if they just
posted it to their Jango website and it
was you know put out on the blog I mean
Google gives good results based on good
content so if a lot of good content and
smart developers are writing on medium
of course it's going to look like
they're getting a lot more extra you
know bump for their or bang for their
buck or whatever but for the most part
you know you're writing there's blogs
and things like that that are being
written by all kinds of different people
that may or may not
be good writers or may and may not be
very good or very knowledgeable that the
subject that they're writing about and
things like that and medium isn't going
to help those types you know what I mean
so another thing about medium is like I
said you you then have to obey by you
know mediums terms like for the longest
time like I don't think they had any
sort of monetization in fact they still
may not I don't know if they do or not
but I was reading it you had one
particular article that said they were
trying to bring it to the platform so
mediums been out and the article was
written into 2016
but medium has been out since 2012 so
you know the fact that you know several
years have gone by where people are
posting stuff to medium and then they're
not getting paid for any other views and
stuff like that I just I don't really
see the benefit there and it's just
another example of something that claims
to be you know the answer to all of our
concerns and you know and why we should
use this product and stuff like that but
it the only people that seem to be
benefiting from you know this hype is
the actual company themselves and their
founders medium was created by one of
the twitter founders and it was supposed
to be like the newer version of twitter
where you could get more content you
know i mean like instead of it being
limited to 140 characters you could
write and have more pictures and make it
all pretty and stuff like that and you
know that was the the whole entire
premise of it but it's like isn't that
what pretty much every website is trying
to do they're trying to to build a
pretty you know they they want their
website to be as pretty as possible and
to to drive as much traffic as possible
and to make money and things like that
so I don't know man if I were if I were
to like blog and be a blogger and stuff
like that I would not be using medium I
wouldn't be using blogspot or anything
like that in fact I would be using
WordPress if I didn't know how to
program and if I did not a program I
would just use like a Django or Ruby on
Rails or even some sort of nodejs
framework and I would control and own my
own data and my own publishing platform
if you're a good enough writer and a
good enough blogger if you're going to
be and make find success on medium
you're going to be able to find success
on your own except you're not going to
be limited
any single way now if you're not
interested in making money you just want
a pretty looking sight than sure use
meeting medium but other than that
though I mean I think it's got an
inferior commenting system so far and I
think that its overall simplicity is
nothing new so let me know what you guys
think man that's just my thoughts all
right guys take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
