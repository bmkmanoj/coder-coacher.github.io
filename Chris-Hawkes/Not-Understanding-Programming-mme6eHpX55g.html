a different room in the house
never never done it from this room I
have a question it wasn't really a
question was more of like a guys
outpouring and he's that he's a young
guy and he said that he's been he's been
developing for a few months and and he
started getting into some Python and but
basically he thinks that he has a
beginner syntax down so you know it's
how to do some basic you know Python
basic stuff but hit his concern is that
like he's trying to read about
programming theory
programming algorithms and it just feels
like he doesn't get a grasp of it that
he's never going to be able to just
succeed I suppose because he feels like
he's just not getting it like he doesn't
he was saying in his and it is a long
way like sending me on Facebook and I
would share with you guys but didn't
have my camera on me
but anyway I'm just kind of going off on
memory also what he said it was it was
it was basically it was it was a new
developer who was questioning whether or
not he was in the right career because
he did not see himself being in a
position to be able to apply some of the
architectural patterns or even better
than that being able to come up with
some of those himself so basically he's
looking at some of the smartest people
in the industry and then trying to
compare himself which is a terrible
thing to do nobody should ever do that I
can tell you the vast majority of
programmers that I work with are just
typical people just you know your normal
people you know they're not geniuses and
things like that it doesn't it doesn't
take a level of genius to be able to do
what we do it does take a decent amount
of smarts though some people may not
have the capabilities to be able to do
this so I'm not trying to go out there
and claim it everybody can be a
programmer sometimes that kind of rubs
me the wrong way where it's like hey you
can't find a job why don't you go to
something and you can be a coder and all
this stuff and it's like oh you could
get a job at Burger King but you're
gonna be a great coder you know it's
like let's be let's be respectful of the
industry you know what I mean we're not
a bunch of idiots right I mean
we we are all experienced professionals
making a lot of money because not a lot
of well a lot of people can do this but
not everybody can do it and there's a
there's that there's a huge demand for
people that can do it so if you can do
it and this is like you know whether or
not you choose to do it because a lot of
this whether or not you can or can't is
gonna come down to whether or not you
really want to or not
but with this guy though he he's
concerned about okay I read about like
okay there John Carmack your creator of
Jim Wolfenstein Wolfenstein 3d like
hugely successful guy great program or
one of the best probably ever exists a
college dropout by the way never went to
college also had some legal trouble
growing up and everything but you know
ridiculously smart guy he's the kind of
guy like you don't want to compare
yourself to so like when you're looking
at and honestly I can't think of the
algorithm but the other day I stumbled
upon it but in quake 3 if you look it up
in quake 3 there is this algorithm that
just kind of boggles developers Minds
like they it's some sort of reverse
something or another and honestly I'm
doing a terrible job of explaining at
the basic if you look up quake 3 or John
Carmack and you can look up that art
that algorithm that he actually created
and it was something that like like for
him to be able to discover that he was
trying to solve a specific problem
number one but number two we shouldn't
try to compare ourselves to some of the
best and the brightest in this industry
like I mean if you're in physics you
shouldn't compare yourself to Albert
Einstein so many people do I've actually
read about so many people that are going
to grad school and they want to develop
the next best thing and and they're more
focused on being the next Albert
Einstein them to truly to really try to
advance the field it seems like at least
that's just my kind of far away type of
a
a viewpoint and we do it in development
as well man that's why we have so many
different frameworks and everything
that's why I have my own framework it's
almost like it's the status quo to kind
of reinvent the wheel and and try to
show how valuable you are and how much
you know and everything and the only way
to do that is by kind of reinventing the
wheel because we're really not that
creative we're not all john carmack
we're not going to come up with some
sort of and if you look at that
algorithm from doing it from from quake3
you'll know what i'm talking about it's
like the typical that most people
are not going to understand but but we
also you know we weren't coding from
from you know eight years old or
whatever John Carmack was when he
started so I guess my point is that it
can be detrimental to your growth to try
to compare yourselves to people that
have been in the industry longer that
and then in many cases you know are
probably gonna be more capable of doing
you know amazing things and then you
know when it comes to like algorithms
and things like that doesn't necessarily
mean that you can't be like a good
business guy a good programmer make a
150,000 dollars a year you know in New
York City or something like I mean none
of that stuff is gonna prevent you from
from doing that but if you want to give
up programming because you don't
understand how or you don't feel like
you're gonna be capable of doing things
like you know I'm just gonna keep going
the same example john carmack then I
think it's a really bad reason probably
to give up programming or even to be
worried about your career there's gonna
be theory and and and things that we
that we deal with day to day out from
Lee whether it's cryptography or things
like that so we're just simply not going
to understand and we don't have enough
time to understand it and we just have
to rely upon the experts that have been
in that industry that have kind of wrote
the book on those types of things and
and and we can still thrive and succeed
day to day without having to understand
those true and are working so just you
know basically don't don't try to let
that be a detriment to
continue programming or not like I would
have I would avoid all that that
programming theory and everything if
it's bothering right now I'm curious you
know with this guy like specifically
what was he working on it and
specifically what what algorithms what
would architectural patterns and things
was he trying to follow that he's then
trying to you know to fully understand
at the point where he's trying to you
know expand upon it or come up with his
own architectural patterns that only
comes through you're just you know sheer
repetition through trial and error
through a lot of a lot of a lot of
coding man that's the only way there's
code code as much as you can I would
imagine that if you can do that if you
just code man you'll be fine all right
take care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
