probably should have done this in the
last video but what we need to do is
just try to clean up a little bit of
this complicated template that we just
brought in which looks phenomenal but um
I wonder I'm gonna go and collapse a lot
of this content here and so we want the
footer and all that stuff to stay but we
want the slider and all this crap to be
removed from this particular template
and we want that to go into the actual
home page inside the block content so
we're going to paste all that in there
scroll all the way the top so now inside
of our base where we removed that stuff
we now want to add the block like we did
in previous videos we're gonna say block
content and then in block
up here in the title when I say new
music this is gonna be the title
and we probably need to have a meta
content description block
we still need a block tag for the header
and that's because if we put any sort of
custom scripts that we only want to load
on the pages that need to load them
that's what we do there we can add those
inside the block header and then same
thing for just beyond just before the
closing body tag we want to have the
block footer scripts that way we're only
loading JavaScript if we absolutely need
to for the pages that you decide to
utilize that space so let's go back over
to home and we're gonna add the title
and we're just call this home because
it's the new music home other than that
that's all I'm gonna utilize for the
home page so if everything goes well we
should be able to refresh our page and
still have a similar result except this
time the slider and all that crap is
being it's being added to sorry I'm
thinking abut the slider and all that
stuff is being added to the home page
and not the master page so if another
page inherits from the master page it
doesn't have to have that huge slider
and everything in fact will do that now
so I'm going to close down this slider
and we're gonna just add all this stuff
in fact what I'm going to do is I'm
going to copy this entire base template
and I want to also put it inside the
band
and then I'm just like with home in fact
I'll just copy this entire thing with
home and I'll put that inside band and
in this time I'm gonna take out this
slider so if we decide to use the slider
later on we can do that but I'm taking
that out for right now all right so now
if we go over to the band and the band
should be using its own homepage now and
this time it's going to inherit and
you'll see that it doesn't add the
slider because we told it not to we also
see though that by doing that it seems
to have messed up our art nav and
everything so that's kind of jacked up I
wonder if we're missing something
no there's no errors or anything so
let's just make sure that's I'm gonna
put the slider back in there
we put the slider back in there see if
that fixes the CSS which it does so that
kind of sucks that the entire layout
seems to be dependent upon the slider
we'll have to figure that out and uh in
a video here coming up but for right now
it's kind of jacked up to be honest with
ya
I wonder inside of the slider what would
cause that to happen
I wonder if maybe we just took out the
UL if I could actually
I'll take this out first actually no
I'll take out both of them see if we
leave the div class slider if that fixes
the problem okay good yeah that fixes a
problem so kind of sucks we have the
slider but it looks like the logo and
all that stuff is dependent upon the
slider so anyway we're gonna go ahead
and finish the video here and you can
see that this page is drastically
different from the home page because the
slider is not there so we don't need
that humongous slider on on the band
profile pages that we'll end up adding
to some more in the in the following
videos alright guys thanks for watching
