got a question here from ash Kumar it's
kind of long but he says I'm a recent
photo of your channel and I've gone back
and watched quite a few of your videos
I'm usually on the ball with watching
whatever new you come out with the same
day so thank you for that I said I had a
question for you and he says am I bit my
background is as in c-sharp so he's been
doing C sharp for about five years now
he says he loves it he's ripped through
all kinds of beginner to intermediate
tutorials on pluralsight he then moved
on from C sharp to JavaScript and he's
done quite a bit in and out of that so
he's saying that he um he's been in and
out of he dropped he dropped a career
that he had for five years to actually
start being a programmer and and he's
done this before so this time though
he's been very very serious he's been
developing pretty hardcore now he says
for I think he said yeah no he's okay so
he dropped a five-year career he's been
programming seriously since I don't know
how long he's been programming I would
imagine I don't know I I'm imagining
like what six months maybe I have no
idea he doesn't say but he says he has a
girlfriend who's actually pitching him
to a company that she knows and they
have a wordpress site they're looking
for a wordpress developer which is a PHP
obviously and they're looking for the
typical stuff like get a template going
google analytics setup the server
probably on a shared host or something
like that obviously enabling eat email
he says he'll get paid and the inhale
out the advantage of being able to put
this gig on his resume so you know he's
hoping that he can actually get this
deal he said well what bothers him is I
he's fearful of getting distracted and
splitting his attention into another new
thing while he's still in the process of
learning you know the dedicated the
dedication he's had to see sharp and
javascript / you know whatever period of
time it is he said in the past I've
started programming and thought about a
career change but then quit it
prematurely so he's actually gone down
the programming road before and has
taken up a few times he said this time
it fills the most serious and he
definitely wants to stick with it to the
end so he's a big fan and having strong
fundamentals so he says that
if he gets into WordPress he feels like
he's going to want to learn the ins and
outs of the PHP language and obviously
the word for a wordpress framework and
he says I know WordPress is pretty
lucrative for smaller independent gigs I
just fear that I'll convince myself to
dump c-sharp asp.net for wordpress for
short-term benefit so he says so I'm
sorry that this point is too long but
basically he's just he's concerned that
he's given up his career that he spent
five years in and he's now considering
himself a programmer and he's dedicated
quite a bit of time to c sharp into
javascript and now he doesn't want to
jump onto the first gig that he can get
which is in PHP because it's going to
it's going to take him away from where
his learning has been focused so far now
this is a two-way is a two-way street
really I'm the number one I've said this
and other people have said this online I
see a lot of senior developers saying
this all the time did a lot of the
junior newbies that you don't want to
jump around from thing to thing too fast
because then you're not going to be able
to grasp the inner workings of whatever
sort of language and framework that
you're working and you're not going to
develop enough fundamentals you're going
to be just jumping from one thing to the
next there is some truth to that and I
would definitely say that that applies
to things like the JavaScript community
if you read all the JavaScript boards
like job boards you could go crazy with
all the JavaScript technology that you
have to learn you'll see backbone react
ember angular 1 verses 2 we're going to
see es6 and gulp and web pack and babel
and grunt and all these other human
bodily motions or sounds or whatever and
and you're just going to try to jump
into all that stuff and it's going to
absolutely drive you crazy because
there's no way that you can be the
master of all of those things so it's
it's typically best that you pick one
even if it's an old-school thing like
knock out which is already considered
old school because it's like four years
old or five years old maybe older but
the thing is is that you're not going to
lose a bunch of your programming ability
by sticking with an older tech for
longer in fact you're probably going to
have to bend that thing to your will and
you're probably going to get way more
experience doing that you know dealing
with something like knock out if you
actually got deep into web development
using knockout as your tool of choice
for data bind
this is just an example then you would
jumping from react to angular 12 then
angular 2 and then back into react es6
and redox and all this other stuff so
you can definitely go to spin yourself
in circles in the JavaScript community
now does that apply to something like C
sharp and PHP I've said in the past that
I don't think PHP is like the best
language when it comes to actual
language design and fundamentals but I
have nothing wrong with with people
making a living with PHP in fact if I
had to make a living with PHP I would
certainly do it i've used PHP before why
I don't hate PHP to some point where I
wouldn't use it and I think that even
though i don't do PHP development i feel
like you know I've heard a lot of good
things about laravel that I could jump
in and start writing some code in PHP
and larry bell and if there was a job
and it was lucrative for me to do that I
would have no problem doing that now if
I fast forward back to when I was first
getting started let's say basically when
I was first getting started i was doing
pearl i'll give you a story now there
was a similar situation where i had a
family member that knew somebody that
knew a company in DC and they were a
hydroponics company and not like the
marijuana weed company but they sold
hydroponics actual plant growing
supplies out of the store in Washington
DC for because of it in urban areas it's
harder to grow garden so hydroponics and
things like that you know in growing
your garden inside and probably people
grow weed with it too who knows but they
that was their whole gig they they sold
this stuff and you know their big tree
hugger type people and all this up and I
didn't have a direct communication with
this company so that was number one
probably the wrong thing but I was also
being shielded from the company because
back in those days i considered myself
like a programmer but i had no business
really calling myself a programmer i
could barely scratch the surface with a
server-side language or understand even
the basics of like SQL SQL yeah i could
barely do you I I remember though I end
up you know signing on to this this gig
and it wasn't a contractor eating is all
just kind of word of mouth I was
supposed to get paid 2,500 to build the
UI
all I was given was one image of what
they wanted this website to look like it
took me like three weeks but I got this
thing this in fully working CSS HTML and
it was all standalone just JavaScript
HTML CSS nothing else there was no I was
not instructed to anything server-side
anything like that I was supposed to
pass that to the server side guy so I
did all that stuff right and my code
probably was very sloppy for UI code
this was before bootstrap was a thing
and um I ended up you know I provided
this to the the partner that was
supposed to be doing the server side
stuff he had the meeting with this other
person in the company and it turns out
like the people at the company like they
really I didn't authorize this design
and all this stuff so whoever authorized
the image and say hey that's what we
want the website to look like apparently
there was this big confusion about who
actually authorized that all I know is I
didn't authorize a goddamn thing I
wouldn't have built it you know just for
that for the hell of it but I ended up
getting screwed out of 2518 collected
even a dime and even to this day even
though that was very long ago I don't
deal with building websites for people
customers they don't know what they want
especially web development you start
going down some row but they're like
yeah I think I wanted to do this I
wanted to act like eBay and uber and all
this other stuff it's like dude you
what are you talking about your Nuck
you're not going to get that you're
crazy people spend millions of dollars
for websites like that and if you want a
website like that for me or a 50 grand
maybe I'll consider it but nobody's
going to pay you that kind of money they
don't pay what they don't even pay you
what programmers deserve to be paid
let's be honest programmers on average
senior programmers are having a hundred
thousand dollar a year salary so that
means they should be getting especially
if it's their free time they should be
getting at least 50 to 75 dollars an
hour if not one hundred and fifty
dollars an hour depending on what your
expertise is in and nobody wants to pay
that nobody ever wants to pay that they
think that oh yeah I went you know wicks
is offering a free website they set me
up I got hooked up with verizon and got
a free Wix website and blah blah blah
and it's just and that's all
that's all just big companies that are
fighting for a dollar and you know using
all their ad space and stuff like that
to try to say that you can have a
website for your business for just five
dollars a month or something like that
but you want to start you know having
invoices generated database you know
setting up servers all that stuff yeah
do your pan wait more than that so and
i'm not talking about ash Kumar who's an
asking this question I'm going off on a
side tangent here about you know being
screwed out that deal but I don't
actually do any sort of web development
projects for anybody in fact I get
people asking me emails all time to do
sell form and I just don't I won't do it
umm there there's not enough not enough
money and time involved generally now if
there was like a good enough offer I
would obviously consider it but like
just just recently packt publishing has
reached out to me to do to to actually
author a book which is the first time
they've ever done that because in the
past they've asked me like co review a
book but only thing I get in return is
my name in the book and then to free
copies of it and I at one point I was
like considering it because I was like I
put my name in a book but yeah I don't
know man let's we're talking money pack
publishing you got to come up with some
sort of figure because I I don't even
feel like having a conversation if I
feel like it's not going to be worth you
know even even a conversation I mean
there's times where it's just not even
worth having a conversation but with
anyway let's get back on this subject
this subject though I would definitely
do it if you feel that this is going to
be a detriment to your learning
abilities somehow then I would obviously
I would go with your gut feeling because
you need to ride this I t-wave wherever
it's going to lead you you already left
your career you consider yourself a
programmer now even though you may not
be on a you know a salary programmer yet
but you know what I say good for you
because I did the same thing man I had
an identity that I was a programmer for
three years before I was ever a paid
programmer before I was ever even making
any money I considered myself a
programmer that happened to have another
job that I was doing but I consider
myself a programmer heart like I went
head over heels into it and eventually
you know there's a saying you fake it
till you make it and I was certainly
faking it for a while we're like I would
not be able to contend with certain
senior programmers but does that mean
that I can't do like you
I didn't deal with a lot of graphics
people or front end people and and now
front ends a lot more difficult with all
the JavaScript stuff but you know I
basically I've been able to contend
wherever I go relatively well and I'm
not the smartest guy by any stretch so I
think a lot of people can do it with
with enough dedication so if you really
feel like like I said that this is going
to hurt you then don't do it but i would
go with your gut and I don't think that
what your situation is applies to you
know what we're talking about was
switching from you react to angular
because it's the hotness you know this
week I think that's a different
conversation but with with PHP in fact I
would be going head over heels and
saying you know what I'm a PHP guy but
you want some asp don't know you know a
c-sharp i can do that too you know in
fact you want to get set up on azure
yeah I no problem I'll do that and
that's gonna be more money because as
your people want to go on the cloud like
that they're gonna pay more money so you
need to ask for more money of another
thing too when this is an advice to all
you guys out there in the old days like
I feel like google has got a lot better
especially the stack overflow it's very
it's matured a lot and we've talked
about the fact that stack overflow can
answer a lot of your programming
questions I wit and Python what is the
best way to to iterate two lists at the
same time simultaneously you know
iterate two dictionaries or you know
whatever it may be there the answers are
there but the website for example i did
a hipster code if you go to hipster code
i spent like three months on that and if
i were going to do another website and
say some sort of basic e-commerce site
i'm going to copy essentially the
framework that I have there if it's
gonna be a django Sam oz will copy the
framework that I have there because then
I just have to plug and play i'm going
to set up a new database setup that you
know update my settings files to point
to the new database for the new app you
know obviously put in maybe different
credentials depending on what sort of
you know AP eyes and things i'm hooking
up to but my point is is that you should
if you're going to be a freelance
developer you should have PHP sites with
working bootstrap themes and all that
stuff that you just have on your side
right here and it just slowly located
right where you can find it because that
way next time you got a PHP gig you're
going to pull out that thing and you're
going to tell somebody gonna be like
look and
fact you know I've even thought about
this Alan of it would work or not but
you could even go to some of these
companies that have terrible sights and
literally make them their new site by
plugging at a bootstrap theme and you
know setting up the site and then you
could even probably contact the owner
and be like look I can do the site for
you right here you know 250 bucks from
like that you know you can plug and play
like different themes and my whole point
is that you reuse your code because back
in the old days that's what programmers
had to do we didn't have github and
stack overflow and all the stuff they
have all these answers for us a lot of
times you had these like you know these
cut and paste codes code sections that
you you you stored and like when I was
first getting started in Perl like I had
all these different scraper things that
I would plug and play you know for if
I'm looking for certain keyboards and
things like that I would just I would
sub those things out but for the most
part the structure of my program will
remain the same and I still do that to
an extent like if I'm going to do a
flash site or a django say i'm gonna i'm
gonna you know go with this base that i
have and then apply it over and over
again and if i was actually looking for
work i don't know let me know if you
guys think it's a idea but it seems
to me like the other day I was at a
scuba diving site and I was like
basically looking at scuba diving out on
the walls i know i might try that but
then I realize that people die all the
time scuba diving and I'm not like the
most healthy person in the world so in
scuba diving from what I understand you
have to make sure you're relatively fit
because something goes wrong you know 20
meters under though the water and in
your ass can't swim up to the top
because of the the you know the metal on
your back or whatever I mean it's game
over but it was funny that I was looking
at this the scuba diving site and this
joker looked like it had been built in
1997 and I was just thinking you know
what this is a reputable company they
got reputable reviews online if I were a
freelance developer i would have a
simple bootstrap theme where i would
just take five minutes plugging in their
logo and stuff like that and saying hey
buddy this is your site right here i
already made it for you you know 250 500
bucks whatever it is you know something
that where you can just start turning
these sites obviously there's a lot of
people doing that but it just seems like
there's
still plenty of old websites out there
that need to be updated and that's one
of the good things about i.t as well is
that this stuff is constantly being
updated and many times like you know
we're just finding more complicated ways
of accomplishing the same thing which is
unfortunate but you could still make
money off of it anyway dude that's a
long way to dancer I think that was a
great question i would definitely go for
it man and I would go with any sort of
and make sure you save it because
obviously even what you're not saving on
your codebase also if you're building up
you know mental accumulations of not
just the obviously business dealings IT
you're going to learn a lot of full
stock stuff you're going to be dealing
with like okay do i set up these people
with an email server which i would also
caution on that you may not want day you
might want to convince them to say you
know what don't go with the email server
buy your domain from google and also get
to Google Apps you pay five dollars per
user somebody that you get your custom
email and that might save you because
you can be like vote email service get
hacked all the time your email server
gets hacked that's going to be on you
but with google that's on them you know
what I mean say you could buy fruit
photo you know basically convince them
the hell you might want to uptake it ten
dollars you start pocket in five if you
want to manage the account for them but
those are the types of things that
you're going to learn along the way I
mean just just business type things and
honestly just as I'm talking about I'm
like man I hate customers as far as
dealing with what customers trying to
figure out what what they want in the IT
world so if you could push them to it
like you've already said Google
Analytics or whatever I would push them
on the entire Google platform as far as
buy the domain from them by like I said
the google apps for their users so you
can do there John at whatever website
calm and and then uptick I'm on the on
the price if you want to do that anyway
guys let me know you think also please
Like share and subscribe I need to try
to grow this channel I'm in a little bit
of a lull right now so thanks man take
care guys bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12 week
intensive poor
focuses on the technologies of the here
and now for web development some of the
things that they're actually teaching in
the Suevi course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery no Jas react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
