humongous news organization it's not
just a website it goes back to being
like a radio station in fact I should
probably look up the history of NPR but
i'm pretty sure it's been around for a
very long time actually if we pull it up
on wikipedia we might as well do that we
can see that it's actually not nearly as
old as i thought it was for some reason
i thought it was like really old but
according to wikipedia assuming this is
accurate it's only like 46 years old so
the reason why they're there in the news
though is that they're actually removing
all the comments from their website so
you can see that they talk about just
general news and in all kinds of you
know just daily and world affairs and
stuff like that but you can see that
they they currently do use Disqus for
commenting and discuss by the way is a
python django website for any of you I
thon fans python django I'd randa at
their peak I think they were getting
like eight billion views a month or
something like that and they were able
to scale down on a django platform so a
lot of people tell you django see small
and all this other stuff and they
certainly scaled that really well but
anyway NPR they're removing all the
comments because the comments were just
like too hateful 22 and inflaming you
know people just never really have any
nice things to say for the most part
when you're on when you're talking about
politics and in other countries or in
wars and stuff like that a couple of
other sites that have actually gotten
rid of comments lately Bloomberg News is
one of the big ones the website Reuters
used to have commenting and now it
doesn't and apparently the verge is
another one so I don't really go to the
verge very often but another thing is um
in where you weren't seeing news
organizations get rid of comments all
together some of them actually change
their commenting system to use something
that allows for less anonymity and I've
talked about this in the past but at one
point I read this article and the
magazine was like fortune magazine and
had read Hoffman's face and everybody
was saying Reid Hoffman was such a
wonderful guy and this guy who was such
a visionary because he created linkedin
he used to work at PayPal had rich
parents went to stand
I believe but certainly he accomplished
a lot linkedin went public and and that
made him a billionaire and he was all
over the news and everything and all of
a sudden you went from being just
somebody that nobody ever heard of to
being like a genius and I say nobody
ever heard of I mean I'm like a
mainstream level but once he became a
billionaire with the stock became
publicly traded that's when he's on all
these news organizations and magazine
articles and stuff at least that's when
I started seeing a ton of them but he
was saying that you know man he had a
vested interest in this that he wanted
people to be less anonymous online and
that the entire internet was going
towards this direction of being less
anonymous people using their real names
and stuff like that and that's what made
linkedin you know worth so much money
worth wide over 25 billion or something
that Microsoft paid for it even though
linkedin wasn't really making very much
money if it was making money at all in
fact there were years where it didn't
make anything so obviously it was still
worth 25 billion dollars for Microsoft
to come in and scoop that up because of
all the you know the fact that people
just kind of went there as like a de
facto standard it's like oh yeah
LinkedIn's a new hot thing I got to have
a LinkedIn account to some extent we've
seen the same thing with like tumblr and
like even sites like stumbleupon like
you know ideas that just aren't even
that unique really but we still go and
we set up accounts and everything to see
if we can you know exploit some sort of
use out of it to make sure that we stay
socially relevant and everything so I
don't really do that much anymore I
don't really follow too much of the
latest social network startups but the
you know I can safely say though that
LinkedIn and Facebook and Twitter we're
on pretty much a separate level you had
to have those accounts like if you mean
you don't have to have a Twitter maybe
but when it came to LinkedIn if you were
a business professional you probably you
felt like or at least I felt like I had
to be on linkedin because everybody else
was with Facebook I don't even really
use Facebook I don't like the the fact
that i'm not all that anonymous on
facebook that like there's too much
friends and family in fact I don't even
promote this channel to any of my
friends or family I don't tell them to
visit it I don't share the links with
them or anything it's a completely
separate thing that nobody for the most
part even asked me in fact i would bet
you that my close relatives have no idea
that i have you know 30,000 subscribers
or 400,000 views and
anything like that they have no clue and
I like to keep it that way but what Reid
Hoffman was trying to do is he was
saying and like I said because he had a
vested interest he wanted people to open
up more and more share all their real
contacts and stuff so that he could you
know basically exploit you know the data
that is linking you know together all
these people in this business
professional you know web networking and
he was saying that were you everything
was moving towards that so in a way it
kind of ties into this whole commenting
system because if you look at something
like YouTube YouTube can have some very
good discussion like I feel like people
have you know some pretty good
discussions on my channel that for the
most part it's not like the straight-up
trolls and stuff but if I see like you
know a video maybe of like you know
trump or Clinton or something like that
you know the amount of hate that is
filled in those comments is just
absolutely insane if i watch somebody
like markiplier and i watch a video and
I you know I like some of the stuff that
markiplier does I don't get to watch
them very often because I'm usually too
busy but you know he's one of those
social gamers and stuff you know kind of
like puta pi which I came to say his
name right but they yeah they get so
many comments and so much of it is just
spam or hate and all this other stuff
it's like we're like you couldn't even
possibly read them like I remember
watching a video that markiplier had
posted and within eight hours it had
over 50,000 comments there's no way mark
seeing even a portion of those when I
was reading through some of them it was
mostly just you know people hating on
them and like it's just like people
should probably have better you know
things to do but the point that I'm
trying to make I think and all this is
that what I've noticed is that some of
the people that actually fill the the
thread forms of you know that you is
discussed so basically a lot of the
people that will go to NPR or Mother
Jones or the hill com or a lot of these
political news types websites it's
usually like I see the recognizable
trolls you know you're going to have the
you know the Republicans roles that are
saying hateful things about you know
Democrats or you know different
movements and stuff going on and then
you have the other side of the spectrum
and those are typically like not your
majority that's not what most people are
thinking but I'm always wondered to
myself like you know what type of
influence are these people having on the
you know the occasional passerby that
checks out a few comments and then sees
this you know this one person who's
obviously a fanatic who's on the website
all day long every day it seems like
just commenting over and over and over
again about this person that person it's
like I'm just wondering what type of an
effect does that have on society I
actually think that it actually breeds
hate a little bit and we've talked about
this before I've talked about the whole
social networking thing in the past
where I feel like it's you know the
downfall of humanity like I think
socially in some way social networking I
mean we're at like a new low and in
society it seems like just because
anybody can can voice their opinion it
doesn't have to be factual so if you
went out and said this person is a
racist or this you know this or that
like I mean that there's no fact
checking for the most part some of the
sites that do do fact-checking like I
mean you could seek it out but you just
you don't get that in the masses you
know it's like if you're looking at your
Facebook feed I mean people are just
posting stuff and like I mean it's false
like I've talked about that in the past
as well like with the Einstein quotes
that just drive me crazy we're like he
never even said it in fact in the United
States there was an entire billboard of
something that wasn't even factually
true and it had to do with with Einstein
and it was trying to promote education
it's like you know what are we doing
like we can't even fact check you know
on a government-run project that's going
to put up a 60 foot wide billboard on
the side of some highway all paid for by
US tax dollars and then the organization
that's responsible for doing it can't
even do with some basic fact checking I
mean that's it's crazy so NPR sees too
much hate they're going away with it
it's not just them other websites have
done in the past USA Today actually got
rid of their old commenting system and
now they use Facebook commenting a lot
of people are towing back on facebook
because you're tied to your real name
and stuff like that so the same thing
was done at Politico where political
used to use Disqus and you know people
were just ranting and raving all day
long they now use Facebook and lo and
behold they're not even the most
popular political platform anymore the
hill com is and the hill com still uses
this anonymous commenting system where
it's just filled with trolls now the
interesting thing when NPR released this
article stating that they're going to be
doing away with the comments they had
this they had determined that it was
like a very small percentage of their
overall population was actually using
these commenting forms so even though
news articles would have you know seven
eight thousand comments on them it was
only a very small portion of their
entire audience that was actually
commenting and making use of it once
again it kind of supports what i just
said we're like you have a few fanatics
that are just basically spamming the
entire comment form now the contrary
that the contrast or contrasting point
of view of all of this though is that
you know what does this mean because you
know people should be entitled to free
speech right you should be able to well
you not hate speech and stuff but you
should be able to you know say what you
think and you know we obviously know
that news sites and things like that are
very very biased whether its left wing
or right-wing they can be very very
biased with the information that they're
displaying and most people are going to
be too lazy to do any sort of
fact-checking or anything like that but
then again commenting isn't really the
answer because then you just get you
know filled with spam so I just worry
about you know what happens when you
know people can't voice their opinion
and you have mainstream opinions being
provided by news organizations that are
knowingly biased so that I think that
poses a little bit of a problem another
example would be something like hacker
news which is a really good website to
go to to get like a developer you know
comments and stuff like that you know
typically you know what it seems to be
well-educated nerds you know basically
so and not just in the IT field but also
I see medical and Sciences and things
like that so it's usually some pretty
good discussion there but they are in
some cases kind of like a circle jerk
which you've heard of that term with
things like with some of the reddit
communities and stuff like that where if
you don't agree with their line of
thinking that you'll get booted out of
their their their forum your comments
will never make it
to be seen and stuff like that and and
it's you know it's just unfortunate
because you you basically have to quell
free speech in order to fight spam or
just to promote your image which or your
message or whatever which may or may not
be factual so I think it's a no-win
situation there was a time before the
Internet obviously where people couldn't
just voice their opinions on every
single news article and there was a time
where you read the newspaper and you
didn't have like you know 500 comments
that you were sifting through about you
know this and that and you know a lot of
times not even related to what you just
read but you know some people enjoy
reading those comments I actually enjoy
reading those comments in the past I've
actually trolled people before just
because I mean I've said before I mean
sometimes it's you know am I say troll I
may sound like I'm like really hardcore
trolling somebody but i will give
contrasting opinions sometimes even what
i believe to just stimulate a discussion
to me that's kind of like a troll move
but i don't know so you know i do enjoy
reading them sometimes but at the same
time like i don't think that I'll miss
them all that much I don't think that
they're making me like a better human or
anything but there could be an
opportunity for somebody out there
that's able to somehow sift through what
they feel is a troll comment or you know
even if you just view like one person
shouldn't be allowed to comment every
five seconds you know what I mean like
there should be a way to block that user
without actually having to go through a
manually block it you should just
automatically block a troll that's just
commenting that much that's that's
insane so I think there's I think
there's a way that we can keep comments
around but just do it better so if
you're going to do like a JavaScript
maybe a chrome plugin flame if you're
listening you can do one of those just
anything like that i think i think that
can even make money for somebody if you
have a good enough product because some
people are just blocking it all together
and that may not be the answer so anyway
guys let me know what you think man i'm
dragging on on this video take care guys
have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
