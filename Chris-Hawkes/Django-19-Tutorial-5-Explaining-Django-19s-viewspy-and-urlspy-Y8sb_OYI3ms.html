just give you guys forewarning I am
tired as a mofo right now so I'm also
not going to be doing that whole
background image where you can see me
like talking and stuff like that some
people like that some people probably
don't I don't know but it's kind of cool
how I kind of removed the background so
I kind of liked it I think it's cool
anyway I'm not gonna be doing that in
this video and I am tired like I said so
I might mess up a few things but
hopefully I don't so what I want to
touch on in this video is looking at the
views in an Jango and explain what they
are and I think it's best if I just kind
of pull up their documentation to
explain it but a view is a Python
function so that's what it's talking
about when it says a function and all it
does is it takes in a web request and it
returns a response right so in the HTTP
world which stands for hypertext
Transfer Protocol and you can think of
it as when you look at your your network
panel like if you're using Google
requests that are made out to Google
these are all HTTP requests and you get
these status responses back so 200 means
good 404 means page not found like 500
means a server error so they have all
kinds of different codes and everything
but with the HTTP request you can pass
information like headers and then the
headers can actually have data that gets
passed along with it sometimes that data
is serialized in the JSON format which
is a JavaScript way of transferring data
from one browser to another through HTTP
sometimes it transfers XML and you can
also transfer any way you can transfer
all kinds of crap and then you can also
get a response back so when Django is
talking about requests and responses the
HTTP protocol that Django handles is all
delivered through of you so the
application routes traffic via the urls
file and it sends it to the view which
is really just a Python method that
takes in this Django request object and
then you're going to return some sort of
risk
so for right now let's go ahead and
we're just going to return static HTML
back from our view and if you go over to
our project our project here we have the
URLs are already created for us at least
some in your basic Django project they
should be there and all you have to do
is just uncomment and you can see that
it says forward slash movie what this is
is a regular expression so regular
expressions were really revolutionized
by the Perl programming language and
really it's just a very cryptic ugly way
of being able to traverse text to find
information regular expressions they
have all these different symbols mean
different things so like this dot means
match anything the plus sign means match
anything at least once or more and they
all have different meanings and some
people are very very advanced with
regular expressions and other people
just kind of scratch the surface with it
so you don't have to be some sort of
regular expression guru to be able to
use it however you do have to have some
basic information about how it's used
that this carrot symbol which is like a
north-facing greater than sign basically
that's known as a carrot symbol I don't
know why it's called that but that means
match to start so what this is going to
match is the URL and your application so
if we ran this thing
so this thing's actually not even gonna
be able to run yeah just because we need
to be able to have a views file that
this movie is pointing to alright so
actually what we're gonna do here and
we're gonna make some changes to this
movie URL here because this movie URL
isn't going to match up what we're
trying to do with our application number
one let's go ahead and I have this point
to the video app that we created in the
last video so let's go ahead and save
video and we can actually get rid of the
movie part here and we're gonna say
video about URLs so what that says is um
use the video app and then use the URLs
file so if we look over at our video
folder structure you can see that we
don't have a URLs file so we need to go
ahead and add a URLs file to our video
app so under the video folder we're
gonna create a file called URLs dot py
and keep in mind the URLs that py file
is responsible for routing traffic in
Jango and we can actually borrow from
this URLs because any time you have a
URLs file you need to include all this
SH is nitrite here and this is the URLs
file of our main project app so let's go
down to the URLs and we'll pay setup at
the top now a few things you need to add
is you need to add this URL patterns
because what we're doing is we're
pending to the Royals URLs file that is
in the main Django app and then down
here let's go ahead and give it a view
that can be accessed and once again I
can actually copy I can copy this line
right here from our URLs and the main
app put that junk right there and we'll
uncomment it
and now this obviously needs to say
video views and we're just gonna have
the name be video and what this name is
here guys is this is the name of the
function in your views file for your app
so the function name is going to be
video so if we go to our view as file we
need to go ahead and create that
function called video and we're gonna go
to the Django example here and we can
just copy this joint and we want to
change this name because the function
name has to match so we're going to say
video and since we're using the HTTP
response as well as the date/time object
which date/time is part of the Python
library and the Django HTTP response is
part of the the Django library but we
have to import both of those so that's
what we're doing right now so if
everything goes well this urls file of
our video app is going to point to this
video function on our views file the way
it gets matched up is this caret sign
followed by the dollar sign means match
anything
so as matches beginning to end so
basically it means match nothing because
there's nothing in between it so it's
going to match everything essentially so
when you go to the URLs and we were
saying whatever our domain names so say
this gets deployed as new movies com
it's going to be new movies com /video
and it says oh you said forward slash
video that's going to be handled by the
videos URL so it says okay let me go to
the videos URL and this this thing says
oh match nothing and deliver this
function under the videos view and
return this so it's going to return this
response here so let's go ahead and run
it here I made a few changes hopefully I
didn't miss anything
all right so it compiled that's pretty
good so now what I was saying before
this is our domain right now it's our
localhost address but if I said forward
slash a video you can see that it's now
delivering in that view that we had told
it to render so instead of the whole
date time now we probably don't need to
do that let's get rid of that and we'll
do something a little bit more formal
where we could say message we'll just
say
let's put this in an h1 tag so somebody
had pointed out that I shouldn't have to
restart my server every time so I'm
gonna see if he's right and you can see
that it's not taking effect so I don't
know if that's my server or what but
maybe it's a Windows thing I don't know
it seems like that's always been the
case with me so I've gotten in the habit
of restarting the the development server
every time
so we'll go to the /video and you can
see that it's delivering the static
static response so if we look at it it's
just passing back straight HTML so this
would be pretty fast it's not the way
that you would actually return data but
if you needed to do some like quick and
dirty data response like say you're
returning some JSON data there's no
reason why you can't use the HTTP
response just to send back some you know
straight JSON formatted data and that
might be you know a lot quicker than
obviously so I guess my point is in the
next video I'm going to talk about
templates in Django but you don't
necessarily always have to have a view
return a template sometimes it's just
going to be raw data sometimes it could
be HTML just like this if that's what
you choose to do so everybody's
situation is different but typically you
wouldn't do this for a complicated web
page so in the next video we're gonna go
ahead and talk about how we send down a
template as instead of this hard-coded
HTML response all right guys thanks for
watching and once again I'm tired as
balls tonight I don't know why well
actually I do know why it's because I
worked all day and didn't get a whole
lot of sleep last night so feeling good
though feeling good about where we are
with this tutorial I appreciate the
feedback please vote up man I got some
got a couple of guys that try to vote
vote my videos down there's at least one
troll out there that votes down every
one of my videos I'm not saying all my
videos are great but um I don't know man
it's just it's a it can't be a
coincidence that like sometimes I'll
post a video and like literally there'll
be one down vote and like 20 up votes
but that one down vote was like within
like three seconds of me posts in my
video I actually think it's like some
sort of a bot or something I probably
have some sort of guy out there that's
hating on me and wrote up a bot to
constantly troll my my channel to see
when I post new videos and download it
so if you guys could do me a favor and
help me fight back against that bastard
and vote up my videos I appreciate it
and I do appreciate all the support guys
I've said that before actually I'm
having a hard time
bonding to all the comments and stuff
says sometimes I can't get back right
away I do apologize I have to work
during the day I have family I have
you know life and stuff that sometimes
gets in the way but I definitely read
all the comments and stuff and I if I
can't respond right away with you know
what I feel is a good enough response
and sometimes I have to put it on the
back burner for a few days and I just
you know I apologized if I don't get
back to you in any sort of timely
fashion but I do appreciate all the
comments and this support guy so thank
you have a good night and we'll talk
about templates in the next video all
right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
