I'm talking about in this video is the
top Python modules and libraries so I
included entire frameworks in this list
and I guess that's arguable whether or
not I should have done that but
basically libraries frameworks they're
all the same thing for this video
presentation and as I started making
this I actually realized that there was
way more Python modules that are very
like that are very important day to day
use in Python so I couldn't list all of
them and as I started adding more and
more and I'm like I kinda have to cut it
somewhere you know cut it short
somewhere so I didn't this isn't like a
fully inclusive list or anything like
that so disclaimer if I didn't mention
something I apologize and hopefully you
guys can just mention it in the comments
and let me know I'm so here I'll go
ahead and get started first one is
python request which i think is really
awesome so the request framework was
actually created from a guy in northern
virginia i had no idea
I just recently connected with him on
LinkedIn which was pretty cool because
like I said I'm from Virginia so I have
no I had no idea that one of the most
important Python libraries out there
right now was created by a guy that went
to George Mason and is right right down
the street from where I live
so with this library what you use it for
is for request for scraping so like HTTP
it's very good for just parsing out
Jason and once you really start to be
able to hack the modern web when it
comes to viewing Ajax posts and requests
I get some posts and things like that
this request library is is super
important it's really replaced the the
old URL URL Lib module that everybody
was using
so now python request is is definitely a
library to check out so next is a
scrappy scrappy as a web scraping
framework and scrappy is awesome because
um but basically if you want to build
something like Google and the original
Google search engine was built in Python
by the way but if you wanted to build
something like a Google bot that goes
and starts parsing link after link you
could create something from scratching
not you know understandable you would
know how it works and everything but
scrappy does a lot of the
hard work for you as far as how a
scraper and a web search engine should
operate so some of the stuff will be
foreign to you when you first join or
first start you know checking into the
library but a lot of this stuff is being
done this particular way for a reason
the one downside dysgraphia is that it's
still working on the Python 3
implementation
last I checked a few weeks ago it was
almost completely ported which was
really cool because it had only
supported Python 2 7 for the longest
time but now it's up to date with the
latest Python 3s so probably three point
four would be relatively safe to use and
first crappy but anyway it's still a it
was still coming along last I checked
but definitely a library worth it worth
checking out for Python
next is tornado I actually did a small
presentation on tornado but I really
think it's awesome because if you're
going to build a super-fast website
that's non-blocking so similar to no js'
or something like that python does have
options with tornado and you can build
just a super simple web server and if
you wanted to create a framework like
you know like flask or something like
that then tornado would probably be a
good place to start because even flask
uses the the work zhuge if i'm
pronouncing that right web server so
this is tornado is is its own
implementation similar to work search so
definitely something to check out next
one is pillow so any sort of image
manipulation we used to use pill pil
yeah it was definitely one oh so pill
was lacking with certain features like
transparent images and resizing aspect
ratios and a lot of things that really
are that get complicated when it comes
to image manipulation but pillow has
solved all of our problems when it comes
to that so I've used pillow extensively
when I was actually downloading images
resizing them and keeping their aspect
ratios and things like that so pillow is
definitely the best image manipulation
library out there for python as far as I
know next one is sequel alchemy so that
is a object relational mapper which is
essentially Python code that queries
databases so it's almost like stored
procedures basically where your Python
code is written in a certain way where
it bends it ends up you know querying a
database and basically the most
efficient way possible so you don't have
to worry about writing complicated
sequel commands you could just write and
learn how to do it in the Python sequel
alchemy way and it will handle a lot of
complicated issues for you this is very
similar to something like Django's
object relational mapper django has
their own but sequel alchemy is the same
way like in Django when you write your
models and you query your database and
things like that you're doing it in a
django object relational mapper way
same thing with sequel out for me a
sequel alchemy is very popular websites
like Yelp use it and a bunch of other
ones so definitely one of the more
popular Python packages in fact I've
actually heard of people that in use
Python for their websites just to use
sequel alchemy so definitely a popular
option next one's beautiful soup
beautiful soup goes back a long long way
the beautiful soup is a HTML parsing an
XML parsing library so if you're trying
to do some data scraping beautiful soup
is definitely an option for you in the
past one of the complaints has been that
it's slow but unfortunately there's a
tremendous amount of effort that's gone
into this project and it's not easy to
solve all of your web scraping problems
but beautifulsoup aims you know it does
it as good a job as any out there when
it comes to that so definitely check out
beautiful soup they've definitely made
improvements along the way and it's good
for data scraping now the problem with
data scraping nowadays is that it's all
Ajax requests and Jason and stuff like
that so the data exists inside the
browser and in many cases beautiful soup
isn't going to help you there because
it's just parsing HTML source but that's
where Python request comes in the first
module that I mention here because when
you start analyzing what requests are
being made you can start duplicating
those requests and and you know
obtaining that JSON data from the server
instead of having to have the browser do
it for you so there's always ways
if a browser is rendering data that
doesn't exist in source it's coming from
somewhere and ultimately you can analyze
that and use the library like beautiful
or I'm sorry
Python requests to be able get around
that now if you're if you're just doing
traditional websites where the data
exists in source you might as well use
something like beautifulsoup because it
will make it really easy for you the
next one is Python selenium so when it
comes to database automation and
scraping you can't get any better than
selenium the problem with selenium is
it's low the positive though is that you
can automate so many tasks using the
Python in selenium and in many cases if
you're not trying to build a next Google
search engine it's pretty much all you
need to be able to parse the web and
just get all the data that you could
possibly need so selenium is very good
Python selenium is is it comes in other
flavors so this isn't just necessarily a
Python implementation but selenium works
with Python it works with c-sharp and
Java and it is certainly a popular tool
let's use everywhere but python is very
easy to work with when it comes to
selenium next one is PI QT so if you're
going to be doing any sort of GUI based
out graphical user interface is what GUI
stands for but GUI development is is
obviously a popular option with Python
because things are portable you can
write in Python and your executable will
run on my Mac or Linux or Windows so a
lot of people do use Python for GUI
based development I've never been big
into GUI I've been more on the web side
of things but PI QT is definitely one of
the more popular GUI based applications
or library frameworks out there for
writing that type of software in Python
the next one is an honorable mention for
the most part is kivi I've had or keavy
as always pronounced I've had some
issues with trying to get keavy to work
I'm sure that they've made some
advancements along the way but
ultimately what Kiva is trying to do is
the same thing as like probably what
xamarin was trying to do with c-sharp
where essentially you can write code in
one language and it compiles and
basically makes it much easier to port
say you're writing for Android you
it makes it much easier to write it in a
Python specific way where it works on
Android and then you just have to make a
few tinker's to get it to work with iOS
or something like that so that's
ultimately how those things work but
unfortunately they never work as easy as
they advertised and that's just because
things are relatively new TV is an
open-source project but even companies
that were you know billion dollar
companies like as Ameren which just
recently got bought by Microsoft still
struggle with building a basically
having one language transpile into all
these different operating systems like
iOS and Android so for that reason you
know we've seen things like react native
that have come along to try to solve
that problem problem TV is pythons
attempt to solve that problem last time
I checked it needed some work still but
definitely a cool project out there to
follow hopefully it's going strong I
haven't checked on it recently next one
is flashed so now we're getting into the
web framework territory Python flask is
a micro framework so it's not trying to
do everything for you when it comes to
website development but it is a very
popular option for getting a website off
the ground quickly and if you're not
trying to build like a game game
changing web application that needs to
handle all kinds of authenticating it
can basically handle all of that stuff
but ultimately you end up having to
write a lot of what other larger
frameworks are doing for you in flask so
although it does solve you know the same
problems that a larger framework does
and you know the fact that matter is
that you still have to implement stuff
that you know you wouldn't have to
implement in a larger framework so
there's pros and are pluses and minuses
for all of these types of frameworks
flask as a micro framework if I was
going to do a simple blog I'd probably
do it in flask if I was going to do a
more robust web application I'm going to
do it in Django so Jango is definitely
the de-facto web framework out there for
Python there's many frameworks I could
mention web to PI web by a bunch of
other ones cherry pie pyramid but the
fact of the matter is when it comes to
web development in Python Django is the
the big frontrunner there it's like
rails for
Ruby on Rails for the Ruby language
Django is pythons Ruby on Rails or what
Ruby on Rails is - Ruby Django is the
Python so anyway guys definitely if
you're going to be doing some web
framework development do django if
you're going to try to get a corporate
job in Python web development in many
cases it's going to be a Django job and
Django is still going strong after all
these years in fact it's probably more
popular now than it's ever been the next
one is for bioinformatics data crunching
number crunching so you're going to look
at libraries like SCI PI and
unfortunately I'm not really into that
kind of stuff so I can't really comment
too much on the ins and outs of it but
certainly a popular language when it
comes to that type of thing as well as
numpy so that's another scientific
computing library and then the last one
I was going to mention is anaconda which
is a relatively new Python framework out
there and really what it's doing is it's
it's creating is making it easier to
manage all these different scientific
computing packages that are out there
which Python is very very important in
that industry a lot of people are coming
out of college or they're you know doing
machine learning these data scientists
are using these different Python
algorithm libraries and data plotting
libraries and things like that well
anaconda is kind of the unifying force
to try to bring all that stuff together
so it's a honorable mention as like more
of a new library that has come along and
is extremely helpful so that is really
it for the end of the list I didn't want
to continue to add more and more but I
really feel like I could there are
plenty of other libraries out there that
we all run into so much hard work is
poured into the Python community when it
comes to you know really the fact that
all of this stuff is brought to us by
guys and girls that are just donating
their time in their efforts in their
brains and they've created a truly
tremendous language that has a
tremendous amount of community support
so it's awesome to be a Python developer
I think and and that like I said is
coming from a guy that typically does
c-sharp development and JavaScript
development so I like to be well-rounded
in all of these things and
anyway guys so if you're thinking about
using Python
definitely check it out Python 3.4 would
be my recommendation at this point and
try to use it with any one of these
libraries to just start tackling
different things that Python can do one
of the other mentions is um there is a
PI game framework so if you're
interested in doing games like simple
games PI game might be an option for you
alright guys thanks for watching have a
good day please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
