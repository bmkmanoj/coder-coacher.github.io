so I've had a few questions about how I
actually taught myself to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to kind of address how I did that
I went a little bit of an unconventional
way because I never went to school to
learn to become a programmer I've
actually never taken a computer science
course at all and don't get me wrong I'm
not here to say that like what I did was
right and going to school is stupid or
whatever because I don't agree with that
at all in fact I wish I would have gone
to school but everybody's path is
different in life and with my particular
case I mean I went from I've been a
truck driver I've delivered pizzas and
I've done plumbing and HVAC work and
I've done all kinds of different
professions I was one of those guys who
had to fix my own car so I would teach
myself how to do that on YouTube and I
mean I did things like transmissions and
rack and pinions and all kinds of
horrible repairs that I had no idea what
I was doing but I taught myself you know
through the through the channels
available on the Internet so I think
that the Internet has definitely you
know created this new revolution of just
information which is crazy um and
unfortunately a lot of people take it
for granted and they don't they don't
use it to their advantage in fact they
use it kind of to make themselves
stupider in my opinion in a lot of cases
and people that just tweet everything or
just constantly commenting about their
their lives on Facebook and saying
stupid things that they should never say
in front of respective employer
prospective employers and bottom line is
that I use the Internet to actually be
able to teach myself how to program so I
started off with CSS and really before I
even jumped into CSS I had decided that
I wanted to be a web developer and this
was around 2009 or so so Facebook at
that point was like blowing up and when
I looked at Facebook I'm like oh I can
build a better web site than Facebook
and you know not knowing anything about
what I was talking about
I had this like ambition and this dream
really my dream drove my ambitions and
you know that's a huge thing I think
starting out if you're going to teach
yourself because you have to be
disciplined and probably the greatest
asset will be determination so that you
don't give up so you let yourself
believe that you can build the next
Facebook or whatever it may be to
actually get you to where you want to be
that's my probably my biggest advice for
for having them to learn something like
this because it's not going to be easy
at all so I decided I wanted to build
this out music website and then I ended
up using Adobe Illustrator where I was
actually drawing out my templates and I
got like you know basically my home page
of what I wanted to look like and it
looked really good and everything so
that my next step was I okay I need to
learn basically the the styling language
of the web which is CSS stands for
cascading style sheets so I started with
that actually started with a CSS 3.0
book I can't even remember what it was
called though I think it was called the
hidden manual actually CSS 3.0 the
hidden manual that was a great book in
fact that was probably the best book
I've ever had in any programming
language at all because I had tried CSS
I believe in other books and even going
online and stuff like that and I just
couldn't figure it out and a lot of
people might boil CSS is easy but you'd
be surprised I work with a lot of people
I've worked with a lot of people in the
past that really don't know CSS at all i
mean and i find it very difficult so CSS
on its own can be very difficult so when
you're first starting out I mean don't
think it's just going to be easy some
people might say it's easy some people
are going to say it's like impossible
the balance is in between there
somewhere so everybody learns at their
own pace and I don't think it's anything
that's that's just easy to pick up if
you have no kind of background in
programming
I mean hell you don't even understand
how what browser works and what a Dom
tree is and all that stuff I mean you're
just like you barely know what a
selector is and in fact even like you
have these words like selector and
grandfather and children all seven you
just like you're trying to make sense of
it and it's just weird you know it's
weird coming from a non programming back
ground so long story short there I am I
ended up moving from CSS over to
JavaScript jQuery and I was at this
cross words were where jQuery was
popular and a lot of people were like
well you don't even really need to learn
JavaScript anymore you can just learn
jQuery so just pick up on that and
that's kind of where I picked up because
I was like I don't want to learn
JavaScript from scratch if I could just
use jQuery so jQuery makes a lot of
things very easy little things you need
to do like hide and show stuff so I
still recommend that somebody probably
look at jQuery even before JavaScript if
they're really looking to hit the ground
running if you want to you know be a
next-level web developer and get into
like angular and react or something like
that then I would say probably focus a
lot more on JavaScript but for simple
web development I mean it's still about
jQuery and jQuery plugins even now so
that's not bad advice at all there so
jQuery was a struggle for me not
understanding scripting languages or
functional languages like JavaScript and
and then not really understanding what a
JavaScript library was or how to create
my own I just basically kind of lucked
Boxster or guess my way through how to
get things to work in jQuery and and in
every part of this path was just
painstaking but you know probably six
months into my development I was
actually building real webpages you know
that did stuff like you hover over a
navigation and drop down or you click
this and it showed you know hidden data
and stuff like that and and it looked
pretty because I was using you know
templates and stuff that existed
nowadays we have you know bootstrap so
why learn CSS from scratch when you can
just kind of learn bootstrap way but if
you truly want to be a really good
developer a full stack developer you
should you have to know CSS I mean
bootstrap does not solve all your
problems
so after jQuery I then ended up moving
on to a language like I needed a
server-side language I need something to
be able to run on the server to be able
to take data to interpret what needs to
be done and and
and what to display and things like that
and I started off with pearl for some
weird reason I thought pearl would be a
good idea at the time pearl was still
like you know touted as like the Amazon
language and it still had a much it had
a bigger following than what it does now
and it still has a decent following it's
just it's been falling off the map
because of languages like Python I'm
really taking a lot away from it but I
started with pearl and the problem with
pearl is that you can do like everything
you do in pearl there's like ten
different ways of doing it right and the
community is not nearly as strong online
as some of the other languages I've
dealt with and this is before even Stack
Overflow was blowing up in popularity so
getting getting information on how to
accomplish a certain task and Pearl was
like really difficult because pearl is
one of these languages where you can try
to make things all on one line and as
creative as possible and like basically
you make it it's almost like it's almost
like there's an entire mantra of it's
cool to make your code someone readable
that nobody else including yourself is
ever going to figure out what the hell
you just wrote so it's very very
difficult for newcomers to come along
and look at that kind of code and and be
able to be able to expand their skills
basically because my issue was that it
you know you have to do something over
and over again especially in programming
for it to make sense and become second
nature and to remember how to do it the
next time you need it and with pearl
every time I'd have to go back and be
like okay how do I do a for loop or how
do I open a file or do this or chomp and
you know I had like every time I went to
a different website or whatever there
was like some other way of doing it so
and that's you know pearls hole you know
nature is that there's more than one way
to do it I ended up getting frustrated
and I ended up moving over to Python so
I started with um my learning Python I
think it was like fifth in with the
mouse on a huge book and that was
probably the second most implement
influential book that I've ever had in
my programming career because you know
he immediately the author immediately
jumped into the entire you know Python
verses Perl which used to be a big
debate that
a purl dominated Python all through the
90s but then into the 2000s and
especially once the MVC like Ruby on
Rails days came along Python just ate
pearls lunch I mean as far as you know
getting a community growing and
everything so he immediately address out
in the book which I thought was cool
because I was coming from Pearl I was
like ah yeah yeah but he wasn't bashing
Pearl and saying use Python or anything
like that he gave this completely
unbiased review of the two different
languages which I thought was really
cool so just with Python things were
just so much easier how do I open a file
how do I read a file line-by-line okay
now I'm looking for a particular piece
of text in Python okay I need to use
regular expressions and granted in case
you any pro guys are out there Perl
regular expressions are better than
Python I understand that pearl is better
at regular expressions than any other
language since they invented it I
believe or at least revolutionized it
but with with Python just everything
made sense if I didn't understand how to
do something I would go online and there
were you know somebody would have some
you know highly regarded way of
accomplishing something which they refer
to as pythonic and and it just made
sense so Python instead of you know
there's multiple ways of doing it in
Perl there's just one way of doing it in
Python or at least in one right way and
they call that the pythonic way so I
embrace that especially as a newbie
comin along trying to figure this stuff
out I mean I don't need you know
craftiness and and cuteness when I'm
trying to learn how to do something and
Python was just you know it required
that I indent my code to make it
readable not only for other people but
for myself and the community was was
blowing up at that point too because the
django web framework was and was just
getting you know getting getting popular
and other Python frameworks were
springing up and I remember I actually
got involved in um like I started with
Django blocks I'll jump to that now so
after I had gotten Python down enough I
started with like Python scripts right
so I would build single Python files
that would become complicated I mean my
code was so sloppy I had I think I had
one Python file one time
that was like sixteen thousand lines of
code or something some ridiculous thing
like that I mean my editor would crash
when I brought up my Python code it was
this big-ass complicated scraping
program that just went from like not
even function to function like it was
just like in a straight line bla bla bla
like all the way down like it was not
robust the slightest thing broke it I
don't even really remember what I was
doing I know I was taking data from the
web and then parsing that data and then
storing that data and oh my god like I
wish I I wish I would have saved that
program to either I don't even know if
I'd show you guys I'd probably not be
I'd probably be too embarrassed to show
you guys but I'd like to see it myself
because I mean that would have been just
atrocious and this was like four years
ago five years ago something like that I
think is like five years ago around that
and and that's a good thing too when
you're a programmer like you notice
month-over-month how well you're growing
and you can just see changes yeah
sometimes as short as a month you're
you've seen that you've grown
unfortunately probably also forget that
or fail to see that we forget some of
the things that we've already learned as
well because there have been times that
I go back and if--and learn something
again it's usually quicker the second
time around but you know you do you do
lose information if you're not into
something day to day so after you know
building these these programs to collect
all this data I needed to build a
website and that's when I ended up
jumping in the Django but Django I found
was like really complicated there's just
so much to it and just even trying to
grasp like how it's modular base like
it's all about components and Python and
Django and you know like these apps that
you build are supposed to be
self-contained I just never I couldn't
really grasp that you know it's like I
didn't understand how anything could be
self-contained I didn't even really know
what self-contained meant and and
programming so I ended up jumping to
another web framework for a while which
was a web to PI and I was actually had a
decent relationship with some of the
founders like Massimo and I'm still
friends with him on Facebook and there
was a few guys on his
team that were just very very helpful
guy named Brno and I really liked their
framework in fact I mean I probably
should have stuck around a little bit
longer but I ended up jumping back to
Django at some point and never really
looked back because you know after I did
that like I was able to get my apps in
the Google App Engine from there I built
a so I built a music website and I built
a Movies website and I built all these
different types of websites and I ended
up getting you know the full time
programming gig mostly as a UI guy up
front because my JavaScript and CSS
skills were better than a lot of the
people that I worked with so and that
was you know without any sort of
training whatsoever and I found that
stuff to be easy at that point I was
more you know struggling with like
server-side and different programming
philosophies and and things like that
and menu design structures and so and
I'm still kind of expanding on those
parts I think in my career now so I mean
that's really that's really the story I
mean the whole the whole bottom line is
that you need to have dedication and
that's probably the most important thing
because none of this stuff is going to
be easy programming is not easy the
smartest people in the world don't
simply just learn programming like it's
nothing I mean they don't just learn it
overnight
you're going to make the mistake of
thinking you know more than you really
do and I think that as you become a
better programmer at least in myself
I've seen that I don't know everything
in fact my confidence level now is
probably lower than my own I wouldn't
say it's like lower than - ever been but
I'm very very restrained as far as what
I feel like I'm capable of I feel like
I'm a good developer a lot of times I
look at other people around me oh my oh
yeah you know I I code for fun these
guys you know they don't code it all for
fun and and and I think that shows a lot
but I don't let it get to my head
because it's a constant everyday
struggle to be a programmer as far as
I'm trying to make sure you don't get
you get burned out and
and just recognizing that you don't know
everything and that there's always
something that you can learn from
somebody else and even if you don't see
that they have you know the more modern
skills you have I mean if they've been
in the programming game for a long time
I mean they they have a lot of
information about a lot of important
things like you know writing
requirements or making sure that you
know all all requirements are reviewed
you know thoroughly for mistakes or
giving accurate time frames and all that
stuff and I mean that is all part of
becoming a programmer as well but you're
really not going to get that kind of
expertise until you get into a
production gig and one another important
thing too is unit testing I mean unit
testing was like never on my plate when
I was getting started and now I mean
you'll get you'll get laughed at I mean
you've got a unit test your code I mean
it whether it's in JavaScript or even or
c-sharp or Python you should be unit
testing everything Django has this whole
unit testing built into their apps I
mean they create a test file for you but
I mean a lot of the Django people I was
talking to they I mean they never even
used them and I wasn't using them
neither so like it's really not a good
idea
but you got to take things one step at a
time and it's easy to get overwhelmed I
think so that's my story guys I mean I
started basically what is a website HTML
template draw up a template make that
template in the real code using CSS HTML
and JavaScript and jQuery or whatever
sort of library you want to use then it
comes time to doing a server-side
language it might be best to actually
learn the the language itself you know
doing what what I did like you know
building little scraper scripts and
things like that
these self-contained little programs
before moving on to like a giant MVC
application like Django or Ruby on Rails
or something because there's a lot of
magic going on underneath the scenes or
behind the curtains with a framework
like that so you're not going to know
any of it getting started and
and it can be maybe too daunting for
some people and maybe turn them off to
the entire idea so you got to keep
things small but once you're ready to go
into the framework then you need to also
learn the other stuff that goes along
with that okay how do I set up a cloud
host you know if I'm doing a Linux
server how do I set up my ports and my
firewalls and how do I set up my
database and and then I need to actually
set up a web server am I going to use
Apache or nginx and then maybe I use
both and yeah and just I mean so there's
there's a ton to a man but it just one
one thing at a time and eventually you'd
be surprised at how far you've come so
anyway guys I hope that gives some sort
of insight into what I did I mean that
whole process took me a year so I'm
still learning everyday and I'm just I'm
thankful to be in this gig though I mean
I like being a programmer it's fun and I
would recommend it and programmers get
paid pretty well all right guys thanks
