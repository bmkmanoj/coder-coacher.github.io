take a few minutes to kind of go over
why Python is a great language to learn
in 2015 and possibly one of the most
important languages so by the time
finish with this video I should be able
to explain a lot of why Python is is
growing so much in popularity over the
recent years and this is also coming
from somebody who makes a living as a
c-sharp developer so I happen to really
like Python it was one of my first
languages that I learned and I consider
myself to be pretty well-versed in
Python c-sharp and JavaScript so I have
a little bit of background in all of
those and I don't claim to be like a
super expert in any of them but I do
make a living as a c-sharp programmer
and Alice to Python at home and have and
really enjoy it I really like to give
back to the community and everything so
just to go off of the explanation of
what Python programming language is
widely use general-purpose high-level
programming language so if you guys
don't know but high-level as opposed to
low-level
low-level is something like C or C++
which is really just a lot of repetitive
code that can control things like
graphics cards and tweak like you know
the actual dimming of your computer
monitor thing you know little low-level
type of things like that you know real
hacker type stuff is written in C but
once again I'm you might take 20 20
lines of C to write a file or to open a
text file and read it line by line it
could take you 20 25 lines whereas a
high-level language like Python is just
simply C code written into a new way
which they call Python which is very
very dumbed down so that one line of
Python can open a file as opposed to 25
lines of C so you can write a lot more
code and a much easier to understand
language like Python now it says that it
has a de line a design philosophy that
emphasizes code readability and what it
means by that is that Python will make
you indent code so that it remains
readable if I took this and I move this
over here it's going to throw an error
message because Python doesn't like the
fact that things aren't lined up the way
that they're supposed to be any sane
developer doesn't want to see a bunch of
vote on one line that makes it almost
impossible to read so Python is very
readable a lot of the terms and words
and everything are very you know human
readable either you know mainly in the
English language which is what it was
originally a written name but it wasn't
written by an American so I should take
a moment to give a shout out to one of
the greatest programmers of all time
this guy named uh guido van rossum who
is a guy from the Netherlands who
actually came over the United States and
working for a bunch of different
companies and then starting Python when
he was bored one weekend really turned
into a huge huge thing and he worked for
Google for a time and now he's working a
Dropbox I'm assuming he's still there
but anyway the guy's a super smart
genius anyway so that's what it means by
code readability and design philosophy
now one of the things you might want to
take a look at as well is that Python
was just recently in the last year which
was named as the number one introductory
language and this wasn't just you know
chump schools that it was being
introduced at and it was actually some
of the top schools in the country like
Stanford and MIT and Carnegie Mellon and
all these other major universities so
python is now the number one language
that they're teaching it's also the
normal language for like bioinformatics
which is a popular among scientist so
there's a lot of code and the reason why
is because python is very easy to use
and very easy to read you can build in
very complicated algorithms and the
scientists still like it because it is
very readable
now it's also a popular language on the
web this little bit of code here is
actually what powers a website that I
have written in Python which is the
Python Django framework and that little
bit of code is what you see actually
powering this webpage through the the
Django framework there's other things
that are being used besides just Python
here it's not like Python does all of
this but python is you know the
server-side language that makes this
website run so so it's very very big
into the web in fact it's not just you
know my small site that nobody ever goes
to or clicks on the ads from
it's also sites like Instagram which I'm
sure you've heard of is a Python Django
and then there's Pinterest calm at one
point Pinterest calm was the
fastest-growing website and the history
of the web where they grew like 30
million users in a matter of like a few
weeks or something like that but this is
all Python Django as well even
reddit.com is written in Python and
reddit comm is is no joke Google makes
heavy use of Python and really was one
of the major reasons why Python has been
able to grow so much over the last few
years now Python is also popular among
children there's actually Python
programming books that are specifically
written for children because it's really
one of the easiest languages that they
can you know pick up pick up learning
but what's funny is that a lot of people
are like oh well python is a you know a
slow language and it's high-level and
nobody uses it but the fact of the
matter is is it's used everywhere from
you know robotics to NASA to web to data
crunching to system administration to
even database programming or even big
data which you hear a lot about Python
is one of the biggest languages using
big data using technologies like Hadoop
and other things so I mean it's
basically everywhere and the fact that
it's easy to use and easy for beginners
doesn't mean that it's an inferior
language in any way the amount of code
that you can write in Python and get it
done quickly you know whether you're a
scientist or a doctor or whatever is is
very attractive to a lot of new
programmers and you know a lot of times
they just you know they keep on with it
so it's not just a beginner level
language now here you can see the
Raspberry Pi which is a variant computer
chip that they're selling all over the
place to give kids a nice ability to be
able to install games and you learn how
a computer operating system works and
graphics cards and things like that but
that also has Python installed on it by
default now another reason why Python is
popular compared to a language that I
work with it at my work which is c-sharp
c-sharp was written by Microsoft and
really only works for the.net framework
which is a Microsoft only operating
is a set of libraries available to the
Microsoft operating system there are
certain exceptions but they're very rare
that you'll find that in an actual
production environment most of your web
servers for active websites the vast
majority are using Apache which is an
open source Linux Linux based on
technology which also works on Windows
but the bottom line is that Python works
on the Mac it works on so Mac iOS Linux
or Windows so it just runs
cross-platform
without having to worry about you know
hosting on a Windows server and things
like that it would runs on Windows just
as well as it runs on Linux c-sharp is
not the same way so that's one of the
downfalls - like something like C Center
C C sharp or Objective C which is Apple
based now as we continue working our way
down the list of why you want to learn
Python if we go to the TLB index which
is really the most highly rated way of
judging the most widely used languages
although there's there's definitely
criticisms that are raised for almost
any sort of language popularity
measurement tool out there it's almost
impossible to say and TLB also says they
don't say which one's the best but
basically they look at jobs and how
quickly something is advancing and you
know how many google searches and it'll
explain all that crap on their website
but it's considered a pretty highly
regarded list of where the popular
language is sit and um and Python just
keeps increasing right now it's actually
creeping up on Objective C and c-sharp
it's getting close to both of those so
you can see that it's actually moved up
into the number six spot now more in
that regard Python has a very active
open-source community so if you look at
something like github or which is where
most of the open-source projects are
hosted you can see python is the third
most popular language and that actually
says a lot considering the fact that
Java and JavaScript are used in a lot
more areas than Python I mean there's a
Java has been around and has been like
the corporate go-to
language for a long time so there are
tons of jobs and Java and it's been that
way for decades now so Python not having
as many jobs and things like that it's a
very impressive to see it on you know
third in this list of open source
projects meaning that it has a pretty
pretty hardcore community so another
thing you can look at is something like
Stack Overflow and if you look at
something like Stack Overflow and you
see the questions asked you can see that
it's got four hundred thirty-eight
thousand questions asked which is a lot
of questions so I mean that's that's a
lot compared to other languages and I
mean ranks pretty well up there with
with I mean there's gonna be more for
Java or C sharp but once again there's a
lot more jobs so one of the last things
I want to show which is very interesting
is that you when you see relative job
growth on indeed.com which is the number
one jobs website out there you can see
that above job of PHP and dotnet jobs
Python is just I mean it's just killing
it with its growth and it's because it's
actually growing in so many different
industries that it's seeing its
opportunities advanced and it's not just
in the web like I said it's a
bioinformatics and a few other niche
niche areas where Python is really
starting to see a lot of advancement so
guys that's really it I just wanted to
take a moment out since a lot of my
video viewers are Python fans like
myself and I just wanted to kind of give
a what I feel like is a big update on on
a language that really seems to be
tearing it up and still doesn't get
enough respect in the in the corporate
world as it should so anyway guys thanks
for watching please subscribe have a
good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
