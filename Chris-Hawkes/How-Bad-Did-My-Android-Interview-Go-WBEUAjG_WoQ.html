question on a video that I had just
recently where I was talking about that
Android programming job that I said
didn't go very well and this person was
asking me like they're like well I guess
they're thinking the situation is much
worse the way I'm playing it up and and
I guess you know forewarning is probably
not as bad I mean but for me it was my
personal though because that was I think
the third that I think it was the third
time I'd actually gone to a job
interview for programming and there
might have been I think it was countless
other you know like applications and
perusing job sites and stuff like that
just to see if anybody would give me
that opportunity but this I think it was
the third time I actually went for an
interview and the other two times it
wasn't that bad but in this particular
case um probably not as bad as I made it
out to be but I was given like roughly
like two weeks or something like that to
build an Android app and I was just a
beginner Java programmer I had been
doing Perl and Python before that had
probably played with PHP and a few other
things but I was given roughly two weeks
to do this Android app and I didn't know
the first thing of what I was doing so I
mean I was basically for the first time
messing with the Android SDK learning
the job ins and outs enough to be able
to build an actual application and I
mean I worked I worked hard so I was
working during my day job and then at
night I would come home and I completely
dropped everything else that I was
working on it's hot as a mother out here
by the way
it's like 90-something degrees out here
in Bryn Virginia really hot humid but
anyway I would come home at night and
I'd work late at night trying to
frantically get this done and leading up
to a couple days into the application I
had rewritten this Android app a couple
times in order to you know basically
build this app that I thought might be a
good idea because you could you had the
opportunity to build any sort of a pew
wanted and I had to keep it reasonable I
couldn't do like some sort of game like
Angry Birds or something like that that
wasn't going to happen
so the you know the app I felt like was
related to you know what the company
might need or what the customer for the
company
want in that was just you know so that
was part of the analysis I went into the
application but I had rewritten a couple
of times and so I finally settled on
this one prototype there's mosquitoes
ire - it's ridiculous so I agreed upon
this this prototype you know last second
you know within a few days or so but
there were a couple like late night
frantic okay I need to get this thing
working at least needs to work you know
granted there's some features and things
I could talk about and and all this
stuff and so there's a lot of work a lot
of and I think it was excited to because
I was like man I might get this job then
these people sounded interested you know
they wanted me to apply and all the
stuff I go all the way to DC from where
I live which is like an hour and you
know an hour trip or more you know I'm
all dressed up in a suit and everything
and I get in there and in front of a
panel of people and immediately it's
like oh you don't have a degree
oh you don't have you know this website
of that website oh you're not using
geolocation oh you're not doing this and
and you know long story short like there
was like they never looked at the app it
was never I had it on my phone I had it
pulled out on the table and everything
and it was just a question answering
session of all these different things
that I didn't have so I think a lot of
you guys were curious in where they were
they hitting me with logic that I just
didn't understand and and and that
wasn't it and honestly I feel like that
would suck too but you know I think I
could handle that that situation and I
handled this situation you know fine I
mean I thanked everybody for their time
but it was an embarrassment just you
know all the work that goes into that
and just to find out that they're not
even going to look at the app like there
was no intention on hiring you to begin
with they knew you didn't have a degree
you didn't have all this you know all
the requirements that they needed it was
a senior job a job a developer that they
were looking for and I certainly didn't
fit that bill so maybe that was my fault
but you know and just just not even
looking at the app that I had like
frantically spent sleepless nights you
know building to try to prove myself I
thought was a pretty big embarrassment
my boss at the time knew that I was
going up there for this this interview
and and obviously my wife and probably
my other close family members and they
all knew that that I was you know
working hard towards this thing and and
then just to not even be just not even
be given like even a remote shot not
even not even given the respect of just
hey let's take a look at what you built
you know so for me that that sucked real
bad and maybe you guys thought it was
worse than that but for me that I think
that at the time you know after being
turned down several times and not even
being responded to on many other job
opportunities and prospects and stuff
like that I just felt like it couldn't
have gotten too much worse than that at
that point and I remember I talked to a
few people and was considering just you
know giving it up and basically like
this isn't going to happen
but you know that answer is the question
I think I mean I'm probably skirting
around the issue I could I could
probably I could have drawn this out
into a longer video maybe but you know
that's essentially it man it was um it
was finding this job thinking that you
that these people were actually
interested and going through all the
process of you know working frantically
at your day job having kids having a
wife you know spending late nights
trying to build this app rewriting your
prototype several times trying to learn
you know a technology that's not exactly
easy like especially if you're just
jumping into it an Android SDK along
with the Java language I wasn't a very
good c-sharp programmer at the time so
if you guys know Java it's not that much
similar it's not very similar at all to
how you would design a Python app but um
I mean it was it was all that and then
it was um you know getting the app
working and feeling at least comfortable
that hey you know at least I I showed
that I have you know this this Drive
that I can figure things out and
everything because the app did work I
hadn't uninstalled on my phone and I was
ready to demonstrate it and everything
and then obviously you know getting all
dressed up and trying to get all nice
and everything driving all the way to DC
and you know just having to go through
the whole nerve-wracking thing and talk
to a panel and then nobody even nobody
even gives you a shot you walk out of
there like you know I completely wasted
my time
I mean in these people pretty much in
you know it told me that I wasted their
time so yeah man that sucks dude what
what are you gonna do I mean it could be
worse I mean you could be like starving
or dead or something right I mean but I
mean we all and those things make us
stronger though they do I'm a stronger
person because of that so I also I use
things like that as a chip on my
shoulder I mentioned this before but I
don't want people telling me that I
can't figure something out there that I
can't do something there's plenty of
pricks out there like that but yeah so
that's that guys that that was the story
man just so in a nutshell that that's
what happened all right man talk to you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
