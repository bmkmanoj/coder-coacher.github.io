quickly show you how to get a connection
string depending on whatever your
database environment is best thing to do
is go to your sequel server management
tool so I'm gonna go and pull this up
here so single server management studio
and then for men here I'm just going to
copy whatever database name you have so
you should have a server already set up
if you don't know how to do that I do
have a video on my my channel here that
explains how to quickly do that after
you install sequel server 2008 so maybe
there's a name of my my database or
server name
all right so once you do that I have an
example folder set up under my documents
directory and what we need to do is
create a new text document and we're
just going to call this example once you
create that go ahead and double click on
it to open it and then we're going to
save the file as example dot UDL and
then change this from text document to
all files go ahead and save it we can
close that now we can delete example dot
txt file and we have this example dot
UDL file go ahead and double click that
and then from here what we want to do is
I'm using depending on whatever type of
security you set up on your sequel
server I use just my regular Windows
security so I'm gonna change that there
and I'm gonna go ahead and just select
from the drop-down
the name of my my server instance which
is the name of my computer now on this
you should have the databases that you
have set up under your sequel server
instance I have a database one that I'm
connecting to and once we do that we can
go ahead and just say ok now you can
also test the connection and it tells
you that the connection is good it's a
good idea to go ahead and test the
connection alright now once we've tested
the connection it works now we can go
ahead and right click on the example and
go ahead and say open wit and you should
have the option you may have to choose
you can choose a default program but
anyway just go ahead and open it with
notepad and by opening it with notepad
you can actually see that this is the
connection string right here so this
entire thing is what you would need to
put into the visual studio web config so
that it would connect so in another
video I'll go ahead and explain how to
do that but anyway that is how you get
your exact connection string so it's
pretty sweet it's an easy way of doing
it instead of trying to figure out what
version of the sequel server you have
and going to connection strings com so
thank you please subscribe have a good
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
