learning WebGL for noobs tutorial in
this tutorial what we're going to do is
we're going to learn WebGL but I'll tell
you what the best place to actually
learn WebGL is at least on the WebGL the
low-level language that it is I used to
go to learning WebGL calm so we're not
going to touch on that because it is so
complex like I mean I suggest that
everybody before we start this tutorial
actually if you type learning web NGO do
it right here is the learning WebGL they
have lessons here which are great the
website from what I understand is not
going to be actively updated from this
point on because I know that the guy
that had originally started is moving
down to other Python things but if you
look here you can follow these lessons
as far as how to draw things on the
screen it is very complex just to
actually get this square on the screen
you're looking at I mean you're looking
at all this script code here it's just
it's a ton of stuff to simply write a
square and a triangle to the screen
honestly it baffles me on how you know
how difficult it is to do so just to get
an idea though on the low-level workings
of WebGL i would encourage that you do
go to that now the purpose that I have
in this tutorial is actually to be able
to move forward with the frameworks like
we know dealing with WebGL code is is
really a pain in the ass it's going to
take a long time and a lot of code just
to do the simplest of things so I'd like
to get to a good point where i can
actually utilize WebGL without having to
deal with a lot of the inner workings
and the mechanics behind it but having a
good idea of how those work is also very
important so I would I wish you the best
and trying to get to learn that but if
you still are shaking on it then don't
feel alone because I am as well but
we're going to move forward and we're
going to really work with the 3gs
framework which is still WebGL so the
tutorial is the WebGL for noobs even
though we're going to be using other
frameworks so I suppose I could call it
something else but I'd like to dabble
with a lot of the different frameworks
in WebGL and that's kind of my goal here
so just to show you an idea on what's
possible these guys are
whoo technologies go engine they
developed a WebGL engine their own
custom thing and they created this game
which just looks really amazing for a
game that runs in the browser an html5
enabled browser without actually having
any sort of plug-in so it's pretty
amazing you should check that out and
you know I'm actually rowing this guy at
this thing right now I'm controlling
them which is so it should it's just
amazing that this is running in the
browser now on this video as it's
recording it's probably going to look a
little choppy so that's just the video
if you have a graphics card that's
decent and go ahead and check that out
it should run really smoothly anyway so
it would be nice to be able to learn
okay well how do we get comfortable
enough with WebGL to be able to start
using guta college ease or look on 3gs
or one of these other frameworks that
are available out there so anyway please
subscribe and we'll go ahead and get
started with 3gs and the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
