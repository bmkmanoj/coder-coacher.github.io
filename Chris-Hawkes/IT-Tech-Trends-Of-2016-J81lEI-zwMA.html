like there's gonna be a lot of different
IT tech related trends that we're gonna
be looking at in 2016
some of them will be continuing from
where we left off in 2015 and mainly
some of the key points that I'm gonna
talk about in this video
pertain to just in the IT web related
world and where we're kind of headed
with everything so let's go ahead and
jump right in here
so the first thing we want to look at is
whether or not more IT jobs are going to
be pushed overseas so this speaks really
to the United States of the euro zone a
lot of companies like Facebook and
Google they they are either trying to
you know bring in overseas talent and
then some you know companies like Disney
had been in the news and earlier of 2015
because they ended up laying off like a
ton of IT workers and their Orlando
office and basically brought in a bunch
of overseas h-1b visas to take over the
job which you know typically even though
the laws and rules state that you're not
supposed to you know pay those workers
any less than an American worker
typically that's what you see they get
brought in and they get paid less and
they're happy to take it for less and
and the company ends up saving money and
American workers are out of business so
it's not just an America that we see
those trends but it looks like you know
that's not going to be something that's
going to be addressed anytime soon
the current Obama administration it's
kind of a key talking point between
Republicans and Democrats for the
upcoming presidential election on you
know how they plan on handling some of
the American IT workers that are either
being laid off or having their wages
suppressed which doesn't happen
everywhere but um you know there are
reports of wages being suppressed but
due to you know overseas workers being
brought in so we'll probably continue to
see more jobs like that being pushed a
lot of jobs for like testing and and
things like that companies already
pushing those jobs overseas so it's
always a concern on
Eric and I feel workers mine and will
continue to be in 2016 so responsive web
design is still going to be a popular
buzzword responsive is not going
anywhere here's an example this is a
template here and what you have is you
have this full screen technology that
ends up being morphed down to a much
smaller version so that the same exact
CSS and HTML code that makes this work
on a desktop and look very good also
looks very good and functional on a
mobile device so the key is that you
don't have to have an end user download
an Android app or an iPhone app or you
know a Windows app to be able to view
the website and in this way so that's
definitely going to be a trend that you
see a lot of websites still haven't
adapted to the responsive world yet but
you'll continue to see that in the 2016
and that's definitely going to be
something that's in demand so what we're
going to see in 2016 what we saw at the
midpoint of 2015 was that Google finally
announced that more people were using
the Google search engine on cellular
devices or mobile devices which includes
tablets and then compared to the desktop
app and that was the first time that
we've ever seen that it's been a
speculation for a long time now that the
way of the world and the way of the
Internet is going to be based on mobile
devices and handheld devices and you
know wow for IT workers it's still hard
to fathom that you know we're gonna be
using these friggin phones I mean we use
them but we don't program with them and
you know to date there's no cell phone
or tablet or anything that can compete
with a desktop PC when it comes to
actually coding but the the bottom line
is that most people aren't coders and
they're just using their phones to check
you know reddit where they're going to
you know buy their movie tickets from
Fandango through the mobile app or
either I mean there's the mobile website
so the bottom line is most people are
using their phones for the internet
nowadays it's probably about fifty five
forty five at the moment and it's going
to grow into 2016
so definitely need to cater your website
towards a mobile audience
so we're probably going to continue to
see the iPhone and Windows Phones losing
market share to Android iPhone
specifically because Windows never
really had any sort of stranglehold on
the market the iPhone you know obviously
revolutionized a smartphone and really
leaped Apple forward however Android has
a dominant market share and the and the
smartphone industry and will continue to
do so into 2016
there's just way more Android devices
out there than there are iPhones so
Apple can't possibly keep up with the
open source nature of the Android SDK
and operating system so 2016 and you
could argue that 2015 was as well maybe
even 2014 but you're going to continue
to hear more about big data so really
what we're what that pertains to is
we're looking at products like IBM's
Watson which is IBM iBM has been losing
money for something like 16 quarters in
a row or something like that they laid
off 50,000 employees they're struggling
to to try to adapt from there their
typical IT industry and in Watson is a
big bet for them they're using Watson
which is supposed to be artificial
intelligence which is basically an API
and they're working with all kinds of
different industries from medical to
restaurants and and food ingredient type
websites and things in order to be able
to use machine learning and Big Data to
be able to find better ways to handle
business processes and not just
necessarily businesses that IBM knows a
lot about they feel so confident in
Watson that they think Watson can you
know if a company feeds Watson the right
amount of data then Watson's going to be
able to find ways of streamlining and
making you know making their business
processes much more efficient so that is
IBM's big bet into 2016 so I'm sure that
we're going to see that a lot you know
bigger push there they've already spent
billions of dollars developing that and
there's been a lot of buzz around that
lately but you'll continue to see that
in the IT world going into 2016 so I
also have a fight here to rule the cloud
and what I mean
by that is you're gonna continue to see
Amazon and Microsoft Azure competing
head-to-head as far as their their
cloud-based systems so many websites
from fortune 100 to small mom-and-pop
shops are moving their entire technology
stack from server farms that they manage
over to actual cloud services managed by
Microsoft or Amazon or Google or the
like so right now Amazon is a major
player in that market they've never
really made money with it but apparently
they are in fact I think they were
profitable just recently for the first
time ever so I'm as successful as Amazon
is as a company they've never really
made money until recently so it looks
like all the posturing though with that
company that's really paid off so people
are moving over to the cloud there are
smaller providers that can compete with
Amazon to a lesser extent for the
developers out there like I always
recommend OneNote digitalocean is
another good reputable site you also see
like Rackspace and a lot of you know a
lot of a lot of cloud providers are
gonna continue to be out there because
companies find it much easier not have
to have to pay a bunch of neckbeard
admins to manage their server farms when
they can just have Microsoft and you
know the conveniences of being able to
just you know toggle throttles up and
down in order to be able to create
elasticity to respond to you know peak
demand hours and things like that
without having to have all that
maintenance themselves so there's a lot
of benefits to the cloud and there's a
lot of question marks I think still
personally as far as being able to
entrust your entire business over to a
cloud service provider we've already
seen Amazon I'm sorry not Amazon but
we've seen a sure in 2015
compete head-to-head with Amazon on
price points and then recently they've
increased their price something like 15%
or something like that in Australia and
Europe so you know that is the the
downside of being locked into another
company's technology is that they can
just up the price on you no matter what
you know what they might say that's
always something they're going to try to
do so you're going to continue to see a
lot of the big tech chure
I invest a lot of money and time into
the cloud trying to you know soak up
that business revenue native SDKs or
something else so we talked about how
big and important the the cellphone
devices are gonna be because now more
people are searching and using the app
the web on their their cell phone device
and ever before so what we've seen when
I talk about native SDK is we've seen
recently a project that I haven't had
time to actually jump into but I've been
extremely you know impressed with and
intrigued with is the react native
project react native instead of actually
writing native code on an Android or an
iOS device what you can do is you can
use the react framework to write code in
JavaScript so one language which works
on both iOS and Android now apparently
this this JavaScript API is very similar
to note if you've ever used that and the
node API is just JavaScript but it it
actually interfaces to machine code
that's written in C and C++ so similar
to react native you're gonna have this
JavaScript API but it's actually boiling
down to native iOS code and Android code
so basically the idea is that you can
just write it in one language and just
have it work now typically in the past
we've seen major performance hits with
using wrapper type services like this
but react native apparently is not a
wrapper around an actual device it's
it's code the write that compiles down
to native language so I haven't had too
much interaction with this yet I've used
react the regular react project for
dynamic UI's and I think that project is
great so as soon as I can jump into
react native I hope to be able to do
that in 2016 but I'm sure a lot of
people will be doing that as native SDKs
might be a little bit more of a headache
to have to maintain for multiple
platforms when you can just use one code
base and and go from there
now in that regard um we've also seen
Swift arise in 2015 Swift was
objective-c or Mike I'm sorry Apple's
replacement for their Objective C
language which is a terrible language in
a lot of regard a lot of ways and Swift
is supposed to be like their Python type
replacement for Objective C so you're
gonna continue to see Swift take away
from the Objective C market share and
eventually you'll see that rise in the
TLB index inside the top 10 most likely
surpassing I would say Python and in
2016 but at the same time it's not it
doesn't mean that you know Python is any
and any less demand it just means that
Objective C right now is being split
with Swift and eventually will retake
that position that it had before Swift
ever came along now Microsoft has never
really been able to gain a lot of
traction with their Microsoft phone and
their surface tablet and things like
that is making some headway but they
still don't have a large market share of
the mobile world and we're going to
continue to look and see whether or not
they're going to be able to do anything
about that into 2016 now one of the
things that a lot of people speculated
was that the XM Arum project which is a
similar to reacts react native you can
use C sharp which is Microsoft's
language of choice which has a lot of
very good tools that Microsoft's been
working on and maintaining for a long
time like Visual Studio which just has
second to none you know in debugging
tools and and things like that and XM
Aaron works well with with those you
know with that entire net set up so for
a.net developer c-sharp developer XM
aaron is the best way to build mobile
apps that work on ios and android
without having to learn Java or
Objective C or whatever it is that
you're trying to apply towards so the
question is going to be whether or not
XM Aaron is going to pick up pace or is
it going to end up losing some ground to
something like react
and similar projects that might end up
coming along the way or even you know a
responsive web design if that if that
starts to get a little bit better as far
as performance because typically with a
responsive website it's just not as
performant as a native app and there was
a brief moment in 2014 and 2015 about
whether or not c-sharp
I'm sorry Microsoft and c-sharp would be
buying XM Erin but unfortunately that
didn't happen so XM erin is going to
still continue to be operated as a
independent company and want to see
whether or not that gains more traction
and at 2016 MongoDB will compete with
the big boys what I mean by that is is
this going to be the year of of of no
sequel taking over the standard sequel
so for four decades now we've seen
relational databases be you know they go
to way of being able to store data and
and work with data and with MongoDB it's
kind of the first mainstream effort at
taking a no sequel schema which is
schema lists and making it you know an
actual mainstream thing so MongoDB just
recently has gotten another you know
it's a round of funding it's still a
privately held company it's not publicly
traded yet but in 2016 we may see it
gear up towards its IPO where you can
end up seeing it expand by a great deal
if it ends up getting a lot of stock
money then it should probably be able to
expand its its influence and market
share but we're already seeing a lot of
major fortune 500 companies starting to
use MongoDB I've actually used it on a
few websites
I love the the Jason type nature of
MongoDB I like how it's built to to just
expand out horizontally which makes it
so much easier to deal with in that
regard compared to something like my
sequel or any other sequel database out
there so it'll be a big deal a big big
big year for no sequel databases for
sure
bootstrap will continue to rule the CSS
world almost every site you're going
through nowadays you're seeing CSS just
it's all bootstrap basically so a lot of
developers don't even know CSS anymore
it seems like they just know the
bootstrap way of doing stuff so
bootstrap every site is kind of looking
the same with you know you have the
flexible nav at the top and typically a
small you know 150 pixels wide by 86
pixel and height logo and they always
look pristine and have the big old
headers and everything and they're
usually the nice carousel and all that
stuff but every one of the sites looks
the same it's because they're all using
bootstrap and everybody's going to
continue to do so the ones that don't
use bootstrap will start using it and
the ones that do use bootstrap will
continue to use it so that brings me to
the point that media sites are gonna
have to step up their game for a long
time it's been easy too well bootstrap
makes it easier to compete with main
sites so if I'm gonna do a movie site I
can compete pretty well with you know
Rotten Tomatoes maybe not on content but
as far as look and feel and things like
that you know I can I can build a pretty
decent looking movie website or
something like that or if it's music and
you're MTV so it's been easy for web
developers to just build a
beautiful-looking site that can compete
with some of the mainstream guys out
there that doesn't mean that the content
and go is good and that we're gonna get
a lot of traffic from doing it but
bootstrap makes that entire process easy
but what we need is we need sites to
step up their game as far as how they're
being presented to make it a little bit
more challenging for a web developer
basically just create a better user
experience then then what a typical you
know single bootstrap developer could do
now one such example of what I'm talking
about here is here's a New York Times
article from just a couple of days ago
about our the Marshall Islands
disappearing and when I load this page
up I mean I have this full screen with
you have this animated gif that you can
see the waves coming up on on the island
and I mean this is just absolutely
amazing UX I mean this is a
experience here look at I mean this this
video didn't even take a look it just
does it automatically it's using the
best of what html5 has to offer and
they're just and it's just truly a
mesmerizing user experience and that's
not something that's easy to do and only
a renowned newspaper like the New York
Times will be able to pull something
like this off at least easily so you
know they have the resources of
providing a better user experience and
and maybe you know maybe some developers
and and you know smaller you know
mom-and-pop shops can try to build
something similar and but it's going to
be tough to compete if they're doing
something like this on a consistent
basis because where is a mom and pop
shop gonna be able to get footage like
this only New York Times has you know
the ability for the most part to be able
to get some of that great footage so
you're gonna continue to see just you
know amazing UX on that front you're
gonna also see sites try to do something
different here's Bloomberg they did a
major redesign earlier this year and
they went to this you know almost
old-school large ugly blue HTML font to
try to make things stand out they use
this you know cute animated gif for a
404 page not found and we've never
really seen UX like this before in the
web world I mean it's not it's not like
we're going to taking a step backwards
and using marquee blinking lights around
our divs like we did back in the 90s but
this is something that is just trying to
make you know companies need to stand
out especially if they're in the
business for media and content you have
to be able to stand out and that's one
of the things that venture capitalists
have said that for 2015 and beyond one
of the things that they stay away from
is content related sites so if you're
like hey I got this great you know music
website idea blah blah blah you know
users are gonna be able to contribute
and but you know the bottom line is a
lot of venture capitalists that know
what they're talking about they're like
yeah I'm not gonna get involved in that
game because content is you know what
they said was content was King but
content doesn't get you anywhere so the
good content is gonna have to come from
these major sites that are paying some
of the best journalists I try to write
personally and I've blogged and things
like that and it's just you're not going
to get the same level of professionalism
that you would get from an actual
experience Journal
that that writes from one of these major
publications so if they can continue to
write good content mix that with you
know great media like I just showed you
there's no way you know some of these
smaller content related sites are gonna
be able to offer the same type of user
experience so we'll see where that goes
in 2016 I'm really curious about that
now another thing on this note is that
ad blockers are crushing revenue right
now I've felt it anybody that's owned a
web site that relies on media and ads
has felt that web blocker or ad blockers
are all over the place we're going to
continue to see that in 2016 you're
going to continue to see revenue decline
in the in the web content world so it's
another reason why venture capitalists
have said stay away from content related
sites now this is another little thing
that I want to mention phone awesome
you're seeing this everywhere just like
with bootstrap if you haven't used that
you should use it it's very simple but
every it's all about using icons so
there's all these different icons they
update them all the time and it's just
it just makes your site look really good
so definitely check out font awesome if
you've never seen it everybody's using
it just like bootstrap alright guys that
really wraps up my video here so these
are just some of the UI and IT related
tech trends that I foresee in the 2016
I'll probably do another video because I
have a whole other list that I didn't
even get to but I can't make this video
too much longer than when I have it
right now so I'm gonna go ahead and cut
this off let me know what you guys think
if you guys disagree or if I miss
anything just you know feel free to
leave a comment I always try to respond
to everybody and I thank you for
everybody to everybody who's who's
watched this video you didn't have to do
it and I appreciate that you did so have
a good day guys please subscribe and
take care of mine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
