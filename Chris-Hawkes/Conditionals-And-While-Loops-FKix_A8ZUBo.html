next video of this beginning JavaScript
tutorial series for hipster code comm
and in this video we want to look at
logical and more into logical operators
or basically expression operators now
they can consist of conditionals which
means if this equals this do that or
they can condition it can consist of
loops so you know for X amount of times
do this or do that and there's a lot of
times in programming where you do need
to say for a hundred times do this and
then stop doing that because if you
didn't tell it to stop doing that you
end up running into a situation where
the computer's gonna run out of memory
or will run until the end of time which
of course you can just kill the power or
close off your browser but I hope you
know you get the point that computer
programs do what you tell them to do and
they only do what you tell them to do
they're not going to figure out on their
own how to do stuff as much as you know
we'd like to think that Google and IBM
with Watson and all the stuff is like
inventing computers that can just figure
out what you want it's not the case
everything is all just input in and put
out so it does what you tell it to do
and that's why these conditionals are
important so let's look at a conditional
first before we look at the loop so we
could say variable x equals Chris and
this is a string so we looked at that
before so if I said if x equals and
remember we have to use two equal signs
because we're equated as X equal this
not pay X equals this because I want to
assign the value we're going to say does
X equal
Chris then we use the curly brace you
know what this is not going to work
inside the console very well I'm just
gonna go back to the atom editor alright
so let's go back into this editor here
to make it a little bit easier for us to
run our code and now we're gonna say so
variable x equals crisp
in fact we'll just give it a better name
so variable name equals Chris and now
this comparison operator will say if
name equals he his double quotes we can
say Chris and now we're gonna be using
these curly braces now these curly
braces denote a block of code so in
JavaScript you're gonna have block
statements and a lot of programming
languages actually have it like this but
this basically means all this this logic
is contained inside this one particular
piece of block and this just helps to
note what is one block from another
block so it helps us structure our code
into a more readable fashion some would
argue that you don't need it the Python
language doesn't have curly braces and
it seems to get along just fine but it
goes back to the C language and possibly
even beyond that but it's just the way
that we've done things and we've gotten
too accustomed to it so we can logically
in our minds group that this code is all
related to itself so if name equals
Chris and we'll say we'll just do a
large statement or their name equals
Chris else then we do another opening
closed curly brace alert your mom is
nice alright so this is a fork in the
road and our programming language is a
logical operator do this or do that
so if name equals Chris which it does
then it's gonna alert this statement if
it didn't it would alert this statement
so if we ran our code in the browser you
can say the name equals Chris so you can
see it works the way that we wanted but
now if will say if variable another name
equals and you then I could say does
this equal another name so it doesn't
have to be referencing a string here
that we're equate and we could actually
pass in a variable so we have two
variables Network waiting does that one
variable equal that other variable so
the logical operator is not met so the
infra conditions not met so the else
condition is fired and it says your mom
is nice
so the fork in the road took us one way
or the other
alright the next statement we want to
look at is a for loop and a for loop is
something that we will deal with a lot
in programming but let's go ahead and
say variable x equals 0 and now we're
gonna do a for loop so we'll say 4 and
then here is a weird syntax where we
could say X you know we could actually
we don't have to give X to value there
we could just simply say for VAR x
equals 0 and then we'll say X is less
than 10 and then we say X plus plus so
we're actually using the incremental
operator that we looked at in the second
video of this series and what we're
we're giving the value of x 0 and then
we're saying if it's less than 10 go
ahead and increment 1 but it's going to
fire the code in this block each time so
we'll say alert I fire this has to be a
string I fired you know it just will do
that there's a simple statement so now
this is going to alert 10 times 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 and then it stops so the
for loop stops because we said hey this
is a starting point this is the end
point we use the incremental operator
and we see why that's beneficial this is
a very kind of ugly way of for looping
through something but it goes all the
way back to the days of C and it's it's
the same way in a lot of different
languages and namely I can think of
c-sharp does for loops in this way as
well it's very memory efficient so if
you're trying to do a fast program it's
going to be much easier to loop through
something like this using a for loop
it's
it's just very easy to do is very fast
so now let's look at a while loop in a
while loop is very similar to the for
loop but let's go and we're going to
create a variable X and we'll say it
equals zero
and we'll say while X is less than ten
then we can actually do our alerts table
so let's say alert your mom and then now
in order to not get into an endless loop
we do need to add one to the X each time
so that way X won't continue because
otherwise this would continue to run
over and over and over again until the
end of time so we don't want that to
happen so it's very important that we
take the value of X and that we
increment it so once X is equal to ten
then it will actually jump out of the
block here and this block statement it
would continue to execute in well
couldn't even see here if we said alert
we're moving on with our life now so
you'll see this code is never fired
until this loop is finished and this
code would never be hit if your endless
loop continue to run your mom your mom
your mom your mom your mom your mom and
now we're moving on with our life now so
that's a while loop so while loops are
very similar but four loops are going to
be used a little bit more often just
because you're typically trying to you
know how many elements you're sorting
through and we'll get into some
different reasons why you would want to
use the for over the while as we get
further along in this tutorial series
but for right now this is just a simple
explanation of the for in while loop
okay so that's where we're going to
leave it here on these just basic
conditionals and for loops and while
loop so you're gonna see that more and
more and we'll try to discuss more and
more but I don't want to get too far
into that just because I feel like it
might deter some of the newcomers
to the language so let's keep things
just kind of moving along in the next
video I want to look at arrays and some
of the reasons why we would use an array
because an array is very important in
JavaScript you're gonna see it all the
time and we'll get into that in the next
video so thanks for watching guys please
