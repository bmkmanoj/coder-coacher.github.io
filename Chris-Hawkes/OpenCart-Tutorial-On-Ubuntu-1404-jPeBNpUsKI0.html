going to be doing a opencart demo here
which is an e-commerce platform that's
built for the PHP language it's actually
one of the better storefronts and it's
completely free so when you compare it
to something like Volusion or Shopify
open car is on is absolutely free so if
you have some basic PHP knowledge you
should be able to work your way around
relatively easy i would say now once you
want to start you know building themes
and things like that forward all that is
but you know very possible just like
with wordpress sorry I bumped into the
mic there but just like with WordPress
you can develop additional themes for
opencart and then sell them to other
opencart users so open cards actually
used by quite a bit of name-brand
products and things like that so I saw
even like Volvo's using the you know the
the platform here so to get started what
we need to do is go to the free download
and you're just going to click free
download from the open cart website it's
going to give you an ape dup folder so
we need to open it up that means that
you need to have some sort of unzip your
program a lot of people use like wynne
AR AR or i'm using 7zip which is
completely free and the next thing you
need is you need an actual server so I'm
going to post the link that to the
server values which is linode and if you
actually do decide to get an account
with them please use the link in the
description because then I get a free
month of hosting assuming you stay with
them for more than three months and and
it's very cheap to actually use the note
i recommend the twenty-dollar account
i've actually been able to use or put it
and run a lot of websites including my
Majengo a website hipster code calm is
running on is a python django website
and it's actually running on the twenty
dollar monthly note account I didn't get
several thousand people a month and it
does some decent stuff it's got some
tutorial systems and handles
authentication and stuff like that so
anyway just to let you know it is a very
reputable virtual private host so it's
much better than a shared host and once
again just make sure you guys use the
link in the description below so I can
get a free month out of it alright so
that said what we need then is we need
filezilla so files oh let's go ahead and
Google that
it's a ftp which is not
filezillafilezilla and it's an ftp tool
which basically allows you to connect to
your server so once you have the node
set up the note is a completely separate
situation but you don't have to use the
node the point is you have to have some
sort of a server so if it's going to be
a web host or it's going to be leno door
it's going to be something else you need
to be able to upload these documents to
your server and that's what we use
FileZilla for so I already have it
installed so I'm going to go ahead and
run files that long if i type this i can
pull it up on my Windows machine
alright so this is this is it on the
left hand side this is your actual files
and everything you have on your computer
so everything that I'm going to put in
here is going to go inside of a folder
that's going to be called Amanda all
right so this is just a blank folder
here so when I go to my web apps i like
to put all my web apps inside of here so
here's Amanda I'm actually going to be
getting rid of all this stuff so i'll
probably end up deleting that in fact i
should do that now so in order to
actually sign in to your server if
you're actually using something like
linux from your computer your windows
machine i have to assign into my my
windows are I'm sorry my lid linode a
bunch of server which is linux base from
windows using this a putty tool so let
me go ahead and log in here
alright so here it is I'm inside the
directory that you could actually see so
this is on the server so I'm seeing it
all the files in real time on my server
I'm going to go ahead and back up out of
here and i think i'm gonna say we remove
our mrf amanda and then if I look here I
can see that amanda is gone so good and
make der Amanda and its back I look
inside here there's nothing inside the
amount of the folder so now we need to
go ahead and upload all these documents
so let's go ahead and extract it first
so we're going to say extract and then
just in my downloads I'll go ahead and
I'm going to create a new folder so I'll
go here I'll just click this button here
and then in my downloads i'll create a
new folder so new folder and we'll just
call this amanda and i select that and
press ok press ok and it's going to
extract all those documents into that
amanda folder inside of my downloads
folder
alright so now that I've done that I'm
going to go ahead and find my downloads
folder over here so I'm going to go to
downloads there's the Amanda folder and
here's the Amanda I need to refresh this
because that's empty so now it's so you
can see that's empty so I'm going to
take all these folders and files and
everything i'm just going to say upload
and I do that by right clicking and
saying upload so this is actually
transferring all these files up to the
server it's going to take a little bit
of time because there's quite a bit
files that have to be transferred up you
can see over 3,600 files are being
transferred up so this is going to take
a few minutes I'm going to be pausing
the video while this is going on now
open car needs to have a database so you
need to have my sequel installed on your
a bunt a server so that's beyond the
scope of this tutorial series but go
ahead and um you should have no problem
being able to look up and find out how
to install my sleep will actually don't
have that available with me right now
but I already have my sequel installed
so I need to go ahead and log in I'm
going to say sudo my sequel user root
and then p
ok
yeah that didn't work
alright so now I'm inside my my sequel
databases i put in the password
correctly and i'm going to say create
database Amanda I should have done a
semicolon so now if I say show what is
it sir show db9 yes I get these soap or
so confused because honestly I'm dealing
with postgres my sequel and mongodb and
I haven't used my sequel and actually
years now it seems like so it doesn't
matter the database was created it
exists its name is Amanda and we're
going to need that when we get need to
pee of the open court thing working
alright so now this is going to be more
of an overview just to kind of give you
guys a demonstration on you know things
that I had to do in order for this to
actually work I will go ahead and forge
you guys a copy of my virtual private
host now here's the thing engine X right
now is one of my servers that I have
available on hipster coat I have engine
X is it's serving static content meaning
that all the HTML CSS and the images are
being handled by the server engine X so
I have one engine x server installed in
my ubuntu server with witla node and
then what i needed to do is I needed to
actually install a bunch of PHP stuff in
order for PHP to be installed on my
machine so I had to run sudo apt-get
install engine X PHP well engine X i
didn't really need to do is some of a
bitch i didn't mean that but anyway PHP
PHP 5 fpm php5 CLI which stands for
command line interface php5 hyphen m
crypts php5 and GD php5 my sequel Andy
and php5 curls so those are all the
things I needed in order to get PHP
installed on my machine now once I did
that I needed to create a virtual what's
called a virtual host inside my engine X
sites available directory so I created a
file called Amanda hawks com I know
there's a little bit hard to read but
that says Amanda ha
let me see if I can make this bigger
alright so i made a file in here called
Amanda Hawks calm and it needs to be the
name of the file that you actually have
and you can see here this is where some
of these these sites that I've had and
some of these sites are still running
get caught has helped drug abuse is
still there hipster code that's that so
you can see those are all different
websites that i have so when i had i
went ahead and i created amanda Hawks
calm by saying sudo nano and said Amanda
Hawks calm and it goes it creates the
file but then I had to put all this
stuff in here and all this stuff in here
tells it to listen on port 80 which is
by default what engine X is listening to
and then server name you're actually
giving the name of the domain that you
own and then down here you're given the
name of the domain that you own without
the www that way it will redirect to the
ww version should you not your surgery
leave off the ww now here are listening
on server 80 there's some more
information down here this is where
we're actually setting the access log
for Amanda so it'll actually write those
logs there and then there's an error log
so if you have a problem it's going to
write to their so number one if things
if you go and you look at your site and
you get a server error the first thing
you need to do is look at the error log
I mean in the airlock engine X is always
going to write to some sort of error log
and it will tell you exactly what the
problem was now one of the things you
will want to note is down here this this
part where it says VAR run PHP 5 fpm dot
sock that is actually going to be
installed once you run all those
installation commands and you can
actually see it right there right here
php5 fpm sock so make sure once again
you update all this information inside
of here should be everything
lame now one thing to note as well is
that you can see this is the file
location that we actually uploaded that
folder to so the upload folder went here
and you can leave off the trailing /but
you're saying this is where the root
directory is because by setting this
route properly all these other things
we're going to are going to look at the
root so when it talks about you know the
open cart down here or you know the
sitemap XML and all the other stuff it's
going to be basing that on the route
okay so nice
yeah that should be about it
and it's all press ctrl x to get out of
that now another thing you need to do is
when you set up the sites available file
and you copy that in there you need to
actually make and you guys are going to
forget this I'm telling you're going to
forget it and you're going to be screwed
but you need to do a what's called a
static link and this is what I'm going
right here I said pseudo which is my
pseudo user l and and i said hi finesse
and this is like for a symbolic link so
what it does is actually takes the first
argument which is this file right here
in the sites available folder which is
the same it's the location to the file i
just showed you guys and then there's a
space and the second argument is where
you're actually going to put a symbolic
link so basically the file exists in in
one spot that way you only have to edit
it in one spot because it needs to be in
both folders so doing it this way is
much better than having to create the
file in both spots but i suppose if you
wanted to go the hard way and just
create the file in both spots you could
do the same thing it was just be the
same file and it's two files that have
to manage and change every time you have
to change your virtual private host once
you do that you then need to restart
your server so you're going to say
you're going to say sudo anyway it's
sudo service engine x3 scarf and that
will restart engine X alright so that
was a lot of information but now by
going to the domain that you own and
going to Amanda ha calm it's going to
give you the install you know this
license agreement stuff all this stuff
is like this is where you know opencart
makes its money really this is like this
is a very easy setup I think from here
we're going to go ahead and accept the
license agreements and things like that
is an open source project it detects
like the PHP version and everything so
looks like it we need to have some
correct permissions on the files below
so let's go ahead and actually let's go
ahead and fix that right now so what we
need to do is we need to go to that file
location so I'm going to go to Amanda
here i'm going to say upload and you can
see the first config distribution dot
PHP alright so what we need to do is we
need to rename these two files here and
and by doing so you can see that we had
config dist in our actual server and
this says it's looking for config.php so
it's good and rename that file here
because look it says config dish so I'm
going to make this a little bit bigger
once again I have a bunch of different
different sessions here open
alright so now we're going to go into
the config disco so we'll change the
nameless a pseudo CP so we're saying
copy config this top PHP I can spell it
right config dis PHP and then we give it
the second argument which isn't there
going to be called a config PHP put in
my sudo password and you can see it's
now there is a config PHP there so the
config dist is still there that's fine
we need to CD into the admin folder I
did that wrong CD ad men and now you can
see there's a config dist in here so
we're gonna be the same we're going to
run the same command Express up and
we're saying copy config test.php to
config PHP so now that we've done that
once again we have to that way we keep
the other one intact but now if we
refresh this you should see it says it
son writable so now we need to actually
give it permission so let's go ahead and
assign a group permission so we need to
say sudo shown which is changing the
group i believe the data we're giving it
the ww data group which is the standard
server group and we're going to say give
it readable permissions did I not
hold on a second
so make sure you're in the the upload
directly directory when you run this
command actually had a typo there but on
this should be the command sudo chow ww
data that we go to data and then you're
giving it permission to all those files
alright so now you can see that is
readable and writable so that now
resolves the server conditions so we can
put it and press Continue and now this
is where we actually need to log in to
our database so I'm not going to be able
to share this information but there's
going to be the login information in
order to get access to your my sequel
database now obviously the database name
was amanda because earlier in the
tutorial we saw how i logged into my my
sequel command line and i created the
database amanda so all i need to do is
say amanda here by default my sequel
listens on port 3306 and then obviously
your username needs to be whatever sort
of username you have
alright so once you fill in the
necessary information now it's telling
you that you need to delete your
installation directory so let's go back
over to our our setup here and we're
going to say where say sudo RM RF
install okay now if we refresh this you
can see that step four is now gone there
is no install anymore so we go to Amanda
Hawks calm and we have our storefront
alright guys so that is uh that is a
relatively difficult task I'm sure
you're going to run into some problems
if this thing helps you know make sure
you guys check out my patreon or my
paypal stuff and that also will help you
if if you need help getting this setup
and you expect to have some you know no
offense or anything but I'm kind of a
busy guy so if you guys run into a lot
of problems you know consider that and I
will definitely consider helping you
guys out and you know getting you set up
and everything but um this is everything
that I did in order to get set up now so
the following tutorials I'm going to get
into another tutorial that is brought to
you by template monster geez i can t
remember i'm sorry so in the template
monster they're not even paying me for
this video but they are going to be
working with me on a new theme that
they're trying to promote for opencart
so I'm going to be making some videos on
how to upgrade your themes using some of
these other out of basically paid for
options and it does a lot for your
storefront making it I would say more
attractive more unique instead of
looking like everybody else's so thanks
for watching this tutorial guys make
sure you subscribe up vote and share
thank you right hey guys so I've talked
about this a lot Deb mountain coding
boot camp they are my sponsor they're
one of the reasons why I'm able to do
these videos and they offer a 12 week
intensive course that teaches you the
technologies of the here and now they're
going to focus on a lot of things that
are actually being used and websites
things like jQuery
and they're going to be using stacks
like nodejs the 12-week intents of
course is to try to get people in the
job market so that is their entire focus
we've all we've talked a lot about on
this channel whether or not a college
degree is worth it I'm not the one to be
able to answer that question for you I
absolutely think that college degrees
are great especially in computer science
I never want to convince somebody to say
that they shouldn't do that obviously
schools like Stanford and MIT I'm you
know I I'm an envy of all those
graduates however there is you know the
bulk of developers that don't
necessarily need to be the MIT graduates
to actually have success in the
programming world I think I speak
relatively well for for that type of
person and with coding boot camps we're
seeing them you know try to offer more
Skills more modern-day skills because a
lot of times when you're going to a
computer science course and a major
university you're learning technology
that's already outdated by the time
you're learning it with Deb mountain and
coding boot camps like what dev Mountain
offers they're focusing on really what
is hot right now so and they also focus
on a relatively you know small set of
skills in order to make sure that that
they are teaching you what you need to
know in order to be productive in a in a
workplace environment so make sure you
guys do me a favor do yourself a favor
check out the link and that in the
description tab below for more on Deb
mountain coding boot camp thanks guys
