the computer guy style this morning and
so I just real job I look tired there
fly but I'm curious I'm wondering where
the trends and youth in your opinion
because I'm reach out to you guys I feel
like I've been so caught up in you know
specifically what I've been doing over
the last leg probably a year or so that
I haven't I don't think I've cared as
much about some of the upcoming trends
or yeah just I just I haven't really
cared because I've been so busy with you
know what I feel is really the here and
now and to me everything revolves around
you JavaScript like every bit of it so I
know how to do C sharp and try it on
I've done you know minor amounts of like
PHP and Java and things like that fish
there's a trend in my mind is that you
need to be an expert JavaScript guy for
a lot of roles now there are still like
obviously a ton of java developer
positions and see short positions but
for them for the most part was like I
just don't seem to be overly involved
with those of in my opinion it seems
like everything is transitioning over to
the simplest run impossible like you
know some sort of a node node server
that is looking to just century an API
and maybe even that API will end up
calling more sophisticated API is
written and maybe a maybe Python or too
sharp or something that has a
synchronous rub a synchronous support
you know C sharp five point oh so you
know it seems like there's still dad's a
man but for whatever reason for for me
it feels like it's all we're going to
advise other people it all seems to
revolve around job description and
everybody's doing web based applications
who is not writing something that runs
in the web even gaming and things is now
working in the web and with a new web
assembly maybe they're going to start
having a virtual reality in the West but
ultimately go to the Internet in the
weather's how really this browser i
should say is how we're all able to
connect with each other what has made
this in technology revolution possible
is the fact that you could have
data on one person's computer and then
be able to share that across the world
says you know in a nutshell that's all
the internet is and but is you know that
capability of something for a new was it
came around in the mainstream in the 80s
and 90s so you know we're still in his
infancy thing and we've been limited by
the browser's overall ability to be able
to do some of the complex things that we
want to do in a futuristic type world
but those deficiencies are quickly
becoming mute basically so with
JavaScript and specifically es dick
seems like that should be what
everybody's focused on if if they're
working in the web there's not a whole
lot of opportunity there to use d sharp
to expand what's possible in the browser
or your job already none of those things
are going to going to work that way so
and less like something new comes along
you look at like chromium it's written
in C and C++ so you know it's for those
languages to actually build the browsers
that are running these JavaScript engine
I suppose there there's a market there
to you know to obviously make the
browser's much more capable so I
probably should have made sure they had
enough space on my friggin phones if
you're just recording anyway so unless
you're actually extending the browser
functionality to like tree and C++ I
don't really see how these other
languages are going to have like a
humongous part of web development now
obviously data manipulation and api's
and even your database layers of you
know those are all going to still be
there but when I look on indeed com
which I see a bunch of bullshit really
uh like there's so many jobs that are
being listed by recruiters that are just
trying to get as many people inside of
their database as possible so that when
a position opens up they're like oh yeah
I go play Jenga I got a c-sharp a bitch
I get the feeling and I don't know this
for sure but I get the feeling that a
lot of these fuggin companies don't have
any positions and they're just literally
trying to round up people because like I
see so many of the listings on indeed
that like or like yeah we need Python
javis rubian like no no you no you don't
you don't have a shot that is running
all those different languages and if
they did they're just probably the
Complete Streets rotatably disarray I
guess from so I can't prove it but I
feel like you know it's bullshit so one
of the things that you have to look at I
think that gives you a good idea on
where the market is at is um it's like
github obviously so like github has
trends where it will show that the
languages like Python and Java and we're
not jealous but Python and in JavaScript
are really you know they're really
popular things on github nuts the
interesting thing about that is that
those are also you know to relative
beginner languages that have a lot of us
you know I guess the younger support so
you're not going to find as many 925 C
sharp guys that are already making 100
hundred twenty thousand dollars a year
and that you know basically do what they
need to do day in and day out and go
home and overly you know chosen on the
side I mean there's a lot of developers
like that and and those particular
developers I mean they are the ones for
the most part to go home and start you
know creating some github project or
something like that it's usually the
younger again abramov of the world that
end up saying hey I want to have hot
reloading with this fluffy architecture
so I'm pretty much gonna copy a lot of
what's luck starts well and makes it a
little bit better and then any is
definitely smart dudes butt of every
touch does it better than flux I mean
there's no question like fluff is a
convoluted way of going about your state
management compared though you know
something like read us was much more
simplistic but you know he would be
young guy that had a motivation to do
that and i don't know like so you don't
find that as much with the sea shore of
925 type
so we're aware that the industry has a
man I feel like like right now for the
next leg year or two for me it's all
going to be about lately especially
about about a modular JavaScript
application to mungus JavaScript
applications that are branched out we're
not going to need you know Gulf as much
anymore we're probably going to use web
pack for a lot of different things you
know for minifying Oakland flying
obviously module loading you can even
have it running extra dev server you're
gonna end up using totally npm scripts
up there for a long time and I wasn't
probably the first one or anything but
I've always liked it an advocate for
this you know the local node modules
folders that you reference to NPM trip
so that you don't have you know global
dependencies or anything like that which
is the same thing that obviously plays
on virtual environment neyo solves a
long time ago or whatever but you know
the fact of the matter is that you can
do a lot of you know really you can do a
lot of you can make your life so much
simpler with with with no Jas running an
NPM and its command creating your
package.json with all your dependencies
your desert entities and your regular
dependencies for the application and
then just using the scripts portion to
be able to automate everything from you
know running your chest to other flying
minifying all that stuff so you don't
need to have goals and browser fire
anymore so those tools are becoming
easier but I feel like there's still an
opportunity for people to come along and
build like you see things like yo man yo
man comes along and tries to spin up the
applications that have all this
boilerplate and most of the applications
these days have a ton of boilerplate
especially in JavaScript but even Django
and all that has quite a bit boilerplate
and yeoman tries to come along in and
fill that void where it just kind of
spends up a new project a problem with
yeoman I think is that it's like to all
over the place like if you go to look at
a django yeoman project there's gonna be
like five or six of them i remember i
ran at least one or two
they didn't work at least you're at
least one of them didn't work and I was
like man I'm like I've always been an
advocate like you understand what's
going on in your application so when you
use something like Gilman and all this
boiler place being on up and you don't
really understand it so no but in at the
same point at the same time though if
you look at something like Django like
you don't need to understand all of the
inner workings you don't totally
understand how the Django object
relational mapping you know in same
thing with microsoft asp.net I mean most
people don't know half of what dotnet is
doing or hell even serving five percent
of without net filling and then you know
with asp.net they're used like all this
black box magic for routing and
middleware and all that stuff and you
know the fact that matter is that we
don't have time to be experts in all of
that stuff it's all about assembling
components have said that is low we're
like we're moving into this day and age
where it's like how quickly can you set
up a you know relatively complex ton of
boilerplate react and redox es6
expressed reyes application that has you
know a one single command that will run
your server minify your code or like
over fire so should you be deploying go
production environment or you know
getting test setup so like how do you
get test up with react which requires a
Dom you have to use jf Dom which is a
virtual Dom in order to be able to do
that so clearly you know somebody who
created gsm you know they they are i'm
sure was a lot of developers on that so
you know that that's that and that was
filling a need that came along the way
but we don't need to write that from
scratch to be able to solve that best
testing problem airbnb actually solved a
big part of that you know so now they
created this project called enzyme so as
you're testing a react code you're going
to use enzyme and if you were trying to
write enzyme from stretched and i said
before you probably not gonna do a
better job than it's been a team full of
developers at Airbnb that we're trying
to solve the same problem as you
but like I feel like you know if you can
make it a little bit better or maybe you
know cause be off a lot of the
architecture make it better and it's
trying to like it's really all we're
doing these days it seems like but who
has the time to mostly do that it's the
younger developers so I think that
that's why you see a lot of you know
these younger developers that are on
github that have some of these more
popular projects which the other one
being you know typically sponsored by
companies it seems like at least in my
opinion now you do have occasionally
like an older developer like the guy
that created beautiful soup for Python
he was like an older guy that likes
would constantly in a rant on blog post
like if you see a bug just fix the guy
dancing because I don't have time and
for him like she broke into our project
and not enough people were contributing
it's like Liz dude like I mean he wasn't
getting paid to use it i'm sure some
people donated things but you know
donations don't come anywhere near that
the amount of time and effort that comes
and it's involved in some of these
projects so but anyway so he's somebody
that comes to mind is like being older
person that came home and you know
created a project ended up being like de
facto project for for HTML parsing and
try it on nowadays it's too slow and and
everything you know should be done
through HTTP and yeah using something
like Python request or something so
that's really yeah like so I'm basically
asking you guys like where do you think
the trends we're going I haven't seen
any sort of projects that have come
along lately that like have me all
excited or anything if you Jay yes I
know people were talking about that of
UJS doesn't do anything more than what
react is capable of doing yes it's a
little bit easier to deal with and we
actually you're not going to build a
complex architecture out of view
components in my opinion and not not
better than celeriac at least in my
opinion I think reactors going to end up
displacing angular's position it's
happening slowly because a lot of
companies developed a lot of stuff in
angular 1 and they got
earned on this little angular 2 thing I
don't see why script taking off i really
don't i think that most companies are
going to be like you know let's just use
es6 with Babel because then we're
writing something that's closer to the
standard so I just I don't see how types
Krypton's of succeeding in the long run
but you know that's that's the way of it
should I see it right now is that
everything is our yesterdays Babel Rita
will not really be desperate yes it's
level in and then let patch so whatever
you end up using with those flavors you
know that that's where I feel like most
people's attention you know unless
you're learning like you're just getting
started once again I'll just jump around
and jump on your shirt because it's not
gonna do you any justice or anything but
like if you're a web developer in this
industry like if I were like a friend
since I worked a lot of guys in my
previous jobs over just met guys like
c-sharp chives and you know they
consider themselves web developers and
they have no you know arts or JavaScript
knowledge of you know the modern
JavaScript fashion saying I think it's a
very dangerous thing to be like know
what does JavaScript sure there's going
to be a fad and I don't need to learn it
and all that stuff like that would I
think that would be a terrible mistake
for a lot of established web developers
to ignore the soul JavaScript engine
system so anyway guys that's my gosh man
make sure you subscribe thanks for all
the support we passed 50,000 that's
awesome and you guys have a good day
right hey guys so a lot of you asked me
how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
coding boot camp is a 12 week intensive
course that focuses on the technologies
of the here and now for web development
some of the things that are actually
teaching in the 12-week course is geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery no jf react
angular how to use github so a lot of
the things that you're going to need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding boot camp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
can't just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
