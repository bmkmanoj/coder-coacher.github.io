good comment here and I thought it was
pretty interesting and I'm just gonna
read it word for word his name
Christopher Wyler wheeler he says in my
opinion languages and syntax is not
programming if you are able to come up
with solutions to hard problems than
you're a good programmer for example
what is the space complexity of keeping
a hight field in every node of an AVL
tree so that we know when to perform
rotations when a node is unbalanced how
can you improve this space complexity to
zero one the there are real programming
problems out in the real world because
they require logic and critical thinking
and thus this is what computer science
is building a website is for eyeties and
it is just a mechanical process and it's
really quite easy actually programming
actually has nothing to do with coding
really all it takes is paper and pencil
and applied math with logic and critical
thinking so I think this guy he makes
some decent points he's basically you
know trying to say that I'm assuming
whatever sort of job he has as a data
scientist or a rocket science or
whatever he's doing you know for talking
about rotations and balancing and stuff
like that you know I would have to say I
mean if you were having to be faced with
problems like that day in and day out I
certainly would never be a programmer I
I taught myself how to be a programmer I
don't think writing web pages and
managing full stacks and having to deal
with all the day-to-day technology that
a typical web programmer has to deal
with is easy buy and buy any regard and
if it were so easy then we wouldn't see
salaries of 120 to 140 thousand dollars
to write web pages to manage databases
to manage full stacks etc etc so yes
everything has a web presence and that
there is a lot of web programmers out
there and maybe web programmers aren't
as smart as some of these data
scientists that are doing a lot of
machine learning and crunching some of
the most complex algorithms you're doing
physics and and then studying you know
quantum theory and all this other stuff
that is
not necessarily I would say that that's
kind of a blanket statement that that
you know to say that web programming is
not programming or not computer science
is is absolutely ridiculous I think now
I will say this there are certain people
that are probably advanced enough in
order to do rocket science or aerospace
and engineering and things like that and
then there's people that aren't and
there are programmers that are very good
at math and there are programmers that
aren't very good at math in many cases
being a web programmer and doesn't
involve a whole lot of mathematics and
in a lot of cases and some of the game
programming that I've done in c-sharp
and a few other languages and there
hasn't there's been a lot more math than
what I would find
doing databases and websites but it
wasn't nearly as mind-boggling as trying
to create my own physics engine where I
have to look at you know force and
inertia and all these like physical
components in order to figure out how
items interact with each other it was
more of okay rotate you know you know
this this amount of degrees or turn the
camera this way in that way granted a
lot of the complicated work has been
solved by us by some of the smartest
brilliant minds and mathematicians in
the industry it doesn't mean that we all
have to be that way so I think honestly
with programming from from what I've
seen it seems like we have dumbed down
programming a little bit more I mean
with object-oriented languages with a
documentation that's available out there
with all the sites like Stack Overflow
or tutorials on how to you know teach
yourself new technologies and you know
holding your hand and walk and you step
by step we're making programming easier
obviously so programming is not like it
was in the 70s you didn't have to be
Alan Turing in order to be a program or
understand you know cryptographic
analysis and all this stuff there are
guys that are there guys in you know
girls obviously women men and women that
are that brilliant and they're going to
be writing some of the most brilliant
code you've ever seen and I think most
programmers strive to be there to one
day get to that point but it doesn't
necessarily mean that we're bad
programmers because we never reach that
that height there are certain people
that are just gifted and that you know
they they're almost to the point of
sanity you know I would say with some of
their thoughts and thought processes if
we look at somebody like the
mathematician Kirk Godel the guy was an
Austrian physicist and mathematician and
you know extremely advanced extremely
smart he was a friend of Einstein at
Princeton they often went for walks and
talk together and who knows what they
were talking about I'm sure they were
talking about some pretty miraculous
things or maybe nothing at all we can
only speculate
however this guy starved himself to
death after his wife was like
hospitalized or something like that he
was literally to the point where he was
crazy like his wife would have to
taste-test his food silly that so this
guy obviously I mean he advanced the
foundation of mathematics is very smart
but I don't know that we all want to be
so smart that we end up you know almost
driving ourselves to the verge of
insanity because of the kind of thoughts
and things that go through our minds so
he's just he's just one example of you
know somebody that's so smart and
probably was faced with some of the
largest challenges of humanity ever you
know as far as mathematical trying to
find the theory of everything
essentially that this guy you know used
it and drove himself to insanity or
maybe it was his own physical health I
don't know but I think it sounds like it
was a combination of the two here's an
example of Schrodinger's cat so I mean
he proposed questions to the Copenhagen
I guess Copenhagen convention or
whatever you want to call it but they
had the back in the 30s like a model for
quantum mechanics and it was something
that Schrodinger had raised you know the
possibility and Einstein actually like
Schrodinger's the way that he kind of
phrased the same type of question that
also Einstein had phrased back in the
30s as well as far as not understanding
some of the quantum theory that was
being produced by some of the brilliant
minds from you know mostly Europe and
around academic colleges and
universities everywhere so so there's
all kinds of physicists right and
they're all trying to study the same
quantum you know quantum questions and
problems and solve the same issues and
there's certain professors that are
assisting and working in the field day
to day and granted you know they may not
ever you know discover the the secrets
to life or to
the answers to these unsolved problems
but it doesn't necessarily mean that
they were like stupid or that they were
not good physicists or doctors or
whatever it is that they're doing I
think that there is a high degree of
certain people that are very very gifted
when it comes to mathematics and physics
and things like that and that you know
they they will be able to expand
computer science to new horizons I think
we all strive to be that as programmers
but it doesn't necessarily that mean
that that we all have to be that in
order to be a good programmer being a
good programmer in the commercial world
from what I've seen is being able to
solve business problems effectively and
efficiently and having enough knowledge
of the different systems and things that
are available and the tools available to
you to be able to get the job done
you're not worrying about how to prevent
a satellite in orbit that loses one
engine thruster from tumbling in space
or as it orbits the earth or something
like that
and if that is your job and you're
getting paid the same amount as a
computer scientist and you know and a
typical insurance industry you know
that's writing webpages or something
like that you know I think that's
probably an injustice I guess maybe but
maybe you then have more you know better
feelings about where you are in your
life and what you're doing to contribute
to humanity if you're getting paid the
same amount or whatever it is so anyway
I'll sum this up by saying computer
programmers are generally from what I've
seen smarter than a lot of the mass
public that you see out there that just
doesn't understand you know basic math
or basic logic and things like that and
then and then you have a certain gifted
elite class of academics that are
studying obviously greater math problems
and things that that you know most
programmers will never actually attain
you know that degree of understanding or
have you know the amount of math
necessary to really be able to you know
assist in that regard but there are
plenty of opportunities for the masses
of programmers
I consider myself included and many of
the other people that I work with
personally that are never going to
attain that but we have we have a skill
that is that is definitely in demand
it's a it's a high paying skill and
it's not going anywhere anytime soon and
and in Grenon when technology gets
easier to deal with we're still a step
ahead of some of the noobs out there
that are just getting started and using
these larger building blocks in order to
accomplish you know similar goals and
tools so I think that you know that
there is nothing wrong with being an IT
and writing webpages if you're into
video gaming or and you're in the
medical sciences or anything like that
that I think we all do contribute to the
field and that's that's really it guys
all right thanks for watching you guys
have a good day thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
