relatively hot topic when we talked
about whether or not the degree is
necessary and IT and some of the people
have said that they think that the
processes should be changed by the way
this video for Eli man was hilarious I
thought I was classic but um you know
some of the people had pointed out that
with the hiring process like it seems
like it's broken now granted this
program that I had created that parse
through one hundred eighty eight
thousand jobs and it found something
like five thousand five hundred and
twelve I don't remember the exact number
but I posted in the last video or a
video a few days ago and you know it
edie stated that like ninety four point
four percent of all the the job listings
needed a degree now there's probably
some inaccuracies in that code so that
could be a little bit high but when I
did do some spot checking it seemed
relatively accurate where I saw it but
obviously I don't have enough time to
spend you know parsing through eight
hundred eighty eight thousand jobs it
would take me a month and you know some
of the people had pointed out well it
seems like the the hiring process to
change because things have changed quite
drastically like people were commenting
like thirty years ago if you knew how to
to code then you could find the job
anywhere and it didn't matter if you had
a degree or not and then all of a sudden
it seems like in this shitty economy
everybody's like oh you have to have a
degree and and some of you guys are
saying oh well that's not the case you
prove that you know what you're doing
and you know I mean you always have a
job and all this other stuff and I
actually though I don't know that I
believe that I tend to be somewhat of a
naysayer sometimes and um and I
generally have like a pessimistic view
points um and I'm really a lot of things
in my life that I think that I've
crafted me to be that way but in many
cases it's just having a back-up plan to
know that you have something else that
you could do or that you would want to
do and and part of what I like to do is
just I like to create business ideas and
I like to work on my my knowledge but
all that being said I don't know that
their companies would actually hire me
even with you know four years
professional IT experienced it on an
enterprise level you know c-sharp dotnet
experience along with JavaScript being a
relatively decent front-end program or
having a decent amount of django
knowledge and being completely full
stack when it comes to me like building
a lot of these fools
sites that I've worked on or what did we
know what about even you know building a
YouTube channel and building up this
audience you know I don't know it seems
like I've done a lot of different things
and I have no confidence whatsoever that
somebody's gonna be like hey this guy
has a strong work ethic we're gonna go
ahead and hire him and I'll give you an
example some I get these these
recruiters all the time that we're
reaching out to me and and I notice on
my my LinkedIn I had that I mentioned
this this four-year university that I
had attended along with the community
college that was going to and I ended up
removing all that because I haven't even
finished that two-year degree and the
four-year college I went to I only went
for one semester I took two courses and
ended up having to drop out and it was
really it was a money situation I was 17
when I was enrolled there and and you
had to have your parents like getting to
get financial aid it was just I was a
young kid and I ended up like delivering
pizzas or something at that point but
basically I was just getting out there
and I went from being a lifeguard and I
think I'd started delivering pizzas as
my second job and I was probably doing
that when I was going to college but I
just remember not wanting to deal with
all the headache of the finances and
everything and even back then courses
were well over a grand you know for one
single course and that wasn't even
counting books and like they wanted my
parents involved in like it was just as
a long drawn-out process and eventually
you get to this age though where you can
apply for financial aid where you don't
have to actually give all your parents
 because basically the government's
like if your parents are loaded they
don't want to pay for your education
even with financial aid you know where
even if you have to pay it back you know
no we're not even talking about grants
and stuff like that but so my point is
that I updated that so that I changed it
I noticed that immediately like a lot of
the recruiters you know I saw a drop-off
now granted I've also read in articles
recently that that IT jobs are down like
40 percent across the United States I
read that on Hacker News just not even
like a couple weeks ago so we know that
the tech is is where is like entering
into a relative slowdown that the
venture capital funding has been drying
up so a lot of these these positions
over lucrative are not really there you
know people aren't starting that you
know that
the companies and and every possible
idea in getting millions to back them so
things are tightening up a little bit so
I imagine that that accounts for some of
the drop-off but I really think that it
was me not listening this this college
there that even though it didn't say
that I graduate or anything you know I
saw this drop-off and then there have
been multiple occasions where I've had
recruiters actually reach out to me and
typically I'll respond back and you know
thanks for the offer and blah blah and a
lot of times I want to hear them out
just because you know they have some
sort of relationship with different
companies I'm generally interested when
they're like hey a hundred and thirty
thousand dollars a year and we're gonna
give you like five weeks paid off blah
blah blah and you know you get all these
like things you just want to know okay
what is the company but they typically
don't want to give you the company and I
don't know a whole lot behind that of
why they don't do that but it just seems
like it's just kind of a you know I
guess used-car salesman type of
mentality I guess I don't trust them
essentially that's the best way to
describe that I don't trust any of these
recruiters but some of these recruiters
have actually flat-out told me oh no the
company actually requires you have a
degree because they'll be like you were
a perfect fit for this and I look at
this and it's like asking for a PhD and
they want me to do react and and oh so
how did you think that I was eligible
for that I mean are you sure it says
that you know I said a lot of those
people I won't even respond back to but
there have been a few that I would talk
to and a lot of times I actually do this
to try to build up knowledge for the
channel as well especially as of late
and and I can tell you it's not it's not
very good I mean like this one company
they were like yeah this the the salary
it was like some company in DC they'd
even give me the name of it actually but
I told him I was like I don't I don't
have a degree you guys are asking for a
degree and you know and I think I'm for
reaching out and everything and then
apparently they're like oh you know let
me talk to the company all this stuff
and then they get back to me oh yeah
definitely need to have the degree and I
said alright well I wouldn't want to
work for a company like that anyway and
I wasn't interested in working for this
company number one these people
approached me but I used to get these
these recruiters all the time and it
seems like I get them less now than I
used to
although I still do get recruiters
probably you know at least a couple of
week
reaching out to me and it's usually
never the actual company directly now
one time Amazon had reached out to me
and it was a recruiter
from Northern Virginia and and that was
definitely somebody that actually worked
for that company another time there was
another company in that in DC that
actually reached out to me so sometimes
they are legitimately companies that
reach out to me most of the time it's
you know these recruiters and I'm not
saying that all recruiters are bad a lot
of people swear by them and think that
you know that they they help out a lot
but it just seems like a real sleazy
thing and I remember a post the reason
why we chose Wikipedia pulled up here is
guido van rossum the creator of python I
remember he posted a couple years ago on
Google+ that some recruiter had actually
reached out to him and this might have
been a recruiter directly for a company
or it might have just been you know a
headhunter I don't I don't remember
which one but it was some sort of
recruiter and it said hey we know it
looks like you'd be it looks like you
know a lot about Python so we think
you'd be an excellent fit for this you
know this position and it goes in and
listing all this stuff and it's like you
asshole do you even know who you're
talking to you're talking to the guy
that created Python I mean in and that's
just a mindset that you see from some of
these recruiters and it's it's it's a
big fat waste of time but I can tell you
just by talking to some of them who have
talked and or represent some of these
companies that they try to recruit for
and they do hold it against you and they
don't give a that I have a YouTube
channel with millions of viewers or that
I've been programming and teaching
myself for almost a decade now are going
on the latter half of our closer towards
a decade then then you know mid mid year
pointer mid mid decade pointer I wish I
would have said that better but you know
what I'm talking about so you know you
even with all of that and the fact that
I I've been going to school for business
administration and I've started
companies I've started full stack web
sites like I can tell you firsthand that
a lot of them you know it never even
gets to that stage of where they even
give a to hear about any of that
stuff because you never made it past
that front door or that for the first
stage because you didn't have the degree
and I mean I've seen it firsthand
and a lot and a lot of these recruiters
like I said you know approaching gwido
and asking him asking if he's interested
in the
Python job because he might know a lot
about Python or he seems to know a lot
about Python I don't know man it's
pretty messed up if you ask me the the
number one most important thing of being
a programmer I would definitely say it
is dedication because dedication is
going to get you you know to continue to
try and try and try again because you're
gonna need to do that anytime you're
learning something new even if you're a
c-sharp guy like of late I've been
messing with react and redux and Redux
is it's granted it's not like
complicated but it's still - you know
it's it's still something that I have to
spend time learning like why am i doing
things this way why does it work this
way and and I see other people do do
things and you know and they struggle
just like everybody else to learn new
concepts and learn new things and but
the fact is is if you can learn those
things then you should be a very very
valuable employee because there's a lot
of people with a mindset hey I have a
degree I got my degree 28 years ago and
I've been a c-sharp programmer since
2002 I don't need to learn Python I
don't need to learn react I don't need
to learn JavaScript you know what I mean
that kind of mindset is rampant in you
know the IT world and I don't understand
the mindset of why a degree is so
important when it's like you know some
of these kids that don't have the
degrees they're the ones paving the way
and helping and they're motivated to
bring these projects forward and
contribute to these these open-source
projects and they're passionate about
the technology they're passionate about
their new tools and I don't know why not
why not give them just as much of a shot
there's definitely something going on I
would say in the United States for sure
I personally think the economy kind of
sucks I think it sucks since the Great
Recession I think the government is
stipulating that certain contracts at
least in the DC area have to be
fulfilled by people with degrees because
if you look at a lot of the IT defense
contractors that populate the DC area
where I live I mean it's almost like
exclusively every single one of them
they not only want you to have a degree
it is a requirement that you have that
too
and I've heard from other people that
it's because of the way that they build
a government and the government
sometimes stipulates that that these
people that are going to be built at
these certain hours you know with all
this experience in these new you know
they want them to have advanced degrees
stem degrees and you've seen it even
with Obama's election in 2012 where you
know he was trying to defend the record
you know of his first four years in
office because you know he went into
there he took office during the Great
Recession four years later the economy
was still just kind of sputtering along
even after spending trillions on
bailouts and things like that and a lot
of the college kids I remember with his
debates with Mitt Romney I mean he would
they were asking I'm like they were
asking both they put candidates they're
laying it well how are you gonna help us
find jobs and stuff like that so you
know the president knows that that was a
big deal for kids that are coming out of
college with their stem degrees to be
able to get them employed somewhere so
what can they do they can go out and
they can tell all the IT contractors
that they give billions of dollars to
every single year hey this has to be a
stipulation you hire these people and
you have people working on this
government project they must have an
advanced degree in computer science or
mathematics or something and I
definitely think that that might play
into some of it and then we're just you
know we're seeing just a normal slowdown
as well but it's interesting I think
it's I'm curious to see where we go and
I'm never very confident that I would
just really go out and find some job
anywhere just because you know just
because I have a programming job now I
you know I don't know I'm always I'm
always trying to plan for that future
and part of my planning and is just to
make sure that I continue to keep my ear
to the streets and make sure that I
continue to teach myself and to learn
and I think that's really all we can do
and eventually things will turn around
for us I think but there's certainly a
war against people without degrees right
now alright guys thanks for watching
have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
