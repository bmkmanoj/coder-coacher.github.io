about skin peddlers you probably never
heard the term this is actually
something that friend of mine who I know
from DC I used to work with him he
actually uh it was he mentioned it I'm
not sure if he came up with it himself
but he was the first person I'd heard it
from but he referred to headhunters as
skin peddlers I actually like that name
a little bit so I think that it's a
pretty good name for what a lot of
recruiters are now just be forewarned
not all recruiters are bad I've had good
experiences and bad experiences but this
list is mainly just about a few items
that kind of stand out as to why some
recruiters have given the entire tech
recruiting industry a bad name so let's
go ahead and get into that list a little
bit first so once again not all
recruiters suck many of them do so I
mean a lot of people have had really
good experiences with recruiters I know
a guy who actually worked with a
recruiter who actually negotiated the
guy salary up by almost $20,000 so he
was actually short short citing himself
because he was moving geographic areas
and the recruiter knew the area that
this job was in and also what to be able
to ask for salary so I know that some
people have had really good experiences
so it's really just about finding the
right recruiter to build a relationship
with but we'll get into that so some
will actually call you at your place of
work I've had this happen I literally
have had somebody call my work and this
is at a place I was working at and I
hadn't even been working there very long
and I didn't even know my work phone
number so like that's how little I had
actually used and set up my own phone
number like nobody called me during the
day most of the communication was done
via email or in person or like Skype or
you know even though we were using slack
as well but the this this recruiter
actually somehow found my number and
through like the corporate directory
they they called my work and that was
pretty crazy I ended up getting back to
the guy through LinkedIn because that's
how he found my information and I told
him I wasn't interested but guy the
recruiter was out in New York New York
City area and just you know complete you
know complete slimeball move I think I
mean so if any recruiters are watching
you definitely shouldn't do something
like that I certainly wouldn't work with
you no matter how good the job is if a
recruiter did that to me
in the future so many will spam you with
opportunities with no regard to like
your work history your geographic
location your education or your salary
requirements I've had jobs sent to me by
recruiters day in and day out where it's
like we're looking for a PhD or 20 years
in the industry or C++ like they didn't
even do basic keyword analysis on like
what you know what my resume was and
things like that so there's definitely a
lot of that and that's just based on
where we are in technology because
recruiters can spam so easy nowadays
with the things like LinkedIn and
mailing lists and things like that so
they also inflate job titles
technologies and salaries to try to get
a bite from predict potential candidates
so that's actually something that
happens a lot oh yeah this jobs for
140,000 and Indianapolis like well you
know good and well like nobody's getting
140,000 for some like basic JavaScript
or web UI thing stuff like that so it's
like recruiters probably promising the
world and most likely that the job is
going to settle it somewhere around you
know 100 hundred and ten so they're
known to inflate some of these things
they also want to inflate the actual
benefits and things that the potential
that the company provides and they'll be
like you know awesome you know great
work-life balance and all this stuff so
you definitely want to take a lot of
that with a grain of salt because these
these recruiters they don't really care
about you in many cases they would just
want to get that they get you landed
with the job so they can get the
Commission because that's how they make
money and they're able to feed their own
families but just keep in mind they
don't necessarily represent you and the
deal due to like literally no barrier to
entry become a I team recruiter many are
not trained to perform like decent
screening especially for technology so
it's kind of goes without saying a lot
of these recruiters aren't coders so
they're not going to know a lot about
coding technologies and things like that
but it's just it's one of the hardest
things to do in order for and that is
for IT companies to hire good IT talent
try to siphon out good programmers from
bad and it's something that there is no
foolproof way of being able to resolve
that but it's even harder to resolve
that problem when you have somebody that
literally knows nothing about technology
trying to place the technology candidate
again due to no barrier to entry many
recruiters like Commons customer service
like that guy that
calling up somebody on there at their
place of employment just no common sense
there as far as like that's something
you just do not want to do to build a
good relationship a lot of times you
know they're not calling back or they're
not being forthcoming with with their
their potential candidates that they're
working with and now I'm just you know
bad customer service in general and I
think a lot of that has to do with just
simply once again no barrier to entry to
become an IT recruiter so also many
recruiters are relentless so I've seen
this before so even if they're not
calling your place of employment on your
work phone number they are texting you
several times throughout the day
sometimes I've gotten up to like 10 e
text messages from one recruiter and a
potential day and you know obviously
24-hour day and then emailing phone
calls things like that you know so it's
a lot of them are just it's a very
cutthroat industry they want to land
that job they don't want the job to be
filled they don't want another recruiter
to get it and things like that so it's
definitely just a cutthroat industry all
right so keep peddling that skin once
again I can't really claim credit for
skin peddler but I think the skin
peddlers you know probably just as good
as headhunter you know or Body Snatcher
I'm just kidding I'm not sure what other
names there are for recruiters but a
skin peddler I think has to be up there
for us moving forward all right guys
