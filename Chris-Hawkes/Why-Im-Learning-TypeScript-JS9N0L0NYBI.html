that I've wanted to do in 2017 was learn
typescript and the reason why I mention
it is like I was just recently I was out
with a couple of people on Friday and
there was some talk about whether or not
typescript was going to be used within
the company so it's something where I
haven't learned typescript because I
haven't actually seen it involved any
sort of businesses that I've worked for
and I mean for the most part I mean
typescript hasn't
I wouldn't say grabbed a whole lot of
attention or anything as far as a hey
look what we've done in typescript
compared to what you know what you could
do in regular es6 and for those reasons
I haven't really used it so it's hard
for me to sit here and be like do
typescript there's so much better than
es6 and everybody's going to use
typescript because it's going to be
great everything I really don't have any
sort of arguments for it like that and
and I understand what typescript is I
mean it is a it is a superset of
JavaScript meaning that you write type
script and it compiles down to
JavaScript it's really no different than
what we're doing these days if you've
ever done any sort of es6 where you're
then using babel to compile your
JavaScript into something else and even
though this is I guess the difference
between you know babel and typescript is
that when you're writing es6 the babel
way then you can technically say well
you know even though this this code is
being compiled to something else this
code would eventually work inside of a
browser and typescript you can never
really say that because it is an
entirely separate syntax it's a separate
language and even when browsers start
supporting some of these es6 features or
es7 then you know type scripts going to
have their own kind of implementation of
how that stuff works and but ultimately
I guess what I'm saying is they are two
distinct paths and whether or not one is
better than the other I'm not really
sure that that I can say definitively
but I can say that like with JavaScript
fatigue all the tools you have to get
set up to basically building on like
react projects especially if you want to
introduce like read ox or a react read
officer but basically because of the
complexities of getting a basic projects
that have a lot of people are like man I
don't want to do
people like typical back-end developers
that were doing a lot of server-side
stuff with Java or C sharp there are a
lot of people that are turned off to
that entire JavaScript community but I
mean I've basically come around on it
just essentially because of the fact
that I make a lot of money doing
JavaScript so it's like I'm willing to
play by those rules and jump through the
hoops and everything because it you know
obviously my career is surrounding it
but there are days though where I'm like
you know what if I'm going to learn a
new language I'm probably going to spend
on you know some time on something else
you know besides the whole job is for
front-end environments of really rust or
go lying or something like that but the
reason why I'm like well you know types
are because this is the first time that
it's been introduced where it's like
it's a possibility that it could be used
when a company that I'm working for so
for that reason my typescript will be
the next language designed of learning
in 2017 so I I think that you know
whether or not this thing wins out is
going to be it's really tough to say
like here's of the neat things that I
really don't know how accurate these
things are like how much you know clout
you can give this but you can see on
Google Trends that the typescript is
it's exploding in popularity but react
probably went through the same sort of
transition now the probably the problem
with react is it's such like a it's a
normal word we react to something hey
I've watched you know these funny
reaction videos or you know what I mean
it's like so you can't really type the
word react because then you get you know
a skewed results so it's like I don't
know man like and you can't do
typescript jazz because nobody's calling
it typescript Jas it's just out yes I
mean it so it as far as how accurate
something like this is it's tough to say
because a lot of people do call react
react and not you know react yes so a
lot of these trends and when we're
trying to analyze everything it's
typically to have the gray font on the
end so I don't know man I wish like I
had the answer to some of this shit but
I can tell you that like if companies
start using typescript then you want to
learn tie script right and if companies
are using react over angular
it's kind of like where the jobs are man
that's that's mostly if that's what you
get paid to do for that but if you're
just doing some sort of hobby then you
probably don't care but for me it's like
man I want to be where the industry is
in a couple of years and that's kind of
why I'm like man type script dude it's
probably if you're a web developer it's
probably worth spending some time with
because one of the main benefits of
using typescript besides the fact that
it's you know statically typed or bring
static typing to to the JavaScript
language and by the way static typing is
essentially types and you know strings
arrays numbers things like that that are
determined at compile time so there's no
like there's no like oh let me
dynamically assign some sort of type and
everything so statically typed languages
are all about having the compiler know
what type of that it's dealing with when
the actual code is being compiled in
typescript brings that to you so like
when you're creating functions and
you're passing in arguments you know
what type of arguments are being passed
in because you're labeling okay this
argument a is going to be a number and
argument B is going to be an array and
like when you're reading when you're
looking at the code you can you know
you're much it's much easier to reason
about for people that come from like a
c-sharp and Java background because and
really for anybody for that matter but
you can look at the messin clearly say
oh yeah this is what this is accepting
and with JavaScript you typically want
to use like if you're using es linting
rules which are just like suggestions on
how to code and everything then those
will typically have you know layout how
your your method or your function
definition and that has like two the
definitions for each argument but it's
kind of a hassle to have to read the you
know the standard documentation and when
you could just locally or literally read
the method or function and be able to
see the arguments that are being passed
it is it worth an entire subset or
superset of the JavaScript language well
that alone probably is not but then
there's other things that types where it
brings to the table as well like they
have interface
and things that a lot of like c-sharp
developers are used to so the thing
about typescript is that with all the
c-sharp developers out there that don't
want to touch javascript like this is
kind of Microsoft's answer to say hey
let's go ahead and get all these c-sharp
people to start writing JavaScript you
know literally the future of law
language that runs in the browser or all
languages because it runs in the browser
then you know the Microsoft's whole
thing is hey learn typescript and we can
make it you know very similar to kind of
C sharp and and then you end up getting
a lot of people that weren't writing
JavaScript to start writing it so that I
mean that is a I think that is a bigger
deal than probably what you know many I
would say just normal JavaScript
developers we don't want to believe or
want to hear I mean there are massive
amounts of Java and c-sharp developers
out there and the JavaScript community
there's there's quite a bit of them as
well but there it's a lot of like newbie
like the inner level a lot of advanced
people as well as it I mean JavaScript
someone the first language is it seems
like you newbies start jumping into and
learning the latest framework and things
like that so you start introducing some
of these older programmers into it you
know via typescript and everything I
mean we were in for I think a pretty fun
environment in the next couple years I
don't know where it's going to go but I
can tell you though I know or at least I
feel like I know enough about the fact
that companies are starting to use
typescript that there is this there's
this drawing towards it you know based
on in the form job of c-sharp developers
and then might get into the JavaScript
world and it does offer you know quite a
few nice things the sanity of it is
probably a little bit easier to deal
with when you're looking at something
like Babel and you have Babel that's
broken up and oh you know fifteen
hundred different projects so it's like
I want to do promises I'm going to bring
the sanno I want to support a sink in a
way I got to use some sort of Babel
polyfill or anything like that I mean
the Babel can be kind of a complicated
environment so typescript from what I
hear tries them to make that a little
bit more sane with what you need in
order to to utilize some of the latest
features of the
language and the JavaScript language as
a whole all right guys I'm babbling on
man so I'm learning to type you don't
have to learn type script
I think type script mistakes are in for
hell the battle probably the next couple
years and I don't see that one really is
written like that much better than any
other one I don't I think whichever you
decide to do is probably not going to be
that big of a deal but as a web
developer like if you are working one
day on a es6 project and then you have
to move to a typescript project it's
probably going to be a good idea that
you don't have it like completely
blindside you so for those reasons
that's why I'm going to be learning type
script all right guys thanks for
watching have a good day bye hey guys so
a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in the
suevi course it's geared to get you into
the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
