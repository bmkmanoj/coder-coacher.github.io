looking at today is going to be trying
out the GoFundMe crowdfunding website
and it's probably the third in line I
would say behind Kickstarter and you go
as far as popularity the difference
between GoFundMe and Kickstarter's that
GoFundMe like basically can promote all
kinds of stuff from like any a new car
to I need to go to college or you know
more like raising money like they one
lady had a lot of success raising money
for injuries that she suffered in the
Aurora Colorado shooting so it's kind of
like a just like an open forum basically
or open platform for almost any type of
fundraising you could want so that's
what we're going to go in and try out
today and see what type of ease of use
it has and let's go ahead and start with
the signup process okay and I'll give my
general website address to the website
so if you guys have any questions just
use the gmail account and this easiest
thing okay so essentially I'm going to
be following the same format that we did
last time we're just going to try to
raise money to advertise the website the
noob niche website which is my
crowdfunding website at reports on news
some of the latest like what I call tips
like as far as like awesome crowdfunding
projects that are currently existing
right now just to give people an
awareness on the successes and failures
that people are having on different
platforms but also to hold these
platforms accountable because we're all
waiting for the SEC to release
regulations for crowdfunding and
essentially it allows the typical
American to be an angel investor to be a
capital or venture
to us so it has a lot of promise to it
but we don't want you know few bad
portals and companies dragging down
something that could be you know a
phenomenal way of doing business that
changes the way things are done you know
almost like the internet changed the way
business was conducted in the 90s and
you know leading up to today and now you
know it's a lot of mobile talking
wherever but I mean the crowdfunding
thing can be you know and ultimately a
game-changer I mean they there was one
portal that was just recently our
project that was recently started for a
Space Telescope and they raised as a as
of today I believe it was six hundred
fifty thousand dollars and over a
hundred thousand dollars on their first
day so when people believe in something
they will definitely contribute and I
think you can you'll see a lot more of
that once the SEC releases the
regulations because you know not only
are they going to get it Dib at the
product they're actually going to get
part ownership of that company so then
they become angel investors themselves
the typical American so we'll see what
those regulations entail once they're
released and I've been you know I've
been continuing to report on that but
that is the purpose of the website so I
think that it does have a purpose I want
to be you know want to hold these
companies accountable for for their
actions and things so both good and bad
so that's the purpose and the project is
just going to be raising money for the
for the advertising needed since I
created a website myself I programmed in
everything so there's not too much risk
and on to pay anybody to do that for me
but you know there are expenses
obviously but I just strictly want to
use they can't pay money for advertising
should it actually succeed so let's go
ahead and do that so is it going to be
for charity or nothing
I'll just do this one it seems to be
most popular goal amount will do $1,000
and I guess it's yeah I don't know if
that's a good or bad title but uh page
color I think red kind of screams will
go with the orange I believe yeah that
should be good
Facebook photo
fine I'll let them do that posts your
friends no I hate when it tries to do
that because I'm like you think you're
just trying to comment on something next
thing you know it's all over Facebook
and I honestly can't stand up but here
we'll do this one King oh crap I just
said okay anyway I can turn that off
later but it's fine
actually no I'm going to select that one
that looks a little bit more
professional I think all right position
yeah actually fun continue there we go
um all right so go Fredericksburg
Virginia page message I guess this is
where I kind of do the upsell it's not
very clear here but page message so I'll
say I am trying to raise funds to
promote new niche comic crowd funding
news and ratings Webb's goal is to raise
awareness of the crowd funding crowd
funding is ideas and hold crowd funding
companies accountable for their actions
okay offer a reward level yeah sure
so if you donate I'll say $25 does it go
level quantity and chooses I wonder okay
alright so basically what I'm saying is
if you donate $25 for the advertising
that your name will be added to the
about us special thanks to so people can
say hey you donate it to the website and
no I don't know it looks terrible
whatever so no I don't want to ask for
their mailing address
so we have to use our repays term has
only been known this company asked
okay what you'll have to read that
individually on an individual scale but
I'll visit that in a moment
wow that was a
that was pretty easy actually I was a
much easier than Kickstarter that's for
sure Kickstarter I'm still jumping
through hoops trying to get the account
process which is mainly with Amazon I
get the fax a bunch of documents to him
and everything but yeah this one it was
surprisingly easy so definitely
ease-of-use I mean so it's way better
than Kickstarter as far as getting the
project just getting getting it going
senior product progress here so other
than that that's about it so let me go
back here success to continue pose to
your page to Facebook I don't want to do
that here so I'm going to skip this set
this step and by email contacts of
support yo skip it post your page to
twitter skip it copy and paste and share
your page link right ahead later and
then print your campaign sign let's skip
that too
so I've raised $0 all right well I'm not
going to go ahead and conclude this
tutorial I found that quite easy
obviously I've seen people try to like
raise money for stuff that's
questionable like I think it's kind of
wanted downsize is something like this
is that like you really don't know what
people are going to use the money for
like in my particular case if I do - the
money will strictly be used for
advertising but you know I can't say
that other people would live up to their
their pledge or whatever so that's about
it so I definitely like that the
platform is very easy to use and if you
have any questions feel pretty email me
make sure you visit our new niche comm
has all the latest crowdfunding
information and subscribe to the channel
outside of tutorials that I do for
programming if you're interested in that
and that's it so thank you for watching
