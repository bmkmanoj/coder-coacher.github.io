just want to touch on real quick what
nodejs is there's been a lot of
confusion out there and and this is
actually somewhat of an old subject so
if it doesn't interest you I totally
understand but a lot of people think
nodejs is a framework and a lot of times
it's called like a framework or they'll
say the nodejs framework and I've
actually said the same damn thing myself
and it just causes I think confusion of
what nodejs really is to chance or any
sort of confusion nodejs uses JavaScript
and the way it uses JavaScript and if
you guys are familiar with javascript
javascript cannot be executed outside of
the browser so if I say alert hello
world I'm executing this from inside the
browser now it's going to run because
it's something that JavaScript can do
the alert is a built-in function that's
part of the JavaScript language that
alerts that pop up now this JavaScript
that is being executed when I click
enter it's actually using Chrome's
built-in JavaScript engine which is the
v8 JavaScript engine so this chrome
engine scan read the you know the
JavaScript to know what to do know that
said no js' is not actual JavaScript it
is it is written in C so if you go to
github and you look at the source code
for the actual node project you can see
that all this stuff is these header
files and everything but it's all C
based code so this is all raw c b and
the reason why is because the javascript
can't access file systems or anything
like that it can't run outside of the
browser it's not made for servers and
sockets and all that other stuff so it
that is all written in C and as you know
C requires a lot more code than a more
higher level language like JavaScript or
Python so the amount of code that is
being written for you with this judah's
node project allows you to essentially
create web servers using the node
technology with about 20 lines of code
you could have a working web server
where if you wrote that in C you would
have much much more code on your hands
but node does that now note says hey you
can actually extend and use this
framework anywhere you want using the
JavaScript language and when it does
that it actually says ok in order for us
to interpret what you're actually
to do with the node project we use the
v8 chrome engine to then transpile or
compile whatever JavaScript that you
typed which then tells nodejs what to do
no js' is considered an event based
system so event-driven programming is
essentially this they give the example
in the Wikipedia here where it's a UIC
you hover over something an event gets
fired and the event gets sent out to
some other you know some handler an
event handler and the actual thread that
is running the UI doesn't know how to
handle the event it just knows how to
send the event so that being said the
node.js project is built so that with
this event rate based system that it can
handle as many requests that you throw
at it it doesn't mean that it handles it
any faster than any other technology out
there although the v8 engine is very
fast and as well as node because it's
written in C it doesn't mean that no J's
just somehow magically can handle crud
applications which stands for create
read update and delete which is your
typical database website for any sort of
content type thing whether it's you know
Wikipedia or the you know Spotify
anything that has to read from a
database and update and all that stuff
whether you're using an API that's
restful or soap based it doesn't matter
the point is is that for all these these
these things that need to be done like
actually querying the database grabbing
data reading from it so that all still
takes time with nodejs it doesn't do it
any faster for the most part however it
doesn't block so while that request is
being made if you were going to use
something like like Python for a web
server it's gonna then it's gonna spin
up threads to be able to handle all the
different processes that all the
requests that are being thrown at it
whereas the the node system is more of
like a queue that's the way I interpret
it anyway we're you know the requests
get stacked up in a queue and it's being
served first in first out so so FIFO and
you know that's that's essentially it so
it's an event based system it allows you
to write server-side languages and that
you know in a
gives you much more power and
flexibility than the the JavaScript
language normally would but it's not
JavaScript so it reminds me of a of a
news article that was going around the
other day where some ransomware software
was being sent around and in the
ransomware in case you guys have never
heard of it it gets downloaded on a
machine it locks some sort of file you
have to pay a ransom and then it it
decrypt the file allows you to access it
again so there's been like a hospital
got hacked one time and their entire IT
infrastructure had a ransom on it and
the FBI basically said hey pay it
because they there was no way to really
solve this situation and I believe
that's what they ended up doing too but
the point is is that the entire news
article was like this is the first of a
kind because this program was written in
JavaScript and all the browser's run
JavaScript and basically the same kind
of you know media that we
always read about where the sky is
falling and they take things out of
context because they have no idea what
the they're talking about and
little do they know it's not JavaScript
that's accessing the file system and
encrypting and all the other
it's all being done at a sea-based
language on a sea-based language at a
sea-based level that has access to all
those different things just javascript
made it much easier for them to write a
sea-based program in or that it had the
capabilities of doing something like
that
so anyway guys that's really my thoughts
for today once again this this
information note is not new I mean it's
been around since about 2009 so it's not
new at all but there's still just a lot
of confusion with what it is and what it
isn't and and even as recent as that
ransomware article that I was reading
about just a few months ago alright guys
thanks for watching make sure you
subscribe please upload the video I
appreciate it and take care bye hey guys
so a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer
soon as you start they're going to be
teaching you in this and this coding
bootcamp and the entire goal is to be
able to get you into the industry within
12 weeks so if you guys are interested
in learning more information about Deb
mountain coding boot camp just check out
the link in the description tab of this
video thank you for watching and have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
