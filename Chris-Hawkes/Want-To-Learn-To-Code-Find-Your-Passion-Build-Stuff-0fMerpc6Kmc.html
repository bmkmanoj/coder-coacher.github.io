see a movie with my wife and my daughter
and we went to see lala land you guys
can laugh at me whatever I don't know
 but it was actually a really good
movie it was it was a good movie it was
it's considered a musical but for me
like I'm not really in there like this
full-fledged musical type thing I can
deal with some of it
but you know I'm not really the type
that would actually you know want to go
out and see that however I do like both
Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling I pretty
much always have and it's kind of
amazing to see where they've come but
anyway the movie was excellent
definitely one of the year's best movies
I mean I know the critics and things
they're talking about that so I can
second that I'm not one of the ones who
typically sides with critics I'm more of
like if the critics and the fans like
and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna like it if
just the fans like it there's a good
chance I like it if just the critics
like it and most of the fans don't then
I'm pretty much know I'm gonna hate it
so that usually is where I fall within
movies and things like that so I also
feel like I have a pretty decent I - you
know - talent and and you know good
directorial and and writing and the
musical sense to the to the movie was
really good but one of the things I
thought was most interesting of the
movie was that was the trials that these
two characters are going through and
they're really just going that it's
really a journey through Los Angeles
California
almost in this nostalgic type feel but
it's in modern-day society and it was
just very interesting how we kind of
went back in the past you know by also
being in the present so it was a very
like I said nostalgic tone to the entire
musical genre that doesn't really exist
in Hollywood anymore or even in society
but this movie proves that that you can
still have success with you know some of
these old things that they used to work
you know decades and or even more ago
and you know it's probably gonna win
Best Picture it's definitely gonna be
nominated for Best Picture but anyway
it's also one of the interesting things
is that the two characters and the movie
were
going through you know many different
trials and things you know the one girl
she wanted to be an act actress and and
the other guy wanted to be a jazz
musician so both of them were pretty big
pipe dreams and you know they just had
they kept getting turned down and life
was kicking them in the balls and you
know they had to keep trying and and and
obviously Hollywood kind of glamorizes
the whole story and really you know
paints the underdog home but you know
there's so much truth to that I think in
real life that you know it's it's kind
of touching because you know I've been
through the same thing where like you
know I've gone through interviews and
like I said there was that embarrassing
Android interview where I created an
Android app over a period of weeks and
then bring it in and they don't even
look at it within the interview and you
know that so I've had my own share of
embarrassments and a lot of you guys are
trying to get into the industry and I've
even had criticism because this channel
provides hope to people that want to get
into the industry believe it or not I've
actually had criticism for that reason
somewhat you know some people have even
you know said that I paint this false
hope and things like that you know and
and I think that's kind of a nasty thing
to say considering the fact that I was
able to become a self-taught developer
plenty of people that have commented on
this channel I've said the same thing
and many who have said that you know
since they even watched my channel which
has only been around for a few years
that they've actually you know found
that motivation and gotten their first
opportunity so the movie like I said was
very touching on people trying to find
their dreams and they're there you know
and and and fulfilling those dreams at
all costs and and it did a really really
good job of that it's also interesting
to see how far Emma Stone has gotten
because I remember her when she was in
super bad and super bad I think is a
hilarious movie I love super bad but
it's it's really it's like that that's
but the super bad really gave rise to
many tough you know top actors now like
Jonah Hill I mean he wasn't really a top
actor before that role it seemed like
and then you know obviously I'm a stone
just found a lot of success from that
movie
and then you could even say well Michael
Cera was was popular before that because
of Arrested Development but still they
all found success after that movie but
none greater than really Emma Stone and
probably Jonah Hill the other game
really last night I started playing with
rust again and and rust I think is a
phenomenal language you guys have always
asked my opinion on different languages
and I gotta say that rust is the most
impressive new language that I've seen
in really a long time it really it's the
most impressive piece of technology that
has me somewhat excited and you know
something that I really feel like is
worth the investment to really be able
to pay off five ten years down the road
so rust is a systems programming
language so I mean if you want to build
game engines or
operating systems I mean rust can handle
that sort of thing eventually things can
be built on top of rust I would imagine
we can even get different languages at
some point that that are built on top of
rust but I think I think rust is is very
very good and my own video that I posted
last night you know I admit a number one
guys and I even said in the video I said
I superficially touched the language I
don't want anybody not giving things a
try just based on my opinion people do
ask my opinion so I'm gonna give it and
in some cases you know I can't be an
expert in all these different fields but
I do know enough about programming I
think to be able to try out a language
or a framework and see whether or not I
like it and compare it to what I've I've
known and done in other languages and
that's really all it is so I like to
throw out that disclaimer so that I'm
not I'm not you know
steering somebody in the wrong direction
and and then 2017 I have a goal and I'm
not sure how well I'm gonna be able to
live up to this but it's part of the
reason why I started looking into rust
and it was that I want to focus more on
the craft of being a programmer I want
to create awesome things if that movie
shows you one thing you know la-la-land
is is that those people were after you
know genuinely great things they were
dreamers
and I've always been a dreamer and I
feel like over the last like year you
know the dreams of building awesome
things well even if it's a content-based
website that you shouldn't you know you
shouldn't sell yourself short like I've
said you know I haven't made my movies
website tonight I'm feeling sad because
I don't have my movies website anymore
I took it down and I should have just
left about because I had that
opportunity to try to expand upon it and
make it better and really just I have
always had a very you know passion I've
had a passion for movies for a long time
like I can talk to you about all kinds
of different movies from all kinds of
different genres I don't watch TV for
the most part I just watched movies I'll
watch the occasional TV show on like a
Netflix or something so I don't have to
deal with the commercials but I don't
watch any sort of mainstream television
I watched some sports but being in
Washington man all we have is heartache
so so the thing is is like find your
passion in programming and stick with
that you know I've spent so much time
jumping from one tool one framework to
the next instead of focusing on the
passion that it is to you know to create
things and and really the passion for
this channel is you know the ability
that I have to be able to create videos
and talk to you guys I can do a better
job at it I really could I could do
better video editing and I could bring
in probably more effects maybe even hire
people to help me and those things you
know I might have the option an
opportunity to do down the road you know
I feel like it but you know I'm a
programmer primarily not a youtuber and
I want to make sure that I'm continuing
to perfect my craft and and by doing
that it's gonna be by building things
and not superficially you know effing
with one language to the next so yes I
just barely touched upon home do I feel
like getting going down the rabbit hole
not really and I'll tell you the main
reason why is because I don't see
anything from the ohm community yet that
makes me think oh I'm missing out I
can't create brilliant works of art and
something else you know something you
know if I want to create maybe people
are trying to tell me that jQuery is
dead I mean there's no there's no way
jQuery is that I don't know how many
crud applications I
seen over the last really year I would
say where I'm downloading one point five
mega byte of minified uglify javascript
in order to basically read a typical
credit application or a content-based
application and you know what is the
point of that like they used all these
tools and everything but the end product
wasn't really anyway it's it's actually
way inferior to what we have so so let
me give you an example is it better to
have jQuery and use the built-in Ajax
function that's that's in the jQuery
library in order to make an AJAX call
and by my data whatever or do I need to
go ahead and you know bring in the whole
ecosystem where I'm gonna have web pack
and I know this quite well guys I
do JavaScript all day long so am I going
to bring in web pack to install Babel
and then install you know Babel core
Babel CLI Babel you know the Babel is a
react yeah I don't remember name is all
the libraries but there's like ten of
them and then once I have that you know
if I want to do I may bring in babel
polyfills so once i have that i'm gonna
go ahead and bring in react and then now
i'm using react i probably want to bring
in react maybe Redux you know for state
management so bring in redux and if I'm
gonna do that I need to bring in react
Redux and then I might as well do you
know the front client-side client-side
routing so let's go ahead and bring in
react router and then since reason redox
in order for that to play nicely we
might as well bring in the project react
router redux and and then we finally got
some decent stuff going but now we're
not using jQuery to make Ajax hull so
it's not like we want to go back to that
the whole way the old old-school way of
doing it so now we're gonna go ahead and
bring in bluebird or something like that
in order to be able to make our ajax
call and do some and use like the
promise type syntax and you know it's
just it's insane so by the time you get
you know this this humongous ass
javascript file that has all these
different libraries which by the way of
all kinds of dependencies on their own
you have this big minified thing so
instead of actually having just jquery
where you kind of need to do it
the Dom manipulation that works in older
browsers you know this you know
humongous thing and and and and here's
an in the real the real question is are
we building works of art with that
connect that data with these libraries
and things like that
I think the creators of the libraries
had problems to solve and that's why
they created the libraries and I think
that those are works of art they are
works of art on their own but you know
just because they did a great job
building a project that was meeting some
sort of need that they had doesn't mean
that we all need to jump on the same
band we're gonna make it I think you
know we need to make libraries better
instead of making so many of them and I
think that we need to focus on building
stuff so if movies is your passion and
you're a developer why don't why not
build a new type of movie site why not
build new movie editing software you
know what I mean like why not why not
focus on a different things I mean there
could be different algorithms you could
use a system's level language like rust
that's built for concurrency to to
literally crunch so much data on movies
that you might find a better rating
algorithm that's that's useful to
somebody I mean there's you know that's
just one particular area there's just
there's so many things that we can build
in life that makes life better what I
mean what about robotics and and and
things like that so I think and for me
in 2017 that I want to build I want to
build more stuff and honestly I was
looking at robots tonight trying to
maybe get into some basic robotics maybe
the Raspberry Pi I've said that in the
past but I just want to kind of do
interesting things and and and
superficially trying out tools beyond
giving my opinion for this this channel
because I'm gonna give my opinion on
these tools and things like that
ultimately though I'm gonna focus on
building stuff and it might be content
related sites and and I shouldn't act
like I've never built anything because I
have like last year it's already 2017
which is crazy but you know towards mid
of last year I built hipster code and
believe it or not this gets a few
thousand people a week or so so you know
that's something I'm kind of proud of
and it's something that like I had you
know social logins and stuff like that
you know I had to figure out all this
stuff so
is my fray and the HTTP and handling
credit card payments and building PDFs
on the fly things like that so there's
quite a bit of work that I feel like I
put into that that that particular
project but I also created a base IGS
which is something that I went out and I
kind of did the hipster trendy type of
thing of building my own project and
it's a node.js framework and you know
just like so many other people I did the
same damn thing and really now I don't
really have the time to maintain it or
anything like that but I know how to use
it and the benefit of something like
this is that we don't always have to use
Express when we're using node we could
use whatever we want we could create our
own work of art in this particular case
you can make you can criticize or
whatever else I basically had an idea I
worked on it for a couple of hours a few
months ago and I was able to build like
what I consider to be a web application
so I mean it's using node and as a
template engine and everything in it and
they're like like if I were going to
build a Content site I might build it in
this just simply to say you know what
because I built a whole stack but I want
to build things as what I'm saying I
want to I want to be one of the ones
that are actually building things
instead of just watching all these tools
get built around me and then feeling
like I have some sort of obligation to
try them all in order to keep up with
everybody else I don't think it actually
makes you a better developer I think in
actual you know I find you find your
niche or niche and you know find that
passion don't give up on the dream and
just start working on things and
with everybody else thinks so that's my
thoughts tonight guys all right man make
sure you check out the movie and also
check out my sponsor dev Mountain coding
boot camp they have links in the
description tab below so Deb mountain is
a twelve and sixteen week coding boot
camp that's based out of Provo Utah they
also have on-site locations in Dallas
Texas they have stellar reviews and
their goal is to actually focus on the
technologies of the here and now and get
your foot in the door as of the
developer into some sort of software
shop they deal with things like UI also
back in stuff whether it's node and in
front-end engineering really full stack
engineering with react and angular so if
you guys are looking for some
credentials you may want to check them
out and the like like I said the the
link is in the description tab below and
let me know if you guys have any
questions have a good night
take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
