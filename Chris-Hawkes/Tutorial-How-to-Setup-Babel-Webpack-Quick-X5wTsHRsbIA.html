pain in the butts about being a
developer these days is the JavaScript
fatigue everything changes so quick I've
done videos about six months ago on how
to give web pack and babble and
everything working together and it's
already out of date like it's already
out of date in just six months but at
the time in this video right now right
here and right now things are a little
bit easier than they used to be now
nothing's easy like I said just because
of the JavaScript fatigue there's
somebody there's so much documentation
that's outdated to watch this video
though from right now hopefully for the
next six months or more this will be the
best way to go about getting web pack
and Babel working together and why do
you even want to do that Babel allows
you to write modern JavaScript that can
be compiled down to earlier versions of
JavaScript in order for you to be able
to write the here and now and have it
work on all the browsers web pack is
used that you can actually distribute
your entire JavaScript application and a
bunch of different modules and
everything and then have them being
imported and used as you need them that
allows you to have you know JavaScript
files all over the place they're
handling specific pieces of
functionality so it allows like large
development teams and everything in
order it just brings a lot of clarity to
a very complicated project so modern
JavaScript applications are written and
then the modules are all over the place
it's not just one jQuery you jumbled
library or anything like that
so what that brings all that in for us
so let's go ahead and get started here I
have Visual Studio code you can use any
editor you want I have this s6 folder
I'm going to say reveal and Explorer and
inside my es6 folder this is the
tutorial that we're using someone to say
CMD any time you're creating a new
JavaScript project these days you're
going to use NPM and you're going to say
Amit and that's short for initialization
I'm just going to call my project es6
that's fine I will say babble and web
pack tutorial from the greatest
and I say that jokingly alright so and
I'll say MIT you guys are free to copy
this code I don't care about that
package JSON is now created for so if we
open up the folder where a project is
located you can see in package JSON you
can see that we have our config file so
that's great now what we want to do is
going to install a few things and what
we want to do is use the - - save
command so that the dependencies that
we're about to install are going to be
added to our JSON file that we just
created right here so those are four
things we need in order for all this
stuff to work and it seems like a lot of
yes it is but we need four things guinea
fowl odor terrific battle our space we
need battle preset env let me need Babel
core and then we need webpack at the
time of this video web pack 3.1 is out
already so this is going to reach across
the web it's going to install those four
dependencies it's also going to add them
to the package.json file and the main
reason why you want that is because if
you guys take this project and you move
it to another computer this package JSON
now has a tracking of the dependencies
that it needs for your project to run so
all you have to do is say npm install
and it's going to install all the
dependencies your project needs and it's
not going to install the wrong version
which causes your code to break and
things like that it's going to install
these specific versions so that's why we
do that all right so now that we've done
that and all this stuff is installed we
need to go to our project so let's go to
the editor again and I'm going to create
a web pack config file because we need
to tell web pack to use Fabul to compile
our code so restate web pack config is
make sure it's spelled just like that
web pack config is now this is going to
use the module exports which is if you
know anything about node that's how we
actually export modules and node and
just need to have an equal sign as well
all right and now it's going to export a
JavaScript object and this object is the
configuration that with
I need so the first thing it needs to
know is where is the entry point so
we're going to say apt yes that's going
to be the entry point now we haven't
created that yet but we're going to do
that in just a moment
next we're going to say when you take
that entry point we want you to output
to this location so we're going to say
our name which means the directory name
from where this config is located and
then we're going to say file name equals
then we're just going to call it bundle
J s all right so this tells webpack hey
I want you to take out digest and turn
it into bundle Jam next we're going to
say watch equals true this allows us
when we run the webpack command to
continue listening for changes to the
app j s and continue changing it over to
the bundle j s every time we change app
j s alright next we're going to say
module and this part is really confusing
and then by the way none of this stuff
it can make any sense to you but luckily
you don't really need to worry about
right now but we're going to say module
is an object it has a loaders property
which is an array and the array is an
array of objects and the object the
first one we need to worry about is the
loader and we're going to say use babel
loader which we just installed earlier
next we want to say query and this is
even more difficult this is also an
object and it takes any argument called
presets which is an array of arguments
that you use to actually compile your
code so we're going to say babel preset
P&amp;amp;V and that's another dependency that
we just installed with one of those four
dependencies to get everything running
it was babel core got a loader babel
preset environment and webpack alright
so now that we have this config in place
I want to go ahead and create the
starting point of the app Gaggia so
we're going to create that file app is
now here I'm going to use some some
newer versions of JavaScript that were
going to want compile to older versions
so we're going to say constants which is
a new constant keyword in JavaScript and
we'll just say test equals I'm going to
use the arrow syntax to just do a simple
hello world all right so now this code
is using two new things in es6 there's
the constants as well as the tests now
what's interesting is the bundle already
got created because I was running this
and I probably shouldn't have been this
is from previous example you're only see
alright so the reason why the bundle got
created is because I was running the
watch and that's interesting so anyway
let's go ahead and delete that and
pretend that didn't happen all right
don't even worry about Hannah stars I
just said all right so now one of the
things that we need to do in order for
this to work is in package.json we need
to add an argument here because we're
going to be running this argument called
web pack and web pack all it has to do
is run web pack and by doing it this way
what we're doing is we're saying hey use
webpack that is locally installed and
you can see in the node modules here if
we scroll all the way down to the W's
we're going to have web pack installed
here and this is all the dependencies
that got installed from those four
projects that we need all that stuff is
required in order for those four
projects that we installed to work and
they all go inside the node modules so
by adding this web pack argument to our
scripts we can now use NPM from the
command line and say NPM run web pack
and just to reiterate this web pack is
name right here is coming from here this
is here and at all it's saying it's a
use web pack but by default this guy
will look locally in the node modules
folder before looking anywhere else for
the web pack so it's going to find it in
our local node modules folder because we
have it installed I know that's
confusing and the best way is just if
it's too confusing just gloss over right
now the more you understand about node
and web pack and modern JavaScript
development you'll and it will start to
click more and more but for right now
don't worry about it you don't have to
truly understand that just kind of
follow along so the NPM run web pack so
now when we do that what it's going to
do is going to take the app digest file
and it's going to output the bundle
digest so now if we look over at our
project you can see bundle JS was
created all this stuff was created for
us with web pack
and then down here at the bottom you can
see that it's using your strict and it
took our code and it turned it into a
different version you can see that it's
now the older-style function there is no
arrow function there and some it's using
the bar instead of the constants and
everything so it took this modern
JavaScript and it turned it into this so
if we ended up adding something to our
app here let's go ahead and uh and watch
this real quick so you can see that this
has been bundled one time so if we went
ahead and I'm going to have to have both
of these open hand
alright so watch what happens if we go
ahead and we add something else with a
constant test 2 equals alert this mode
compile all right and then also you can
see so because I saved it and went ahead
and built a new one so that's what the
watch is doing also I want to go ahead
and just con I want to call tests so
that way you can see now it's called net
and it bundled it for the third time now
so let's go ahead just create an index
file real quick just at a railer HTML so
that we can pull in our javascript
bundle and i'm going to do this simple
HTML so
alright there's our HTML inside the head
what I want to do is bring in the bundle
that's not going to work alright so I
can say script source equals and then
point to the bundles at JS file close
all my scripts so now what I'm doing is
I'm loading this bundle JS file that we
just we just created into an index on
HTML so if I go into the folder I can
double click on my index file open it in
the browser you can see we get the
console logs of hello world and we only
get to one hello world because we only
fired the first function which is here
so if we want them to do both commands
we could say test to save it it's still
going to listen for the changes over
here to see now forth to build was done
and if I just simply refresh it we get
hello world and this mode compiled so
