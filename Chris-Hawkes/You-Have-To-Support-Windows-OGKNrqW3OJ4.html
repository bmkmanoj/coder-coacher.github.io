video I'm just going to be shooting the
 with you guys a little bit but I
want to just go over a few things with
you real quick number one so as you guys
know I was working on my unity game and
everything and I mondal you know that um
what I think is really awesome Visual
Studio code has the ability to be able
to step through and hit breakpoints and
everything from within your code so
that's it's pretty sweet so if you guys
remember one to get into unity
development of dot visual studio was too
difficult or whatever but there are now
packages that you can use with Visual
Studio code to actually put breakpoints
in your code and hit the breakpoints and
everything should had a better
demonstration but I don't unfortunately
maybe I can get one here in just a
second so number two what's interesting
that I find with a lot of these open
source projects and a lot of you know
people probably why does this happen you
look at something like Tenzer flow which
was a project that was started by google
i believe and at least funded by google
and now it was released as open source
in 2015 but it's all about machine
learning and you use Python in order to
to interact with it so it's a very
sophisticated library a lot of math a
lot of notice computation basically so
I'm not an expert on it I can't even
pretend to be but you guys could check
this out you're interested but I thought
it was it was funny because i was
looking at this last sentence and it's
like the tensorflow community has
created amazing things with tensorflow
please see the resources section of
tensorflow and dot org so you're like oh
hey I'm going to check that out see
what's being built with it and boom you
get a 404 error so no no no doubt knock
against the community but it's just
funny like these open source projects
man they're maintained by volunteers
stuff changes all the time like how
often have you gone to like Google or
paypal or some other major site and like
the documentation on how to actually use
their site is out of date granted google
is not as bad as some of the other
places but it's just it's amazing how
often or really how how easy it is for
things to go unnoticed you know things
that that could really affect the
overall
you know the overall project really
because that you know was looking at
enterprise not like I was going to
really do anything with it tonight but I
just want to look into it a little bit
and and you know when one of the links
is down now I could probably go to the
website and then you know search for the
community and things like that if I
wanted to but I don't so I'm not going
through at this point another thing i
was looking at tonight is the crystal
programming language so a lot of you
guys have actually recommended this to
me and i was going to check it out
tonight and actually download and
install it so crystal is like a ruby
type of syntax apparently they you know
they they want to create the new ruby
like feel but be as fast as a C
programming language so it's written in
a way with concurrency and mine very
similar to like rust or go they cite
benchmarks that say that at crystals
faster than go but you know take all
those benchmarks with a grain of salt
we've talked about that before it always
like goes into like a type system it's
like oh wow programming language has a
type system so you know none of this
stuff is like you know like all that i
would say overly interesting but i still
want to check it out and just see what
it's all about but here's the problem
the problem is is that it's not
supported on windows and a lot of you
guys are probably whities and windows a
lot of people use windows in fact
according to the 2017 Stack Overflow
survey forty-one percent of all
developers develop on a Windows machine
so forty-one percent next closest was
Linux that like 30-something percenter
thirty one percent or something like
that there was a low 30 something
percent so when you're releasing a
product I mean a lot of like you know
windows usually goes falls by the
wayside and people don't you bother
supporting it and I can understand cuz
working on windows can be a real pain in
the ass but the fact that matter is like
you're you're automatically excluding
forty-one percent of the market if your
stuff doesn't work on windows so I guess
I could set up a vm or something like
that but you know like once again
tonight I've been working I don't feel
like it man this guy who develops on a
Windows machine who's developed in
Python and JavaScript in c-sharp and a
ton of other line
was just I don't feel like doing all
that tonight so you know once again not
going to do it I could do it but I'm not
going to do it and I think that that is
the way with a lot of programmers you
come home like I mean you're not trying
to like jump through it the bunch of
damn hoops to try out a language it's
just right so until that gets resolved
it's really just not going anywhere in
my opinion and you're probably well
Chris you lazy bastard won't you
contribute to the crystal programming
language but I just rather not like I
mean I have better things to do tonight
and contribute to the crystal language
but guys just well you know this this
video is sponsored by sight one two
three so if you're looking to develop
your portfolio you want to build a
website whether it's a blog or a
restaurant or an e-commerce platform or
e-commerce site i should say check out
side 123 they make the process very easy
it's very cheap to get set up with them
and you're going to save yourself a lot
of hassle over some of the other options
like setting up your own server your
mail server you're having to buy your
domain dns forwarding and I was not even
to mention like the JavaScript HTML CSS
and whatever sort of service sign
language you end up using another
sponsor is dev mountain coding boot camp
so if you guys are looking to get your
foot into the industry they have 12 and
16 week courses in provo utah and dallas
texas they have a sterling record as far
as getting people in the industry I know
people that have actually worked with
these guys before and the courses are
expensive a lot you guys are booked
about how expensive it is but the coding
boot camp especially reputable ones are
not going to be cheap but they do focus
on technology that they here now like
nodejs they're going to focus on a lot
of different JavaScript libraries they
react and angular so make sure you guys
check them out both of the the links are
in the description tab below for more
information thank you guys for watching
you have a good night and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
