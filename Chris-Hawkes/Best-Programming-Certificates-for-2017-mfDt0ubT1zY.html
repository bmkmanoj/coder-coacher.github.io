couple of you have reached out to me to
ask me what are relevant serve
certifications or where should you get
certified in order to become a
programmer I'm just gonna give my
opinion on what I know about the subject
because I'm not an expert like I'm not a
hiring manager and the only thing I can
do is tell you you know certifications
and things like that that I've heard of
and offer my advice so that said I would
welcome any sort of feedback from the
community and hopefully somebody that
actually knows what they're talking
about that actually is in the trenches
and they're getting hired or they're
hiring people with these certifications
I will tell you that I have spoken to a
manager at Raytheon who was stating that
they you know we're very very interested
in and some of the AWS certifications as
well as the cotan of the company Capital
One they were also very interested in
and certifications as well so if I could
take a moment just to say that I think
certifications are going to be become
much more important than they have in
the past on technology and it's always
changed it's such a rapid clip but we
obviously know that there are developers
out there that can program just as well
as others that have degrees so if you
have a degree or you don't it doesn't
necessarily mean that you're a you're a
great programmer but having
certifications it does somewhat you know
solidify the fact that you do know you
know a little bit about the subject you
know that specific focused subject so
that said I think that you know some of
the things that I talk about in this
video it's you know it's interesting and
I think this you know this dynamic is
changing and we don't really know where
the mark is and then I'm gonna get into
it just a few things you know that
couldn't end up you know changing the
way that this market works but we
obviously know from the past that the
programmers and programming companies
that they focus a lot on on college
degrees but not every company does and I
would continue to I would think that we
would continue to see that in the
industry though byah byah Marge I think
you're gonna have a much easier time
with a degree than without one but
certifications would certainly help so
the most most popular one that I
like I said is AWS certification because
so many companies are using Amazon's AWS
on even some of the largest companies
that you wouldn't expect are backing up
their data on AWS clouds and stacks and
to be honest I've been working with
lenôtre for quite some time but if I
didn't I would probably pay the premium
for AWS just because it's it is so it's
such a popular option
so being AWS certified is is our
arguably the most sought-after
certification that I know of on this
list of products that I'm gonna mention
and another thing too is I want to also
say that I don't have every product out
there in fact this video would probably
be boring as how and very long if I
mentioned every single certification
that was out there so definitely AWS
certification is one of the top ones
that I know about now
the M CSD certification that microsoft
offers that is something that is also
highly sought after and the dotnet
ecosystem so if you're going to be
developing and you know iis or any sort
of azure there there's all kinds of
certifications that you can learn about
the mcs d though is definitely the most
popular option that I know of on that
Microsoft has at the moment so being
certified in that I think would most
certainly give you you'd get your foot
into the door and a lot of Microsoft
shops so you know one of the other AWS
or MSM CSD those are the two most
important ones that I can you know drill
down I think no the the next couple that
are really the next one I'm going to
mention is the CISSP certification or
sort of certification if I could say
that right this has been around for
quite a long time and it deals with
network security so it's actually a very
important thing for a lot of engineers
that need to be up to date with it with
with with security issues and we've
talked about you know all the hacking
and the internet of things and how like
I feel like it's not going to be able to
take off without actually getting some
of this hacking under control but you
know this is an industry that is going
to constantly be evolving and having
certifications and some of the latest
ones and
network security is gonna be extremely
important so one of the things I did
when I mention is that the these cysts
or cysts certification that I'm
mentioning right now there are multiple
different ones some there's some newer
ones out there so I just mentioned one
of the most popular - that I know of but
I know that there are additional ones
out there that focus on different areas
some focusing more on data and some
focus on networking and things like that
the the question was raised more towards
of programming into the spectrum and not
like network engineers or network what I
call like cable jockeys um or not really
I call him that but I've heard them
called cable jockeys but you know if
you're running networks and routers and
things like that there's gonna be others
you know Cisco certification programs
you're gonna want to look into that I
didn't mention here but this is more for
the programming side of things so you'll
continue to see a lot of network and
we're in data and engineering
certifications related to cybersecurity
and it's definitely in high demand
alright so one of the high demand ones
is this certified in governance of
enterprise IT so this is a I've read one
of the highest paid certifications and
the website looks like by the way
but this website is not necessarily
related to this specific certification
it's just a an organization that deals
with certifications but they if you get
certified it's something like this
there's no question about to find a job
somewhere I'm not sure if there's gonna
be any sort of prerequisites and I'm not
even a hundred percent sure whether or
not this just applies to you know
government in government type positions
but from what I've read online that this
is the most highest paying certification
on average for companies that are
looking for this certification you know
by their average salary is much higher
than other other certifications that
I've already mentioned although there's
probably not as many opportunities you
know because it's a relatively
I would say it's a not uncommon but it's
not as widely known or used as I would
say AWS or Microsoft certification now a
couple of other things that spring up a
lot of a lot of websites out there doing
the certifications and things like that
for courses like you
Linda calm and Pluralsight and a lot of
these different things that you can do
to get certified even SkillSoft has some
stuff but I don't I would I guess I
would be I would be wary of spending too
much time in those programs if you truly
want to get your foot in the door and
make sure you're getting your money's
worth out of some of this stuff because
some of these certifications can cost
four and five hundred dollars and you
have to pass them too and they're not
going to be easy so you know be wary of
I think the easy certifications and
things like that they don't really offer
a whole lot and time will tell whether
or not you know they're there they're
offering lives up to it so it's tough so
if something's only been around for a
year or two years or even three or four
it's probably not having enough time to
get its foot into the door of the
industry to make a name for itself so
it's it's difficult to say you know how
well these things will pan out but like
Google developer certification so Google
starts its own cloud cloud options and
things like that so you know being a
Google developer certify is always a big
deal so you can check out more and I
have links for all these certifications
in the description below but and once
again these are all just you know my own
personal thoughts Salesforce so a lot of
companies are using Salesforce for a lot
of their their business and development
needs so if you have a company that's
using Salesforce then you're going to
you're going to want to be Salesforce
certified it's gonna help you be able to
land that that Salesforce job so if this
is something that you know I would say
if it's a company that you're interested
in and you feel like you have a shot at
that company by getting certified and
you know through Salesforce University
here then I think that that is an option
worth mentioning and I also want to
mention that there are many different
products out there similar to Salesforce
which is a product a
software-as-a-service product there are
many of those products out there that
will offer their own certifications like
even analytics
software you know adobe based software
Google you know for their products like
Google Analytics I mean you can get
certified in some of these different
these products and you know I guess I
would be you know I would be cautious on
how many you try to go after because you
know these certifications can be a bitch
to obtain but I would I would focus on
some of the more popular ones first but
you know definitely if you feel like you
can knock out a certification a weekend
for a job that you applied to that I
think it would it would definitely help
now there's also database certification
so Oracle is one of the database leaders
and really Larry Ellison is one of the
reasons why he's one of the richest
people in the entire world you know it's
because of his db2 database systems and
you know being being oral oracle
certified there are definitely a lot of
different Oracle certifications out
there Oracle is the owner of Java Java
language and you know they obviously
have solutions there but there's there's
a the the hell was I gonna call I forget
the name of their their database system
that's someone that's so popular either
way go check out Worple university of
you if you're looking for database
certifications you're probably not gonna
get anything better better than that so
definitely check that out now and one of
the things that I was mentioning that
that uh you know is it's gonna it's
something that's relatively new and like
I said it's a little bit difficult to
gauge the market on it I mean that is a
I'm mentioning a coding bootcamp which
is my sponsor the sponsor of this video
Jeff mountain coding boot camp from
Provo Utah they have 12 and 16 week
courses that actually focus on modern UI
technology modern front-end technology
and in really full server-side
technology when it comes to no js' but a
lot of different a lot of different you
know booting coding boot camps are
popping up that that have this entire
you know 12 week 16 week mentality of
trying to just literally teach the
latest skills that are that are in
demand like right now so those skills
are changing they're they're being
switched out these certifications that
you end up getting
from your bootcamp there their aim to
get your foot in the door so once again
I would be wary of you know different
boot camps out there now Deb mountain
you know they have you know they've been
around the block for a long time they
know they have quite a bit of resources
behind them including their parent
company I believe but with a wig
Mountain just make sure you're doing
your your proper review and analysis of
the different boot camps that are out
there because they are springing up all
over the place but you can see in Deb
mountain and if you look on their their
reviews you know from around the
community even on Quora and things like
that they're relatively highly rated so
you can see that they're dealing with
react and jQuery and angularjs and
nodejs which is like really the common
stuff and also get and github most web
sites and are really what web shops are
using git so they're focusing on those
things and trying to make sure that
people have a major understanding of
that so I've talked to hiring managers
at the deal with coding boot camps and
you know they say coding boot camps are
a relatively new thing you know having
some programming background where the
coding boot camp is is very sought-after
but this one hiring manager I talked to
he said he's a little skeptical of boot
camps without some of the backend
technology our back-end programming
expertise but you know basically a
programmer that might have been and you
know Java for the longest time who gets
you know some sort of developer boot
camp to learn nodejs and JavaScript like
he would obviously feel a little more
comfortable with that but I think that
goes without saying you know the the
boot camps they're certainly popular
springing up all over the place or in
Canada United States and time will will
truly tell you know how well the
industry accepts them but I think that I
would be willing to bet that they're
gonna continue to grow in popularity
now another certification is like
website certification so you can go to
Coursera and I mean they have courses on
Python Big Data all this different stuff
problem is their certifications are not
free so even though they you know they
offer the course and the lectures for
free they're not really catered to
specifically towards you so they're not
going to be nearly as one-on-one as a
bootcamp or anything like that but you
do get to you know print off your
certification hour
seeing people update their LinkedIn
profiles and stuff like that whether
they're Coursera sort of certificates
and in some ways it can be a little bit
misleading because you see a certificate
with Yale you think oh they understood
went to Yale you know but the fact that
matter is is having a course that's
offered by Yale on Coursera doesn't mean
that you went to Yale or that you have a
yield based education so in some ways
you know be cautious of that just
because you have your name on a Yale
certificate doesn't mean you went to
Yale so those are really my thoughts on
the subject and I'm like once again I'm
welcoming you guys as feedback on this
because I'd like to know where you guys
stand and what you've seen in the
industry in the market as well and again
I didn't want to get too much into like
network security systems or A+
certifications and things like that that
have been around for a long time there's
so many certificates in this in this
video would be an hour long at the very
least but I can talk more about this in
the future if you guys are interested
but these are just once again my
thoughts so let me know we think and
make sure you subscribe Oh to the video
and take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
