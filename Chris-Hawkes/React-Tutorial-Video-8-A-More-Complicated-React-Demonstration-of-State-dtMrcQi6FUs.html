looked at this town state let's look at
a more practical example to show like
you know some of the coolness that you
can add so let's go ahead and add
something you know we're going to do
this a little bit unusual we're going to
use the jQuery library so what we want
to do is make sure to make query is
reference before react and you can go to
jQuery and go to cloud fair cloud fair
is just a content distribution network
which is really just a server that sits
out there and and you can link to like
JavaScript and different files and stuff
that don't you know basically to make
your application quicker and more
reliable and stuff like that so we're
gonna go ahead and copy this this jQuery
from cloud fair I'm just gonna use the
minimal version and then when I go into
my HTML I'm gonna do a boat the body tag
gonna have a script tag just like we did
and the source is going to be the file
fair extension and then let's go ahead
and now reference in our component so if
we go over here I want to I want to be
so let's take a look at something so
here's a a music video from this band la
dispute which is they're pretty badass
actually that I really like them
relatively unusual for not really
considered mainstream but I just saw
them in concert and DC they're pretty
cool but here's the share button so if
we go to the embed you can see that
here's the embed code and we're gonna
just paste the embed code right inside
here and we need to change some things
possibly number one this value here
let's go ahead and remove this and I
want to say this is going to be your
string so we're going to put in this
other this curly braces so anytime we
want raw JavaScript to interface to our
JSX menus these curly braces
and here what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say Plus this start state dot
video ID I'm I don't even need to make a
note of that but here is uh so here's
the source this needs a double quote
here so we need to then have the state
video ID so we're gonna say data and
drag we'll just have a video ID and
there's gonna be no default ID at the
moment so we'll just have the video ID
be blank and let's go ahead and put a
break here I want to do just say BR
which means break or newline and we're
not going to display the data here but
here's this iframe and we'll even say if
we could wrap this in a in a ternary
actually so we're gonna say if actually
the only me to say if an attorney a
ternary is just simply going to say this
state that video ID so if it's true thee
meaning if it's true and it's not know
then we're simply going to say that or
it's going to be nothing so make sure
this : this is a ternary operator and
then jeaious actually want to use
ternary 'he's a lot and this is just
simply saying if this is not null which
it's going to be it's going to be no
because empty string is considered a
falsie statement then this it's going to
render nothing so let's go ahead and say
load video so instead of any of this
logic here we're going to say load video
now let's add an input we're going to
say video ID
and then we'll put enter a video ID so
this is a more practical example of
something that you can do and react so
here's this input ID which is just a
text input let's go ahead and reload our
page here to see what's going on all
right so here's this enter a video ID
and if I enter the video let's go back
to the video this video here I'm going
to copy the YouTube ID and if I paste it
in here I say load video then nothing
happened you're like well why didn't
anything happen well number one we
didn't do anything in handle click so
when handle click is fired we're now
going to use jQuery where we reference
before and we're going to say video ID
and we're gonna say dot actually you
know what we're gonna get a variable
name
I say variable video equals video ID dot
Val so it's getting the value of
whatever we put inside the input and
then we're going to go ahead and say
this set state and it's a function so we
pass into the video object or the new
state objects when we say video ID
equals and we're gonna say the value
equals video
so now let's go ahead go ahead and go
back to our page and if we enter the
video ID there it is and we say load
video looks like we get an error message
on the frame border but don't worry
about that we don't don't worry about it
but now we can actually watch it from
so now you may be wondering if you're
like well okay so I want to get the
video at a specific point all right so
how do we add that functionality because
maybe so basically what if I wanted to
get to a particular port portion of the
video where I think it's really cool so
let's see
all right so say it's about that point
right
maybe so we could just say you know what
I'm gonna copy the video url at that
time so what I can do is I can paste
this inside of here
and you can see all it does is adds a
query string parameter of time equals
144 so what I could do then and that's
obviously a hundred and forty-four
seconds into the song I could simply say
let's add a new I'm gonna add a break
point actually after this a break and
then we're gonna add enter start time
and then this is a new video will say
start time and then we'll do another br
here so now we have this start time this
optional start time and basically it
wouldn't hurt to just simply say you
know what let's add the query string on
top of this and we can say question mark
T equals Plus this state dot start time
all right so now we have that and
basically I'm wondering what's going to
happen if we if we don't have a value
let me see if any functionality changes
because if we have a zero start time by
default let me go back to the video so
if I go back to the video copy this join
and I do this and I don't add a start
time and we load video let's make sure
everything works fine so it does work
all right so now what if I wanted to add
the optional start time to the video I
could then say you know what on this
click Handler I want to actually update
the start time and you could actually
save our start time equals and then the
same way using jQuery we say start time
dot Val and then we'll update the state
to start time to start time there we go
all right so now if i went ahead and i
refresh this on my page you can then
we'll add the video ID then we'll say
start at time 144 so I don't know if
this worked or not
so it didn't actually work let me see
what's going on here
so what I'm going to show you on this is
that if we look at and inspect the
element here if we look through the
content you can see that the time equals
144 was added to the video like it
should because if I were to
so apparently the this this parameter is
being added just fine but it's either
not working in the embed or it's just
jacked up so let me I'm gonna try to
copy this real quick I'm just gonna copy
the entire HTML and just I'm just trying
to figure out if we actually have a
situation with with JavaScript on the
embed or with a cam it with YouTube on
the embed or if we're actually looking
at situation where react is not updating
the iframe but I want to find out here
so we're just gonna embed this video so
yeah so basically that's a problem with
YouTube and that's something with react
cuz react was updating that dynamic
query string on there so that's probably
a conversation for
so basically if I wanted to change this
around to not work within the confines
of of YouTube because maybe there's a
way for YouTube to do video embed start
times I'm not sure but that's not really
the point of this video so let's get
over to first component and figure out
how we can actually do a start time so
we can we can simply say really we could
say this time stage start time
so if I copy this this value you can see
by doing that that allows the start time
so I can simply say instead of strain
and if that condition is false then
we'll say do nothing so what we're doing
here is we're just creating an anchor
with that start time if they add it so
let's go ahead and look at this again
right so if I go ahead and grab the
video ID and the start time you can see
that we now have this anchor tag
attached so if I click the anchor text
you could see this joints
alright you know what screw it you guys
get the point so I'm dealing with with
YouTube here it appears so the point is
though is that you can add in certain
values and you can get certain values
back and this isn't really working for
me but you guys get the gist of
manipulating state with react and why it
can be a powerful thing hopefully so
anyway guys this video is running long
