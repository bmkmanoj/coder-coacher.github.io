this comment i got from on Orion here he
says he'll me Chris Hawks I must do a
project with python that project
supposed to do translation from two
different database tables and connect
them to a form i am in a deadlock and I
need help dude this dude didn't even put
spaces or periods and and obviously it's
not even a proper senator that was a
because that was like maybe the worst
sentence of a red but anyway sorry not
trying to be a dick but it's funny guys
I get this kind of stuff all the time
man you know nobody's gonna do your
homework man like why are you asking
people to do your homework if you can't
figure it out like try to figure it out
or don't you know do something else
maybe you shouldn't have taken that
class I don't know but I will tell you
one thing nobody's going to do your
homework if you have to ask something to
do it like hell no man you got to pay me
$150 man answer that question for you
that's my going right if you guys have
questions out there you know what I'll
be reasonable hundred dollars I'll
answer your question for a hundred
dollars I'm not gonna spend more than 15
minutes on it though so like if it's a
programming question and you guys want
me after I've been working all day and
then driving in our home plus driving an
hour to work and I have my kids and my
wife and everything else I talk to you
guys on youtube and then you want me to
answer your programming question so that
you can do that for school glad to help
man hundred dollars every 15 minutes so
that's so for real if anybody wants to
maybe that kind of money which I know
you guys don't nobody's got that kind of
money look at my patreon it's a it's a
good example of that now I will say
though that it doesn't really matter
because this is a hobby and I do make
money off my hobby now which is really
cool but guys I like I go to I'm a
programmer during the day man and that's
what a lot of you guys aspire to be and
that's that's what everybody should be
trying to do it but like I don't luckily
need need to saw this kind of revenue
but if if I do end up answering and
having to work after all this other work
and all this other stuff I'm doing then
I'm going to be asking for you know some
some compensation everyone returned I'm
assuming if if you're probably going to
sleep
we can't pay a hundred dollars every 15
minutes so maybe I can make it 90 I'm
not sure all right anyway that's my
response to any of you guys asked me to
do your homework I get those things all
the time so that's that's my answer
there so guys what else am I gonna talk
about okay so there was a I was talking
to my buddy from the other day and he
was he was made to it was funny because
I love having programmer talk man and
two programmers talking to each other
this guy he's interested in doing things
on the side I'm interested in doing
things on the side we all like to create
so that's what I think really drives you
know a lot of programmers is to build
things and they're trying to see people
use your product you know in my case
like anybody that watches these videos I
think that's great i mean it's awesome
but we're having this conversation and
he was like yeah I constantly get people
that tell me you know these business
ideas and they're all like you know
they're very hot dirty another very you
know excited when they're there elevator
pitch and everything and and they never
liked have the means or understanding of
what it takes to actually develop the
idea they like they think that they're
like an idea man and then they're going
to make money on it I've talked about
this before my videos but ideas are
worthless man if you don't have some
sort of implementation plan a lot of
people like it i was i was laughing with
him I'm like yeah I've had the same
thing I've had people come up to me with
like these business ideas and stuff they
don't even know what a business plan is
like they don't know how to make money
with their idea or like it's so
far-fetched like it's just ridiculous
like I had at one time it was like an
architect guy and he was trying to get
me to write a website and he's like no
look at look at it was like for calm or
Chevy or might have been BMW lexus I
don't know it was one of those car
manufacturing companies and they have
like this superb website man where it's
like 360 panoramic views and like all
these views of inside the car it was
like perfect UX man like and from a
professional experience like I was
looking at that website I'm like this
company probably paid about six
10 million dollars for it to be produced
from the UX designers to the
photographers to the people that
understand how to actually create you
eyes in the back end like dude they
spent a ton of money they probably
produced that website over a period of
like a year and then some of the things
that like people don't really understand
like when programmers are coming home
and they have there's no how programmers
are making fifty sixty dollars an hour
many of them you know anywhere from 35
zar probably a hundred dollars an hour
that's what programmers are making and
what when they're making that kind of
money and then they come home and if
somebody wants to do their programming
you know homework problem or they have
this great idea that's going to be like
a tremendous amount of work and we take
an entire programming team you know
three years to complete but that's their
idea or we take a hundred million
dollars in capital to be able to spread
the word enough to for anybody to even
use the product like how do you how do
you how do you you know convey that like
you're always like for me and I've had
this happen a couple times I'm like oh
that's a good idea you know I think
that's a good and all like you know but
i would i would consider this so i kind
of slide into that but even though in
the back of my mind I'm thinking it's
just like your office space maybe if you
guys have ever seen office space for
he's like it's the jump to conclusions
mat he's like you jump to conclusions
like it's like a you know like a mat and
then the wonders like that's the worst
idea I've ever heard in my life like
that's honestly what I feel like saying
to some people like that is the worst
idea I've ever heard of my life
sometimes their unique ideas but in most
cases like you know people don't
consider the actual capital that is like
that is required to actually get a major
idea off the ground I one time I had
somebody tell me oh well you can make a
website where all the doctors login to
the website and people could take their
own temperatures and things like that
and then send them to the doctor so that
way all that that stuff that preliminary
stuff doesn't have to be done and it's
like immediately like it's jumping out
of my mind like dude yeah that would be
great in a perfect world but then you
know the actual liabilities you know
surrounding something like that you know
just like taking somebody's advise you
know
work for oh yeah I took my temperature
of the 98 points up you know I mean like
no doctors going to do that number one
number two they get paid to do that kind
of stuff so they want to do it
themselves because they're going to get
paid you know for every visit and things
and insurance companies have certain
rules and regulations that say hey if
we're going to pay this set amount of
money you have to do these set amount of
things and like it's all just you know
it's this big game dude it's this game
that's been going on for a long time
nobody wants to change that game why do
medical providers not have electronic
documents because it's an outdated game
man why do college books have to have 16
editions of accounting one like why
every semester almost are we getting a
new accounting book for a particular
college why I'll tell you why bunnyman
everybody wants money including myself
and if I'm going to answer your
questions for your homework 115 Don I'm
sorry hundred dollars every 15 minutes
is what I'm looking for maybe I'll do 90
and if it only takes me 15 minutes maybe
i'll do 80 but seriously beyond that all
right i'm starting to negotiate against
myself man because i know it's
ridiculous nobody's going to pay that
kind of money but that's the thing
people don't respect of programmers time
and that is one of the most difficult
things for dealing with people in this
industry because it's one of the reasons
why I don't do freelance work for people
I've actually turned down a website
where I could have made twelve thousand
dollars on website why because I got
 on a twenty-five-thousand-dollar
website for an agricultural company in
Washington DC who never paid me and that
was a bad deal man the whole thing was a
bad deal up and down but I didn't get
paid I got through why because the
customer doesn't know what they want
nobody respects to programmers time and
you know they're like in it's because of
your stupid us websites like wix com to
say I got a website for free at WIC so I
went to sell into it I got a website for
free verizon gave me a web site for free
for signing up for fios business and
stuff like that but people don't
understand those websites are basic
you're you're you're giving all your
rights away to the actual company that
holds on to your domain that holds on to
your actual product like good rethink
that idea that's a bad idea you should
own your own data you should own your
own domain and you should pay developers
who know what they're doing the right
amount of money too
do it correctly and if you don't want to
do that then you need to learn yourself
and that's that's basically to answer I
mean so how do you break it to people
that their ideas suck man most people's
ideas stock dude business ideas like
they are a dime a dozen and if it
doesn't come with like an actual means
of one time it comes to mind Steve
Wozniak created the first half in one
computer Steve Jobs you know through
their connection they were friends and
they were in the cenotes I guess our
West Coast Silicon Valley on over the
hell they were but at one point during
this early venture after after wozniacka
created the apple one Steve Jobs had
come over to Wozniak's house or at
parents house and his dad was in the
living room and and Jobs was talking
about fifty percent of the company that
he was going to create with Wozniak and
was me I did all the work when it came
to creating this computer he was the
brains behind the operation and was
gackt dad told Steve Jobs he said you
didn't do and he's like my son did
all the work you're not getting fifty
percent of the company so the father was
negotiating for the Sun it was a you
know a young man at time probably what
18 19 maybe 20 21 something like that
he's a young guy and Steve Jobs started
crying and basically told Wozniak that
if he couldn't have fifty percent and
then he could have a hundred percent so
basically he was going to walk away from
the deal although he didn't really do
anything but obviously as you know
history has shown that you know being a
good marketer and and and things like
that ken can lead to a lot of success
and if you look at somebody like Steve
Jobs like he was kicked out of his own
company it wasn't until a lot later that
he ended up coming back into Apple you
know creating me the ipod or really you
know being the marketer and the the idea
man behind that but you're talking about
a guy who had already like you know
basically found it pixar animation
studios and had success through apple
and was famous amongst developers all
the way back to the 70s and 80s and
things like that being an idea man when
you're in that kind of position of power
yeah that's great too but otherwise if
you have an idea you better learn how to
implement that
d on your own otherwise somebody else
can just take it because what stop and
somebody like me from being like you
know what that's a good idea of a why
the hell do I need you if you're not
going to do anything you're not to
provide any marketing any venture
capital funding if you don't even have a
marketing arm like I've joked on this
channel it's like dude at least I have
like you know like 60 61 61 thousand
people are subscribed to me right now
and that's worth five percent of a
company right anybody have any companies
out there they want to give you five
percent oh no it's not even that even
that is not worth that much money it's
really not a knob so I don't know man
that that is really my am I saying
however one time when I was watching
John Thomas video and he was talking
about how if you have a truly unique
unique idea you might be on a story
nearly off the acid or something like
that and at the time I did criticize him
for saying that and me and John you know
we're friends and I and we talked in
case but in a way like he was coming
from somebody who is a very you know
active and smart business person I mean
he made a lot of money on pluralsight he
took that money he was able to invest it
in real estate he was able to write
books and things like that he doesn't
even have to be a developer anymore so
like if you have that kind of drive like
if even somebody like him was like you
know what I have an idea and I'm going
to try to implement this idea you know
that's the kind of person you want to
align yourself with if they don't have
the necessary like up-to-date technology
skills or whatever be able do this or
that like you at least have that other
area that you need somebody to have and
for that architect guy that I was
talking about one of the best things
about him was his passion like he loves
Steve Jobs unfortunately he compared
himself to him to him too many times but
you know he was he would have been a
great spokesman marketing guru for the
company but the problem is is that you
have a certain amount of hours in the
day man and if you're not making money
and the times that you that you know
that you're at home and working on some
sort of product man like
it's difficult to stay motivated and and
I'm not trying to bust your balls for
asking me to help you do your homework
man I understand I understand where
you're coming from but I don't think you
understand where people like me are
coming from either so in it and if you
do then clearly you're just nevermind so
that's all I got guys thank you for
watching you have a good day buddy hey
