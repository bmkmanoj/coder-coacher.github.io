this video we've been looking at
functions and we looked at classes and
and actually so class thing and all this
stuff and I want to just swing back
round two functions to give one more
detail of something that you will see
occasionally and we're going to get rid
of this and we're going to have a simple
function that has let's just call this
print no but I'm going to swing back to
the class actually so from within this
this employee class let's pretend we
have to pass in all these values but
we're passing in an employee number here
but what happens if we don't have the
employee ID like what if we this is
where we pass an employee ID right here
well you know what that's too confusing
I'm going to put it into its own file
we're going to say defined optional
parameter and what is a parameter we've
already seen guys the parameter is
simply the argument that you pass to
your function so this is will say first
parameter I'm going to try to make this
as simple as possible I don't need to
complicate things I'm going to say print
first parameter and we'll even say plus
eight so we're going to do a math
operation so this is a math operation
because you can't this is a number so
we're going to pass in a parameter and
it's going to print eight so let's call
it we're going to say optional parameter
and we'll pass in eight so that way we
can get 16 so when we run this I'm go to
my debugger and we're going to run this
and we're going to get 16 now what
happens though is if I try to see
that's what if I pass in nothing
optional parameter is missing missing a
positional argument first parameter
saying because it's this isn't optional
parameter is the name of the function
which is very misleading for this error
message because it's saying hey you made
first parameter required so how do I say
you know what I want this function to
run even if first parameter isn't passed
in you would actually simply say equal
and I would say zero or you could say
you know if you wanted this to be eight
by default or ten by default but the
point is is that I don't have to pass in
a value for first parameter because it's
automatically going to equal zero if I
don't pass something in so let's let's
take a look here if I now run play this
isn't going to throw an error in first
parameter when I highlight over you can
see the zero showing up right there
right it right there first parameter
gets assigned a value from within the
function definition itself so it has a
default value and that way when I say
print you know plus 8 so 8 plus 0 is 8
so there's this default value now I
don't have to worry about checking
something in well now you're going to be
like well you know won't be 0 all the
time no it won't if I pass in a number
now to this default thing first
parameter is not going to equal 0
because equals 0 by default but then I
passed in a parameter that overrode its
value and now when we highlight over
first remember you can see it's 8 so we
get 16 to the console anyway guys that
is called the default argument in Python
and a lot of times you want some sort of
default value with the option of
overriding so that way your function
still operates if somebody doesn't pass
in a parameter to your function all
right guys thanks for watching have a
good day bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
wanna take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding bootcamp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this what
we
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp in the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
