a quick heads up number one thank you
for helping me get to 26,000 subscribers
it's really crazy because it wasn't
until January till I get my 10,000 so
you can see just since January of this
year that I've grown by another sixteen
thousand so I've am on my way to you
know controlling that number hopefully
by the end of the year but anyway the
the changes I want to make is just to
let you guys know that I am going to be
posting videos hopefully every single
day and I'm going to start doing it on a
schedule so literally time schedule 5
o'clock p.m. Eastern Standard Time
United States Washington DC New York
Stanton your time zone so just a heads
up and also thank you guys once again so
in this video I'm actually answering a
question from flame 20 20 57 also from
somebody else I don't have their name in
front of me but I actually got this
question like three or four times it
seems like in the last couple of days
another thing too is I do get all of
your your comments guys some of you guys
have sent me some real deep comments and
it's very difficult number one to
respond to some of it but I do plan on
it and sometimes it's just difficult
with scheduling and things to give it
the proper amount of time so just to let
you guys know that if you've sent me a
message I do get it and I do read it and
I suppose I should at least just respond
and say you know what I'll try to
respond sooner but anyway just he's just
sorry to say that because I know that
there are there is mail that sometimes
goes unanswered and it's not unread it's
just unanswered so the question that was
how do you get better with algorithms
and this is being asked of somebody like
myself who is self-taught I'm a senior
programmer but I am NOT a math Wiz in
fact I'm I would argue that I'm not very
well I'm not bad at math I'm just not
somebody who like sits around and likes
to solve algorithmic problems I do feel
very satisfied when I actually come up
with a solution that parses data in a
way that I want it to be parsed or that
if I'm doing like basic game programming
which I've only really scratched the
surface with game program programming I
get a lot of satisfaction
it comes to you know integrating some
basics and physics to where I'm telling
something to walk forward and telling it
the speed and if you get into a
proximity of something else you know I
mean so there is there is algorithms
that are looked at to figure out but I'm
basically to figure out proximity and
stuff like that so I am NOT a huge
algorithm guy there's all kinds of
different algorithms that you're going
to find in life one interesting quote
that I wanted to share with you guys is
this is from Donald Knuth who's who
currently is over at Stanford absolute
genius he wrote this it's really a
multi-volume of work called the art of
computer programming he's considered the
father of analysis of algorithms which
is according to Wikipedia so I'm sure
that there's some sort of link of where
that comes from but the bottom line is
that this guy is a major figure in
computer science and algorithms and but
he says people think that computer
science is the art of geniuses but the
actual reality is the opposite just many
people doing things that build on each
other like a wall of mini stones so he
is true in that sense and also instead
of just building on others I would add
to that that you build on what you're
learning I mean so whatever you need to
write code right so all the knowledge in
the world is not going to help you
without actual action so really it's
it's having knowledge and then taking
action that makes you bigger stronger
more powerful and I think it's the same
exact way with algorithms because the
type of programming that I do now I
wouldn't have been capable of doing when
I just got started so not only is it
stones that I learned from other people
that have made my job easier it's also
stones that I'm adding that I've put in
you know many years ago that are adding
up this own stone foundation that I have
you know that is myself so I think it's
an interesting quote if you guys want to
read more about dawn or donna donald
knuth you can read about them here but
there's also this this video on YouTube
I would recommend so I think that's it's
pretty interesting just hearing him
speak so you asked about algorithms one
of the places I would actually send you
is probably unity just because for me I
didn't really get into a whole lot of
Algar
most of my algorithms were based around
text and pattern matching and using
regular expressions to say okay how can
I grab this particular data or I'll use
algorithms but mainly it's all about
data scraping for me that's that's
mostly where I'm doing it and that's a
big part of algorithms obviously look at
the amount of money that Google makes
off of text algorithms but they're not
just a single algorithm anymore so
anybody that thinks Google is just one
set of this perfect algorithm that's
worth hundreds of billions of dollars
it's clearly not the case they had a
unique idea that they built upon and
they built up their own stone foundation
of you know this algorithm on top of
this algorithm on top of this and this
and this and then eventually they now
have like thousands of things that are
looked at plus they have the sheer
amount of volume of data where they can
you know be sloppy with analysis and
basically just through brute force trial
and error you can find correlations just
you know through the big data that they
have exposure to but if you're looking
for yourself just to build upon like you
know physics and and things like that
then I would probably suggest unity and
that's one of the reasons also why I
pick C sharp as one of the top languages
and this may be common knowledge here
but with with unity when you start off
like one of the roadblocks for me is
actual modeling like 3d modeling and
blender or some other you know program
like 3ds max it's so difficult it's it
typically and it's like an instant brick
wall like I run in this brick wall that
is the art and I never get into the
actual complex gaming and and I think I
never really gave the unity store a fair
shake but you can buy entire packages
and if you want to just get into like
the scripting of like you know the
effects here the physics and all that
stuff you can just look through a lot of
code that people have already written
but if you're going to get into game
programming I mean it might be easier
for you just to jump into an already
created solution and start expanding
upon that some of the stuff that's
really well put together they only
charge like 50 bucks for it and then
there's other cases where stuff is
completely free but that might help you
dealing with game programming another
thing is this project Euler net so this
will start you can see this this number
one multiples of three and five this is
this is
actually fizzbuzz this is like the
fizzbuzz test that you see them giving
so this is obviously there's some
credence to these types of of tests here
but these I would definitely go to
project Euler and start solving some of
these these smaller ones once again I'm
not the type who actually like feels
like what you know it would help me to
sit down and actually do this but I just
I I I feel like I'm too busy doing other
things but you know I actually should
practice what I preach and actually sit
down and mess with some of these because
I actually have in the past but I never
got past like the top ten and before I
was like you know it's enough because I
mean some of this stuff this will really
make you think but you're you know your
noodle is something that's growing all
the time so the more of this stuff you
pump into it I mean you're going to be a
much better programmer but like Donald
candy says it doesn't take geniuses to
be able to do this stuff some people are
just natural geniuses others can start
with some of these basic algorithms and
start working your way up and some of
the stuff isn't basic at all like you're
not going to find that you're doing a
lot of these these types of algorithms
and in the day to day job when it comes
to standard web development and stuff
like that but all this stuff will make
you a much better computer science or
computer programmer but even beyond all
of this stuff so I can sum it up by just
saying just action take action every day
that you take action and that you're
writing something you're solving some
problem you're going to run into
algorithms along the way that you're
having to write to solve this particular
problem or that problem and you know
build up this stone foundation for
yourself and and don't necessarily think
you're going to be able to just read out
of a book and understand how to be a
better programmer especially when it
comes to algorithms and things of that
nature
alright guys thanks for watching once
again you know be on the lookout for
these new uploads they have five o'clock
Eastern Standard Time United States and
thank you and take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
