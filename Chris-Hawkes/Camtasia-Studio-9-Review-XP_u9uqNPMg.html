the question the past of what software
do i use for screen capturing and it's
not exactly straightforward answer
because i actually used several
different programs for the most part
with this channel but that being said i
mean there are a lot of different
products that I've tried i'm not going
to actually named them all but i can
tell you that the program that i end up
using for most of my screen capturing is
Camtasia Studio Camtasia to me it may
not have some of the bells and whistles
of some of the more advanced and more I
guess professional-grade video editing
software and things like that but the
ease of us actually makes up for any
sort of you know inefficiencies that it
may have when it comes to like
processing especially like you know
processing intensive stuff like if I
have to splice out certain sections of
the video and everything so Camtasia
nine-point-oh just recently came out and
in this this newest version is really
it's better than ever that it then it's
ever been like you have these cursor
effects which is relatively new there's
all kinds of different animation options
that you have I know you guys have seen
my green screen in my video as well so I
even the older versions of Camtasia you
could use the green screen but some of
the other programs that I end up using
are like Premiere Pro just for some of
the gives me a few additional tools but
as far as like the green screen is
concerned I think Camtasia does just as
you know just a fine job on that as as
far as that is concerned now when I talk
about ease of use like here's a video
right here and say well you know here's
what I'm doing my my talking here I can
easily just edit out like a certain
section grabbed add delete it and then
just being able to drag these different
parts like this timeline feature of
Camtasia is just so much easier than
then really any other program that I've
ever used for video editing and stuff
like even this here's this audio clip or
the actual video clip that doesn't match
the audio and I'm gonna you know I can
shrink that down really easily just by
stretching dragging and dropping if you
wanted to import you know different
things like you have all these different
options and everything that it gives you
like you can see this little like here's
an apartment clip and everything you can
add
you're your timeline if you just want to
drag it down and then I can drag this
shorter you make it smaller or bigger
depending on what you have selected like
here I had the image select so I can
make it smaller put it in the top right
corner so I know you guys have seen me
talking on the bottom my videos and
things like that but I use Camtasia for
that so this is this an extremely
extremely easy software application to
you is compared to a lot of other ones
you can even flip stuff like 360 like
one time I actually created a video and
put a lot of effort into it and when I
recorded it on my Galaxy s7 phone I
actually had it upside down so I was
like oh damn it like in most video
editing it you have the ability well
actually maybe not most but I mean you
can flip videos around and things like
that you can also do transitions like if
I wanted to actually and some of this
stuff like you're like removing a colors
for green screen so it's a lot more help
with some of that stuff but let me go
ahead and I want to let's see so I'm not
going to get into too much of this stuff
because actually Camtasia 9 just
recently came out so I'm not not too
well versed in it but here you can see I
just easily grab this this circle
stretch animation and just dragged it
into the the actual image so you're
going to see in the bottom right if I go
ahead and play this testing testing
testing 123 testing testing testing so
you can see you can just apply these
different amika animations and
everything it makes it really easy i
like to pixelate one right here so we'll
add that testing testing testing 123
testing now I don't actually use a lot
of these animations as much as I
probably should but you know some people
are like it's you know better to you
know not have some sort of long intro
and outro video and stuff like that I've
actually scrapped both of my intro and
outro but even if you wanted to slow
down the actual animation you're like oh
it's too long or whatever you can adjust
it here so I really can't say enough
good things about Camtasia the speed of
which I could actually make a video
where I record my screen save it as an
mp4 and upload it to YouTube
it's just so much easier than some of
the other products I've tried which
include like Adobe the premier Pro IV
was like danda cam some people have
complained about actual 50 or 60 frames
per second video gaming so if you're
doing a lot of video game walkthroughs
and stuff like that with grass graphics
intensive processes that is something I
can't really speak on too much I know
that Camtasia recorded games like
octodad I know my son was doing octave
dad videos at one point and that was a
that got handled just fine but octodad
is obviously not a first-person shooter
like Call of Duty I was going to say
Grand Theft Auto for some reason but
anyway like Call of Duty or some sort of
graphics intensive application like that
you'd probably you could run into a
situation maybe I've heard with Camtasia
maybe older versions but the newer
version i'm not i'm not sure that that's
an issue but when it comes to most liked
video presentations for you're making
your typical youtube video i don't think
there's any limitation there now another
thing i want to mention that is so much
easier with camtasia compared to other
other things is like right now i'm
recording on an earlier version of
camtasia not the newer one but if you
look at the recorder here that's going
on this is the recorder that you can add
markers to your stuff like I don't
really do that too much but I can draw
on everything we're just free porn
pendrell and just by clicking that it
goes away also the best part though it's
like before I even started recording
here you could actually click on your
webcam so it does a webcam end video
processing at the same time there's been
times I've tried to do game walkthroughs
and stuff like that where I have to
actually have my face band recorded I
had another time where I was doing on
basically I was recording gameplay on my
playstation but I want to be able to
record me playing it and I just had this
extremely like extravagant difficult to
deal with set up to try to be able to
get all that set you know going and this
was before PlayStation 4 out a lot of
the built-in capabilities with a camera
and everything and that was just such a
hassle to set up and then some program
like you don't actually get to do your
screen capturing and the webcam at the
same time and you have to jump through
hoops in order to do that if you go to
logitech and by logitech webcam and you
want to do a you know logitech they
don't you can't record your screen with
your logitech so like you're just kind
of missing the ingredients but with
Camtasia you have all that so that's
what it's just another reason why I use
Camtasia it saves me so much time now
finally you guys are going to ask about
the price point I'm sure so you can get
a free trial try it out you're not going
to go you're not going to find an easier
one to use but as far as the price point
is concerned I wouldn't say it's steep
because anything like this is going to
be expensive but one hundred and
ninety-nine dollars is the price tag and
I've more than made up for that price
along my youtube career for sure but
that is that you know it's a heck of a
price you know for somebody that's just
getting started with web videos and
things like that but if you're able to
scrape by with that I mean you're going
to get a much better product and
anything that's free and if you compare
this to something like premiere pro or
even I views like Sony Vegas before but
not really for screen sharing but Sony
Vegas is another very very complicated
product and adobe captivate which is
what you know they're Adobe's Camtasia
alternative was that thing crashed on me
all the time the best feature of
captivate was that it had cool intros
like I had this one where if you guys
have ever seen my videos where I had
like fish eating the title that was
pretty cool but everything else sucked
with it because it was like a big memory
hog and it crashed all the time so yeah
that's about it guys so definitely check
out Camtasia if you're able to afford
that you know 199 price tag and there
might be discounts for students and
things like that then I would definitely
check it out but that's that's my spring
editor of choice and then every once in
a while if I have to do some green
screen intensive type stuff i'll use
some the adobe adobe premiere alright
guys thanks for watching have a good
night bye hey guys so a lot of you asked
me how do i get my foot in the door to
