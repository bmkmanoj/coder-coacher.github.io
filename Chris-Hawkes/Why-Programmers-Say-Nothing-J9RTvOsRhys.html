great comment I think and it was about
the video that I made about a death
march and IT and the death marches I'd
already discussed it basically it's a
project that is spiraling out of control
because of a lack of requirements
upfront or lack of resources or just
simply trying to build a vision of a
project that isn't going to be fulfilled
because at the top level the people that
I actually authorize the project didn't
take into all the considerations or even
whether or not it was you know truly
possible and everything is possible to
an extent so yeah some people there
there are people in this world that I've
actually encountered we're like it'll be
like well you know it's certainly
possible you know and then they try to
like hold you to it like when you say
it's not but there there's a difference
between saying it's not possible like
physically not possible in the realm of
the universe that we live in versus it's
not possible to meet any sort of it you
know deadlines and get something into
production for the company you know
within a certain period of time so
anything is possible but that doesn't
that shouldn't be giving that shouldn't
give you enough of an incentive to do
something that you shouldn't do so I
think there's a separation there but um
with this comment they were saying hey
I've recently stumbled into a talk about
um kebab Robert Martin that indirectly
touched on the subject it was called
expecting professionalism I highly
recommend watching it because I'm going
to butcher the synopsis okay his basic
premise is that when your boss or boss
is whoever comes to you and asks you to
do something that you know isn't going
to work it's better or even an
obligation to say no they're going to
want to push you into doing things that
are bad for the project and bad for the
bottom line to meet expectation of their
bosses but the farther away you get from
the development the less you know what's
going on if you give in or afraid to say
no you end up costing company a lot of
money and compromise the integrity and
quality of the project essentially they
are paying you to tell them what is and
is impossible and it's unprofessional to
do something that you know is a bad idea
now I would agree with all of that but
unfortunately you know this guy that
gave this talk you know it isn't
necessarily like it depends on the
organization that you're in so there are
a lot of here's an example there
are gonna be people that are appointed
positions around you that may know less
about programming than you do and they
may even know less about leading a
project and getting things done than you
do and maybe that's just in your own
mind because you have the dunning-kruger
effect where you think you're better
than you really are and then some cases
you are really better than the person
that you are getting orders from now the
problem with this though is that say
like a VP they authorize a project that
goes down to the directors and they tell
the managers and the managers tell the
leads and the leads tell the programmers
and you got a couple of yes-men leads
and yes-men leads are basically they'll
say yes to anything that comes from
their manager and they're not gonna
accept impossible because they don't
have to code the project or anything
like that so they're trying to lead an
overall project and you know typically
then you have like project owners in
agile environment and you know scrum
masters and stuff and they're supposed
to be communicating with the leads and
in management to say whether or not
something is moving along my cat is
anyway so the problem is though is that
you can be surrounded by yes men
developers that may not even recognize
the feasibility of the project that's
being implemented and then if they're
just you know yes Manning up to the top
and you try to bring the situation to
light it could end up putting you in a
bad spot so if you're not paid to make
those decisions nit then sometimes like
you kind of have no choice but to just
go with the flow and that's kind of the
Death March situation I was talking
about I've seen people that are just
going with the flow even though they
know that the entire direction is kind
of flawed my cat is just complete I have
a kitten and she's just jumping into
stuff and making a ton of noise just
like with Lois Rothman's videos cat is
interfering in the middle of the video
all right I just booted her out anyway
so yeah I agree with it for the premise
there but sometimes you don't have an
organizational structure that allows you
to get close enough to management or
leads or whatever it is I'm not a lead
really but to be able to express your
concerns and then sometimes depending on
who's involved in the software project
if you have people that have more
seniority than you do
and then if they're telling you to go a
particular direction even though you
know it's wrong you want to caution
yourself of trying to speak out
sometimes you could be wrong and other
times you could be right but either way
don't ways gonna listen to you anyway so
sometimes it's just better to go with
the flow and then when the project falls
apart and even if you saw the writing on
the wall it's not gonna be you that gets
blamed for the downfall anyway and I
mean you should always express your
concerns maybe to those senior people
around you but I wouldn't just jump over
their head and start talking to a
manager or director and an IT
organization because you disagree with
the path of the project there should be
a chain of command that follows up to
the top so if you have enough valid
concerns you should be able to express
that to your senior developers around
you to the lead maybe even your manager
but you know definitely don't go like
the VP and be like oh all this whole
things you know screwed and all this
stuff I I definitely don't agree with
that now
the problem is is that being programmers
though you deal with a lot of people and
you get into these um what I call like
pissing contests or dick-measuring
contest where you have people that want
to show you how smart that they are and
how crafty they are as developers and
how they can get anything done and and
once again there's a difference between
something being possible and whether or
not you should do something so it
reminds me of the Jeff Goldblum quote
from Jurassic Park where he's like the
scientist got involved got so involved
and caught up and whether or not they
could do something they never stopped to
ask themselves should they be doing that
so an IT that ends up happening a lot
especially with some of the developers
that are yes-men type of people that
aren't looking at the bigger picture and
they're like you know I know this is
possible and maybe they don't have kids
down on the family and they plan on
working weekends and 16-hour days which
I've seen that but that's
because you know they are trying to you
know fit a base square peg in a round
hole because they have more time to
devote to the subject and I don't know
man the whole situation can get really
really crappy and we could probably talk
about this subject Danny you know for
several days really but I know it's
gonna bore some of the people but this
is some of the stuff that you do see in
the corporate IT environment where like
the directions of the projects are being
led by you know by people and factors
that are out of your control so even if
they are a bad idea and things like that
you sometimes they're just kind of
forced to go with the
hello and and once again I would just
cautious cautiously advise people not to
just you know jump over people's heads
I'm one of the things that I've actually
heard about from a lot of different
companies it's like a lot of people will
be like oh we have this open HR policy
and stuff like that yeah you never kind
of you never really want to go to HR
with some sort of complain or whatever
from and from many cases because that's
gonna be pretty much a fast track with
your weight you know with you getting
kicked out of the company that just
typically seems to be the case I've seen
that a lot actually so you know just
because they say that they have an
open-door policy and all that stuff
doesn't mean that you should be
expressing all your concerns because
sometimes the the impression of what you
can do as a developer and things like
that could be you know their impression
of what you can do could be influenced
by some of these yes-men and these
people that are trying to tell you that
you're just being a naysayer and things
like that so I don't know basically you
always got to worry about your image and
this is a good idea in most
organizational cases I think that IP
organizations whether it's VPS and
management and leads and directors they
should have a lot of skip level meetings
so that you know people can anonymously
voice their concerns to some of the
higher levels that way you know
basically there should be an anonymous
reporting type of thing probably for all
organizations to try to you know have a
good Avenue for people that might be
underlings to be able to report some of
these problems that are going on in the
trenches you know before they end up
costing companies literally millions
sometimes hundreds of millions of
dollars alright guys thanks for watching
have a good day and bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in the Suevi
course it's geared to get you into the
industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
