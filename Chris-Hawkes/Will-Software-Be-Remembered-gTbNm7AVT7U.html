not would be inappropriate for me to do
a video from within my car while I'm
driving and the thing is is like I
really don't think it's a big deal
because they do that in like cops
and all those like reality TV shows
everything and I think there might be
some like legal issues if you have the
camera like filming people's tags and
stuff like that although i'm not even
sure if that's a problem so I don't
really know that you can actually like
legally videotape from your dashboard
but you know from the car should be fine
especially with like a hands-free unit
it's no different than talking to your
passenger in the car or whatever so I
don't know I'm curious what you guys
think about that because I thought about
it and like I said I just don't I don't
see an issue with it but today I'm on my
way to go drive out to the mountains
which is roughly two hours from Ryan I
live which is the Shenandoah National
Forest which I think George Washington
made it into a state park a long time
ago it's a pretty interesting place in
fact I wanted to bring my telescope but
that's something that was just it was
too much hassle and I am the dog in the
back seat basic
Messer
there she is so yeah we're we're on our
way to the mountains tonight and I'll
bring my telescope next time and one of
the things I want to talk about is it's
interesting that people always try to it
seems like they try to like lessen your
accomplishments whatever you know there
might be a hint of jealousy and I'm not
sure how much accuracy there is in that
statement but I've had people that
basically you know tell me that the
other they never tried to do like a
youtube type of thing that I've done and
then you know it's just it's not
something that they you know that they
that they want to do is so they never
did it and otherwise if they had wanted
to then they could have easily
accomplish the same thing so Gator you
know I guess what am I trying to say I'm
trying to say that there are certain
people that I talk to where it's like
you know they kind of question the whole
like YouTube thing like you know they
don't really understand it and and I'm
not really sure that I understand that
either but all I know is that it just
seems to be working I mean I just
surpassed 37 thousand subscribers over
the last three months I've had a million
views I have a corporate sponsor now
which is Deb mountain coding boot camp
by the way so make sure you guys check
out the link in the description I
appreciate that then they do me a huge
favor because honestly the YouTube
videos are not very lucrative and of
themselves and having a corporate
sponsor makes things a lot easier you
know monetarily to try to produce
content but yeah that said I think that
I would produce content anyway because
for the four years I was on YouTube and
I didn't make anything and it took a
three and a half year investment before
anything started paying off even
remotely and if you I think add up all
the time that I spent making videos over
three years into three half years
obviously the time you know versus the
money that I've earned on the videos
doesn't nearly come close to like
compensating a programmer for what their
time should be programmers should be
making roughly between you know fifty to
one hundred fifty dollars an hour for
probably consulting gigs and then on the
lesser scale of like salary programmers
in the United States you're probably
looking at a minimum of thirty dollars
an hour and then whatever sort of
profession or company that you're
working for within the United States and
that's like I said I'd minimum so you
know that could be in like Central
Florida or something like that you
should be making that kind of cash so
you know it so putting you know what I'm
sayin with that is just simply that
you know programmer times like at the
amount of time I've spent certainly has
it been worthwhile no I will say it has
been worthwhile as far as like
connecting to other people you know to
keeping me more up today because you
know there are things that I like to
teach myself and other people and I
think that you know teaching other
people also helps you understand this is
the topic better especially when you go
to make a video on something that you're
not a hundred percent familiar with like
it comes out pretty clear out quickly
when you're trying to teach somebody
else and you realize that you have no
idea what you're even talking about yeah
so challenges yourself to learn the
content a little bit better in order to
be able to explain it to somebody else
and also to be able to explain in a way
that you understand you know which can
also help other people too but um you
know so i would i would do this anyway i
think i've enjoyed this whole YouTube
thing I really have I just surpassed 37
thousand subscribers today I don't even
promote the channel all that much I am I
don't really tell my relatives or family
too much I've told my friends and you
know people that are close to me they
obviously know about my YouTube thing
but
I don't know I guess sometimes it's kind
of annoying though when I'm like yeah
you know I've gotten all this traffic
and I've had some you know moderate
success or whatever and then people try
to like you know less than what you've
accomplished and if people think it's so
 easy to have a youtube channel
with you know thirty seven thousand
subscribers and whatever content you
want you know go ahead and try and see
how he is how you know you know it easy
it is that if they have more subscribers
than me especially in a short period of
time and I've seen it happen but I've
also seen masses of people that don't
have as much success either so I don't
know I mean basically nobody should be
trying to less than anybody's
accomplishments and software is
definitely a case where people love to
one-up each other that's why we have so
many frameworks and so much different
technology that we're dealing with every
day like I mean you look at like how
software engineering and a lot of ways
it relates to architecture if you're
like a building architect or a
structural engineer or something like
that I'm you're building your building
things that stand the test of time
whether it's a bridge or a building or
something like that and the benefit of
something like that is that your
building stays in existence probably for
you know sometimes hundreds of years if
not thousands I mean look at the Roman
Colosseum and I mean granted I mean all
the people that probably put together
the Roman cost of Colosseum or the
ancient pyramids and Egypt or whatever I
mean it we don't know exactly who put in
all that effort or what but we know that
an effort was put in and that the effort
like stands the test of time it gets you
know
display it for millennia
thousands of years and um
I think with with software it's
interesting because you could be the guy
who created redux and your moment in the
Sun is like you know probably a few
years time and and and one day you know
we're going to look back and it's going
to be like oh yeah you know I was the
creator of redox and everybody's gonna
be like whoa what is what is Redux
because now we're on the harry potter
framework and harry potter is like five
frameworks after reduction it's just
interesting that so much work and effort
can be put into software and then it's
just either forgotten or one up and then
one of the frustrating things about
one-upping is just simply that there's
some big-ass little charge of rotis big
old farm vehicle out here in the middle
of nowhere um so yeah just what would
the interesting thing with one-upping is
a lot of the times we do that just
simply because we want to be able to
leapfrog other developers with newer
technology and company is also like
doing that too because the new shiny
tool if you're dealing with react as a
company react has only been around for
what four or five years not even and
it's really only been popular probably
for the last two and it's just it's
interesting that you could be a senior
developer with 30 years of experience
and you're 30 years of experience does
not equate very well 22
you know developer that has two years
with react so even if you have 30 years
of overall IT experience two years and
react then you're not very much better
off than the kid who just came out of
college with two years experience so why
would a company pay you 120 thousand
dollars when they could just pay them
you know 40 or 45 coming out of college
to do the same thing and they probably
have just as much experience if not more
and they might even have it on an upper
hand too because they don't have to
relearn some way that they you know that
they that they learn over you know
decades of experience to say okay things
should be done this way and now we're
doing it this way and you have to kind
of relearn all of that it and it's just
different mindsets I mean it's very like
it's a very religious type of topic that
makes us go in these different
directions but the j sx thing is a good
example of that like jsx came along it's
like we were supposed to separate HTML
from javascript and CSS we weren't
supposed to mix all that stuff into this
new type of syntax that they call jsx
which is very similar to like XML but
but eventually like you know the people
we know that have been around and they
knew that you know we made that decision
10 years ago to separate those concerns
if not longer and now we're kind of
going back on that and they balk at that
stuff but the ones that were just
jumping into it they're like oh this is
the status quo this is what this is all
I've ever known and I think in some ways
that that's an advantage over you know
more senior developers but one thing I
can't stress enough is that senior
developers understand business and
understand people a lot better than some
of these young punks that come out of
college these kids don't have real life
experiences they don't have kids and all
have families they don't I mean what is
one of the first things that they do
when a social networking startup you
know you get becomes popular what is one
of the first things that Google did when
they started blowing up in popularity
they went out and they hired some gray
hair experienced people that knew how to
run companies they knew how to manage
people and they brought those people in
because their company probably would
have never been able to succeed without
that so you could have these frat party
programmer types or whatever that are
running startups and things but I I
wouldn't I mean eventually you're going
to need the experienced developers that
are going to come in that understand
business and understand requirements and
understand that coding is a lot more
than just writing down coat and a
computer
it's an attempt on more than that in
fact it's that's the least of your
concerns when you're a senior developer
in my opinion
I actually want to share an image that I
found online which i think is great but
it basically just explains the
disconnect between architects engineers
analysts the business you know the sales
associate and all this other stuff in
inches i chose throws all these
different presentations of what
everybody's envisioning the you know the
end goal to be and it's completely
different you know i have to show that
to you guys one day
but anyway that's all I really got so
yeah thirty-seven thousand subscribers
and
for somebody who doesn't really promote
the channel and really went about this
in a way that wasn't planned for at all
and somebody who's not even this you
know outgoing extra for like I am a
introverted type that is not mr.
popularity or anything and for for me to
be able to find two saturdays success on
YouTube I think that's great you know I
feel I feel very lucky fortunate blessed
whatever you want to call that but at
the same time I've also worked really
hard for it and I don't think that that
I should be ashamed of anything that
I've done in some cases I worry I think
about you saying something you know you
either get a rise out of somebody or
basically trying to have an opinion on
something I don't feel strongly about
I've done videos on things that I just
don't really care about and and it shows
because then you get this um you know
this half-hearted lackluster effort to
justify some position that I don't even
feel strongly about and in those in
those cases those videos you know
typically aren't well received and when
I look back on them like I'm not proud
of them but at the same time I'm not
like oh so you know now my career is
ruined because I had some shitty opinion
on some subject at one point we all have
shitty opinions I hate to break it to
you none of us are all like you know
perfect and
and those are things that I think that
ultimately you know what some days I
wake up and I'm like oh man I what am i
doing I'm putting my opinion out there
for millions of people to see and
they're watching it some people you know
they take my advice and you know
sometimes my advice is you know probably
not the best so I think it's somebody's
a dose that that is the only real
concern that I have with YouTube is just
simply that I'm going to end up saying
something that I regret and and I think
that's just natural though because we're
all going to do it and in this world of
social media streaming you know this
vlogging thing is still relatively new I
mean it's not something that we've had
for decades or anything and we're going
to continue to see that advance but I
mean we're all capable of saying things
you look at people's Twitter accounts
and they constantly are like you know
putting their political opinions out
there and stuff and I try to steer away
from political opinion because nobody
gives a when my opinion is you
might be curious but if my opinion is
not you know the same as yours and
you're not going to respect it at least
not with the polarizing politics that
are going on in the United States today
so I don't even mess with all that stuff
but you see like in you know all kinds
of Twitter feeds of famous people
they're constantly you know throwing
their opinions out there and a lot of
times their opinions are but my
point is we all do it so I'm just I'm
not a celebrity like that so you know I
have a less exposure
it's probably better than that I do have
less exposure quick anyway I shouldn't
give a not something really to
worry about and for the most part I
don't and that's why I just keep doing
videos so anyway guys thanks for
watching and I'll talk to you guys later
make sure you check out my sponsors
links in the description tab is def
mountain coding boot camp the boot camps
are rising in popularity and I do want
to make a video actually because I
talked to a hiring manager the other day
and he was talking to me about his
experiences with boot camps and I
thought it would be very very
interesting to share but I want to make
that its own video so anyway guys stay
tuned for that take care and have a good
day but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
