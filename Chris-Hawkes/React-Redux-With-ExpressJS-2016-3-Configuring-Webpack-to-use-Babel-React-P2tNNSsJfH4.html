third video series of this react redox
Syria I can never say that right but you
guys I'm gonna talk about this a third
video and now what we need to do is we
need to try to set up our web web pack
config file and this is another
confusing aspect but something that is
going to create a lot of it's going to
do a lot of stuff for us so in our root
directory where our package that JSON
file is I'm going to add a new file
called web pack config dot dot J s so
this file here it's gonna do a few
things we can say module dot exports
equals and this is a JavaScript object
so we're going to give it an entry point
and this is going to be the root
directory to our application and I
actually wanted to be in the public
folder and I'm gonna call it a PS that's
gonna be our entry point because we
already have an app yes you know that's
gonna be confusing we're gonna call this
react you know what let's think let me
think let me think um you know what our
react Redux series is going to focus on
a counter object so we're just gonna
call this counter app a s so let's go
ahead and yeah we'll keep it at that and
then now we need to say output and this
equals and we give it a path and the
path is going to be using the underscore
our name which we've seen with uh with
nodejs that it knows how to find the
root directory where we're at currently
with that and then we're gonna say
bundle actually I want to say public and
then bundle J s and we're gonna fix this
part here where I'll say der name plus
public
and we'll just call this bundled wrasse
so what this is doing and saying our
root directory of our project and then
add on the public folder so I want the
the files to sit inside there and then
it's going to output this bundle j/s
because what web pack does is it takes
all these different modules and it
combines them into one folder all right
so let's put a comment here or comment
here we're gonna stay module and this
part will say loaders and this is what
we're actually going to tell web pack to
use Babel in order to compile our stuff
so in here we want to go ahead and give
it an exclude directory so we wanted to
say don't use any folders that say node
modules so just like that it's going to
ignore anything inside of here it's not
gonna try to compile it because we
definitely don't want to do it now we're
gonna say the type of loader you're
going to use is babel since babel is
actually going to be reading our react
code and then our query is going to then
we need to pass in a few arguments where
we say presets and then inside presets
here we're actually saying yes 2015
which we've been npm installed in the
last video as well as react so we need
to use both of those if those aren't
there then it's not going to know how to
compile our latest java script it's also
not going to know how to compile like
react JSX code without this stuff so
that's why we need to do all this stuff
and then after the module i'm gonna put
another comment we're going to do an
argument that says watch true and that
way when we execute a web pack command
it's going to continually watch for our
folders it's going to look for
everything inside counter at yes and if
anything changes it's going to recompile
it and it turns it all into this bundled
ijs folder which we'll put in our public
so for now what we want to do in order
to see if this configuration is actually
working correctly
we need to go ahead and and create these
folders or files that it's looking for
so let's go ahead and do that now
so the first thing we need to do is says
okay public counter app yes so that's
what it's looking for so let's say
public and we need to create a counter
app.js file so inside this public folder
let's create a file and stay counter app
j/s and for now inside this file we just
want to simply give it a var X equals
this is gonna be an array just cat dog
and just just a simple JavaScript array
right here with an X name just because I
want to test this thing out so now if we
go to our command line and we need to go
to where the web pack config is and one
of the things we need to do is we
actually need since we're doing
everything locally through our npm i net
config we need to give a specific
command to the package adjacent files to
open this up package so jason and under
the scripts right here we need to say
web pack so we're defining a script that
npm can run and then we're just gonna
simply say web pack and make sure
there's a comma after that so we added a
specific script to our npm config and
then what this does it allow us to
execute config and it'll run the locally
installed version of WebEx so that way
you can have multiple versions of web
pack installed and each project can be
isolated from one another so let's go
back to the command line and inside here
I want to say NPM run web pack and once
again this is going to look for the
locally installed version of web pack in
order to compile and this is going to be
a huge time saver and it says here error
and note API for babel has been moved to
babel core so it looks like we need to
install babel core and this is one of
those into installs that i was talking
about we might have missed in the last
one but we just need to say npm install
- even save babel core
so this is uh I constantly you know rave
about the madness of the JavaScript
community there's so much boilerplate
and setup that is involved in getting
something like this off the ground
people make jokes about it on Twitter
that it's like you know step yes I want
to set up some you know hello world
project step one install web pack step
54 create my you know HTML file or
something like that so it's it's
literally a ton of steps and everything
it's it's absolutely maddening so now
we've done that let's create an NPM run
web pack again alright so this error
apparently is another fresh error in the
JavaScript community where we need to
uninstall Babel and we actually
installed babel in one of the first
videos because you would think that
since we're using babel we would need to
install that but due to the ever
maddening changes of javascript we need
to actually uninstall babel and i
believe we've already installed babel
loader in babel core which are both
needed in order for this to work let's
go ahead and see because if not if they
we still get this error than it means
that we didn't install babel core and
babel loader but i believe we did ok it
says yeah piece of okay so what we
need to do then this should be able to
resolve and this is this is biting a lot
of people by the way npm install - -
save and then we're gonna say babel
loader space babel - core so those are
two things that babel now uses instead
of just being called babel you have to
have both of those installed
all right so now that we've installed
both of those things let's go ahead and
see if this runs
so yeah this is alright so now we're
getting some some new errors so that's
that's both good and bad all right so
now what this is saying and this is you
know what this is just gonna be the way
it is normally I wouldn't want to deal
with something like this on a tutorial
series but at the same time it's like
this is just because this is
this is the JavaScript community at work
I mean everything changing all the time
and having to have these specific
modules in order for stuff to actually
work right is just ridiculous but
whenever something like this happens you
really just seem to google and figure
out okay what is the latest standard why
doesn't this work and two of the things
that it's saying we need is Babel preset
es2015 and babel preset react I believe
we've already installed one or the other
it doesn't matter if you install it over
again it's not gonna like duplicate it
but we're obviously missing one of these
projects and some of this stuff
literally changes over a period of just
a week or a day or you know months at
best all right so let's try this another
time NPM run web pack hopefully we have
everything this this bastard needs in
order to work there it finally works so
bundle j/s and then you can see that's
where we're at output it so if we go
over here and we look at the public
folder and there's this bundle j/s and
once again web pack took everything and
it just all put it into this one file so
within our views our index pub we want
to go ahead and link the like I want to
put it at the body actually it's a
closing body I'm gonna have a link to
our script so we actually need to change
this we're gonna say at the bottom we
need to say script because it's actually
different than the JavaScript and let's
go ahead and are the CSS statement that
we did so source equals and then we're
gonna reference the bundle is file
all right so now that we've done that
let's go ahead and open this back up so
actually just real quick make sure you
put a comma and then type
text/javascript inside the script tag so
by doing that if you save it and we
opened up in our poke template you
should be able just right click and view
and you can see the script gets included
and if I right click and I say open a
new tab it should open up all this
bundled JavaScript stuff so now we're in
good shape now to continue on with the
web pack and react Redux tutorial series
alright guys thanks for watching and
have a good day bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev

like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
