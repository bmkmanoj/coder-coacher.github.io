been interested in my back story as how
I became a programmer I've done a couple
of videos on the subject which I seem to
have gotten a lot of attention so it
would seem that a lot of my audience on
this channel are people that are in a
similar position as I was in a long time
ago where you know you're trying to
change your career you like programming
you want to make it a full-time job some
of you may be going to school for it
some of you are just trying to teach
yourself after working you know
full-time jobs or part-time jobs some of
you have children some of you are
married and it's a difficult struggle so
I get the question a lot and I get a lot
of views on like how did I do it because
you know my story dates back to the fact
that I was 28 years old I went to a rock
music concert for a band named Bayside
and it was in Baltimore I left the show
and after the show I ended up coming
back home and I remember I got sick
after that and but during the sickness I
was also like I basically had a blast at
this show and the lead singer of the
band was the same age as I am and I was
just thinking you know my life is a
little bit different I had this house
that was like way out in the country I
was commuting almost an hour to work
every single day and I was doing a job
that I just felt like you know it wasn't
the job that I wanted to be doing for
the rest of my life and I I didn't have
a whole lot of options so I had wanted
to start websites even before that that
time I believe but I definitely wasn't
serious about it it wasn't until after
that show that I ended up really
starting to get into Photoshop and and
you know basically planning out my
templates the way my website was going
to look and I was writing down a lot of
the rules and things like that I will
say that I was bouncing off and ideas
off of my father who you know has been
in business for a long time and he was
actually telling me to write down
business plans and things like that that
I wouldn't normally have thought to do
but I was I was serious about building
the website and I you know I got into
the the different programming languages
starting with Perl and then moving in
the Python but I was using the
programming
images to basically scour the web to
collect data on the rock music you know
for the mountain rock music website I
was looking for band names genres labels
things like that and I was trying to put
it all together and ultimately my
product wasn't wasn't really coming
together because it took so much skill I
remember the first time that I got
involved in jQuery and back then you
know jQuery was like the EOD go to
library but it was still relatively new
just a couple years old and a lot of
people the conversation was and do you
need to learn JavaScript working you
just learn jQuery now that conversation
I don't think has had as much because
there's a lot of frameworks that are
going back to the regular JavaScript
days but back in those times it wasn't
even that long ago that but that was the
debate so I was I was like you know
getting into some basic JavaScript but I
started jumping into jQuery and you know
the first time I actually got a plug-in
to work like I liked even the concepts
of getting a plug-in into my HTML page
and actually calling the right functions
and stuff like that was very difficult
for me because I had literally no formal
training in programming or anything like
that and you know I barely knew what you
know external javascript stopped you
know pages were and you know external
stylesheets and things like that I
didn't really know much about that but
uhm you know the first time I was able
to do it I was very proud of myself and
it was just small little examples like
that that I eventually kept building
upon to where I started building more
complicated things to the point where
the first website I ever deployed to a
production environment I actually posted
it on a server that my dad had had owned
or was using or something but my website
was entirely static like the entire
thing was just HTML and CSS and
JavaScript there was no database there
was nothing it was all just data and
HTML templates and when you're getting
started I mean that's fine because you
know hooking up to the database and then
learning obviously the sequel language
or having to deal with some object
relational mapper if you're using Django
or something else so you know those are
additional learning curves that you have
to to overcome and you know when I was
first getting started I just wanted
everybody to kind of see what I was
working on and you know the static site
looked good but obviously there was very
limited functionality that you can have
because it was static and there was no
database and really any Oh server-side
processing or anything like that so but
the point is that was that it was it was
little accomplishments built on top of
each other that eventually built you
know a more solid foundation this was a
long long time ago so all that being
said I sometimes get emails and this
video is gonna be about a couple of
different things but I sometimes get
emails about you know Chris can you help
me be a you know a program or you know I
don't understand what I'm doing can you
help me there's really not a lot I can
do for you in that case like one time I
was watching a video for Johnson mez had
done about trying to find a mentor and
he was basically stating in the video
that that nobody has the time at least
people that you would want to be your
mentor they don't have the time to be
your personal Yoda or your personal
mentor because you know they're barely
probably they're probably barely holding
it together themselves with all the
responsibilities and everything that
they have to deal with but you don't
need a mentor though this isn't about
like trying to master like that you know
the samurai and you need like some sort
of you know kung-fu Panda or something
like that you know whoever Kung Fu Panda
went to in his videos to learn the
secrets of kung-fu and everything it's
not really about that this is about
repetition and it's about it's about not
getting down on yourself when you get
you know kicked in the balls and told
that you're not good enough and sorry
that's a male reference but that is
going to happen unfortunately and in the
business world especially in the IT
world you're gonna deal with a lot of
arrogance and a lot of egos I'm there's
a lot of people in this industry that
are very smart and they want you know to
show you that they're very smart we see
it every day with all the different
technologies and frameworks and stuff
that are popping up out of out of and
really everywhere it seems like
everybody wants to have their own
framework they want to be Zuckerberg
they want to show you how smart they are
and how clever they are and there's a
lot of that in this industry and
unfortunately that does sway into you
know the hiring process and stuff like
that too so if
somebody that you know is is also you
know very capable and they you know went
to some major university they're gonna
get taken over you in most cases but
what you do in that case is on is you
need to be able to learn how to handle
that adversity you need to be able to
bounce back when when people tell you
that you're not good enough some people
will get down on themselves because
being rejected sucks whether or not
you're getting dumped you know by a
girlfriend or a boyfriend it sucks being
told that you're not good enough that
you're not the you know the person that
is gonna you know fill that void you
know whatever it may be so we want to
feel secure as humans and we want to be
good enough you know and and for many of
us if we're changing our careers and
we're out there trying to learn and we
knew even if we're going to school for
this stuff you know we want to make sure
that we're able to handle it
and it sucks to be told that you're not
the right fit you know so that's going
to be hard no matter where you are and
and how you handle that it's going to be
gonna be whether or not you can succeed
or not because I've been told that I'm
not good enough many times and and I
went you know going back to being a
young child like I was never much of a
fighter
or anything like that I typically if
kids were you know being mean to me I
typically tried to build the social
connections that I needed to try to
avoid being on the you know the losing
end of a you know being made fun of or
whatever and whatever have you it's not
like I didn't have any friends or
anything like that but I certainly
wasn't mr. popularity but I think in the
back of my mind like my family like I
was never you know one of the more well
dressed kids or anything like that in
school and you know tough right I
mean it's not a big deal but those
things do weigh on you and I think you
know how you handle those things if
you're able to brush that stuff off or
even better yet like in my case I don't
really brush that stuff off very well if
I'm told that I'm not good enough
sometimes I actually get angry by the
way I mean I guess that's somewhat of a
personality flaw with myself and and and
sometimes it might be anger with myself
you know feeling that I'm not good
enough or sometimes it could just be you
know anger towards the person who thinks
that I'm not good enough and it's not
like I want to go out and physically
hurt them or something like that but I
mean
anger actually translates to motivation
to where it's like you know what you
know screw you asshole you might think
that I'm not good enough but I'm gonna
be good enough I'm gonna be better than
you and and sometimes I think you need
that because there's going to be
assholes out there that tell you that
you're not good enough and and if you
can't brush it off used it for
motivation I think I do a combination of
the two and you know even with this
channel like I get some pretty big
criticism on this channel sometimes and
uh I mean for the most part I brush it
off I could be like look asshole I'm
making money so you're not you know but
I try not to do that and you know it's
it's it's a tough thing or every
experiences is going to be its own
challenge you know and um being told
that you're not good enough definitely
sucks if you are going the route of
trying to teach yourself how to program
and you're not gonna get the degree like
I've said all along that I recommend
that people go out and get the degree
right now the economy worldwide it's
just not good enough to provide a ton of
IT jobs to people that don't have
degrees I mean there are a lot there's a
lot of demand an IT but if you're gonna
be like a code monkey that's pounding
out a lot of you know code day in and
day out you know the protocol companies
are looking for young people they're
looking for kids you know with degrees
because there's so many of them to be
had I mean granted there's a lot of
demand out there for like really good
cutting-edge programmers that can
literally you know master your masters
at their craft essentially if you're the
guy that's writing the react core
library and things like that then then
you're gonna be a guy that can get a job
anywhere you're the guy that works at
Facebook and Google and stuff like that
yeah those are for like pretty much the
elite status but I can tell you that in
the programming world there is the elite
status and then you have a massive
amounts of people that are not as good
as you think that they are in and one of
the things that I thought when I first
got in the corporate programming is that
like I was never gonna fit in I was
going to people that graduated from all
these different major universities how
would I ever be able to fit in and you
know to be honest I could fit in I feel
like I still can fit in and there's
people that are smarter than me there's
people that are going to tell me I don't
know what I'm talking
but I'm gonna brush them off and you
know I'm gonna try to be on the winning
end you know at the end of this game so
business is a finicky thing I think if
I'm sure Steve Jobs was told that he
wasn't good enough and you know that's
he's the kind of egomaniac that probably
wasn't wasn't able to handle something
like that but you know he got thrown out
of his own company so that's got to be a
tough a tough experience there too but
the thing is guys as you can you can
brush it off you don't need a mentor you
need repetition you need to to not get
down on yourself you need to build upon
small successes and you know never never
tried it well you're going to doubt
yourself every now and then but try not
to doubt yourself try not to harp on
those negative thoughts and feelings and
and if you really are like for a
consistent period of time you know
getting down on yourself you might want
to switch gears and just work on
something else for the moment not saying
get out of programming but I'm just
simply saying you know start working on
a different facet of whatever it is that
you're trying to do programming is a
hard thing and it's going to continue to
be hard and you know it's just a hard
thing there's no question about it so
you're trying to do one of the harder
things to do in life and not only is it
just hard to learn it changes all the
time but the good news is is that you
will get better at it and if people tell
you you're not good enough they can go
straight to hell that should be your
mentality and you should prove to them
that they're wrong because you're the
one who knows whether or not you can can
do it and and that that answer really
depends on whether or not you're going
to give up on yourself or not so anyway
guys let me know what you think and you
know so let me know what you think
that's all I have to say thank you guys
