want to talk about in this series is you
need to become acclimated with the tools
out there that it's going to be able to
make your job easier now as a JavaScript
developer we have all kinds of different
tools that our disposal but the best
thing about javascript is that these
tools are built right into the browser
so all you need to do is download and
install Chrome on your machine
I recommend chrome if you're a firefox
guy or girl and you've been using
Firefox and they do have also good
developer tools I prefer Chrome's and
for this series I'm going to be just
using Chrome
so with chrome it like I say it comes
with your browser so once you have a
Google Chrome browser pulled up you can
go to any web page and press f12 that is
going to launch your developer tools and
it might show up on the side if it shows
up on the side you can you can indeed
attach it there you can dock it to the
bottom or you can dock it to the side I
think it shows up on the side by default
I like to keep mine on the bottom so you
want to make sure that you look into the
fact that there's different tools here
if you select this option you can
actually get different like measurements
and stuff like that so you can see how
the website shows up on mobile devices
but we're not gonna worry about that
right now
one of the things that you will look at
a lot is your element so if you like
right click on something when your
elements tab is open this will take you
to the actual HTML that's showing up in
the browser which is very helpful the
console is actually where you can type
JavaScript right in here so hello world
you can type right into the console and
it will run and execute the sources is
actually how you can put breakpoints and
step through your JavaScript code what
you're going to find is very very
important your network panel is also
very important because any sort of HTTP
request that goes out to a server and
returns data and things like that that's
all going to be taking place inside your
network panels so when you're testing
communication with your back-end then
that's going to be important the
timeline is good for like actually
measuring how long requests take and
stuff like that I don't actually use it
very often for the most part that's
really just what we're going to be
focusing on elements console sources and
network
while we're in here one of the good
things if you actually do control pee it
actually tells you hit ctrl P to find
the file so if we do ctrl P you can
actually search and you can see it
actually searches for any sort of files
that are connected to whatever sort of
web page that you're debugging anyway
guys so that's the first thing you want
to do it takes a long time to get used
to developer tools but I want to make
sure that you guys know how to open it
which is f12 and also what those
different panels mean because you need
to understand for this tutorial series
going forward alright guys thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
