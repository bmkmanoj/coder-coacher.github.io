video and what I'm doing is I'm messing
with Django 1.9 the latest version of
Django as of the date of this video
which is April 25th 2016 I'm going to go
as quickly as I possibly can
and this is just a showcase how I would
go about actually creating a django
website now I host my django websites in
a Linux environment using the node which
is a great company I recommend them but
I develop on a Windows machine so there
are two conflicting operating systems
and working with those differences can
sometimes be a little bit problematic
but in this particular case we're going
to try to get a django out some website
set up as quickly as possible in a
Windows environment and not really worry
about getting it to the Linux
environment right now maybe I'll add
that in the future but let me know what
you think so first things first guys you
need to know where you're going to put
your project I put my projects in my
projects folder and the name of the site
that I'm going to be using is a new post
I'm basically rewriting it I have it in
flask but I want to do something a
little bit more involved in what I'm
doing currently so I'm just call this a
new post so I have my folder there now
any time you're dealing with Python you
need to have Python installed on your
machine so if you don't have Python then
you need to get that installed so when
you pull up a command prompt and windows
you should be able type Python and it
should pull up you know actual Python
emulator here where it prints Python
code so this is the emulator that comes
with Python it actually runs Python so
you can do quick scripting and stuff
like that if you want to get out of that
do control see what you want to make
sure that that is there that it's
installed and added to your path so I
plenty of videos on that if you actually
search my name and how to install Python
you'll find plenty of that and then
there's also sources on the web but
let's go into that new folder that we
just created which is new post now any
time you deal with Python you probably
want to do a virtual environment it's
really important if you've ever done
note or any of this other stuff it's all
about basically encapsulating
dependencies so that way you don't have
to projects that rely on the same plugin
but then you go and maybe
one relies on a more up-to-date version
of that plugin and they're both trying
to share and it creates a major problem
so every project should have its own
plugins its own modules and things that
it's using and it should be isolated to
just that project so that's what virtual
environment does for us it's very easy
to use if you have Python 3 installed or
3.5 or even 3.4 and probably earlier
versions and that it comes with virtual
environment so there's no reason why you
shouldn't be using it at this point but
all you have to do is virtual
environment or virtual env I'm sorry and
then you're going to give it the name of
the environment so we're just going to
call it env which is in your short for
environment now I want to add two flags
which is a hyphen and say no site
packages so what this means is that if
there is a package that two projects
share or they're the packages available
in the global Python installation and to
explain that when you install Python on
your machine you're going to have a
Python 3.5 folder somewhere on your
machine in that folder there's going to
be site packages that's going to be
there's a folder name site packages in
that that is all the modules you have
installed 43.5 for your installation
version of python what virtual
environment does is it says ok I'm going
to create a separate folder that's going
to have its own site packages just for
that folder not for all python 3.5 but
just for that project and what no site
packages does it says hey if I'm using a
module that is installed in your
installation Python 35 folder don't use
that even if it's already there because
I said no site packages it's going to go
ahead and install that anyway in to my
virtual environment so that's what you
want to do that's what it's for
hopefully I explained that okay so this
is going to go through and it actually
reaches across the web to get the latest
version of Python really you can see
that's actually running setup tools and
pip and stuff like that so once we have
this installed we're going to need to
activate the environment so you can see
that it went ahead and installed pip and
all this other stuff that we use to
install modules in Python if I do a door
on that directory you can see we now
have an invite
armen directory so I'll go and CD into
the environment our environment
directory and then now I want to CD into
the scripts directory and there's this
full this uh this activate and that's
actually what we want to run so on
Windows you just have to say activate
and now on the left hand side you can
see the env environment is now activated
so anything I run with PIP install is
just going to be specifically for this
one project folder so if I say pip
install Django it's going to grab the
latest version of Django which is you
can see one point nine point five and
it's going to go ahead and install it
and only that Django is going to be used
by this this project new post and by the
way this project that I'm going to be
trying to create is actually going to be
a video to kind of supplement my YouTube
videos I've been kind of bouncing around
different ideas and stuff like that but
ultimately my flask website that I have
currently is just not it's not cutting
it and Django makes a lot of things so
much easier so I'm just going to go back
to doing Django with that and what we'll
see how how it goes but ultimately what
this project is going to consist of is
that it needs to use some of the latest
web standards like bootstrap and stuff
like that so I want it to be a
relatively plain site but I'll show you
guys how to get all that set up so now
that we have Django installed here you
see let's go ahead and one of the things
with my Django websites you need to have
a database so I have a website or a
video out there that is how to install
Postgres the database - free and open
source database that you can install on
your Windows machine or Linux or Mac or
whatever you're using and my video
though explains how to actually set it
up on Windows but once you actually
install Postgres to your machine if you
run PG admin you're going to see this PG
admin 3 which is like this helpful
little console application that allows
you to interact with your database a lot
easier so if I double click on this and
I type in my password I now have
connection to this database server and
you can see all these are like test
databases that I have inside here and
you can see I already have a new post
database I'm actually going to delete
that
and drop the whole thing I don't want it
but then I'm going to go ahead and
create a new one so I'll say new
database and then I can say a new post
and then I want to give it a database
owner and you create an owner by default
the default owner is Postgres so I'll
just say ok and what this is going to do
is is going to go ahead and create the
database for me and it's a lot easier
than having to go into the Postgres
command line and do like raw commands
and stuff like that so now we have a
database now let's go ahead and create
our Django project so I'm going to get
out of the environment directory and go
into the main new post directory and I'm
going to go ahead and create a project
called we're going to call it post okay
so we're going to say Django admin dot
py which is um this is a file that's
going to be ax accessible now that we've
installed Django and we're going to say
start project host I'll just call it
post and now if we do end of the
directory you can see we now have a an
actual Django application set up which
is a this post so now what i use is
visual studio you can use any sort of
editor that you want but i like Visual
Studio so I'm going to say a new project
or solution
if I go down to other languages here I
can go down I can go to North Python
there's Python and I'll just say from
existing Python code and I need to give
the project a name and let me give it
the right folder too so I'm going to go
down to my new post folder that we just
created so I'll select that and then
we'll just call this post click OK go
next and now this is going to say global
or default so I want to instead of doing
a global installation I wanted to detect
the virtual environment and it looks
like so I actually want to customize
this to a Django
web project and then we'll say finish
all right so now what I need to do with
Visual Studio is I need to right-click
on this and say set as my startup file
so my manage that people I should always
be my startup file if I right-click on
the project and I go to properties in
Visual Studio I can go to my debug panel
here and I can actually give it the port
number that I want it to be set up under
so so every time it runs it will use
port 8000 now the application I don't
think is going to work but let's go
ahead and try it so if I just play it
from my visual studio editor it may run
it may not we'll find out okay so
all right no module name new post
he needs to be my
I see so for some reason the project
name here is named new post and it
thinks that the actual app name is going
to be called new post as well so I
actually need to rename this to post as
the name of the project and that should
work so if I go ahead and run it from
the editor so this is why the editors
are a lot easier to deal with just
because you can just click of a button
and run it and it just it's easier I
guess so this will actually fire up a
Django site normally it's quicker than
this okay so now it's listening on port
8000 so the local host address port 8000
if we look at it we can see that we do
have a Django powered application
running now here's a gotcha
which is a term that means something
that's going to trip you up with Python
3.5 in the latest version of Django
especially using Postgres let's go into
our settings file real quick and we're
going to do our database settings so if
you want let's see so we want to change
this to use our Postgres data so what I
need to do is I actually need to remove
this Django DB all the way to back ends
here and then I'm going to do dot
Postgres will underscore psy CEO PG two
and then we need to give our database a
name so it's called new post we need to
assign a user and the user is going to
be the Postgres user or whoever you have
as the the user of the database that we
created earlier so here's password and
I'll give you guys my password for this
test database it's a hard one to
remember test one two three and it's not
live so I'm not worried about being
hacked or anything in fact I created the
database just for demonstration purposes
so you can see test one two three now
post Postgres is not going to work
without an actual plugin and what we
need to do in order for this to actually
work on a Windows machine at least it
was for relatively recently you need to
download
this psy CEO PG to the basically the
latest version of this psy CEO PG to
module which is the Python module that
makes Postgres work with Python and the
reason why at least as of a couple weeks
ago the latest version of Python was not
working on Windows environment so I had
to manually like basically I couldn't do
pip install and reach across the web and
grab it like for some reason it couldn't
compile or something like that but
ultimately it's easy enough to just be
able to take that that Weil file and
then we're going to put it in our own
environment so here's the new post
folder we created inside environment is
our virtual environment inside live is
the site packages folder and this is
what I was telling you guys about before
this is all for your virtual
environments so this is any sort of
Python module that your project is going
to use so this is the wheel file so this
is the hard core way of just installing
something manually so now let's go into
the environment folder go into live site
packages basically where we just pasted
that full of that file which is right
here this wheel file and I'm going to
say pip install and make sure you're in
your virtual environment pip install psy
Co PG p sy Co PG 2 - 2 dot 6.1 - CP 35 -
none - win32 WHL so if you've ever had
to or if you ever need to manually
install a module that's how you do it
now we need to go to our main root
directory of our folder we're going to
go into the post folder which is
basically the name of our Django
application and what Django does
whenever you create a new application
there's going to be a post module so if
I go into this next post folder in fact
let me show you guys through the through
the editor it's easier so you can see
that we have this this post directory
and inside that it contains a post
older but it also has when you're in
this sequel we don't need that but it
also has this manage that py files so
anything you did with Django whenever
you're doing database updates and stuff
like that you're going to use this
manage py file inside the post is
basically the settings file and the URLs
and the whiskey file and stuff that the
Django needs so that said let's go ahead
and we need to run a command one of the
gotchas with python weight especially
with Django is that the database
migrations need to actually take place
before I could create a super user so
I'll explain that now what I need to do
is say python managed that py and I'm
going to say migrate I had to do migrate
first before I could actually create my
super users and now that I've done that
I can say python managed dot py create a
super user all one word and then here so
I can create like a some sort of
username you can provide your email now
you need to make sure you pet and type
your password right both times and now I
created a super user so now that that
has been done if I go ahead and I play
the project again
so here's the file if I go to forward
slash admin Django has this awesome
built-in admin so I can log in with my
user that I just created and this is
actually logging into my database so you
can see under users it created the super
user who has staff status and this
ultimately this user has authority to
change basically anything in the website
it can create new users and all other
stuff it's just it's so helpful having
this just work out of the box I mean
when you compare Django to flask or MVC
or asp.net or any of that other stuff or
node this is even after years and years
of developing this is just such a
beautiful thing all right guys so now
the next thing we needed to we need to
download bootstrap ok actually before we
even do that let's go to the I'm going
to stop the server I'm going to go to
the directory where the project is
installed inside this post folder I'm
going to create a folder called static
and then I'm also going to create
another folder called templates inside
of our templates we're going to create
actually we'll worry about that later
alright so now with bootstrap I can say
just download this joint this is going
to download it into a zipped up
directory so we're going to unzip the
entire contents of bootstrap which is
fonts CSS and all this stuff
we're extract it and we're going to put
it into projects new post post static I
think that's where it is right alright
so if everything went well and we pull
up our folder inside static we now have
the CSS and all this other stuff so
that's good
now we need to tell Jango where our
templates can be found so and Django 1.9
there's this templates list which
contains key value dictionaries so in in
here they have a directory key and then
the value is actually a list of
different directories on where your
templates can be found so this is just
going to be straight directory to your
templates folder so new post-post
templates that I think is where it is I
down at the bottom we also need to add
our static files directory shorthand and
this is going to help us some if you
just copy and paste this is going to
actually be able to link to our CSS and
everything that we're going to be using
during development that also means that
we need to update our static URL so
we're going to actually give this is
going to be the actual drawn out path to
where we put our static folder so it's
post static okay
I think this is good so now let's go
ahead and since I'm using Visual Studio
this is something that you don't have to
do it but I included in my project next
I'm going to create a folder inside my
templates which is going to be for
layouts and now let's go ahead and
create a new item there's just going to
be just a simple HTML page and I don't
want to call it webpage HTML but we're
going to rename this layout on the table
layout and then under the templates
folder itself we're going to go ahead
and create an HTML page for index and
then I'm inside my index right now we're
going to do this is template
Django's template language so we'll say
extends layout layout dot HTML so what
this does this points to that layout
folder and it basically says hey use
that main layout so that way I only have
to define a complicated layout file one
time so you can see mostly a new post in
fact you what we'll do this block title
and block so Django has the ability to
allow us to use these templates and make
use of of these template tags to just
fill them in so like since index is
extending the layout I can just say
block title and then here I'll just say
home and then any sort of block you
always have to have an in block
statement and then we're going to do
another block for content
and blocking in here we'll just say
it's just a standard message so since
we're going block content let's go ahead
and put that in here all right so now
the the main in depth the layout file
can have all the complicated CSS and
JavaScript and everything and then all
you have to do is do block tags for any
sort of page that implements that master
page and that implementation is being
done there I'm actually missing an
apostrophe that should be in there
should be two apostrophes ER all right
so let's see that should be good let's
go ahead and go to our post our main app
here and we're going to do a URL for the
index so we need to say are I um you
know I think I can just say something
like that that should work
and then here we can say host use dot
index
so I think that'll work so what this
does is a regular expression it means
match anything so if it matches a
basically the root directory of your
your application then it's going to
point it to the index view and right now
we don't even have an index in our post
app so let's go ahead and add a a Python
file so we'll say empty Python file
we'll called views dot py now inside our
view is at the top we're going to say
from Django dot shortcuts import render
and this is just a easy way of being
able to render a template to the user
when they request it so anything in
Django this is um your views file so
it's just a Python method that returns a
template and this request object is
actually the user's information it will
contain things like the user's IP
address and all this other stuff and
that's that's it so we're going to have
this empty dictionary that we're passing
back but we'll get more into that later
but for now let's just go ahead and and
do this and I want to go to run we made
a lot of changes let's see if I've
tripped up on anything here because I'm
just going off the cuff here
oh here's my yeah as I referenced a
variable here that I didn't define
because I copied and pasted that from
another project I forgot to actually
define it but let's just go ahead and um
we're just gonna get there straight path
to our application here so just go just
like we did before there's going to go
right to the static folder and really
crap really it can be this same path to
our static folder just put it here I
don't need that comma either alright
sorry about that so let's go ahead and
stop this and rerun it
all right so now you can see we actually
have our web page being rendered to our
templates and all that stuff is working
so that's good now if you're on Windows
and especially if you're using Visual
Studio and you notice this weird gap in
chrome it's a weird issue and I'm
probably going to save you a ton of time
if you've ever had this problem but all
you have to do is go over to file for
the layout page and go file
the advanced state of options I feel
like that wasn't just showing okay and
then go all the way down to the bottom
and just a Unicode without signature
it's so weird you have to do that and
now if I save it if I went back to this
you can see the weird gap the freaking
sites not running out I stopped it we
all see that that gap has gone away that
took forever to figure out in fact I
posted a question on Stack Overflow even
at a video like demonstrating the
problem as far as I know nobody else
really runs into this situation and
that's the solution so I ended up
figuring that out for myself that was a
long time ago
and I think I just got lucky kind of
guessing but now if I am if I inspect
element you'll see that that weird gap
issue isn't there anymore
see how it's gone so that said all right
so now our templates are working
everything so let's go ahead and make
use of our see um let's make use of our
bootstrap stuff and just make sure that
that is working so if I say link href
equal and then here's what it's nice to
be able to use the static keyword that
comes with Django so I can say CSS and
basically there's just a shortcut that
jumps right to the static folder and the
reason why this is nice is because you
just have to define where that static
folder is in your settings file and you
can change you can move this Django
project somewhere else
some other machine some other operating
system and just update that that value
and ideally everything should be able to
work so you don't have all these
absolute hard-coded paths all over the
place you have to update manually
anytime you change stuff around alright
so now that we have this is standard
bootstrap Styles here and class names
and everything
so if I give a div class container this
should like Center the content in the
middle all right let's see if this works
I really need to just keep the site
running
okay so we have a new error here this is
it says did you forget the static tag so
this actually trips up a lot of people
too but anytime you're using that static
keyboard that I was telling you about
the first thing you need to do at the
top of your page is say load static
files
all right so let's say so for some
reason though
so you can see our bootstrap is not
loading so let's take a look here
so let's see if that's even where the
file is
oh yes you have a typo boo trap okay how
does that say why is that not working so
you can see it's there's a typo right
there some bootstrap still a typo big
typo all right
all right so now you can see the
different bootstrap style centered
content all that stuff so anyway guys um
we now have a pretty good website going
in Django so that's pretty sweet
and this Django 1.9 Python 3.5 and
