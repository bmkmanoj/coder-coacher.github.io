this video we need to make a few updates
to our site one of the things number one
you can see how this thing disappears
but when you scroll it comes back if we
inspect the element and we go over the
navbar up to the top so if I have the
navbar highlighter you can see it has a
background color of transparent under
this agency dot CSS so if I get rid of
that eight that transparency it kind of
grows and shrinks I'm not sure why it
does that it's probably partly by design
but for right now I won't worry about
that too much I think it's the actually
don't I don't know if top of my head why
it's doing that but I could figure it
out and enough time I'm not gonna mess
with it right now I don't really care so
let's go into the agency dot CSS though
and change that so here it is right here
that's the minified version which I
think it's using the minified version
that sucks
hmm that's probably part of the you know
using the template is that it's gonna
have it all minifides so that's gonna
make it a little bit more difficult to
deal with all right so that's why
everything's on CSS line one tube is
it's all meta fide into one just one
line alright let me see if I can do a
search on this
all right so this is gonna be a real
pain in the ass to mess with in the
future but right now I'm just gonna go
ahead and get rid of this background
color what you want to do if you run
into a situation like this is that there
are just websites that will unmanned
Afiya code put it all on you know its
own lines and stuff so it's not so
difficult to look at and that's
ultimately what you're going to do but
by us changing that code you can see
that it now is a solid navbar so it
doesn't you know it's not missing or
whatever so another thing down here is
that these should have social icons and
they they're not there so the reason why
is because if we look at our layout file
we're actually missing or and this is my
fault I forgot to add one of their
statics and you can see over by the
fonts yeah right here so this it needs
to be we need to use the static helper
tool
so now we have our little icon showing
up so that's cool as far as the growing
and shrinking and stuff yeah I'm
definitely have to change that because
that kind of sucks so I've said this
before but I'm one of the sites that I
go to actually to give photography as I
stock photography I usually never really
buy images I try to get the free ones
but unfortunately you just can't get the
same quality when it comes to like a
full-blown like you know high-resolution
image there are some free ones out there
but the really good ones you're gonna
end up paying for and really it's it's
not the end of the world I mean it's
like twelve bucks maybe sixteen dollars
at the most for an image that you can
use on your website to show everybody so
like if you're gonna have like a main
website you know like this with a big
image you know for me this is a
programming tutorial related website so
I want to I want to have that you know
some sort of coding or computer or
something just stand out so I went ahead
and purchased what I felt like was a
relatively professional-looking image to
show people working on the computer it's
really all I'm really going for here so
I went ahead and I copied it to my
project folder and since I've done that
what I need to do is actually resize it
because I'm I stock photography you can
download the big images I just went
ahead and downloaded a big one even
though I know that you don't want to use
a really large image on a website
because you got to think about you know
wireless networks cell phones having to
download humongous images like this
image that I bought is something like 7
Meg or something like that so it's
really big and with Photoshop what I can
do is I can actually resize it to
something a little bit more reasonable
so really I'm gonna have it be 600
pixels wide so it is gonna be a large
image and that might be too large I'll
have to check out what happens to the
page speed but once I resize it I can
say save for the web and then this
should be able to optimize it so we'll
just call this header VG so I'm gonna be
replacing what I have there
and now
so you can see I feel like the site is
good but we obviously have to do
something about you know the text
because this is a lighter image than the
darker one that we had before so I'm
going to need to you know tinker with
this text a little bit here to make it
probably darker
it's really what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
add color I'll just change it black for
right now in fact I will go zero zero
zero that way I can click on this little
color box
this is not working as well as I was
hoping right
so it's gonna take a little bit of
tinkering here too I might even want it
to be the same as that
yeah we're just gonna do it the same as
that right now so as we've done this
before I can just go ahead and copy this
entire this entire thing and we're gonna
use main dot CSS to actually overwrite
well let me think all right you know
what we're gonna do this right away
we're gonna agency CSS we're gonna copy
all this and I search that into Google
will see how well this unmanned files
here see this is easy as that now I can
copy that and I'm gonna replace all of
that with the unmodified stuff because
this is just redonkulous you'll probably
want to minify it again for production
but now you can see everything's on
different lines and stuff so we don't
have see this will tell me right here
300 line 300 so I gotta find 300 and of
course I don't have line showing up on
my text editor so let me see a general
if I want to add lines I got a general
all languages show line numbers all
right so I think it's excuse me I'm
joking so I think I said line 300 all
right now we're just gonna add the color
here
all right
so for this intro text I don't really
need all this but I'm going to say start
learning today and then this says tell
me more just probably for right now I
just have this link to the tutorials
page
now this is a rather suspect thing but
for border and for browsers that support
text outlining I can use this Web on
this WebKit text outline so this
probably only works on Google I'm not a
Google Chrome I'm not 100% sure I'll
have to test it on a cell phone later
but for right now I do want to give a
little bit more oomph to the the text to
make it stand out a little bit better on
the image I really feel like the you
know the text outline allows it to be
seen a little bit better as you can see
here now since this is a main page and
it's supposed to be rather relatively
professional-looking I think the
services I need to go ahead and you know
lift some services of why you'd want to
use this website and really in case I
haven't explained that this entire
website is gonna be geared towards my
programming channel so you know trying
to interact with you guys not just with
coding tutorials and examples and stuff
like that but also just you know the
typical vlogs and stuff just to kind of
you know interact with you guys a little
bit more than just a YouTube channel
alone in addition I'd like to go ahead
and start making more content more
tutorial related videos and you know I
hope I hope for the best there but
that's that's basically what this
platform is all about now because some
of these content sections don't really
fit I'm gonna go ahead and just I'm
going to comment them out just in case I
do need to use them because I'm a I
really like the style and stuff but you
should never just try to pigeonhole
something and even though or just
because you like the way it looks so
here I can put this entire thing in a
HTML comment here
in fact I don't even need to do it that
way all you have to do is as I'm doing
it I'm just kicking this line here at
the end part
just put it down here
yeah like I said I mean just because um
you know it's there looks good doesn't
mean that we should use it if it doesn't
fit
alright now I'm also gonna do that to
this services section because I really
don't need that either not right now
anyway so for the most part this entire
home page is just going to showcase some
of the tutorials
alright so now I'm just gonna change
portfolio will call this tutorials
this'll just be a placeholder I should
probably say something there but as I
just said text to come so now we need to
go ahead and incorporate what we had
done before where we would displayed
some tutorials and everything inside of
our templates so we're going to go ahead
and do that now
the unfortunate thing too is that it's
not going to look as pretty as what
these images look like unfortunately but
it is what it is so it's let's go ahead
and get that done
so I'm going to go ahead and get rid of
every one of these things
actually I didn't work at all
all right so there's Roe so basically
all of these need to go
because what we're going to use is we're
gonna use Django to repeat this section
for every item for every tutorial that
we have in the the main page here so if
we go to our views and we look at what
we're sending back on the index page
we're looking at our tutorials so we're
sending that down to the template so if
I go into the index on this section
since this is where I'm going to repeat
I'm going to say for tutorial and
tutorials I probably want to indent all
of this
okay
so in this case we're going to say down
here we're going to display the tutorial
dot title and then here this is going to
be the tutorial dot description I think
is what I called it and then here the
image is going to be something that
needs to point to the the YouTube image
so here I'm going to paste this and this
is where the YouTube IDs gonna be but
this one's gonna say YouTube or tutorial
videos dot all dot 0 dot YouTube ID now
the reason why we have to do this is if
you remember from the earlier videos
that we had a many-to-many relationship
so a tutorial can contain many videos
because I'd only need to display one one
of those videos images which comes from
YouTube the thumbnail I just want to
grab the first video in that collection
of videos that's attached to the
tutorial to use as the image to display
so that's a little bit complicated I'm
sure to any sort of newbies that are
following along but that's what I'm
doing there
and as you can see it works pretty well
now I would argue that the thumbnails
probably aren't that good
you know this whole black in the
background I'm not there's sure there's
a whole lot I can do about that I think
that's actually coming from YouTube
itself which kind of blows but um
yeah there's not really much I can do
about that if I try to change the height
that's not gonna do anything yeah that's
definitely coming from YouTube itself I
believe yeah see if you highlight over
the image you can see that that black
border and everything is coming from
YouTube so I think if anything that
might be a you know and a basically a
warning to me you know or heads-up to me
that I need to make my thumbnail images
bigger because they look like shite on
on this this website so I'll try to keep
that in mind for the future so if you
just take a note of what's going on here
we're displaying the title we're
displaying the tutorial description and
that's about it and then we display the
image now you can't click on it
in fact clicking on it is doing some
some weirdness as far as pulling up this
this modal so where's that even coming
from
so the the modal appears to be coming
from here the data toggle modal so I'm
gonna get rid of that just see if I can
stop that pop-up from occurring because
ideally what we want to do is we want
instead of the pop-up we want when they
click on it it's going to take them to a
different web page just for that
tutorial which where it's going to list
all the the tutorial videos so now we're
going to do that in the next video
because that's going to take a little
bit of work for us to accomplish alright
