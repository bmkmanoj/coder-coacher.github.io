series and in this series what we're
gonna look at is the well in the past
videos let's just touch on real quick we
made our actions which can fire one one
function and it's the add its the add
action and then the add action calls the
reducer which thing gets executed and it
modifies the state so the reducer files
within redux should be the only files
that actually are mutating your state
but now we need to define the store that
this global state is going to be stored
in no pun intended
so it's going to create a new file that
we call store jas alright so in here we
need to do some import so we're gonna
say import and we're actually importing
create store make sure that there is a
capital s here that's camel case from
redox so we're pulling this in from the
redox library now we're going to say
import counter app and once again this
is camel case from and then here we're
gonna say dot forward slash reducers and
that way it's importing here now we're
gonna say let and let is a new lexically
scoped variable named for javascript so
it's like two VAR keyword but it's Lex
Lex lis scoped so I'm not going to go
into that explanation but that's another
new feature now we're gonna say create
store so we're using this create store
function from the redux library and we
need to pass in our actual main reducer
which is our counter app and then we
want to pass in actually note I'm gonna
leave that off right now we're gonna get
back to that and I'm gonna say export
default store alright so that's it for
the store and in the next video we're
actually going to work on modifying
we're gonna create our first our Redux
component basically alright guys thanks
for watching
by hey guys so a lot of you asked me how
do I get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just wanna take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
bootcamp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in the suevi course it's geared
to get you into the industry by focusing
on things like jQuery nodejs react
angular how to use github so a lot of
the things that you're going to need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're going to be teaching you in this
and this coding bootcamp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
