just wanted to take a moment to answer a
question about what kind of a computer
does the programmer need and I wish I
actually said I I wish I would have
showed you guys like the video to
computer that I bought just recently I
decided to upgrade a PC that I was using
and the point that I want to drill home
here is that one of the good things
about programming like you're writing
Python you're writing JavaScript c-sharp
whatever it is you don't need like a
fantastic computer it's not like you
grew up creating cutting-edge 3d
applications now if you're going to be
doing a lot of game processing Unity
engine unreal engine things like that
and you're trying to really make a
triple-a title you know at that point
you need to have a pretty beefed up
graphics card but for the most part like
if you're just writing code and things
like that you can use like the bass
taking a run-of-the-mill piece of
computer that needs to be upgraded five
years ago if you wanted to and you'd
still be able to learn just fine as long
as you have an internet connection
that's really the most important thing
now actually no there are exceptions to
that don't get one of those netbooks you
know little Intel Core $300 little
laptops from from Walmart that's not you
just don't do that please I mean you're
much better off getting like it's just a
desktop and an old monitor from a thrift
store or something before you did that
but so with my computer lent man for the
longest time I was making a lot of money
and learning a lot on just a simple
I had an HP Envy that I bought a few
years ago I paid $5.99 for and I bought
it in the store now one of the things
that I do is I end up going into the
store I don't know what the hell this
was HP Envy desktop i usually go into
the store because you know i make bad
decisions and i like to to get what it
is that i want that you know right away
so I can you know take it home with me
and things like that for those reasons I
actually I really hate you know this
modern day all the stores are closing
because you know Amazon can sell
something online type of thing there's
convenience to online but there's
nothing better than going to an
electronic store like that's why
grabbing you know 55 inch plasma TV or
cdtv with quantum dots and you know that
you can't do that on Amazon man until
stores be able to do that like I don't
know I do not want like an all internet
world I think that we're going to
eventually have a mix of like you know
Walmart's going to have better logistics
were and they already do it so you can
buy online and pick it up in the store
like two night today and that's what I
do even was I Best Buy of order things
and pick it up within an hour so last
weekend I went ahead and I was like you
know I'm getting the new computer so I
went and I bought a cheaper brand of
computer which wasn't cheap at all this
is just for the desktop you can see the
prices on sale it was 17 49 so I bought
this I buy power because it has the best
of the best in even though I'm not much
of a video gamer on PC or anything I
hardly ever play video games on PC this
graphics card right here is like I mean
this thing is beast for for the
standards right now like I'm sure that
there are better graphics cards and
things like that but this GTX penaity
you're not going to find much better
than that and like a prebuilt PC I mean
even see just did card itself is 549 so
I bought this computer and it was cool
it had like liquid cooling and
everything I've never seen that before
although it makes me paranoid like what
happens when those things spring a leak
like they do in cars all the time then
you get your all your electronics all
wet and everything and probably just
Fry's not just one piece to be put out
all of it so there's peace with it so I
set it up it was cool flashes different
colors I had like a glass case you can
see into the side of it everything and I
know I set it up spent hours like you
know getting all my content onto it
everything and then yesterday man the
hard drive just quit like it went into
like a boot loop like I read about it
online other people have had the issue
some of the red flags that point out to
me is like nobody had ever opened up
this and this machine in the Box not
that I could tell because it was
perfectly assembled and everything I
take it out of the box and it tells me
to take the glass casing off so I can
take all the packaging material out of
the inside of it but there was no
packaging material on the inside of it
so it's like that thing probably got the
 kicked out of it going across the
United States and and it really wouldn't
been that big of a deal until like I
ended up I tried to run a game on it do
it and like even the game
for whatever reason on gtx NAA like it
seemed long or like laggy in like not
not nearly as what it like it as well as
i was expecting for something that cost
this much money we had this kind of you
know seven generation i7 like there
wasn't we don't get much better specs
than that and it was it was still
running a basic game pretty buggy so i
ended up about restarting at that point
and that's when I went into this boot
loop there the hard drive is fried
nobody could not nothing could be done
so I ended up taking apart and I was
like you'd have had to sing one week I
even tried to buy a call to ibuypower
people and they're like oh we're closed
nobody here to talk to you about it but
well so I just said this I'm taking
it back and I got all my $1,600 back and
ended up replacing it with this
Alienware so a lot of people don't like
Dell dude but I'll tell you like Dell
has been pretty reliable for me both
Dell and HP I had an Acer laptop a
couple years ago and they had Windows 8
on it and literally nits died within on
the thirteenth month and I only had a
one year limited manufacturer's warranty
so I'll never buy another Acer for that
purpose at least on Acer laptop but I
still prefer desktop over laptop some of
you guys are crazy that you want to
develop on a laptop I understand like
being able to take it wherever you want
but when it comes to getting like a
legit amount of work done nothing better
to me than an actual desktop now this
was $100 off so I paid thirty thirteen
ninety nine for but so this was cheaper
for me alien wear is a much better brand
than then I buy power and although it
has one step behind on the graphics
cards I don't really need those
capabilities in any way and really you
guys could have ended up just getting
something like this feel like I would
have no problem with this but I did have
a little bit extra money to spend I
wanted to I wanted to get it boosted up
graphics card so you really pay a lot
more for the graphics card but you know
something like this is also very well
you can see it's got the two terabyte
hard drive but it's going to have a much
less scaled-back graphics card in here
let's do graphics on this thing you can
see it's also a sixth generation i7 so
that's another issue there I don't even
see the graphics card
either way this thing's not built for
gaming those so if you guys are gamers
you clearly know that you know you have
to buy something like in the daily where
I buy power or something - or build them
yourself a lot of people like to build
themselves once again I like to be able
to just go and pick it up so I be able
to do that but now this thing is beast
oh so if you compare this computer like
right now like my video rendering my
gaming everything is much faster on this
machine in the ibuypower now maybe it's
because that I buy power had it was
defective from you know out of the box
but I mean it did boot up and it did run
and it was pretty cool but it definitely
like I said for a graphics card is
supposed to be a lot better about 25
percent faster than the 1070 I'm
noticing faster video rendering and just
a much smoother experience on this this
Alienware here so I would definitely
recommend it over the other machine
alright guys so anyway yeah this it
doesn't matter what kind of computer you
have as long as you have internet
alright thanks for listening to blab
about my new computer I'm excited
all right guys bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention Death
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
