unusual video for me usually I do
tutorial series and try to explain
step-by-step how to do something but I
typically want to understand what it is
and I'm doing before I do that and in
this particular case I was just dabbling
in with react native Android I've been
very excited about that project I want
to get into it however I wanted to avoid
the actual installation hassle of trying
to you know explain that as part of the
tutorial series because typically you
get people off on the wrong foot they
get upset because they you know their
machine is different than yours and
something like this is a major pain in
the ass to get set up by the way at
least it was for me on a Windows 8.1
machine but here I have a Windows 8.1
machine and I was just going to tell you
based on the instructions and how I
decipher alright so here's the the first
things first is that it asks that you
have get installed I have I haven't
actually had to use git yet but I have
had get installed so I use github has an
installer so if you want to use a
install git you may want to just go to
github and look at the installation
procedure there that would probably be
my recommendation I had already done
that a long time ago so I didn't have to
install get for my machine and to be
honest with you I don't even know that
it needed to use it for this
installation I think this is just
telling you in general that you need to
have that on your machine so the next
thing you do have to have the JDK so
what that means is obviously you have to
have the Java and Java development kit
so I just went ahead and for a Windows
machine I grabbed the 64 bit version
which is the installer so I definitely
did have to install that and then you
have to install the Android SDK so you
have the option of using the Android the
standalone SDK which means you can use
Eclipse or whatever sort of development
environment you want to use I would
recommend you just use Android studio
because I had some issues with the SDK
alone with other environments of trying
to figure out how to get these this
genymotion which I'll mention in just a
moment but I think it's best you just
install the Android studio if you're
just getting started and you want to get
this thing working so once I installed
Android studio you have to add Android
home to your environment variable
and it needs to point to where Android
studio was installed so let me give you
my environment variable here so if you
want to go look at your environment
there a variable you go to your control
panel and then go to system and security
and go to system advanced system
settings environment variables and then
down here I created one so I said new
and I gave it that android home and then
the value but the value needs to point
to the Android SDK for Android studio so
let me look at where there's this so
here's the Android home so I created
that just like it wanted me to here
Android home and then I gave it a path
so if I said edit now this is pointing
to where the Android SDK is installed so
you can see that it's on my users which
is where it installed by default so I'm
pointing to the Android SDK and that's
where it needs to go so a lot of I think
there was some question with where that
was and at least I had that question I
didn't know where that got put so that's
what I needed to do next thing they
recommend you install Gradle to speed up
development time because apparently it
can improve it by 50% but I'm not
worried about that right now I feel like
there's enough hassle with just getting
everything else set up so you don't need
to worry about that at the moment and
then it says configure your SDK this is
important because when I installed
Android studio it didn't actually
install all of this stuff and it's
important that in order for this thing
to work with getting motion you do have
all this stuff installed so make sure
you pay attention to all of this and
then and make sure that that it gets
installed now when you have Android
studio running in order to be able to
see that let me close this real quick
you want to go to file and then go to
settings and I'm actually trying to
remember where I think it was appearance
and behavior system settings so here's
down here is the Android SDK and then
you can say launch standalone SDK
manager remember that's what I did so
you want to pull that up so you can get
same type of image that shows up on the
installation instructions and then you
know it's a little bit easier so it
pulls this guy up where's it at Motel
oh hey there it is okay so now it pulls
this guy up so that way it matches the
image that's what you want to do it
actually pulled up two of them I don't
know why it didn't pull up for me but
you can see it's important that you have
those same folders installed because
make sure you check that because Android
studio did not get everything I needed
set up in order for this to happen so
let's see so now you go down here so any
motion it's probably best that you don't
try to set up your own emulator honestly
I tried to do this this hyper-v thing
isn't gonna work for Windows unless you
actually have a Windows 10 or something
all I know is Windows 8.1 that wasn't
gonna work I could have done this stock
Google emulator but I don't know
anything about this and it looked like
it was more work than necessary so I
would just recommend you install
genymotion because it is free for
personal use and to be honest if you
decide that it's a good product there's
only like 140 dollars of for an indie
license per year I mean that's really
not it's not terrible guys I mean if
you're gonna be serious about trying to
pump out some Android iOS apps and stuff
like that then you may yeah that's
really it's a bargain unless something
easier comes along but it certainly
hasn't I don't know of anything easier
at this moment so you download and
install Guinee motion now any motion is
going to require that you also have
something called Oracle virtual machine
installed so it'll tell you you know the
Oracle VirtualBox is what it's called so
you do need to have that installed as
well but I was confused because once you
install it it opens it up and it asked
you to create a virtual machine and all
that you don't have to do any of that so
don't even worry about you can just go
ahead and close it after you install
VirtualBox you don't need to do anything
more with that now with Android studio
what you want to do is you want to
actually install so go to file settings
and then you let's see where's plugins I
think it is you have plugins and you're
gonna want to go down to browse
repositories and then if you go all the
way down to genymotion there's a Guinea
motion plug-in and this is one of the
main reasons why I said Android studio
would be the best option because you can
just install this plug-in right here
restart your Android studio so you can
see I already have mine and
but once you install it yeah there'll be
a button over here when you click on it
to install it so install it then go
ahead and just shut down Android studio
reopen it and then you're gonna have
this little button up here to launch
there a Guinea motion now now you can
see that this particular app right here
is actually running the code so I'll get
into that in just a moment so let me
close that down real quick but once you
have guinea motion installed you're
gonna have this little GUI and you need
to just click add and then this is where
you can actually add whatever sort of
Android device you want to run on your
machine so you can see I have Samsung's
six and Google Nexus seven I had a
problem with Samsung six and by Google
Nexus 7 is actually working just fine so
if you clicked started we actually run
just fine but yeah that's good so you
could actually launch it right from
right from your Android studio which is
really good now next you also need to go
through the process of how to get
started with Android so if you go to the
tutorial series this is actually going
to explain step by step how you can go
ahead and install you need to use NPM so
if you don't have MPM installed you need
to have node installed which comes with
NPM and node has a Windows installer as
well which makes it really easy but you
just do NPM and then this.g make sure it
installs it globally so this react
native CLI it allows you to use this
command react native vine it awesome
project and that's gonna actually go
through and download all of the react
stuff the rack native stuff that you
need in order for the Android app to run
and it tells you that you know the name
of this awesome project is a a project
where you would put it in your you know
in your computer wherever you want the
project to live so like I put mine under
projects and then I have a react native
react native so you can see the awesome
project in here so then I have all this
code that was created so I just used the
inet command but Android studio allows
you to open up an existing project so
you can
see it opened up the awesome project
this was actually made in the same way
through the eye net command from the
command line using those instructions
that I just showed you using these
instructions right here anyway guys so
it was a headache I think this might
save somebody some time it's not your
your typical let me walk you through
this step by step but basically the
instructions walk you through and this
video is just kind of help you out
because I feel like the instructions are
a little bit lacking here and there as
far as you know the best way to actually
get this thing up and running on Windows
because it's not an easy process and and
normally we just want to start getting
in and start coding and yeah and the
setup just sucks I mean unfortunately
alright guys thanks for watching please
subscribe please vote up and have a good
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
