trial run I went ahead and upgraded the
mic and to be honest with you I haven't
spent any time with it to figure out
what I should do the one thing that's
disappointing though is that I don't
know that I can attach a mic to this
it's probably something I should thought
about before I even bought a goddamn
thing but how many should be fine anyway
but in this video I got this guy named
John he always he always comments he
does great comments but for some reason
youtube doesn't let me respond to him
and i'm not sure why it says that he
edited the comments and maybe youtube's
not letting me just because it's edited
i don't know but he was responding to
the the android job that i was talking
about that didn't go very well and he
was saying that that is one of the
reasons why age 40 he gave up on being a
developer for a company instead he's
actually focusing on growing his own
startup so he said i don't know but at
some age that there is something sad
about being a programmer with all these
kids in the office amateur blabbering
24-7 about this tack and this new
framework arguing that one proverbial
hammer is better than a screwdriver he
says so he's I guess approaching 40 or
he already has and he was basically
suggesting that I focus on managerial
positions or starting my own company he
says life is too short there's no safety
anyway so I would agree with that there
is no safety and anything that we do I
will say though that I've already
started my own company in fact i think
it was twenty eight nine when i started
this company which i still have in fact
the company acts as the owner of all
this YouTube content as well so like
when when Google you know any sort of
advertising revenue and stuff like that
this channel makes it goes to the
company and has to be reported so the
company is also trying to do several
different things like you guys know I
tried the hipster code thing I haven't
really given up on that but to be honest
after I build a project like that I
always I feel like I push a little bit
too far then I have to take a few steps
back and just some just kinda you know
regroup a little bit because I'm not a
hundred percent sure what I'm going to
do with
website but I still plan on doing
tutorials but one of the things that
will say about tutorials is that there's
a lot of competition out there and some
of the stuff that I do is I do it from
my own learning experience so it's not
the best that I you know I try to turn
around and teach somebody else on
something that I don't know that well
myself and there's a lot of guys on
YouTube that do that in fact I know it
got a lot of guys in fact one guy in
particular makes a lot of money doing it
that way and there's no way you can be
an expert in all of those things so you
can either scrape the surface on a bunch
of Technology and do tutorials that way
which I mean there's really nothing fun
really nothing wrong with that in some
sense because you know some people just
like the the teaching style that certain
people have and honestly it's probably
the only thing that I have as well you
know because I'm not a perfect teacher
when it comes to some of this stuff but
um the tutorials are something that I'll
probably continue to do but just really
for my own enjoyment the channel that
I'm working on now is mostly mostly just
talking about technology and stuff so I
plan on continuing to do that now he was
also talking about trying to get into
managerial positions and things of that
nature but right now I haven't even been
an actual programming leads so I think I
have a long way to go and not in that
regard but I think that he is right like
once you start getting older you want to
be with a company that offers the
ability for you to be able to lead teams
eventually maybe get into managerial
positions the real question is going to
be whether or not a degree holds you
back so in my case I'm not sure if some
of you guys are aware but I've been
going to school for a two-year
associate's degree in business
administration for quite some time now
literally six years or more just trying
to give my 60 credits I mean I know that
that's a long time but to be honest I
mean that in that time frame I've taught
myself how to be a programmer to be able
to land a full-time gig and you know
obviously doing this channel and other
things that I've worked on along the way
and then on top of all of that you know
full-time job wife and kids and you know
house responsibilities all kinds of
stuff so if you're like well why the
hell is it taking six years and get your
degree I mean well that's the reason and
to be
honest with you I I'm kind of just going
through the motions to check off a box
on a piece of paper that most people
probably don't even care about God keep
getting texts um you know most people
probably don't even care anyway about it
to your degree unfortunately they want
to see that four-year degree so in some
ways it's just I question whether or not
I actually even finish but at this point
I think at four classes left so I will
finish that but the real question for
somebody like me is the lack of a debris
going to hold me back so even if I have
a successful YouTube channel or a
successful company because it is a large
corporation are they going to just
immediately close the door on me because
I don't have the degree below well
you're not going to ever be a manager
here so i think that's yet to be seen on
on my end one of the guys that i truly
new admirer is as far as like how he's
living now and I don't really know him
personally or anything like that is
Johnson mess because he retired
essentially at 33 now obviously he's
doing his channel and other things like
that but I mean this dude gets invited
to talk that is a marine conference that
was in arlington virginia and you know
one of the the guest speakers at that
convention was steve wozniak one of the
creators of apple and really the brains
behind the first Apple Computer I'm
really the only reason why I think you
left that company because he got into a
plane crash in the early 80s and we
almost died but um you know he gets to
attend conferences he retires at 33 he
made a boatload of cash i believe on
laurel site and and that's one thing if
you guys wanted out like when we talk
about competition and programming
tutorials and stuff like that like
pluralsight is doing a pretty good job
providing that content so the only
downside that pluralsight is that it's
not free you're going to pay 30 bucks a
month which is a lot for a lot of
developers that are trying to get off
the ground but yeah John I can't respond
to you for some reason because of the
way you tube has this setup setup but um
yeah that is something that I've thought
about as far as trying to get into more
of them into
ship and an even doing what I'm doing on
this YouTube tutorial series just trying
to make sure I stay relevant a lot of
people don't stay relevant and I think
that that's a major issue and they in
the industry so thanks for the comment
man sorry I couldn't respond</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
