this video we're going to be adding our
actual template to our website and I'm
not a UX designer so I don't actually
spend a whole lot of time trying to
evaluate how to be like an artist I'm
really I don't really have artistic
creativity when it comes to colors and
how they make people feel and stuff like
that so I leave that up to the experts
in that industry I consider myself more
of a programmer as opposed to a designer
but there are some people that can do
some really excellent designs and stuff
like that and and bootstrap makes that a
lot easier so we're going to go ahead
and use a simple freelancer bootstrap
theme which has been around for a long
time now probably a million sites use
this thing and probably don't even adapt
it all that much in fact you see so many
sites with this same alternating 100%
with layout it's actually it's a little
bit annoying at this point because even
major companies that can afford to you
know try to push the envelope with their
design just kind of fall back to a
regular bootstrap and be like everybody
else
so either way we're not going to go into
that too much but this is going to be
our starting point so at least we can
then just kind of adapt some of this
stuff and really just follow the flock
of people that do the same thing so I
mean it is professional and
unfortunately if you don't do that
unless you're a real good designer
you're going to end up spending a ton of
time trying to trying to build something
that probably won't even look this good
once you're done so it's this will save
us a lot of time by just using something
like this and it is completely free so
what we would do if you wanted to use a
different template you could always try
to follow along similar to what I'm
doing here but we're going to download
the template and it's actually going to
download an entire directory which will
contain CSS files and J's files and all
kinds of different stuff so as like even
a font awesome and they actually have
image IMG instead of images I really
hate that but that's fine now they even
have less and all this stuff you know it
for right now and we're going to take
the entire thing at least all this CSS
and mail every all the directories
inside there let's go ahead and extract
that and we need to find our project so
that we can extract it to the right
directory we're going to be extracting
into the static directory in our Flast
project so here's I'm in my static
directory and let's just go ahead and
say ok now one thing we need to do is we
need to pull up the directory and since
we have an images fot a folder let's get
rid of our images folder we'll just go
with the IMG for images instead ok so we
now have all these files now we need to
put the template inside of our templates
folder so this index is going to be
extracted to the same thing static
except for static it's going to be
templates so change the static word to
templates so now index lives under our
templates folder and you can see we now
have index let's go ahead and change our
project so instead of pointing to this
add user let's have it point to the
index folder or file and typically with
projects um you're going to find that
the home page is called index so we'll
go to our app top UI and
this index will change from adduser to
index now things probably aren't going
to work right out of the box but let's
go ahead and take a look here
so you can see that we have all these
these 500 errors we're really I'm sorry
four or four errors that means page not
found so there's a ton of stuff in here
that can't be found and the reason why
is it's trying to point to like image
and all this stuff instead of static
image everything sits in our static
folder so all these directories that
it's trying to point your need to be
changed to static so really the first
place we're going to do to try to update
some of that is we need to pull up our
index index file and here with my
project I actually need to add this
explicitly by saying add existing item
and then add my index so it shows up
here so if I double click on it I can
now see the contents of that file and we
need to go ahead and change all these
paths that that can't be found starting
with this one needs to be forward slash
static the forward slash initially means
root directory so we know that static is
always going to exist in our root
directory if we start embedding
templates and the other folders like we
have a folder for movie templates and
user templates and all that other stuff
if I don't do that forward slash it's
going to be even end up having path
problems so it's always good to try to
have an absolute path from your root
directory so let's just copy this entire
part just ctrl C and copy it because
we're going to be replacing that for
every other URL that we find here
so really let's look for all the images
in our template shoot sorry any any
image source we need to append that so
that the image can be found
so we're just going to go through the
through this entire folder and change
all those sources so that way they can
find the images
all right so now I'm going to make sure
we go all the way down to the footer
because a lot of times they'll have yeah
here's another image down here
all right so we're getting there
all right let me need to change all
these paths so they can be found
alright let's go ahead and see how many
four or four errors we get now since
we've changed all those paths it looks
like we have some some images showing up
so that's that's good I guess it's
partly good so now it's saying that's
still missing the bootstraps I'm not
sure what I missed that let's look for
bootstrap in here
oh yeah I missed it right here alright
so we'll add this to both the CSS files
save it and let's go ahead and try to
refresh it again see what kind of
results we have all right so that's
starting to look like a much better
website now and in fact looks like we're
we're done
alright guys sweet so now we have a
professional-looking template being
rendered by flask and it didn't take us
very long at all
all we had to do was find a free
template download and extract it to our
static directory and then change all the
endpoints that point to folders that
that need to be pointed to like
JavaScript and CSS and images and by
doing that we now have this working
application that we can or working
template that we can start to kind of
mold to our individual needs alright
guys thanks for watching and please
subscribe have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
