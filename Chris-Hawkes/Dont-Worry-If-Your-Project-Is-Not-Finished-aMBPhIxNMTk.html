what I wanted to talk about tonight is a
lot of times when we're trying to build
a project we're trying to make it
perfect when it would like right out of
the gate we wanted to be perfect and
sometimes we're afraid to share the new
projects and things that we're working
on with other people and we're like you
know don't judge it yet because it's
only halfway done all this stuff but but
here's the one of the key things if you
look back to what Google looked like
when it first came out and how it
operated compared to how it operates
today or if you look at even YouTube
when it first came out and you look at
it today or even Facebook if you look at
the first prototype of facebook when it
went public when Zuckerberg went public
in 2004 whatever that was the product
looked like and honestly like when
Google first came out in fact when
Google when Larry Page had his idea for
page rank he tried to write it in java
the java language and the late 90s or
mid mid to late 90s and 98 or so and
java was relatively new language was
still very buggy so either up getting
this guy like a son or something last
name hassan but he went to Stanford with
larry page and Larry Page ended up
rewriting the search engine and Google
but the whole thing is that Larry Page
even though he's a brilliant genius guy
like his first prototype was complete
 so now I'm not trying to come and
just just so you guys know I'm not
trying to say that like anything I've
ever done is is at that level but i do
want to take a moment to kind of show
you guys how this channel has matured
from you know getting back here three
and a half years ago when i first
started this compared to now and you
know the level of effort that I try to
put into the videos to try to reach out
to you guys it's actually quite funny if
if you just kind of look at my demeanor
for instance let me go ahead and play
this uh this first video here this is a
video where I'm talking about Python
beautiful soup and just you know right
out of the gate I mean I sound like I'm
either half stoned or half asleep and
I'm neither one of those by the way but
that was kind of the approach that I was
taking back then that I was kind of
taking a blue collar let me teach you
how to program approach because that's
kind of the effort that I put you know
the route that I took when I was first
getting started however if I look back
at like three and a half years ago when
I was first doing this number one I did
not know to make tutorials that anymore
researchers properly I certainly wasn't
an educator and you know clearly I had
no plan when it like when it came to the
videos and in fact some of the things
that people like the most about the
video was that like I would get into an
example in my ten minutes and it
wouldn't work so there was no editing
there was nothing it was just like you
know I'd started cussing or whatever in
people like that so you know some of my
early subscribers that's what they were
subscribing to and then they like that
and not everybody does I mean obviously
people that are looking to get
information or not trying to get
information from somebody who doesn't
know what they're talking about but the
whole point is that you know the first
product it doesn't matter what it looks
like as long as you keep working on it
and you keep expanding upon so let me
show you this just one video here which
is pretty interesting looking back on it
now hey guys what's up hard so what we
want to do now now we need to need to
make sure that you guys have easy
install set up on your your Python your
pro
basically it's its capital sensitive so
if my space is capitalized which it
probably is and I think this is going to
fail but let's just try it real quick so
it obviously failed because it didn't do
 so
shoot I'll remember I'll have to look
that up one second I'm going to look
this up because when you run into that
situation it's actually you know what
 it we're going to go ahead and just
print this out to a file you can see
that myspace body has now been written
these things now some sloppy looking
 because we didn't put any new line
characters in there so this next video I
want to show you is another video that I
look back on down and you know and I
could say that I'm embarrassed by it but
really I'm not really embarrassed by it
i just it was something that i tried to
do it was an idea that I I thought might
work I've seen so many different ideas
when it comes to education for instance
one time I saw how to install and setup
sequel server and the lady that was
doing it had these humongous tits that
were like hanging out of her shirt and
like that was that was their niche they
were trying to get this you know this
chick that was like showing loss
cleavage and they wanted you know the
programmers today and I get a lot of
people liked it too so I mean I'm
assuming I don't even know how that
channel is doing I haven't seen it since
that one day and that was literally
years ago so maybe it's it's going
strong maybe you guys know about that
but I just want my brows laughing about
it because at the time i was thinking
okay you know my my niche my focus is
going to be this blue-collar focus but I
was also going to be very very off the
cuff and also be you know somewhat
vulgar because I felt like at the time
you know that's what some people wanted
to hear you know that's like if you look
at like poop on all these other guys you
know the people people seem to you know
love the you know the foul language and
all that and I suppose you know looking
looking back now I didn't really
consider you know my image in the long
term and even now I'm wondering if I
would you know be embarrassed by some of
these videos maybe 35 years down the
road hell maybe even a year down the
road I don't really know but let me show
you this other video so the idea was
that I was going to build cartoons and
the cartoons were going to be terrible
like literally the animation was going
to be worse than south park because I
don't even know how to draw like
I'm a terrible artist so I was going to
in fact and even beyond that I don't
know anything about animation so I think
I had built some basic animations just
trying to be funny using robotic voices
and stuff like that because I didn't
want to actually use my own voice and
have to do voiceovers and all that but I
thought it might be funny you know to go
through a lesson plan and then inject
little a little comedic like your
scripts basically that you know like a
ten-year-old would enjoy well I say a
ten-year-old but they're not not
directed towards a ten-year-old because
they use vulgarity and you know the
whole thing was that I was supposed to
be like this funny like South Park type
experience as you're learning because
obviously I don't have big tits and I
can't show you guys you know like
hanging over like this you know doing
the the example so I was looking for my
own ditch and I realized rather quickly
that it wasn't going to work but let me
let me show you an example of what I'm
talking about but with a simple hello
world programs hello world that sounds
like a dumb name why not print your
mom's got TIG ol bitties
Python now as far as these Python
tutorials are concerned I'm not going to
explain how to install Python I mean go
go on the web type in install Python
pick a version you want hey Chris Hawks
are you a dumb you already
explained how to install Python in the
first video don't confuse people with
your you can save the program's
wherever you want but that's where i'm
going to put mine so that's really it I
mean the whole thing is that it doesn't
matter what your initial product is I
mean the only way you're going to
succeed is you're going to continue to
work at it you're right i mean if you
look at the first iphone looks nothing
like what it did now and I mean it was
just a lot of effort I mean a lot of in
fact iphones not even really a fair
comparison but when you're looking at
smaller apps and single person
operations or even a small team like a
development team like indie gaming a lot
of these you know these game companies
are using the same engines over and over
again because they had to pour in all
kinds of work and they're able to reuse
a lot of that work and the product gets
better over time and the same thing
happens with software like you can't
look at what Google is today and think
that Google was like that in 1997 or
1998 certainly when you look at like
facebook look back on the facebook com
back when it first got released in 2004
it looks terrible absolutely terrible so
anyway the whole point is that you know
we're going to grow as we continue to
build these products you're not going to
build some perfectly polished product
right out right out of the gate
hopefully you have a good enough idea
maybe some venture capital funding or
something along those lines where you
know maybe you're making money flying
under the radar for a certain amount of
time to be able to pour more development
effort into your product but you're
never going to have those like those
perfect products until you actually have
basically perfect engineering teams to
try to to build that vision for you I
suppose there may be some single person
examples of somebody that built like
this perfect product but i don't really
know of any and i think it's funny
because you know we I I think that you
know myself included don't really see
you know the forest through the doing
for the third of trees or whatever
saying is but anyway that's what I have
to say guys let me know what you think
please subscribe thank you for all the
subscribers out there and take care of
