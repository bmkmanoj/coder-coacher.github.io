to talk about whether or not stack
overflow has peaked as a website now I
have always claimed that stack overflow
is one of the best resources you could
possibly have on the internet when it
comes to trying to find answers to
coding problems in fact it's so good
that it actually enables developers to
be extremely lazy there are times where
I'm just searching for an answer even
though I know I should be able to know
it or if I'm bouncing between different
languages I'll simply search like basic
functionality that I know Google will
get me to the you know the stack
overflow answer that i need and
sometimes like i'll remember oh yeah i
know that stack overflow answer and then
phrase the question in a similar way and
i'll get back to that that question so I
no longer save favorites and things like
that where I used to do that a lot when
I was starting out I would find a very
helpful article and save it think and
then I'll need it later and I don't
really do that anymore Stack Overflow
doesn't really require that of me the
reason why though I question whether or
not this website has peaked is because
there are some things that I find a
little bit annoying and the fact that
some of the highest outvoted answers are
people that answer questions on stack
overflow they gain that reputation over
a period of many years and they were one
of the first ones into the website so
that they were answering a lot of the
common questions pertaining to c sharp
and javascript and you know a lot of the
things that the newbie developers
actually asked and the the ability to be
able to get some of these highly upvoted
questions is much more of a rarity these
days so you don't see as many you know
2,000 vote questions on stack overflow
like you used to and in addition to that
stack overflow has you know molded their
their website into a much more
sustainable product when it comes to not
having a ton of like duplicate
content and stuff like that so they are
very aggressive towards making sure that
you know newcomers aren't asking
terrible questions now this actually
goes this is a two-way street or a
double-edged sword when you when you're
very very you know critiquing new newbie
developers that barely know
they're going and you know the last
thing they're trying to do is read all
the stackoverflow manual on how to ask a
proper question things like that but
they'll get ridiculed if they end up
answering or asking something that may
it be duplicated or you know maybe a
newbie type of question and they'll be
told that you know that they didn't
research and things like that but at the
same time if people actually answered
those types of questions people like me
would probably be able to get more
points and things like that but the
proper thing is to say hey you know what
this is a duplicate question you need to
link to this question or to remove it
all together so that people aren't
searching on Google and finding that
question as opposed to another one so
the whole thing is is that a stack
overflow has created a better product
it's also created less incentive for
newer developers to to jump on board
with it and in addition it's also
creating I think less incentive for even
people that have been around the block
for a while to even contribute at this
moment I don't really feel like I want
to contribute anything to stack overflow
I don't I don't really care to answer
the questions a lot of the questions
that are asked these days or four brand
new technology that I'm not too familiar
with or it's you know there's some sort
of obscure point of somebody that's
running into some situation that you
know is that is relatively obscure and
then I have to break out you know an
editor or something and try to figure
out what they're trying to do and it's
like I'm not getting paid for this stuff
the only people getting paid for all
this work that goes into it is you know
the people that own stack overflow which
is the stack exchange company or whoever
they are and then you know people you
know obviously can make up money and the
long term for being helped out by a site
like stackoverflow so am I saying that
the world is a better place if stack
overflow wasn't here no absolutely not
like we all need stack overflow but i
think that the direction of the website
is going to end up changing and the
future because I just you know people
like me I think I don't really feel like
I have time to answer a bunch of
people's questions all the time and to
be honest I have a score of 4060 which i
think is a terrible score you can see it
goes up here since 2013 and and honestly
like I think that score is terrible
compared to the amount of effort that
that I put into actually answering some
people's questions so like I don't
bother with it
anymore and don't really plan to at this
point I don't see any long-term future
now the thing is I'm kind of biting my
words because in the past there were
there was a time where like I i had
heard you know people talking about and
in job interviews like ask somebody with
their stack overflow scores and to me I
don't want to push that ball forward
because I feel like that's the wrong
direction because for somebody who like
for me I feel like I've put in a ton of
work and my scores only 4,000 somebody
that comes in behind me you know
starting this year they they might have
an even harder time trying to get to
4,000 or maybe they don't I don't know
but it seems to me like that it's just
not I don't know it's just not a
long-term thing that I feel like messing
around with too much another interesting
thing is on hacker news there was an
article that was shared that comes to
mind and the guy that was that submitted
the article he basically was saying that
he has oh he has one of the highest
scores on stackoverflow and he hasn't
contributed to the website and over
three years now why do I think this is
important because obviously this is just
one person's opinion but what I think
sucks is the fact that stack overflow is
now going into this whole stack overflow
careers and if you look at the stack
overflow careers the the website is
basically you know now that it's running
into this job market is almost like
trying to say that it's an authority of
itself to be able to recommend jobs for
employers so employers are going to pay
Stack Overflow a bunch of money to list
job openings and they're somehow
supposed to be supposed to get better
candidates which I'm assuming is almost
entirely through the stack overflow
system itself which like I said is
relatively flawed for newer developers
when you compare it to the old school
people so I don't know man I think that
that's where the biggest issue comes in
just the fact that if if they're trying
to like put so much credence behind your
stack overflow score that it's going to
be much much more difficult for newer
people to jump into this and where I
said like a year ago that people should
probably try to work on their stack
overflow score I don't think they're
going to be doing themselves all them
that many favors and
really you know going to be some sort of
authority on some newer language like
react or something that's going to take
off I mean then I just don't see a whole
lot of benefit there I really don't and
i think that there's going to be a
certain level of you know
misunderstanding from employers that are
looking for developers and going to be
basing it off of stack overflow and I
think that's similar to like the college
degree type of thing where it's like
what we had you know all these new
candidates and you're just going to
automatically assume that somebody with
a college degree is much better than
somebody without without one and and
then they don't really look at like your
profile and things like that where stack
overflow is now taking kind of the other
extreme where it's like hey look at my
profile but once again that's kind of
flawed towards the newer people so I
don't really know that there's a winning
formula there now the good news for
stack overflow is that the company that
owns a stack exchange they have all
kinds of different communities and
things like that that are fantastic so
you can see the day I've server fault
and ask abantu and all the stuffs up
there they're actually spreading into
all these different avenues and their
formula for asking and answering
questions is probably second to none so
I really think that the company will be
fine but i think the stack overflow
community I don't I guess I don't see it
getting a whole lot bigger than it is i
really feel like in fact it may have
peaked already i'm not sure but it would
seem like that that the interest in
Stack Overflow is not going to continue
the way it has over the past I would say
five to six years or so maybe when I was
first getting in development I guess
five or seven years ago now stock over
plot thought was fascinating but back
then you could ask all kinds of
opinionated questions and and some of
the most highly upvoted and interesting
topics that I have read about were all
these you know opinionated questions and
then there's also this fine line between
what people consider opinionated and
what's not so that's another frustrating
thing too now I also think that stack
overflow has seen the writing on the
wall to some extent because now they're
moving into the whole documentation
where they're going to be trying to find
you know and implement the best way to
document and we've seen a lot of
different projects that are now using
documentation
I'm like what is it like read me or
something like that or there was I can't
remember what it's called anymore but
then you're seeing a ton of
documentation on github and now stack
overflow is basically going to try to
create that next that next formula to to
write documentation that's
community-based and that is just very
user-friendly because when it comes to
stack overflow when I say that it peaked
I think that the site itself is not
going to lose any any standings amongst
developers like we need Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow went offline tomorrow we
would be so like across the board
but what I'm simply saying it said it's
I don't know that it's going to get any
bigger than what it is as far as you
know the hype and things that surrounds
it I think that it's going to just kind
of maintain this this system of newer
technologies come out questions get
posed on Stack Overflow people answer
those questions over time I'm sure that
we'll get some some newer you answer a
question answer is that will end up
rising in the ranks and being able to
compete with the John Skeets and things
of the world but I really feel like
that's going to be a rarity those
old-school people are always going to
have the major major advantage over the
newbie developers that are just joining
and trying to contribute to this
platform anyway guys that's really my
thoughts on this subject let me know
what you think and and take care please
subscribe please vote up please share
and take care of by hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
wanna take a moment to mention dev
