anybody's watching that a new python
tutorial series i love the feedback I'm
getting so far I'm excited to do it and
I actually wanted to do more this
weekend but I couldn't because I'm a
little bitch and I've been under the
weather this nasty sinus cold man I feel
like I've been steak a lot to last like
six months I need eat more vitamin C or
something but there's a sinus code cold
that like it's just affecting so many
different people that I know and that
I've worked with and now I have it and
it sucks but um that's just I just kind
of kept me off of my game a little bit
lately but I wasn't even gonna do
another video today but now I read this
comment now I feel like I have to do a
video on this and it's an important
subject and you know it's actually in
some cases like when I read something
like this on my off what am I
supposed to do now because you don't
want to just respond with some you know
blatant comment you don't want to act
like you didn't see it I mean both of
those would be a prick move but
basically let me let me read you the
comment that was given to me and this is
uh there's a little bit of broken
wording basically not so I'm just going
to kind of really like it I'm not going
to read it verbatim basically but here's
what he says currently I'm in a
bachelor's program in computer science
and I'm in my second year but it is too
expensive I can't afford it and the
worst thing is is that my parents are
all the time blaming me that you were
wasting our money you were this you were
that he says man I am retarded now
suicidal thoughts are coming in my mind
I love programming but i think my dream
will never come true because of my
family should i drop out from college is
it worth it for me please suggest
something or else i will effing die
that's what he said so number one dude
if you're feeling suicidal i'm not
posting this guy's name and stuff
because i'm a sentiment a direct message
just saying look I made a video response
to it and that way you know hopefully
can he can delete this this comment
because it is public and if he feels
that you know he's it's necessary but
either way I'm not going to like try to
advertise
anything up so the thing is though
suicide is no joke obviously people kill
themselves all the time and it it sounds
like your is going pretty bad for
you and that's terrible and I am NOT
certified or qualified to be able to
speak on this matter the only thing i
can i can say is like I mean I should
just refer you probably to the
professionals in this regard so that
either needs to be like your your your
doctors your family or like a if you're
in the United States there's all kinds
of suicide prevention help lines and
things like that on top of that like if
you're you said you're at a university
so I would imagine that the university
has things in place because you know
students kill themselves all the time
with the pressures and everything that
they go through suicide is definitely no
joke to me because um you know I've had
several friends that have actually
killed themselves in fact it was a time
in my life in my earlier days where i
would i would consider and classify
myself as quite suicidal either through
my actions or just through like simple
thoughts of suicide and things like that
so i can definitely you know relate to
to some of what you know you're going
through with with the thoughts and
everything I didn't really have family
pushing me to college and as you guys
know I didn't go to college for computer
science and I still don't have my two
year degree or anything but I can say
dude that college sucks i don't really
like it I don't like the deadlines i
don't i'm not usually motivated so for
my grades and stuff i don't take a whole
lot of pride in in my grades and i think
i use that as an excuse to not try as
hard as I should but basically I go with
the whole men for my main for a mind
frame I'm sorry had this cold that the
time is money and I you know I'm like yo
if it's more time for me to learn
programming or do this or do that it's
it's more time for me to spend with my
family so basically the more time I
spend the school the more money it's
costing me not just with this tuition
and fees and stuff like that but it's
costing might be me my time that I could
be doing other things so I so I hate
school right and I I typically try to
 my way through a lot of courses
that allow it
certain courses don't allow as much
 and leeway and stuff and those
are the courses that I typically don't
like because I'd like to be able to
skate through things unless I have a
genuine interest and this is and I guess
I'm somewhat weird because like I said I
I taught myself to be a programmer I was
so motivated to do it that even after
multiple failures and we're talking
years of failures you know public
rejections from companies and things
like that I continue to still learn I
didn't give up and and in the meantime I
hate school if I'm doing something like
southern English writing or something
like that like I took an English
Southern literature course and it was
like the worst course I've ever seen
like I'm reading these stories and stuff
about like just you know it i think it
was America well as he has American
stories basically Americans southern
like heritage stories from like around
the Civil War stuff when I find it to be
super boring but then i just recently
bought a book on General Custer and
audible and I listened to the entire
thing and even read up more about his I
don't know why man i guess i'm just
weird but like nobody said hey you gotta
learned Custer and if they said hey you
got to learn about this dude you gotta
write reports and stuff like that I
would have been like oh this you
know what I mean so school sucks dude
I'm and I'm not the one who to say
whether or not you should never drop out
or not drop out I can tell you from
experience though that and something
that I'm relatively positive when I say
that you're going to have a much easier
time finding a job if you finish school
so don't ever drop out on my account or
anybody else's account I mean that
decision I think needs to come from you
and the unfortunate thing is like your
family's giving you all the and
they need to back off because if they
don't understand like the implications
of how it makes you feel and if you
truly are having suicidal thoughts
because of the pressures that they're
putting on you then you know they need
to cut that out that that's
uncalled for I don't I don't think I
mean they're probably looking at it from
a financial perspective and they're
wrapped up in their lives and everything
and you already have all these pressures
on your on your plate and everything
with just school and by itself and not
just to mention you know that you're in
school and you're also trying to teach
self-programming because ultimately if
you go to school you go somewhere else
you're still teaching yourself you have
to learn a subject right so even though
I taught myself outside of a classroom
I'm still reading books from experts and
guys who probably learned from their
professors and things like that so
there's not that much of a difference i
would say but yes school is stressful as
hell and your parents need to back off
if they're really causing that much
pressure and like I said man I'm
definitely not qualified or anything to
give me sort of advice so I caught it I
wanted to make a video on this just so
that my viewers can also maybe give some
suggestions as to what should be done
because I don't know you or anything I
don't know where you live I don't know
what country you're from or what school
like I don't feel like I'm not sure what
what is the you know what what is my
responsibility now that you say
something like that because nobody's
ever really said something like that to
me but you know I can share the fact
that you know that I've been there and
I've had friends that were there and
I've had people that may have had
friends that are intentionally overdosed
I've had friends that literally shot
themselves literally but anyway
literally you know point-blank killed
themselves and had every intention of
doing so because they obviously shot
themselves but I don't know man it's a
it's a messed up situation so can I
advise you on the on mother not the
dropout no I can't and also can't advise
you on like how to deal with your
parents and stuff like that I don't know
and then beyond that i can say that you
know i could sympathize with what you're
going through and hopefully whatever
sort of decision you make you address
this situation with your parents first
obviously first and foremost is your
health and everything so you need to get
your health right because they typically
if you're in like some sort of
rehabilitation program or something
coming off of drugs or whatever it may
be you know somebody's told like when
you're trying to focus on yourself and
get yourself right you can't make big
decisions those shouldn't be the times
that you make decisions that are going
to impact your life for you know in big
ways by
house going to school dropping out of
school getting married stuff like that
having a child hell even buying a dog or
a pet you know like you want to make
sure that you're in the right mindset so
it sounds like there's some things you
need to focus on with yourself okay why
do I feel this way why we what can I do
with my parents and things like that or
how can I even trained myself to just
you know not give a because
eventually dude you're going to be on
your own and and you may disappoint your
parents man some of us do and sometimes
your parents want unrealistic
expectations and 11 case in point is
that a lot of parents try to push their
religion on to their children and they
think that their children or you know
deviating away or disappointing them
because they don't have the same
religious beliefs and things like that
and you know I feel like you know I'm a
parent and when my child if they made
their own decisions in life whether it's
you're religious or any sort of you know
major decision like that eventually I
have to learn to be able to respect that
and it sounds like they're they're not
respecting the the fact that you're
having to go through as much as what you
know what you're dealing with now and i
don't know i mean i would definitely
reach out and talk to somebody though so
hopefully guys anybody is watching this
please please try to leave a comment or
something to give further suggestion to
this guy and I'm hoping he'll see this
video and I hope he doesn't hurt himself
and guys thanks for all the comments and
I do plan on continuing that Python
series I'm totally looking forward to it
as well and I appreciate all the support
so far thanks guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
