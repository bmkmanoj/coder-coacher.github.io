questions here man you guys just keep
them coming and honestly it uh it allows
me to continue to do these videos and
pull them out pretty quick too and I
don't know if I if I should do that
because sometimes I feel like you guys
can't watch them all but whatevs I'm
like G doing that all right so this side
is this one person said he's like
problem solving what are your thoughts
throughout my student years i came
across problems and i feel like i don't
know where to begin with finding out why
an exception is being thrown or while I
web pages and conforming to style so
yeah those are you know those are two
different things you have a runtime
error is like where you get a JavaScript
exception and maybe your page stops
working because of that JavaScript
exception and you have then you have the
styling headaches of like why is my do
you know overlapping some other
container and like why can't it just
clear involve and like you're like I'm
clearing i clear both or i clear right
clear left and it still doesn't work CSS
can be like a real pain and to be honest
like i used to really be i would say
good at it but now i'm noticing when i
look at some of the other what i
consider like CSS experts these days i
realized that i'm not nearly as good at
CSS as I used to be especially would
like to hold sass and less bandwagon I
was getting into CSI so you know before
those tools were even a popular thing so
I do use both of those now but like it's
not my passion to do any sort of CSS so
that can be a major nightmare cilic for
instance even me was you know seven
years experience and all really in the
web development world I'm using HTML CSS
and everything I am the other day got a
template and I bought it from this
company called rat bootstrap I ended up
getting my money back on it because the
template was just a overwhelming like it
was just it was a piece of garbage that
the site was using gulp and all this
other stuff and it was like this dude
gave me this half busted ass project
there wasn't even like an overall
template it was literally a bunch of
like maybe after Hugh had to run like
the builds and all the stuff using his
on his gulp and he was using Bauer and
all this other stuff and I don't even
use power man like I'm like I'm not even
trying to use Bower
as far as i know people aren't using
Baur anymore but this tool or this game
this template i thought that i was
buying for like 16 bucks look
professional and i ended up getting
literally 400 and something meg of like
all these different files is all garbage
i was looking at it and I was just like
where do I start like there wasn't even
documentation on like what I was
supposed to do with this I was pretty
pissed off i ended up getting my money
back but I I tried to reach out to the
company I might do this as garbage like
I didn't pay for this and they didn't
even respond to me I feel like a week so
I ended up having to complain to paypal
in order to get them to refund my money
and then they you know they finally get
back you Millie weeks later and said we
refunded your money after like I gotten
paypal involved but yeah just you know
that experience would those people on
professional but the thing is like when
you look at a project like that
sometimes that is like the project it
really that's like everyday life like if
you ever getting paid to be a developer
you go you start some new gig you start
you download or you come their project
and you look at and you're like oh my
goodness there's like there's all these
build files and then there there's
different tasks for watching and
building and and bundling and all the
different configurations for the
different environments like you just
don't know any of that stuff and and the
thing is at least you're getting paid to
do it so you by example you don't expect
after do that but the thing is like how
do you approach a situation like that
now had I actually you know if I'll
we're going to actually want to learn
how to use that that particular project
that I ended up downloading you end up
number one taking a few deep breaths and
then number two you go to the person who
actually wrote it or the last person to
maintain it and start trying to get some
of the broader questions that you have
about you know the architecture like oh
I see it's using these in clothes but I
don't know how like these includes are
all working and go I'm not too familiar
with is that Bauer's been doing this I
see it's using this or that maybe try to
get some questions answered for you
about the overall like architecture and
the technologies that are being used
because they have you jot down a list of
you can kind of individually check those
out so for instance a lot of stacks like
really complicated stacks these days are
using like react router readouts and
react well those are completely separate
things so like you're going to want to
spend some basic time like if it if all
that stuff is new to you one of the
first things you should do is probably
go and look at reacts documentation and
then you start like building a little
side project using react then you try to
you know do the same thing with redox
and then try to include the two together
and then you know now you're working you
understand when you look at more
complicated code you're like oh you have
seen that before that's using redox and
that's using rest like things just start
to click and that's really the way that
everybody that I've seen does this so
I've said this quote before I actually
read it somewhere but how do you eat an
elephant you do it one bite at a time
you can't take you mungus gobs and just
start shoving like entire listen thighs
down your throat like it's not possible
you're going to have to just take things
piece by piece so if there is somebody
to reach out to break if there's not
then hopefully there's good
documentation if there's not even that
man like meditation deep breaths and
really process of elimination so you get
some of those exceptions those inner
exceptions bubbling up and like some
JavaScript project and you're like damn
I have some exception and minified file
well you wanted then okay place a
breakpoint at the spot before that that
file Gator that that code got hit so how
do you do that well when the exception
is grown you can use something like
chrome developer tools and you can see
you want to look at the stack trace
stack traces are important because it
tells you what called what called what
call button and you know the last thing
that got called is where it blow up like
you know sort of blew up either calling
that yeah it blew up calling that next
piece of code so you know okay I've just
ruled out you know a B and C so now it's
obviously d e and f and then you just
start like like I said it could be a
process of elimination sometimes it's
just random things the other day I was I
was poking I was focusing on an
isomorphic react application where
certain code was being rendered on the
server and brought down so there were
certain assumptions about the
and you couldn't make that normally runs
in a browser so normally they go
JavaScript runs in the browser so I have
access to things like local storage or I
have access to things like like the
window object or any of that stuff and
and some of those assumptions you can't
make when you're dealing with ice and
more for JavaScript because it's being
rendered on the server and that browser
is not there with those brats who you
have to really think about you know
what's going on and and then you know
sometimes it takes some documentation
like if you're learning react like you
read about Oh component did mount
doesn't get called on the server and
it's specific to like if you it gets
called on but on the way like his react
knows enough to where you could want you
to write it in ice and water away so
it's like component will mount will be
executed on the server so if you're
trying to call things or use things that
are in that exists inside of a browser
they're not going to work on a component
will mount so you want to do component
did mount and if you can ask somebody
those are the anyway those are the
nightmares that we kind of deal with
sometimes and and they can trip us up
and I think the more experience we have
the faster we can we can find the
solution to those problems and it really
I think it really just helps to to do a
process of elimination elimination even
if you write down like sometimes it
helps also to draft up an email or even
a document if you're going to ask
somebody it's always a good idea to try
to figure out what you're asking first
because sometimes like if you don't even
know what what you think this thing
should be doing then you're not going to
you're gonna have a hard time trying to
draft your question like it's a lot
better if you've read your question down
before you go to somebody because you
can collect your thoughts as you're
writing like this was my assumption this
is what it's doing I think it could be
this and a lot of times just by simply
writing that out you start getting a
fresh perspective on what the issue is
and you almost started thinking about it
as if somebody was approaching you with
that problem instead of being so caught
up in your own problem have you ever
like been in a situation where things
can be very difficult you can be a bog
honest I'm like that and maybe somebody
else comes you with
question and like there's almost like
this this like if somebody comes to me
with a question like I want to be
helpful as a senior developer I want to
be like I want to help them out as much
as I can so it and I'm also i guess
humbled and and I've Rattata they're
actually coming to me with a question I
think that's awesome a lot of
programmers bounce questions off of each
other and you start you know you should
listen attentively to their problem and
sometimes like when you're working on
your own problems you're not doing that
that same level of I'd say and
decisiveness maybe your intuitive I've
known you know what I'm saying hopefully
but the point is is that writing out the
product that the problem can can really
help and then if you're on a project
with other people going to them to ask
for help is going to be beneficial
process of elimination you know make
sure you keep track of what were what
didn't work and would be you know the
results were they surprise you and
things like that there's so many times
I've seen where people write unit tests
under light and the code doesn't know
the unit test fails to the code you know
didn't do what they expected it to do so
then they write the test based on an
evening of the outcome of the code even
though it wasn't their assumption of
what they thought the code was going to
do you'd be surprised how often people
do that but that's a it's really just
minding my thoughts tonight guys oh
thanks for watching make sure you
subscribe so I have two sponsors Deb
mountain coding boot camp they are a 12
or 16 week course a belay off for 12 and
16 week horses are based out of provo
utah in dallas texas Provo Utah
apparently has a lot of Technology jobs
out there I've never been to Utah myself
so I never been to that place salt lake
city area is pretty nice so and I think
provo you tell us probably not far from
that but anyway they're doing stuff like
a angular and react and you're going to
work in a coding environment where
you're you're checking in code using git
and that you're stashing your code on
github so that's a lot of things over
that real businesses are doing
today so they focus on these
technologies in order to try to get you
in the door as a junior developer at a
startup somewhere or you know even an
established place that's willing to sign
on your newer developers that are there
you know focus on some of these modern
technologies the reason why these modern
technologies are good for newer
developers is that even the senior
developer is number one you know they're
just as new with these new technologies
as you are so that's some of the benefit
of the boot camps and really why we're
seeing so many of them crop up because
they are having success that they were
all like a complete scam then you know
they wouldn't be so many cropping up and
they're also wouldn't be people getting
hired from them so my other sponsor for
this month is side 123 calm so if you
guys check those guys out they can they
can provide solutions for you to be able
to host your website and if you're
looking for like a portfolio or maybe
you have a commerce platform like a
small e-commerce shop something like
that you can check them out and they
have a an editor that allows you to
design the site in a way that you see
fit but then you can also buy your
domain through them and and it's not as
much hassle as having to set up your own
your own stuff so even if you if you
know people are asking for favors and
you know that they can't afford to hire
you to make their their code base for
them you might want to refer them to
somebody like site 133 to make it
themselves so you don't have to deal
with it alright guys so thanks for
watching have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
