the environment is so I just
learned about this Inferno project which
if I go back to this first commit and we
take a look at the code you can see
inferno if you look at the initial
commit of this project I mean it looks
like even the creator had no idea what
the he was creating when it first
came out and now when we look at what we
have here we have this project which has
4,000 stars on github which obviously is
very very popular now nearly you know
over 3,000 commands 40 contributors and
the entire documentation for inferno is
that it's an isomorphic library and
basically all the documentation says
it's like react so basically the entire
thing is like hey we're doing everything
react does we have a slight bit of
performance gain because we only render
differing elements and basically it
makes a better distinction I suppose
between elements that are dynamic and
changing and ones that aren't but either
way I think this is a good case in point
of like why why we just keep creating
new projects instead of actually trying
to make existing projects better when I
was first getting started in Python and
Perl that's what people did they used
tried-and-true libraries and plugins and
and they were you know kidding they were
never additions made to it to make it
better
in this case react is written by you
know the guys at Facebook and there's
some of the best developers in the world
they've been working on it for years
they've been paving the way with it
Inferno is like is just simply trying to
be react and it's absolutely absurd like
look at this it also uses yes components
like react it says hey you can use the
react documentation it's using JSX and
stuff
like react so instead of the people
behind this project assisting with the
react people we've now created more
fragmentation within the JavaScript
community where it's almost like a
project is irrelevant as soon as it's
its first commit is made it doesn't make
any sense to me I don't understand I
don't understand it at all and I'm
certainly not going to use this project
but I just from freaking Ember
one there may be some you know some
performance gains there but I trust the
react people who at least paved the way
and created the initial project more
than somebody who decided hey I like
what react is doing and we're just going
to basically copy off of what they're
doing and we're gonna make some slight
tweaks I wouldn't be surprised if some
of these things were actually forked
from the react project itself I don't
know about that I haven't even looked
into it enough but I just once again
it's just to me this is just it's more
stuff where it's like well hold on a
second what was wrong wrong with
reacting and why couldn't we have just
made it a little bit better did we
really have to do you know spin-off
irelia from angular it was that really
necessary I don't know man it's just
this is this is a perfect example I
think of why we have some issues that
need to be addressed so for years we
talked about JavaScript being the future
2011 I think that's when Steve Jobs like
went out and said hey flash we're not
gonna support flash anymore and
everybody got on you know they basically
shocked the web development world where
it's like hey you know flash is all
we've ever known for video and and now
here's Steve Jobs the saying that Apple
doesn't need flash and we don't need
plugins at all we're gonna use html5 to
solve everything in JavaScript is going
to be the unifying factor if we
fast-forward five years to now five six
years we're looking at you know the
future that has been brought to us from
JavaScript and I personally feel like we
need something else I don't know if it's
gonna be typescript I don't know what it
may be I know that Dart tried to be you
know to try to be relevant and then they
started doing away with their entire
dart running in the browser and now
we're looking at maybe web assembly but
it just seems like the the environment
is ripe for something to come along and
try to unify the developers into one
particular project because otherwise I
just continue to see I think we'll see
much much more fragmentation and I'm not
really sure that it's good to be honest
like when we look at something like
Python and we say hey we want a web
framework do we want a full stack frame
marquee okay yes video so we're probably
going to choose Django and then we're
like okay well maybe you know we don't
want to pull stock frameworks so we
want something much more minimalistic
then we look at things like flasks or
you could even use the work suit web web
server you could use tornado obviously
flask bottle there's a few options there
but there it's not like there's a
hundred and fifty different options that
we have to choose from with PHP now it's
like well you know you're gonna use like
laravel probably maybe you want to use
Co igniter if that's still relevant but
there's just like you know there's
definitely a tried-and-true way with
with JavaScript though you have no idea
where to turn man you don't know if it's
going to be angular 1 or angular 2 and I
really feel like a lot of this stuff
really started to get completely insane
when the angular 1 community and angular
was was humongously popular it was much
more popular than react or even the the
frameworks that have been around for a
while like ember or backbone or knockout
angular had everything going for it with
its 1.0 and it suffered from the same
thing that every other JavaScript
project suffers from is that it turns
into a giant clusterfuck as soon as
things start getting complicated as soon
as you start getting outside of the you
know simple to-do app you start running
into the limitations of what the
framework can provide as well as just
simply the fact that JavaScript is a
nightmare to maintain and if you don't
think that's true look at walmart.com
and all their high paid developers that
have created this cutting edge
technology to take this website that
barely functions barely works I've seen
it firsthand where JavaScript projects
just spin out of control and even my own
projects where I write my own and
granted I'm not the per I'm not I'm not
a great developer in fact some people
might even say I'm not a good developer
at all and I'd say you but I I
still think that I'm at least a
moderately good developer and I've had
my own projects completely spin out of
control and node and Express and using
some of the other frameworks that I've
tried meteor and things like that I find
that I can control the project much
easier with with flash with Jang
hell even with something like laravel I
could do it much easier than then some
of these full-stack JavaScript solutions
that are JavaScript on the server and
the client there's just too many moving
parts I feel like but I'm not sure man
all I know is that the angular community
it suffered from the of like
this is just too complex and and you
know angular is has completely fallen
apart and even when angular was at its
top and it was it was you know riding
the the tidal wave of height I was
looking around I was asking if I was
like well you know this angular hype I
don't see any angular applications that
are any better than anything else that
we had before and I saw all these
examples of these companies that were
using angular nothing was any more
impressive than than what we've had
before and that's fine I mean because
even if you're able to keep up with the
the the status quo of what a website
should be that's fine if you use a
technology stack but it's not fine when
you use a technology stack that creates
more maintenance and has less
productivity and less performance than
what you could have had had you not used
the project and and to me you know I saw
a lot of that with angular but I also
saw some applications that ran pretty
smooth and everything but nothing overly
impressive but then what happened react
came out react started writing a lot of
this hype it was considered a really
niche market and then all of a sudden
react started getting popular and then
what it angular do the entire angular
community said oh we got to rewrite
everything and we got to change
everything everything that we were doing
we're basically going to completely do a
180 now and the entire community got up
in arms you know since that time like it
just seems like nobody trusts any
JavaScript frameworks and now we just go
ahead and we create our own new ones
anytime we want so I really feel like it
all started with this angular 2 mess a
couple years ago and since that time
it's just it's been amplified a hundred
percent so where are we headed right now
we're headed to the to the point where a
new project is going to come out and
it's going to be inferior possibly by
the time I even get
announced as open-source and eventually
something's gonna come along it's going
to unite us but right now I don't know
what that's gonna be it's gonna be some
sort of web component based system I
think I don't think it's probably more I
don't think it's react I think it's
gonna be something else and it hopefully
will happen soon but anyway we'll see
what happens and anyway guys have a good
night take care please subscribe bye hey
guys so a lot of you asked me how do I
get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
boot camp is a 12-week intensive course
that focuses on the technologies of the
here-and-now for web development some of
the things that they're actually
teaching in this 12-week course is
geared to get you into the industry by
focusing on things like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're gonna need to
do as a developer as soon as you start
they're gonna be teaching you in this
and this coding bootcamp and the entire
goal is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
bootcamp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
