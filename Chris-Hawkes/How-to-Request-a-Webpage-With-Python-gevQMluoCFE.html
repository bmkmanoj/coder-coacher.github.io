next video we're going to learn how to
request a web page using a built in
python module called URL lib too and all
you gotta do in order to use a module
within Python and your program just say
import and then the name of the module
that you want so we want URL lip too
let's go ahead and save this file as
grab web page dy so now we can use URL
the two now in order to request the web
page we want to go ahead and basically
act like we're a web browser so that
it's not so obvious that we're actually
a robot in order to do that I'm just
going to copy and paste this code here
but you're going to declare a variable
named opener or whatever you want to
call it and then say URL lib to and then
invoke the build opener method so in
order to invoke a method you use the dot
so you are a Lib to dot build opener
method open and close parentheses and
then within our opener variable we can
now address another method which is
called add headers so we're saying
opener got add headers and then we're
giving it the header that we want to use
which if you look here this is a list
and then we're giving it two different
variables inside of here so try not to
pay too much attention to the syntax I
mean we're kind of just jumping in
quickly but this is a tuple which is
somewhat like a list in Python but
anyway it's a list with a tuple inside
of it but we're going to say user agent
and then mozilla /y point oh so we're
disguising ourselves as a mozilla
browser and let's go ahead and give a
website URL so we'll say you r l equals
i just like we open the file we're going
to go ahead and give this an actual HTTP
address so let's say HTTP
colon wwm I space com and we're going to
grab this myspace com and in order to do
that we're going to say opener dot open
the URL so give it this URL that we just
defined and let's say prints in fact
before we even do this let's actually
named this a variable so we'll say our b
VAR l equals open or not open URL so
let's go ahead and print our URL and see
what happens so we'll open up our
command prompt and let's go ahead and
run our new web program webpage py
you'll see it's thinking
so are we had a bit of a technical
difficulty there so what ended up
happening here is it shows the built-in
object that we have created and what we
were missing here is we actually want to
say God read so let's go ahead and do
that again in my bed and you can see
it's actually printing out the entire
contents of the HTH tml that makes up my
spaces home page so if I want to save
that instead of just printing it out so
that I can have it for future record i
can go ahead and say just create an out
file I'll plow equals like we did in the
last video open projects training and
myspace GXT and it will say w-4 right
and out filed right and we'll say our
URL let's try that and it looks like I
didn't do anything but we pull up our
Explorer you see that myspace is there
we click on it myspace social
entertainment and we got all dishes news
all right so it's pretty awesome the
next tutorial we're going to move right
into how we start scraping content out
of an HTML page right I'll see you then
