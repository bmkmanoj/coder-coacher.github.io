a camera mount for my car so that I
could actually record video in my car
and I actually thought that it would be
okay but then I did a quick google
search and apparently people are kind of
pissed about that sort of thing so I
realized that I'm probably not even
going to be doing what I thought so I
thought it would be cool if I was just
driving and simply having the thing
record if I'm not touching it or
anything like that it's like there's
really no danger there whatsoever this
is a dangerous situation getting behind
the wheel at any time especially if
you've been drinking or doing drugs or
something like that I understand the
whole texting and driving is extremely
dangerous but when you have a friggin
mount and mounted to your dashboard
you're not touching it and it's just
recording you driving it's no different
than having a conversation with your
passenger at least in my opinion unless
you're like looking at the thing which
you shouldn't have to be if you have a
amount but either way people you know
worry and freak out about all kinds of
different things that they shouldn't
freak out about and I certainly don't
want to set like a bad example but
apparently there's like all this like
movement or at least a few articles I
wrote about where this has been like a
growing thing where people are recording
themselves well in the car and it's
something that I guess is generally
frowned upon by a lot of people so that
I think that that's interesting that's
not something that you would expect at
least I didn't expected so people get
irritated and upset about everything
nowadays though but I can understand
like if they think that obviously
somebody's attention is away from the
road while they're doing that and then
that makes sense but in my particular
case it's like man I've been driving for
like goes one of years almost and I
think that I can handle talking while
driving at the same time personally but
anyway one of the things I wanted to
talk about in this video is just
recently I did my exit interview with
the company that island that I worked
for so I gave my two weeks notice and
you know said my goodbyes to everything
after being at the company for quite a
few years I was you know I was very sad
i think i was talking to some people
that i've seen every day for you
years and uh and it was kind of a sad
thing and I didn't really know if it was
making the right move and all I said
those are just natural thoughts I think
that their in your mind but these e
new opportunities i'm really excited for
and i think it's going to be great and
the the entire mindset of locating i'm
kind of sad I'm leaving the company and
low blood I felt all this like I guess
you know this emotional attachment is a
company that I've worked been working
for but then I go through this like exit
interview thing where you talk to a
human resources person and you get
brought into this office and like you
never want to go to human resources
really when you're like here we never
want to be dragged into human resources
to because I generally mean something
that happened unless you have some sort
of like benefits question or like a
tuition reimbursement or something like
that like human resources officers you
kind of want to stay out of at least
voluntarily so with this though it's
just natural that when you're leaving a
company that you do this exit interview
thing so they can kind of explain your
benefits and explain what your next
steps are your options and everything
and and I'll be honest like I didn't
give it much thought about you know did
the time that I was going to leave and
all that stuff because when I went in
there I found out it like all my
benefits like health insurance dental
insurance all my birth like my uh my
life insurance and all that stuff that I
had through the company is all gone like
12am midnight that day that I left the
company so I'll be perfectly frank I
think that that policy kind of sucks
especially when you do the right thing
and you give your two weeks notice and
and you didn't try to claim a bunch of
sick leave that because I have like
seven hundred some hours of sick leave
and I didn't use any of that so
obviously i'm not trying to burn any
bridges or anything but i just found it
to be a little bit interesting i said i
thought that when you leave a company
even if you were fired they would
probably allow you to keep your benefits
for at least 30 days you know at least
the end of the month because when you go
to a new company in the US typically
when you start like your benefits would
that company do not get actually started
or initiated until the first of the
following month so so effectively I'm
without insurance right now which you
know it isn't a big deal because there
is this thing called cobra insurance or
something
arachova or whatever in the united
states though it all it really does is
it allows you to continue your benefits
but you have to pay a hundred percent so
where the company was saying 75% before
and I only had to contribute 25 you have
to valinor % trivia of a decent health
care plan that's like a PPO you're going
to be paying like a thousand fifteen
hundred bucks probably for that one
month of coverage for your family and so
the only good news is though is that you
don't necessarily have to do that like
if one of your kids were sick or like
you had a sort of medical emergency and
you ended up in the hospital you can go
ahead and elect to pay for that and get
that continuation and that continuation
actually takes effect the day after you
left the company or whatever so you
don't ever have any sort of gap so you
can literally get sick or injured after
the fact and you still have this time
frame to to get that you know and pay
for that continuation of benefits really
you know the extra month that you go
without without insurance so that is
something for you guys to keep in mind a
lot of Millennials have a lot of
experience jumping from job to job so
they probably understand that but once
you have wife and kids and everybody's
relying on you it's really important I
think that you want to try to you know
get you know leave the job i would say
towards the end of the month and then
hopefully be able to get hired on to the
you know the new company at the end of
the month or you want to just try to
balance out like that time period where
you may not have insurance and and and i
give that to some consideration another
thing too is if you are like a you know
marriage family guy like myself and it's
also important to have that you know
life insurance and everything so it
might be a good idea to have life
insurance outside of your employer the
only problem with that is that life
insurance outside of an
employer-sponsored plan is like so much
more expensive and then you know the few
dollars that you pay when you're
actually employed and you have your
health insurance through in life
insurance through them so that's been a
that that's an interesting i think you
know turn of events or whatever that's
something i really didn't expect and
hopefully that gives you guys some sort
of forewarning when you try to do the
same thing so I think you know leading
up to that like I said it was you know
it's kind of sad you're sad and then you
get out
in LA hmm I feel like just a number on a
piece of paper because I don't want to
say that you know like but you kinda
can't help but think wow you know this
is you're basically just a number on a
piece of paper yeah I mean you it's
voluntary for companies to want to hire
their associates and have them work for
them and then then it's also voluntary
for the employee to actually want to
work for the employer as well so you
know no negative thoughts here towards
my particular employer but just in
general and generally speaking I think
you know you eat you pretty much like
you want to you want to make sure that
you're thinking ability to advantage of
any sort of available options that you
have to you so every kind of you know
there's chances that we have to take in
life in order to try to expand expand
our horizons you know Lord to learn more
yeah I'd new responsibilities to to just
meet new people or try new things and
and and i guess if there are
opportunities that are presented to you
then you may not wanted to feel like you
know what just because I've been into
somebody for a few years I'm just going
to I'm going to continue to stay with
them and i'm going to turn away all
these different opportunities that I
might have somewhere else because of
this you know this I guess this
emotional attachment which is nice to be
emotionally attached to attached to your
employer but then after giving them you
know a lot of time and you get your
benefits and all that stuff just and
wiped out twelve o'clock midnight that
day you know it's like you know like I
mean yea once again man life is it's
just it's a business decision you always
hear about that in like football like
you know football players being traded
two other teams or like you know they
won't you know get reassigned to their
team and stuff later for the money that
they're looking for it's just it's like
that with with every everything really
at least in the United States it is it
is like that with everything so my only
thing once again I have a few cautions
in this video and that is keep in mind
how your benefits get terminated when
you leave your employer and those number
two I guess try to keep your emotional
attachment to that employer in check to
the point where like you if you have
opportunities and options in your life
that you shouldn't ignore what you feel
like might be the best decision for you
because of emotional attachment so I
think there's you there's unless you
know the CEO and that dudes like
emotionally attached to you the same way
that you're emotionally attached to that
company you know I mean it's just it's
not like it's not that it's probably not
what you think it is in your own mind so
that's that's really my only word of
caution on that so anyway guys thanks
