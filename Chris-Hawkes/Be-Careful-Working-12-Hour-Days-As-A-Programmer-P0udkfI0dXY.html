from work and one so he says I don't I
don't work yet but I do study my second
year soon to be finished the way I feel
personally is that if I don't put in ten
plus hours of coding studying and
learning each day and on the weekends
usually six to eight hours I feel like
I'm not giving it my all I kind of have
an all-or-nothing mentality and
sometimes I could study for 12 hours in
a day in it being effective it's not
every day I do that since I do enjoy
doing other things as well like going
outside and working out etc what are
your thoughts on all that or nothing
mentality for beginners
I've been coding out for nine months and
I really want to be great at it so that
that is that is cool that's something I
did myself you know I was working
ridiculous amount of hours now you guys
know my backstory though I had a family
so I was coming home I even had a long
commute at one point and I would come
home and I would study on the sides
trying to build my products and things
like that you know if you put in all the
hours that I was I was definitely doing
12-hour days and spending when devoting
quite a few weekends to just literally
coding the entire time because I also
wanted to be great at it as well so I
understand that mentality I'm not even
going to speak out against anybody that
wants to do that if you feel that it is
necessary to do that the problem is
though is that we're never going to be
as good at programming as we want to be
there's always going to be some new
technology that we're not going to know
how to use and we're going to you know
hear word of mouth how it's great and
like we're going to want to learn it but
we're going to be busy doing other
things and eventually when you do get
paid to do this stuff like you're not
you're not studying on your own accord
anymore you're actually studying you
know things that didn't you know
interest you initially but now you're
learning and having to use and things
like that because it's a matter of
putting food on the table so it becomes
a like a different overall perspective
in my opinion and if you're doing
12-hour days like each day I think I
would you know caution that in the long
term you know a couple hours a couple
years I would say even it's probably not
that big of a deal but one of the things
I do want to share and this is something
that actually was bothering me quite a
bit so I worked at a Geico with another
developer
and he ended up leaving the company a
few years ago and then I found out like
not even like a year after he left he
had this inoperable brain tumor I was a
brain stem tumor and he was one of the
smartest students I'd know man like this
guy was he was like he was a wicked
smart like it was like because he also
started in the business ended up
becoming a programmer and leaving and
like they're going to build him and
elsewhere but he was the same age as me
started company same time as me and was
really really smart and like strive you
know I basically you know kind of strive
to be able to match his productivity and
everything I'm working and that was
great now once I found out a couple
years ago yet this brain stem tumor I
feel really bad and like I you know
followed him on Facebook and everything
but we weren't like friends we never
were really buddy-buddy we didn't go out
together anything we just simply started
at the same time we we worked in the
same circles and would say hi and things
like that but what we weren't good
friends or anything so it's not like I
was like always like my best friend
anybody well he was a friend and was
somebody that I had looked up to for a
time and then I found out you know you
had this brain stem tumor and then I
read my facebook post last week and I
found out like that was when he took his
last breaths was a week doing he would
be about the same age as me which is
about 35 and he's got three young kids
all his children are under the age of
eight you know 18 younger and he's got a
wife said he left behind everything and
I the thing that sucks like that more
than anything is that when you know
somebody and like I don't follow my
facebook as well as I should but like I
know he had that situation he was
getting treatment but every time I you
know I'd see a picture of a might you
know saw him walking around or you know
some of those kids and it just seemed
like okay well you know they found out
about this tumor maybe it's not grown
they're probably trying to do what they
can but it turns out you know they
weren't able to stop the growth and then
you know eventually like as I read that
post I went back and I started reading
some of these other posts I had missed
along the way over the last couple
months and found out he had been
essentially bedridden for the last month
and like like three weeks prior to to me
reading that post like he lost the
ability to swallow I lost the ability to
move like his
right or left side and arm and leg and
essentially it is a terrible terrible
ordeal for somebody that to go through
something like that on my grandmother
had I remember lung cancer spread to her
brain and things like that but wouldn't
six months like I mean she was she was
like it was way too late by the time you
know they found out about it but this
particular tumor just you know one one
abnormal growth on the brain and like
it's completely it's just a terrible
situation like it seems you know rather
torturous and and for those reasons like
I like I remember I was like I was
laying in bed the other night and I
couldn't sleep because like I started
thinking about it and normally I don't
like I hate that kind of you know
what I mean like when it's always like
when you're at your sleep at night and
like you realize the things you didn't
do the things you wanted to do and then
you start worrying about things like oh
you know as my sister okay like you know
those listenings that they kind of neat
on you that you know during the day it's
easy to put away because we're so busy
but though the whole point behind this
man is that that he's now dead I knew
him very well worked with him for about
ten years and we can't we had the same
profession strive for the same things
and I think that there are more
important things than putting in you
know 10 to 12 hour days every day I
think it's important to read real you
don't realize your goals but you know
don't take an adult look back and regret
you know that that you could have been
doing other things you know possibly
because we're never going to be as good
as we want to be we're always going to
be learning something new this job you
never stop learning and that's the good
thing but you guys got to keep it in
check them and if you're doing 12-hour
days you will get burned out I've been
going strong for seven years and
developmentally and for many of those
years it was like on top of all my other
obligations and and my work and
everything and I now know that I cannot
go at that rate forever so now that I
get paid the codes over the last you
know for nine years I do I do plenty of
learning on the job and honestly
that's the way it should be and I'll do
stuff on the side that interests me but
I'm not going to be you know putting in
you know 12 14 hour days like life is
too short
I've seen people die I've had friends
that have died in high school you know
famous people that have died at very
young age like you know live your life
that's really my advice I mean make sure
you're you're keeping a fine balance if
you're young you're trying to get into
the industry like I said I won't talk
down you guys on you know the 12 hour
days I did it myself and and it's a
competitive world out there so it at the
very least if you're going to put in
that kind of time you know don't bounce
around so many different subjects and
try to be a master of one of them so
that way you have a true advantage over
somebody else if you're spending eight
hours a day or 12 hours a day you know
learning you know no js' new you're like
Django Chris talks about Django to learn
Django don't do that
stick with know'd stick with whatever
you're doing what be a master of what it
is you're doing don't try to keep up
with everything because it's impossible
you're just going to drive yourself
crazy actually all right guys thanks for
watching have a good day bye hey guys so
a lot of you asked me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp in the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about Deb mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
