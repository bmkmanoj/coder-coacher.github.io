to video 3 of the learning go
programming tutorial series and
appreciate you guys watching so far so
we've already touched on some basic
stuff like integer strings and all that
if you're brand new to programming a lot
of that stuff may not make any sense but
it doesn't really matter right now those
terms will become more fluent eventually
and you'll realize that you're just
speaking it without even thinking about
it so most you guys I'm sure are coming
here from some other programming
language so it's probably not a big deal
but assuming this is your first language
yeah just had to kind of stick with it
you'll eventually learn terms like
integers and floating point numbers and
all that stuff so anyway guys in this
video what I want to do is before I was
showing you that you could create a
variable and go and the proper way to do
it is like I say proper but the long way
of doing it is the way we were doing it
where we were like a variable my string
which is the name of your variable and
then we were saying string and then we
would say equals and then we give it the
actual value so this is the value well
you can do the same thing and go because
it's so common that you can just simply
say my string well I'll give it a
different name other method i'll call it
and then colon equal this is the other
method so let's go ahead and invoke this
into the fmt print line which is just
outputting to the screen so I can call
other method will build and run the
project
oh you know what because we're using my
string see this is one that one of those
things I was talking about we go like it
wants to be super efficient so if you're
using any sort of import that you don't
need or if you have declared variables
that you're not doing anything with go
will complain about that it won't
compile so you can see that the way we
invoke this this string was completely
different than what we did before but
the the output is the same so you're
going to see this shorthand version of
of instantiating things much more often
than you're going to see the long
spelled out version the long spell
diversion a lot of people actually like
that because they like to know that
they're dealing with a string or
something like that because we can say
my int my integer and then do the same
thing equals one now it's pretty clear
that my integer is a one but in a big
program you know maybe they'd like to
see integer or something I you know I
don't know but it's just the two
different versions that you have in once
again we have another complained thing
that we have a method that's not being
used or I'm sorry variable not being
used but anyway that is the shorthand
version of how you create a variable
using the go specific way a shorthand
version all right so another thing too
is when you're declaring variables and
go you need to know that your variable
name has to begin with a letter so this
is valid
so this is a valid string and then we'll
say two three four this is not valid not
a valid string and this won't even
compile but just so it doesn't complain
about an unused variable which isn't
even a valid variable I don't think it
would even complain but this is not
valid that won't even compile at all
anyway you can see that's right it's all
screwed up but that's because it's not a
valid variable name now your variable
names can contain underscores I believe
they can start with an underscore to I
typically don't do that now undefined
sorry you should have been that
so it actually can begin with an
underscore for some reason I thought you
couldn't do that and go you can do that
typically in most languages I don't like
actually having the underscore there but
a lot of times people like in Python you
don't have the camel case like they like
to say you know multi word variable name
and they do it like spelled out with
underscores like in Python but in
JavaScript you'll typically see like
something like this multi word so the
first word underscore under case I'm
sorry lowercase and then this step the
second word is going to have a upper
case for the first letter and then any
following word would also have uppercase
letters so that's known as a camel
casing because of the hump so you can
see low and then hump low home but
anyway that's that's called it doesn't
matter how you do it so go isn't
particular and there might be like a go
specific way of doing it but I'm not I'm
a c-sharp developer and a Python
developer and hoping to be an expert go
developer but i'm not completely up to
date on whether or not you know go think
she should use underscore or the NGO
community thinks you should use
underscore camel case or Pascal case or
whatever i think it should be up to you
and you know goes pretty hacker friendly
so just do whatever you feel like you
want alright guys now we're going to get
into a very important part of go
programming and really any programming
language we've been doing everything
inside of our main function and that's
not how many program operates any sort
of object-oriented you have stuff
abstracted out into like libraries upon
libraries and then code is being
executed in all kinds of different
places and DLLs and all this crap and um
it can get very complicated sometimes
with but you obviously don't want an
entire complicated program being
executed like sequentially in one
straight line and your function your
main function that would be ridiculous
so just like any other programming
language you're going to have multiple
files you have multiple functions that
are going to be called so we're going to
go ahead and create our first second
function really so we already have our
main function so let's go ahead and
create
a new function which will call our new
function i'm gonna camelcase this joint
and like i said i don't even know if
that's the proper syntax for the NGO
community but i don't care either so
this is a camel case like i said with
the hump it's our new function and then
this is just going to simply use the
input the fmt library that we've already
imported and we'll say print line this
is a function of being called by main
and i'll do it ! because we're spreading
our programming wings and invoking new
functions now it's go ahead and call
this function so all we have to do is
just type our new function then open and
closed parenthesis and when we go to run
you'll notice that the output is what
you would expect this is the function
being called by mean so the program
actually execute successfully main is
invoked it immediately calls our new
function and this can call another
function and another function is not
defined yet so let's go ahead and add
that down here
and then we're just going to keep it
with a the flow here this was called by
another function
so you'll notice that this works just
fine and what is interesting to note
here is that another function is defined
after our new function so what's what's
interesting like in JavaScript you can
run into a problem because another
function hasn't been defined yet and
it's trying to reference a method that
it that wasn't actually recognized yet
because it actually appears below ER and
are lower in the program then when the
calling code appeared so the calling
code is saying hey where's another
function at another functions down here
hasn't even been you know address yet
but because go is compiled it executes
just fine so the bottom line is that
another function even though it appears
in the program or you know the actual
call to another function appears before
another function even shows up in the
code base it all just compiles down and
works just fine so another functions not
pointing to some you know non-existent
function you don't have any error or
anything like that so hopefully that
makes sense so that's what's going on so
this gets printed this gets called this
gets printed so now what I'm going to do
is touch on something called scope and
this is actually a scary concept it's
difficult for a lot of people to grasp
and the JavaScript language and you know
go is no different really so what we're
going to do is we're going to actually
print a variable so let's go ahead and
we'll have this value here this will be
an actual variable so let's go ahead and
create our shorthand variable so our
string and then shorthand and then we'll
paste that in so we'll go ahead and
print our string now say so this will
work let's just go ahead and do this
real quick so you'll see that this works
just the same way and now what we're
going to try to do is another function
is going to out I try to access this
variable our string so let's go ahead
and try to access that here so really we
want to try to print that twice
and you're going to notice that on our
string is undefined it says hey it
doesn't exist and the reason why is
because of scope our string is out of
scope from this function because our
string was defined in this function so
the problem is is that our new function
can access it because our string was
defined inside of it another function
that variable wasn't defined inside of
it so it can't access it now if we
wanted it to be accessible in other
functions you can use a constant so co
NS t is the keyboard for constant and
then the name of the value so we'll just
say our string and then we say what type
it is so this is the long way of doing
it so this is a working example and if
we run the program now because it's
constant its declared outside of the
function and both methods are actually
able to access it so it is considered
within scope of the entire program
another thing with them go is this
sometimes it can be annoying let me get
rid of these these functions here we go
alright so what I am because it can be
repetitive having to declare multiple
variables on go has a shorthand version
that we can use we can just simply say
var and then inside parentheses we can
do instantiate several variables at the
same time so let's say x equals this is
first string y equals this is second
string I need to close that off too so
basically each variable is on its own
line now if I want to then use FMT dot
print mind x + y + Z so this is all
going to be just one big string added
together but you'll be able to see that
we instantiated three strings very
easily and very quickly and it works
just fine so that's like another
shorthand version of
being able to instantiate multiple items
at the same time you could do the same
thing with integers or floating point
numbers or anything like that alright
guys so I'm touching up on the 15-minute
mark which is what I'm trying to keep
all my videos so I want to thank you
guys for watching have a good night and
have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
