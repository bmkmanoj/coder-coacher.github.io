want to talk about what is a type system
right we've we've all seen types and
programming and I think that a lot of
people don't really give I guess enough
credence to what I type is and how it
actually works and what are the
differences between types and the system
and the programming languages that they
use if you've ever heard of like Python
it's a dynamically typed language
some people say javascript is an untyped
language and a language like C sharp is
strongly typed so we're gonna look at
really what are those type systems mean
and and what are the differences so when
we first look at what is a type system
if we look at the Wikipedia definition
it says in programming languages a type
system is a collection of rules that
assign a property called type to various
constructs a computer program consists
of such as variables expressions
functions or modules so really it's just
it's just a set of rules so if we have a
piece like a type here this is just a
particular defined type then you have
the string and int a bull which is just
true or false so I'm sure you guys have
seen all of those different types that
are in languages and those are all
predefined you don't actually have to
define what those are if you're
programming in Python Python knows how
to handle them c-sharp JavaScript Java
whatever you're using so essentially if
I declare a type to be a string which is
really just a variable so if I create a
variable that is you know my string or
it might be a sentence or a paragraph or
even a web page of HTML content either
way it is just a type of string and then
the rules that come into play are what
can be done and with that particular
type in order for it to you know do
different things like so you have
built-in methods that are on available
on that type so they're part of the
rules system they're like print split
can concatenate so that is you know just
applies to actual strings so a string is
a different type than an int and you'll
notice pretty early on in programming
that you can't combine a string and an
int without some sort of forced code
because there are two separate types and
they don't mix together because they're
not part of the rules of the construct
of the language so if I have two
different types you have an int over
here and then you have a string on the
on the right the int has built-in rules
associated with its type that it can add
and subtract since it's dealing with
integers and numbers and the string has
the ability to split and print and just
so you guys know in most programming
languages you can also print an int as
well but let's just pretend you can't
and if I try to just add these two
together it's not gonna work you're
gonna have a sad face so it's going to
throw a compiler exception because you
violated the rules of the programming
language there are two different types
they don't mix together and that was
defined by the programming language
itself so essentially there's a very you
know academic definition and of type
systems and how they all work and
everything but for the most part you
just have to know that you know types
are real things in the programming
language and it's real things that the
compiler needs to understand in order
for the programmer for the program to
actually execute so there are certain
things that you can and can't do with
with different types they're there to
help you and if used correctly they're
you know they're very they're obviously
been beneficial and they're extremely
important to programming itself so you
you really quickly when you're getting
started running to okay I can't add an
int in a string and I have to you know
either cast my into a string or cast my
string to an int assuming that it would
actually work so now those bring up
different discussions but essentially we
just want to look at you know from a
high-level view what is a type system so
the programming languages can have both
strong and weak types and this guy's got
a terrible looking arm here so you can
see they're strongly type language much
stronger but anyway guys the thing is
about strong and weak and weak type
language is there's actually no
definitive really proof of what is
conservative strong or a weak type
language but there are kind of I guess
status quos when it comes to
a week versus a strongly typed language
let's first look at what a strong
language is c-sharp is a strongly typed
language and what that means is that
when you declare a method and that's
what this is here you actually have to
state what type of type is being
returned from that method and you can
see that that is the first thing it's
called the method declaration so it's
saying that this method is going to
return an int that's the first argument
that's passed and then you have the name
of the actual method and then it also
takes in a parameter which is also an
int so it'll do some processing and then
it's going to return the input times the
input now the reason why it's doing that
that it can do multiplication is because
there's a certain set of procedures and
and like I said rules that the type int
follows and it allows the end to be able
to multiply divide things like that
because that's what's built into the
language but at C sharp is considered a
strongly typed language that every
variable that you use and you can see
like int is a declared variable down
here where it says int input equals I
and that is an int I gets passed into it
so you can obviously assign one into
another without problems but what that
is doing there how it's saying hey I
have this new variable and it's going to
be an int but because it's a strongly
typed language it makes you put the int
first so if you've ever done a c-sharp
there's ways that you can use a VAR
keyword not stuff I'm not getting into
that here in case you guys have any sort
of c-sharp background but you can see
here that you know c-sharp is definitely
a strongly typed language so let's look
at what is considered a weakly type
language so in perl in all its glorious
wisdom will actually allow you to
declare a variable here so they have a
variable X and it's actually a string
for t and then they have a another
variable Y that's equal to 3 so this is
a string this is an int and you can
actually print these two variables so
that you can catenate the two or
multiply and then you end up getting
this string like in this adage string so
pearl because weakly type didn't
complain about the fact that x and y are
different types and didn't try to throw
an error unless you're in strict mode if
you're in strict mode it will throw an
error but a lot of people operate in
perl without
using strictmode they like the
flexibility and and that's known as
magic by the way and that's not good for
the most part they you don't want your
programming language doing some weird
stuff like that because that can
obviously have major ripples through the
rest of the execution if you
accidentally add a string to an end
because typically you would never do
that in the real world in any sort of
programming language should complain
about it because at least in the years
that I've been programming I've never
needed to do something like that I mean
there are times you do want to actually
turn like a string and number into an
int or an int into a string but I've
never you know wanted to combine the two
without any sort of complaint whether
the result like that that's that's -
that's insane
and sanity in my book so the next one up
though is that we're going to talk about
Python because python is considered to
be a dynamically strong type language a
lot of people think that python is a
weakly typed language because some of
the confusion with strong and weak
typing is that I can just I don't have
to declare what a variable is before I
actually declare it so a lot of people
think that that is actually what is a
requirement but it's not so in pythons
example we have three methods here are
no three methods but three variables
ones and n1 za-- floating-point and the
other ones are string so if we printed
all these out they all have the print
functionality because their type allows
for it but you cannot add counter plus
name without being explicit without
doing a casting argument Python will
complain it won't allow you to do that
because it is strongly typed when you
declare a name to be a string it's a
string and that's its string type if you
then try to add counter to string it's
not going to work because it's you know
counter is an INT and name as a string
so I'm going to sum up this video by
saying that when you have a type system
which most programming languages have
some sort of type system its main goal
is to establish the rules for assigning
types to any sort of object and objects
are just like basically little bits of
memory in your computer system so that
is really all
it's a rule system that says hey strings
do this strings get this you know these
rules ants get these rules if I have
somebody trying to add an end to a
string I need to either establish which
type it needs to be because I can't just
magically make a string int doesn't
exist so that is really what a type
system consists of just trying to figure
out the type if if it doesn't know or be
explicit about the type so that's that's
it guys thanks for watching have a good
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
