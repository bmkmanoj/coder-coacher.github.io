we looked at this stop props in this
video we're going to be looking at this
Don State the other way of being able to
reference data from within your
application so I want to get rid of all
this stuff from the previous video if
you want to learn about this stop props
check out the previous video for more
information react components have a
certain hierarchy a lifestyle a life
cycle basically so there's an within its
cycle it has things where you can render
an initial state or you can get the
component before it updates or get the
component after it actually binds to the
HTML document so there's a different
life cycle but in this one we want to
look at get initial state so this is a
built-in function that you can add to
your react component and it's going to
automatically call this get initial
state to reference data that gets passed
back so that data let's go ahead and
just assign a JavaScript object in like
the previous video we'll just say one
those Travis to I said we're returning
this which is really just a JavaScript
object we're assigning it the value data
so that now you'll see that we're not
passing any props into the component but
we can reference the component by saying
this dot state dot data and then we'll
just go ahead and say dot one and when
we refresh it you can see that we get
Travis again so it's referencing state
so why is this important let's take a
look we're going to say button we'll
just say on click so we're going to add
an on-click event and we're going to say
the unclick is this dot
I'm just calling a handle clay
alright so this is just a simple button
that we're passing down when we click on
click it's going to fire this which
means the component itself handle click
well where is handle play it's not
defined yet we need to define it let's
define it and we're just assigning it
the value of a function and we're going
to change the value of this state so
we're going to say this dot set state
and we're going to change data we're
going to say data now equals what f this
changed and this needs to be in a
function call by the way so that there
needs new parentheses there so what
we're doing is we're just assigning the
value of a string to data where data
used to be an object but we're going to
watch what happens here so let's see so
when we refresh the page nothing's going
to happen Travis is still going to be
there but we have this button so when it
says click me mofo I click it and
something happen you change state but it
didn't rerender the reason why I didn't
rear-ender is because we're referencing
a piece of string that no longer exists
data is not an object with a one key
value it's now just a regular object so
let me give a better demonstration so
we're going to have this is the old
string we're just going to have data be
a string initially let's try this one
more time this is the old string click
it what the f this changed so it changed
the state react new no server reloads or
anything like that needed to happen and
it changed the value so you can even add
logic that says you could even change
this back
so you could say like if this state data
equals this will say what the f is
changed so we'll pass in the exact
string and we can say only if that data
equals that value go ahead and change it
back to its original value and this is
why I get initial state is so important
because gate initial state is going to
set the order of events for you in sets
what it should start out at and when you
click this it didn't work so did we get
an error message I probably did
something wrong here no no error message
yeah it's really just me being stupid
and tired but really you want to wrap
this in an else condition because the
initial to the first time it needs to
change it's obviously not going to equal
this and it's never going to change so
we need to actually change this will say
this subset state this is kind of a
stupid thought out plan I didn't really
think anything through but it's fine all
right so we're basically so we're going
to set this value the first time and I
just want to show you that you can
switch it back and forth know it
switches back and forth so you can
understand the logic there we had to set
it the first time and once you set it
the first time this is always going to
be it basically then goes through the
back and forth state changes anyway guys
so that's going to end this video on
state how it works why it works state
should only be used if you know that the
values that it's going to store are
going to be changed based on some sort
of action that occurs inside of your
user interface you don't want to overuse
state if a props can work for you anyway
guys thanks for watching please
subscribe to this this series and this
channel thank you for all the support
and you guys have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
