we're going to be looking at nine free
options in order to do to find a web
host in 2017 so I've always recommended
Linode and I have an affiliate link in
the description tab below but it doesn't
really pay me anything I think I get a
free month if you guys stick with them
for three months so I've never once been
able to capitalize off of that but I
always recommend Leno but at the same
time if there's like 10 and 20 dollar
accounts and some of you guys don't have
10 or 20 dollars in order to pay so the
you know this video is actually catered
towards the people that literally have
no money or at least don't want to spend
any money and where can they go so the
first one is app Harbor and keep in mind
out these these products in themselves
don't have it's not like they're going
to give you the world for free basically
so the point is though is that they do
have a free tier so you can see app
Harbor has a $0 option and you can you
know get your hostname and things like
that so definitely check these guys out
I'll have the description or the links
in the description tab below now the
next one is Amazon's AWS so they
actually have a free tier as well so a
lot of companies are getting on board
with the free tiers and if we look down
here you can see Amazon's
free tier enables you to gain hands-on
experience with AWS so basically AWS and
I've talked about this in one of my
previous videos about what
certifications you should look to get in
the 2017 and beyond I mean AWS cloud
certification is one of the most popular
right now so a lot of companies are
looking to hire people that understand
Amazon AWS and to be honest with you
this is something that I'm going to be
learning myself and then 2017 because
I'm very curious about AWS I've never
I've never hosted with them and you know
there's such a large force in the web
development world that I think it's
important to learn them the next one is
gear host so they also have a free free
monthly session as well here so you can
see how much uses you get you don't get
a ton of usage you know honestly I paid
$20 a month and I get a terabyte of
bandwidth but with Lenovo here you can
see it
say if you know it's free you can't
argue with free so the next one is a go
mix and go mix this website looks like
crap but um I could just be me maybe
it's the pink background I don't know
but the bottom line is they do have a
free option as well now the Google App
Engine that's something that it's funny
I actually use them like way back in the
day and then I moved away from them I
think I moved a webfaction inland oh and
I've been winnowed for very long time
but the App Engine is still a relevant
option here and they do have a free tier
as well just be careful with them I
remember I used to have a free resources
as well and I did a database query and I
hit the database pretty hard I ended up
losing all my free resources and I
couldn't access my website until either
the new month rolled around or my paid
money the next one is a Heroku which is
a really popular option in the web world
and you can see that once again one
person starts to do free other people
have to start to work free as well
because you know they don't want to be
you know phased out of the entire
industry and things like that so there's
a whole lot of like I've always said
when it comes to like pirating software
like companies don't want their software
pirated but if you have your software
being pirated from somebody who wouldn't
be able to buy it anyway because they
can't afford there was always the
possibility that by them using it
they're promoting it and then all you
know so there's money and promotion and
then also there is the situation where
like okay I know how to use that and
some company can end up hiring me to use
that some company that can afford to buy
the product legit can pay that person in
order to then use that product so I
don't know that it's completely lost
revenue in all pirating situations but
only if the cheap bastards can't afford
it and just getting they're not cheap
but but it but if you can't afford it
any pirate then you're just an asshole
so that's really it so the next one is
IBM bluemix and this one there's a free
trial so this probably isn't as good
some of the options the other ones
because it's only 30 days pretty but at
least you know iBM is giving you a taste
of what they offer without having to put
down some cash up front the next option
is open shift and open shift also has a
Developer Preview
which is free and once again I don't
know the exact the exact ins and outs of
this free trial but it seems like it's
more of a like a monthly you know free
month type of thing so maybe not as good
as some of the other options as well and
the next one is Z tour site I'm not sure
how you pronounce that but this one also
has a free option here you can see 20
free deploys per month free back up so
this is actually a pretty good option
here so since free forever I'm always
hesitant to ever put anything on my
website this is free forever because you
never know when you need to make some of
that cash but anyway those are nine free
options in order to give web development
up and started so definitely let me know
what you guys think if you have any
other options or anything just feel free
to leave a comment below and I
appreciate that make sure you guys vote
up the video share also this video is
sponsored by my sponsor Deb mountain
coding boot camp I don't know why I say
that all the time like my sponsor but
the bottom line is the video is
sponsored by Deb mountain coding boot
camp and they're a coding boot camp out
of Provo Utah but they also have courses
in Salt Lake City as well as Dallas
Texas and there are 12 and 16 week
courses that focus primarily on the web
development aspect of things and and
they're their entire goal is to be able
to get you into the industry after you
complete the program so they're one of
the highest rated coding boot camps out
there right now so make sure you guys
check them out the links in the
description below but they focus on
things like nodejs
react angular so if you're looking to
get your foot in the door using a coding
bootcamp there's really not too many
other options that or any options as far
as I know in the coding bootcamp arena
better encoder than the dev Mountain so
let me know what you guys take of the
video and once again thank you for
watching check out that mountain and
have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
