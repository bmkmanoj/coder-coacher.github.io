be me fumbling around with getting
Travis the build continuous integration
tool and just so you guys know
continuous integration is kind of like a
a blanket statement for essentially
being able to automate a lot of the
build process and what the build process
is anytime you have a bunch of files
that are being deployed to a server
you're gonna have differences in those
files in a development environment
compared to like a production
environment as you start getting into
even bigger and more complex programs
and stuff like that and development you
know for major companies they not just
have one you know they may not have one
production environment they have might
have multiple tiers in multiple
different levels of you know different
databases and things that they use for
regression testing and integration
testing and all this stuff so ultimately
things can get very unwieldy so a Travis
continuous integration tool is just
built to be able to automate some of
that stuff and basically it's set up on
like github so that you should be able
to just every time you check in a change
to your github and you push it your
change in this integration tool should
automatically run and I'm sure you guys
have seen it where it's like you know
Travis test you know fail and all this
stuff so there's quite a lot going on
with what I'm working on right now that
I've just recently started getting
involved in so I can't really do a
tutorial on it but I just figured that
you know what there's some blogs out
there to kind of help you out a little
bit but to me it was it was a little bit
lacking so let me go ahead and and just
show you guys number one what we got
going on so here's this base I project
which is you know I've talked about this
this open source project and I'm just
kind of messing around with you get more
familiar with node and github and the
entire kit process really so the first
thing I needed to do in fact this
doesn't even have some refreshing in
here I went into github you have to
create a dot Travis out YAML file and
inside here there's actually a specific
way you have to set this up so that if
you're using node or Ruby or Python
whatever it is there's gonna be a
different way that you do this and
essentially this is just checking all
the different node versions specifically
I'm developing for node 5.1 so it's
it's a nice feature that this will
actually run the code and see that it's
valid for known different versions of
node that you're not even developing in
locally so that's one major benefit of
using a tool like this number two like I
said it automatically fires off as soon
as you actually submit it build so
before I even submit a bill here what I
want to do is actually do a pull oh my
get I mean I'm using Visual Studio Coco
code and this is something that let me
see here all right so I need to actually
commit before I can pull these down
somebody's to make sure you can see the
changes that I've made here and I'll
explain this in just a moment but let me
go ahead and commit these letters say
added mocha test framework all right so
now that I've done that it's gone wait a
second and now I can do a pull so I'm
pulling the changes down from the server
okay and now that I've done that
there's no conflicts or anything so
everything should be down and one of the
things I should have pointed out is this
Travis table yml file was not down on my
local system because that is something
that I added from github and I didn't
add it from my local environment so I
have three files checked out on my local
environment that I'm gonna push up to
github the repository but this Travis
out yml was created on the repository
and I just pulled it down by doing that
that pull commands so now that that's in
here everything's fine but I still need
to push up my changes so I'm gonna go
ahead and do that so I'll go ahead and
go over here and I'll just say push so
now this is going to prompt me to put in
my username email and password forget
which I'll go ahead and do that
all right and just for security purposes
I'm not gonna show you guys my
information there so now I went ahead
and I put that in so I pushed it up so
if I go back over to github and I
refresh you can see that now there's 28
commits if I click on a committee you
can see that you know all these these
changes have been made so to look at
this you can see this added mocha test
framework so you guys saw me push that
up and alright now that that is done one
of the things that Travis yml is gonna
end up doing is it's going to run my my
test command so that was something that
actually had me confused initially I
have this test and and I just have two
basic tests because I've never used
mocha before but mocha is a project that
is specifically it's probably the most
popular testing framework tool for for
nodejs
oh it's like I'm trying to pull it up
so here is this is a testing framework
and if you guys have never done unit
testing I'm gonna probably do a
different series on how to unit test and
stuff like that or at least show you
guys what I'm doing but ultimately you
should be testing your code and moeka
can do that for you makes a lot easier
and I put it all inside this test folder
so I just have two plain tests that are
just returning successful and then what
I what I did is I went into my NPM I
didn't config file for my nodejs project
and really it's so the package that
jason so if you run NPM I name it
creates a package jason for you and in
here i went ahead and i added to the dev
dependencies that way people that are
downloading my project aren't going to
be downloading this mocha framework just
to run my project or be able to use my
project this is just specifically in a
dev dependency because you only want
that to be it's really only necessary
for the development for anybody that's
you know contributing to this stuff so
there's that okay so next thing is is I
went ahead and I edited the script so
this test is actually using these
keywords and it says mocha and then it
tells it to look for the /testdir
directory so dot you know goes back into
rectory and then it finds this test
folder and then I do the flag recursive
because I actually want all the test
files in here to be run so that's what
the - - recursive is so if I were to run
this from my command line I would just
say MPM test and what MPM test is doing
is it knows to look inside your packages
a JSON file it says oh here's test it's
a script command because I'm running it
from the command line so by running
tests it's secretly behind the scenes
actually running mocha dot test - -
recursive so you can see it's actually
it ran both of those tests so here's the
first one here's the second one and both
are passing so two passing tests so
that's good so now what I need to be
able to figure out though is how do I
get Travis dot yml to actually run you
know this test so let's go ahead and and
do that real quick and I'm not even sure
and I've never done this before actually
so I don't know if this is going to work
at all
but let's go ahead and look at the
Travis account that I have
all right so here's my I'm actually
looking at all these and here's another
thing too this is actually going to tell
you for all the different project types
the options that you have alright so
here is uh the Travis CI so this is
actually something that you use in
conjunction with github and when you
actually create a Travis CI account you
can create your account from github and
then once you're in Travis CI you could
actually see all of the projects you
have by going to your profile and then
inside here you can see all the projects
that you have admin rights to which is
interesting because some of these I
don't even own and had hardly anything
to do with well actually most of these
are Forks nevermind so they're all
admins I'm sorry these are all Forks of
mine which I don't do anything with so
many of those but anyway here's the
Bayside one that I actually enabled to
to active so that way when I go ahead
and I click on this we did a check in
and it's the fourth check in and you
could see that it has a status where it
says ok I ran into a problem targeting
the node dot zero six version and it
really I don't even know what this
problem would be but I don't even know
that I care because I don't really want
to target that low of a version so what
I'm going to do then I'm actually going
to update my Travis yml file within
github to tell it not to target that
version because really I don't want to I
can actually just edit it right in here
and I'll go ahead and do that and I'll
say not targeting point zero six so I
mean for me that I mean that that goes
way back with nodes original
implementation and really I'm using five
point one I probably should upgrade mine
but for the most part you know it's
probably good in some sense so you can
see that now we have another commit so
you can see not targeting nodejs six so
now Travis should automatically pick up
on that so you can see now this build
process is going on and it's running
everything because I said not targeting
dot zero six notes so that is the latest
commit and once again this is the whole
a whole continuous integration thing so
I checked in something but it could be
another team member that checked in
something but automatically this thing
is going to run all the tests that you
tell it to run and if a test were to
fail then this should notify you that
the tests had failed and everything but
you can see everything everything passed
and if we click on it we can see more
information you can even see that the
tests down here were run so this thing
was smart enough to know hey look at the
package.json file and run the test
command which ended up firing off mocha
and it was even smart enough to know
that you know mocha is a part of the
doubt dependency and everything so
ultimately this is this is pretty sweet
I think too because uh although it's
pretty sweet this is the first time I've
even started messing with this I think
that's really awesome but I've been
telling you guys um you asked like how
do I get my name out there how do I do
this and that
um you start you start your github
account guys build a project help me on
this one if you want I mean I'll try to
help you through it even if you're a
complete noob but I mean it's just you
got a playa riding up poking around with
this stuff and Mele confusing so
hopefully this gives you guys a little
bit of a high level and it's not like a
step by step I'll probably do a separate
video of like a step by step how did I
do this you know starting from like
building a blank repository and then
making a first couple of commits but on
this video you guys saw me do a commit
you saw me do a pull you saw me add
stuff to my ein it's my package JSON
file so that it could automatically run
my moko tests and everything you even
saw how the Travis CI was integrated
into github using the Travis Scott yml
file and you know the versions of node
that we were targeting so let me know if
you guys have any questions or anything
hopefully this was somewhat helpful for
anybody that might not know what CI
tools and Travis is and you know benefit
or even what a unit test is so the unit
testing is very you know fairly complex
subject and I'll talk about that more in
the future but thanks guys thanks for
watching have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
