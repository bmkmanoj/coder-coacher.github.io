looking at the footer and a PrestaShop
you can actually edit this this message
down here so we can actually say your
company name which is the appropriate
thing to do anytime you have a copyright
on a website you want to make sure
whoever owns the actual media or
whatever is is recognized as such so
what you need though is you need to
actually edit some of the files within
the PrestaShop installation and upload
those to your servers so what we need to
do first when you find out if you have a
copy of PrestaShop on your home computer
which you probably should because any
edits you make you should do it on your
home and then upload it to the server so
you're not messing up something on the
server that can't be easily redone
alright so let's go ahead and my shop is
in a folder named Terra
and Sai PrestaShop alright what we're
going to be looking for is a folder
called themes once you're in there we
have just the standard default theme so
you want to go ahead and click on that
and then we want to look for modules
after that we're gonna look for block
CMS then block CMS dot TPL actually
block CMS yeah this is the TPL file
right here so let's go ahead and open
that and I'm using Visual Studio you
could probably even use a notepad file
if you wanted to but if you do any sort
of development you probably have some
sort of a IDE which stands for
integrated development environment that
you use to edit files and things like
that but anyway I'm using this so what
we want to look for is we're gonna look
for the and copy and you can see here
it's an copy 2014 which is good this we
want and instead of any of this stuff
here let me go ahead and replace it and
I'm simply just going to redirect back
to the home thing to the home site
but let's go ahead and change this out
this trademark and all that stuff and
we're going to put our company name or
whoever owns the website and then inside
the HOF address we might as well just
point it back to our store if you don't
have another website that you want to
point it to and let me think so after
that just press ctrl s to save it and
then we need to have FileZilla pulled up
so that we can go to where the files are
located inside themes and going to the
same thing default modules block how was
it called block CMS so we'll go in there
so on this side we do the same thing so
we'll go to themes default modules
blocks EMS and I'm going to upload this
foot file here and then when we visit
our website if we refresh we're gonna
see that it says e-commerce software
powered by new media LLC but really I
don't want the e-commerce software
because I didn't write that and that
just seems kind of messed up to do that
so let's see if we can change that so
one simple way is just simply take
whatever is inside of here and see if
that'll work so we'll upload that file
again I just want to see what the result
is yeah it actually erased the other
stuff so we don't want to do that let me
see so all we gotta do then I just
replace this
hell I don't do any of this awful PHP
development I'm gonna Python and C sharp
guy but let me um let me figure this out
one second all right so to get it to do
we want keep the brackets and all that
crap and get rid of this all the way to
the bracket and just have the % and the
s and then once you do that save it
upload it go to the website refresh it
and you can see now it points back to
the PrestaShop location and if you
didn't want it to open up well you know
it might as well open up a new file but
anyway that's that's it for this
tutorial thanks guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
