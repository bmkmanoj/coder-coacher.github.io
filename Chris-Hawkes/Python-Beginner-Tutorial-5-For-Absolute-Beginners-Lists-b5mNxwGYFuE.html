so in this video I want to focus on
lists lists are one of the most
important concepts to Python programming
it's usually the easiest way to store
data and we're going to see a couple of
other alternatives that you can own that
you can store data in but lists are
definitely the most popular version of
any sort of container that you can
actually put data inside of you can
think of a container it's almost like
this variable is essentially a container
that holds this value of cat and this
container of my variable we know these
are called variables but you can think
of them as just boxes and they contain
you know a set of data okay and this is
a string but it could also contain an
integer or number and it contain other
things now a Python list though can
contain multiple objects so that's what
it is it's basically a bigger container
that can that can hold containers
strings numbers it doesn't matter you
can throw almost anything in it and in
order to make a list we just have to
create a variable name let's say my list
equals now keep in mind you can't say
list this is a reserved keyword so you
can see it turns green here so me zoom
in here so you definitely can't use a
reserved keyword we talked about that in
the first video if you guys haven't
watched at MoMA skip over the or skip
back to that video but anyway that's
what it is it's these little square
brackets and in case you guys are
looking for them it should be above your
Enter key word on the inner key word
towards the middle of your keyboard and
there's just an open and closed bracket
now anything inside of these open and
closed brackets are actually what is
contained inside the list so if I were
to assign values I can do that I can say
apple pear orange so now this list
called my list actually holds three
strings but the flexibility of Python
which is really nice compared to other
programming languages especially if you
compare this as something like a list
everything in Python is essentially an
object so this works without
having to do any additional work you can
just pass an actual number in another
thing you can do is you could actually
have an empty list inside of there which
is a list with no value or it could just
be another name so we can say another
list equals this is another another list
and then we going to reference it here
so the point I'm trying to make here is
that Python lists are extremely flexible
and they hold all kinds of data so this
is just a simple string but we saw that
we could make a bigger string and may
write an HTML file so you could have
thousands of HTML files inside of a list
if that's what you wanted to do now a
few things that we want to mess with as
far as with a list is on we can do
things like getting the length of a list
by saying print and then saying le n and
then inside of parentheses we're going
to say my list so this is actually going
to print the value the nut and the
numerical value of how many elements are
inside of this list so you can see that
it prints out five and we say one two
three four five and you're going to be
like if you're keen or maybe some of you
guys are going to point out like I
thought Python and computers start
counting at zero and you are right but
they don't start counting at zero when
you're trying to get something like the
length of the list so the value is five
and there's five elements in there that
would be confusing if there were five
elements and the value you got returned
is four now what if I wanted to add
something to my list what I can do is I
can say my list dot append you can see
even your editor tells you all about the
append and inside the parentheses just
give will say another fruit and we'll
get rid of the number and variable here
to clean this up a bit all right so
there's list and let's go ahead and just
print the actual my list to the command
prompt so we'll run this and in the
debug console down here you're going to
see that it actually has banana in there
so obviously that's because we added
here it wasn't so you don't have to
actually put all your values in the list
when you declare it because then that
wouldn't be very helpful the reason why
is like maybe you're scouring the web
and you're
looking for all the occurrences of like
your favorite musician and every time
you see your favorite musician on a
webpage you're going to insert into a
list of like your favorite websites or
something like that you would insert the
name of the website in here for every
occurrence and obviously you wouldn't
know about all those occurrences before
you actually started running your
programming and discovering that so it's
important obviously that list has the
ability to add stuff to it another thing
too is if you need it to and you'll see
this occasionally in programming
languages but you probably won't use it
very often but it is important that you
actually learn learn how to use it if
you say my list up hop let's go ahead
and take a look at this so you'll see
the pop keyboard used a lot well not a
lot maybe but you do see it actually in
programming languages and stuff but it
grabs the actual last element it pops it
off the stack so this follows a LIFO
which stands for last in first out so
orange was the last end and it's the
first out so that can be considered the
life of stack and a FIFO is first in
first out so in many cases you're
popping off the top you know so if you
have a stack of papers and that's why
they consider it a stack you grab the
top one off the stack now a lot of
people will say what's the opposite of a
stack and I say a lot of people I'm
giving you a description of this
actually so you can think of LIFO lastin
first-out as a stack of papers and
you're just grabbing the top paper off
and that's what pop is doing now if you
had a queue where you wanted like okay
like you know typically you're waiting
in line for something you should be
going ahead of the person that came in
behind you because that would be some
 right if you waited in a line
and everybody that came in behind you
got to go first so that's nice so you
could think of that as a queue and that
is first-in first-out
which is FIFO so if I wanted to do first
in first out then you can actually get
that value
as well now in order to do that it's
actually a really weird situation like
pop will grab the last element but if
you wanted to grab the first in
JavaScript there's something called on
shift which will grab the first element
and Python though you actually say pop
zero and zero is the index and we'll get
into that in just a moment
oh but the first element so you're going
to see that this will actually get Apple
and you're probably well when I print
the damn thing I don't see Apple I
thought I'd grab that but well you could
assign this as your variable we can say
variable our way I'll just say my my
fruit equals and then we'll print my
fruit that way you guys can actually see
that it's pulling out Apple now how do I
get the last one you don't pass in zero
I need to get in the habit of hitting
the refresh page there all right so you
can see it grabs orange the Rose the
last one so in Python though you
typically don't see that you actually
see first elements being grabbed via the
index and an interesting thing about
lists and actually with strings as well
is that you can grab individual elements
so if I wanted to grab Apple I would
actually reference its index I would say
just bring in my fruit again my fruit
equals my lit my list and then inside
square brackets I'm going to say zero
and that actually says get the zero
index which is really the first value
because remember computers start
counting at zero so it's interesting
that if you get the length of the list
it doesn't start counting at zero but if
you need to grab something in the list
you reference the first item by zero and
start counting up from there so this is
going to return Apple now this is
something that you will see fairly
common you're going to see this type of
stuff all the time it's just getting a
certain value so we run this I'm not
printing it damn it print
my fruit so you can see a grabs Apple
now what if I wanted to get pear then
you would just pass them one and if you
wanted to get orange you would pass in
two so that is how you actually grab
stuff in a list by index another
interesting thing too is by using
indexes it also gives you the ability to
insert a certain piece of fruit at any
part inside your list so I could
actually say my list insert and then
inside here the first argument to this
method and this is actually a method and
we'll talk about more of that later on
but these methods are all part of the
Python standard library we're going to
say and the firt in the actually will
say in the first index so this is going
to be at pair we're going to say insert
and then we'll say banana okay and we're
going to print my list and you can see
banana got inserted there so what if I
said you know I wanted to be between
pear and oranges you need to say I
orange because wherever you say the
index should be that's where it's going
to be inserted in front of that
so there you go so that's really
interesting but now you can be like you
know what I'm going to say shrimp and
started shrimp they're shrimps not a
fruit so how do I remove shrimp first
let's look and make sure that shrimp is
there you can see shrimp is there so
we'll say my list he's here so now I
need to say my lips dot remove and then
I can pass in the value of shrimp so if
I run this shrimp should not be inside
of our list anymore so that's how you
actually remove an element from your
list now you guys might be like well
that sucks I can only add one element at
a time like if I have a bunch of fruits
I don't want to just add have to keep
doing that statement over and over again
but what you can do is you can say my
list out extend and inside of extend you
could say banana
what's another fruit strawberry and
tomato even though a lot of people think
it's vegetables or fruit um so let's
look at this so now when we say my list
and we print my oh wait now we have a
problem here one second the reason why
guys I'm sorry this is a is a function
that you pass in a list to the function
my bad that's a stack trace and this is
always good every once in a while I'm
not going to edit this mistake out
because when you're programming you're
going to make mistakes all the time and
being able to figure out what you did
wrong is actually something that will
take a long time when you're first
getting started but you'll get better at
it and you'll be like oh yeah clearly
missed that but there you go so you can
see that you can add a bunch of elements
to your list by using extend and it's
much easier than trying to insert things
one at a time so I think that's about
where actually know what I'm going to
focus on one more thing this video is
actually covering a lot with list by
lists or like so important is I want to
focus on slices because slices are
another powerful thing where I could say
new list this name of the variable
equals my
. i'll say it's actually not the slice
cure their slice is actually in other
languages here but if i want to say grab
me the first two elements I would
actually say zero inside the square
bracket zero and then separated by an
actual colon you would say where you
want it to end so we'll say two actually
all right so this should grab the first
two elements I believe unless I'm
looking at that wrong we'll see much
let's print new listo down here so we'll
print a new list all right so that will
grab the first two elements as you can
see so once again it actually goes to
the second element so here's 0 1 2 but
it says oh stop here and it just grabs
these two so if I wanted it to stop here
you know obviously would say three now
one of the things because I'm not in
Python every single day but I believe
you can do negative indexes as well and
that should grab the last element so you
can see a tomato is grabbed so if you
want to go backwards you could do that
in fact you could even go backwards like
this negative 2 that's even it's even
crazier so Python gives you so much
freedom that you actually don't have in
a lot of other programming languages
that didn't actually find anything is I
think that would be good 0 - yeah let's
try that see I don't normally do this
actually it's not going to work all
right never mind don't don't do negative
indexes but you can do like if you
wanted to go okay I need to go from the
the first value so I don't want Apple is
that 0 and I'm going to go first
and if I want to go all the way to the
end then I can do negative 0 1 because
that is obviously the last element so
don't try to do what I just showed you a
second ago because I thought you could
actually do that but you can but anyway
here is your saying start at the first
element which is here and end at the
last element so if you don't know how
long or how big your list is this is an
easy way to say go all the way to the
end of the list because the other way to
get you
the lists we saw as we could say end of
list equals my muffler length of my list
so this returns actual number so I could
say I could pass in a variable but why
would I do all that it's much easier
just to have the negative one but let's
put a breakpoint here so you guys can
see what I'm doing because obviously end
of the list is going to get the e value
so we have is six so this thing says all
the way to the end of the list and it
goes six and it grabs them all so once
again no need to have to build a
variable just to do that every variable
you create in your program if you can
prevent it it makes your program
slightly fast or even though you're not
going to notice it to the human eye but
it's just it's less memory that has to
be set aside to do something that you
could easily do through just some
trickery like this so anyway guys on
thanks for watching this video I'm going
to go and wrap this up on lists and
Python make sure you subscribe share
this with all your friends
and thank you guys for watching have a
good day and bye hey guys so a lot of
you asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
wanna take a moment to mention dev
