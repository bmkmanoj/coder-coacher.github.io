developing with some TV the new Python
cross-platform business-friendly GPU
accelerated GUI developer for Android
iOS Windows Linux all that stuff Mac and
it's definitely showing a lot of promise
and it's still under heavy development
so it changes all the time there's
probably be some bugs and stuff but it's
a good opportunity to jump on a brand
new technology stack I hopefully be able
to utilize it to your advantage so it
looks like it has a lot of promise so in
this video I'm going to save you a ton
of time by getting this thing to install
because there the install instructions
especially if you're on Windows and
Windows 8 specifically is a real pain in
the ass to say the least I just spent
like an hour and it didn't work so best
thing to do though is you can go to this
website which I'll place inside the
description of the video and you can
download
kivi I'm using Python 2 7 so I'm using
the 32 bit version of Python 2 7 so I'm
going to grab the latest TV version
which is 1 8 0 there might be 181 in
development right now but let's go ahead
and take a step back because I could not
get 181 to work very well with Windows 8
so just download this and it will it
will run an installer now it says here
that it requires PI games so you also
need to install PI game for whichever
version of Windows you're using once
again I'm using a 32 bit Python 2 7 but
just pick whatever installer you need to
get that joint running once you do that
let's go ahead and build our basic
application and keavy and we're just
going to simply copy this base code down
here and I have a project I actually
want to go ahead and create I believe
let me see
where is it okay here I'm going to
career I'm going to call it first I'll
say first TV app and I'm using Visual
Studio you can use whatever the
development environment you want it's up
to you so it creates a map location or a
script for me first QB app does a hello
world but we're going to go ahead and
paste in the cue example and I'm going
to start this app and if everything went
well you're going to see this this Kibby
GUI pull up so it's pretty awesome and
and then following videos we're going to
try to get into how we can learn how to
become a professional with TV alright
guys thanks for watching please
