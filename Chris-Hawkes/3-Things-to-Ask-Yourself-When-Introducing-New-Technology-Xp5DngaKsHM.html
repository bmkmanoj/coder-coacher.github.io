to anybody that celebrates holidays and
I know that there's all kinds of
different ones and I'm not trying to be
like super liberal or whatever by saying
holidays instead of Christmas or
Hanukkah or whatever but the fact of the
matter is is everybody celebrates around
different things and what I there's a
few things that are guaranteed in life
you know one of the guarantees is that
Domino's Pizza is probably the worst
pizza of any major joint in the United
States for whatever reason like every
time I get well actually I don't even go
there anymore but when I end up eating
it because like a relative or something
order is it I'm just basically choking
that garbage down so no offense to
dominoes or anybody owns or works there
but you guys have terrible pizza man I'm
sorry one of the things that kind of
sucks recently is at YouTube just
recently and I don't know how recent it
was but they updated their settings so
that I can't actually sort through my
most active subscribers or even like my
longest subscriber if I go down and look
at my subscribers I have to click load
more over and over and over again for 40
not you know forty four thousand
subscribers in order to try to figure
out who the longest subscribed member is
I don't really understand that so maybe
there's some sort of reasoning why
YouTube remove that but it just it's
weird like one moment it's there and
then the next moment it's gone you can't
you can't sort through any of these
columns at all which I mean that really
sucks man that really sucks because I
was actually going to try to make a
shout out it's the end of the year be
like you know here there's some of the
longest members that have been
subscribed to me and now I don't even
really have any way of knowing and it
would probably take me hours to sit
through and even try to figure out who
the original one out of looks almost
forty four thousand people is on the
channel so sorry about that guys I did
want to give a big thanks to everybody
that watches the channel and subscribes
and one of the things I want to talk
about tonight and this is really just a
takeaway of talking to a buddy another
programming guy who's actually a lead
programmer and when he was reading the
article about how it feels to write web
development or
web development in 2016 he thought it
was hilarious but one of the interesting
things about this guy is that like he's
always operated by the kiss model which
is K ISS which stands for keep it simple
stupid so that's like that's always his
motto he's never on the cutting edge
he's never on the bleeding edge he's
always like yeah you know it's cool what
you did was react or what you did was
redux not sup but I could have done the
same thing and jquery and not dealt with
all those you know five or six maybe
even 15 dependencies that you've now
introduced into the project and things
like that so he's always that kind of
guy that takes that sort of an approach
and you know I've known him for years
and every time I would be like yeah I'm
working on this new thing and and for
the longest time I was like The Advocate
I was the you know the newbie that was
like yeah this this technology is
awesome and you'd be I was so you know
what is it what is it doing for you in
and then that's where i would like start
falling short on my argument so one of
the things that i think everybody all
developers should be aware of when
they're trying to either promote promote
new technology for you know their
workplace to use it or even to use it in
their own projects there's really three
main questions that you should ask so
number one is what and what am i trying
to solve by using this tool and then the
second question would be how is this
tool helping solve that problem and then
probably the third and really the
arguably the most important question you
would want to ask is what sort of
liabilities or problems could i be
introducing into the project by using
this new technology so for so long for
many years and even now I would
introduce new technology into my project
simply because I was like listening to
the hype I was like you know I need to
be doing this because everybody else is
doing that this is where the industry is
going and I would spend you know weeks
or months trying to get up to date on
some new technology and ultimately if I
would you know step away from the
project for a couple weeks couple months
especially the side projects and then
come back to them it took a while but
eventually I started understanding the
same mentality of like oh my god I use
this this plug-in in this tool and I
have all these dependencies I have no
idea like I don't
remember number one when I was doing but
even getting in and you know looking at
the code and things like that it's just
it's it's interesting how much
complexity we can add into our live is
based on a simple plug in one of the
stories that comes to mind is everybody
is using babel these days to compile
java script to standard like yes or
basically yes 2015 javascript which is
the es6 standard and getting that to
compile into older versions so we use we
use babel to do that and and we're using
tools like web pack and when you use
nodes NPM package manager you're saying
you know npm install let's just say
Redux for example SI un p.m. redox and
you look at the dead dependencies that
redox has and they have quite a few but
that doesn't really apply unless you're
actually working on the project so let's
go ahead and pull this out real quick so
you can see what I'm talking about and
so I'm just going to pull this up on
github real quick so you can see the
project now everybody nowadays in modern
web development we're using the
package.json which we do by saying npm
inet which creates this package.json
forest sports so we can keep track of
all of our dependencies and things like
that but here's just as this Redux
project so if we were to NPM install
redox to our local folder redox you can
see has four dependencies so these
dependencies have to be in place in
order for this thing to run it is an
actual dependency to the project so it
has see is lodash also load Ashdod es lo
lu simplify whatever the hell that is
and then symbol observable so that all
needs to be used now then you have all
the dev dependencies so just by a simple
NPM install to use redox number one
you'd want to ask yourself do I need to
use redux and even on Redux is
documentation at least Dan abramov you
know as an uprated enough do to be like
if you have to ask whether or not you
need Redux you most likely don't so that
goes back to what that guy you know my
buddy was telling me like you know that
is the first question you have to ask do
you need this product I what problem are
you trying to solve I mean that is the
first what problem are you trying
so then how is this tool actually going
to help me solve that problem and then
what sort of dependencies or issues
could I be introducing into my project
because of that no plugin so when we
look at that you know so often we don't
look at okay these four dependencies are
now being brought in so if i have a new
production app application that is
costing millions of dollars in
development and it could be bringing in
millions of dollars a day or billions of
dollars depending on what type of system
this is we now have four dependencies
just to use redox now once we in the
interesting thing is like mpm will go
out and it will install lodash for
dot-to-dot one so if we looked up lodash
on github and we looked at its
dependencies it probably has its own
range of dependencies each one of these
things has its own licenses so is
anybody actually going through and
spending enough time it is kind of a
separate issue of looking at each one
every one of those licenses to make sure
that we actually have permission to use
them and that we have permission to use
them in the way that we think that we do
whether we're distributing software or
setting up our own open source project
and just introducing it into it there's
so many different questions I think that
come in with that third question like
what sort of problems am I introducing
by using this so it goes back to number
one what problem I trying to solve and
do I really need this tool is it really
what is it going to do it can I do the
same thing with some you know some
jQuery hiding and showing up some divs
or do I really need a virtual Dom with
react and react router and react router
Redux and you know what i mean so it's
it's a very interesting you know it's
it's interesting world that we live in
with the web development this has always
been the case but what this guy was
funny because i mean he he can talk like
he's a very good speaker he's actually a
natural salesman so when it comes to
like having to explain away why you do
things the way you do it actually if i
date back to conversations I have with
this guy years ago it was very similar
to what that web article that says how
it feels to write to be a web developer
in 2016 because the guy that was like oh
it's you know 2016 nobody uses jQuery
anymore
you know I was that guy like you know at
least you know like two years ago in
fact in some ways I still am in fact
some of my buddies on give me our time
they like man you are the you know the
hipster that you talk about and and
they're probably right to some extent
because I feel like with this channel
and and also just a simple fact that I
like to learn new things that I'm always
talking about new technologies but I was
a huge advocate for a lot of these
JavaScript frameworks for the longest
time and I've always been for for Django
and things like that and you know we're
always going to have our our likes and
dislikes and things like that so I think
it's natural to try to you know promote
a product that you feel comfortable with
but the simple fact is is that I was
promoting technology that you know
number one I wasn't looking at all its
dependencies and I wasn't really asking
those hard questions about what type of
you know problems could I be introducing
into you know the software to use this
product and is it really worth the you
know the additional effort and one of
the things that's difficult to actually
pinpoint when you talk about you know
what potential problems am I introducing
is is the actual work force if you're
building software for a major company
you have to take into consideration that
you're going to have to onboard
developers you need to hire
professionals that understand how all
this stuff works you need to be aware of
the fact that lodash for two dot one
could discover that it's got some sort
of a bug that needs to be fixed and you
update that bug and all of a sudden you
have conflicts with like you know your
code base or especially when you're
using you know webpack to bundle minify
uglify all that stuff and all of a
sudden you start having you know issues
springing up because you tried to update
some sort of low dash version because of
some bug fixed or something like that
and this is always kind of been the case
but it's one of the reasons why
companies use things like you know the
dotnet ecosystem companies especially
like major companies fortune 500s they
use net because they have you know the
assurance from a company like Microsoft
that says hey we're constantly scanning
our software and we're constantly
getting feedback and doing bug fixes and
patches and things like that and and we
know that our reputation is on the line
and we know where company and it's in
our best interest to get this stuff it's
not a community up
basically so Microsoft makes over 20
billion dollars a year in profit you
know they're not trying to lose a bunch
of profit based on some sort of you know
deficiencies that they have with their
systems and they have a lot I mean I
think windows I believe one of the
windows versions that got introduced one
time I'd like 90,000 active bugs or
something like that so it's not like
they're not plagued with this stuff but
every software company out there
discovers problems within you within
within code I mean the other day I was
looking at you know there's problems
with the way XML readers are used in
the.net and for ecosystem and and
depending on how you actually if you
don't use a memorystream you try to just
read it all in as one slurp then there's
an XML security flaw by doing it that
way and those are things that a lot of
people just don't take into
consideration but that could end up
costing a company a ton of money so
going back I guess just to kind of sum
this up man though those are three
questions you always you ask yourself
what problem I trying to solve how is
this tool going to help me solve the
problem and what sort of complications
could I be introducing into my code base
or my product or my company by using
that product so interesting stuff I
think just need to kind of ponder but
anyway this is more of like a I guess
more of a boring business type video but
some hopefully you guys find some sort
of entertainment or use out of it but
let me know if you have any questions or
anything once again happy holidays guys
it sucks I can't give a shout out to my
oldest subscribers and hopefully YouTube
fixes that because it's kind of absurd
on me it used to work and now it's gone
anyway all right guys man make sure you
subscribe also this video is sponsored
by my sponsor which is Deb mountain
coding boot camp out of provo utah and
deb mountain they offer both 12 and 16
week intensive courses that are aimed to
get your foot in the door and web
development so they focus on things like
no Jas and jQuery which is a lot of what
major companies are using in the market
right now and
their goal is to by focusing on things
like angular and react to get you well
enough to be able to land that first job
so make sure you guys check out their
their description in the video
description tab below and that would be
helping me out just by giving them a
look and seeing what they have to offer
so thanks guys and here's to a good good
holiday and a good 2017 alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
