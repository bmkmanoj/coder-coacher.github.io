tutorial in the s6 and what we're gonna
look at and this one is gonna be really
short it's gonna be the constant
keyboard and some of you guys have asked
about let's whether or not let's are
needed over bars and it's it's
interesting because I have a guy that I
know that that swears by let's things
that let's are going to replace bars and
that we should always use them and then
there's other people that will you know
let's you know they solve certain
problems right where you can't read
eclair something inside the same lexical
scope which just means inside the same
level of curly braces that you're in
which is usually what you want it's also
beneficial to be able to share variable
names without actually having to create
too explicit differently you know
different variables to have different
values like what you saw Babel doing but
I just thought I would mention that you
know let's I don't think are gonna just
magically replace all of ours I don't
think let's solve such a complicated
problem that we need to have them
replace all of our VARs I just think
there are gonna be certain areas and
you're gonna have certain people that
swear by them so it's important that you
know that we do touch upon that and in
the same breath that's what brings us to
this video which is we're gonna be
talking about the constant keyword and
if you've wanted a variable to be
declared and then never to change you
know and to know that it's never going
to change then then that's where you
would want to do a constant likes and
typically with constants I mean you
think okay well what doesn't change well
you know if there's some sort of like
maybe an invoice number or something
like that and you want to make sure that
within your program that nothing's gonna
change the invoice number for whatever a
particular object you could be messing
with because if somebody came along and
somehow change that invoice number and
passed it around it can it can maybe
create problems but hey that's really
just the first thing that I can think of
off the top of my head but to use a
constants and JavaScript name then you
would just use this Co NS T and you can
see that it's a keyword so chrome
actually supports this so we're not
going to be writing this in our text
editor because if we were to use it in
our text editor and then use babel to
compile it babel will just turn a
constance to a bar because constance is
now
supported in all the browsers and then
you wouldn't be able to test our
assertion here so we're gonna say
basically this is an immutable string an
immutable means that once you declare
you can't change it so typically with
functional languages you hear a lot
about immutable data types because less
memory has to be set aside if a variable
never changes it's technically not even
a variable at that point because it
doesn't vary it's just always true and
constant and never changing so there's
less memory that needs to be set aside
for that value so this is a constant all
right so now we've declared the
immutable string so if we type it you
can see that it returns that value so
now what happens if like later on in our
program we try to say you know what
immutable string you're now equal
changed Chrome's going to throw you an
error and say it's not possible you
can't do that it's a type error you
tried to change the value of a constant
so that is typically what you would want
if you declare a constant in the first
place and if you really wanted it to
vary then you would use a variable or
even a let assuming you don't want to
change it within the lexical scope which
is what lets or for so let's also take a
look at an interesting thing now if I
were to say a mutable object equals or
you know instead of R I'm sorry I'm so
used to borrow I'm gonna say constant a
mutable object so constants don't have
to be a type string this could be an
object and if we look at a mutable
object
you can see it's an object no if we go
ahead and we try to change it to
something else you will get the error
but you can attach objects to it so I
could say a mutable object dot test
equals this is a string added to an
immutable
so you can see that that actually worked
just fine so if we actually type a
mutable object and it returns what it is
you can see that it has tests attached
to it so I said a mutable object just it
returns to string so that I think
sometimes throws people off that just
because you have an immutable or
constant object in JavaScript that
somehow you're not gonna be able to
mutate it you can mutate it just funning
through its properties but you just
can't change it and assign it some other
value or even another object for that
matter all right so that's really it
that's all we really need to know about
the constant keyboard you will see that
in some of the newer quick jobs for
projects and thanks for watching guys
make sure you subscribe an upvote I
appreciate all the support and have a
good day bye hey guys so a lot of you
asked me how do I get my foot in the
door to become a programmer and I just
want to take a moment to mention dev
Mountain coding boot camp is a 12-week
intensive course that focuses on the
technologies of the here-and-now for web
development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs react angular how to
use github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and
this coding bootcamp and the entire goal
is to be able to get you into the
industry within 12 weeks so if you guys
are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description tab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
