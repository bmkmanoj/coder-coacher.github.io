talking about this new google October
fourth release thing they're supposedly
trying to keep everything on the down
low on the hush-hush but there's a big
marketing effort going on at Google I'm
not sure if you guys have heard about it
but the whole thing is just this October
fourth and it doesn't tell you anything
but then there's this white box and I
mean everybody speculating the fact that
Google is going to be announcing a new
smartphone it's going to be produced by
HTC some news sites have even you know
release names of what this thing is
going to be called which is google pixel
and google pixel XL and I guess that's
cool that Google's making smartphones
and everything hopefully they can extend
that horizon a little bit because what I
find interesting is that when the
smartphone industry first came out like
Steve Jobs was obviously credited with
doing that and with coming out with a
new sleek design that the iphone I mean
basically the iphone was a game-changer
it changed the way you know we viewed
handheld devices and and you know if you
fast-forward to today you look at Google
and their stats or you know more than
half the people are actually searching
on a mobile device now as programmers we
usually balk at that because we're like
damn it I can't I can't program on a
phone and for that reason I've never
been personally excited about Google's
release of its netbook or anything so
the netbook and the Chromebook or
whatever those things recall I mean that
 doesn't interest me at all because
for me I need a fast computer that can
do some graphics processing that can do
some good programming and things like
that and it just doesn't interest me to
have some book that can connect to the
internet a little bit better even my on
my Galaxy s7 I wasn't really excited for
this in fact I bought the phone because
I had an S five before this but I could
care less that it was an s7 I just
bought it because it was the the latest
phone out now it does have a good video
recording capability at least I think so
for an actual phone that you use to you
know call people so you know I'm not
trying to bust on the whole smartphone
industry or or you know get down on that
but I really feel like we're in line for
something new because you know what are
people talking about right now they're
talking about virtual reality there's
talking about the Internet of Things
they're talking about cybersecurity and
we're also talking about the latest
greatest cell phone and the
disappointing thing and really it's not
disappointing I mean you could see the
writing on the wall is that the iphone 7
just recently came out and the sales are
down again so there at like two year low
on the sales because the iphone is just
not exciting people anymore in fact one
of the biggest announcements for the
iphone 7 was the fact that it was going
to have bluetooth headphones and that
sucks ass to me because I went out and I
bought like a a 200 pair two hundred
dollar pair of bose headphones so like
bose i think has the best sound quality
or at least you know for what you can
find at the typical department store and
and you know normally i wouldn't concede
i wouldn't buy something that expensive
but I and I was like you know what I
listened it into my headphones all the
time i'm going to go ahead and splurge
and buy these two hundred other
headphones and and I don't regret it at
all but the thing is those those
headphones actually plug in like normal
headphones do so another thing too is I
constantly plug my phone into my
auxiliary cable to use with my car like
my car doesn't have bluetooth enabled
stuff so in a way like its biggest
announcement was the fact that it had
bluetooth headphones and that's like
enough to piss me off personally like if
Samsung follows up and does the same
damn thing then I'm not going to buy a
samsung I'll go with an LG or somebody
else because I don't want to have to
update all my to bluetooth you know
in fact I don't even like Bluetooth
because i have used bluetooth on my
wife's car and at the end the power the
amplification of the power Leichman when
her iphone is connected to the car it
there's not an there's not as much you
know sound quality so you can't turn the
sound up as high as you would with an
actual auxiliary cord especially a
decent auxiliary cord plugged in from
the car radio to the phone so basically
there's many things that I bet there
it's been a long time coming i think
that that we finally have seen the
iphone sales start to decline and even
with the samsung s5 s6 s7 say who gives
a at this point they're all very
good phones some
between the iphone the samsung and then
probably what Google comes out with I
mean this should probably be pretty
interesting but with this whole
marketing campaign of being you know
completely you know this white box we
have no idea what the hell they're going
to announce and we're supposed to just
be excited for like I can't tell you
that I'm like excited for it i really
i'm curious to see if it's going to be a
game changer because i feel like we need
a game changer we need something that's
going to come along and excite us again
because you know since really you know
smart phones with android and the whole
West you know Android SDK and trying to
make apps and everything now like
there's this whole like if you're going
to make an app for the android you
better make a damn good at otherwise
it's not going to make any money I was
talking to a buddy of mine the other day
and he was talking about how you know
this one guys like had released all
these apps and and had you know some of
these apps were just making a little
bits of money here and there like 10 you
know fifteen dollars a month because
they had been downloaded millions of
times and and he was making money on ads
and apparently this guy became a
millionaire because he he created all
these apps and they were apps that did
like certain things like you know gift
card ideas and stupid stuff like that
and the thing is is that like for me I
don't download any apps like that I have
no interest in that so if I download an
app it's been going to be from somebody
like TripAdvisor or Yelp or my bank or
something that I need like I'm not just
downloading worthless apps just for
downloading them I don't know that
anybody I can't imagine anybody does I'm
sure they do but it's just like what are
you doing like why why would you just
download some some app that has some
content that yeah I don't know manages a
in terrible content at that and another
thing that crosses my mind because this
guy was going to go out and he was going
to start producing all these apps and
stuff to try to copy off what this guy
did like this other guy did like five
years ago and one of the things that
I've learned along the way of trying
different things especially trying to
you know build products that people want
is that as soon as you see somebody
start talking about hey I made all this
money and I'm going to show you how that
typically means whatever they did to
make money doesn't work for them anymore
and that the next thing is to try to
convince you that their ideas and
work you know and and and then sometimes
people can have ideas that have like
they have never worked for them but
they'll claim that they work and one of
the like Tai Lopez like I mean has that
guy had success behind actually saying
that he's had success in getting people
to buy his success story that that's a
that's a question mark that I have I
haven't really looked into it I'm not
that interested in that guy but anyway
that just screams at me whenever
somebody says hey I got this great idea
works so well for me it probably doesn't
work well for you anymore and anybody
that's going to waste their time trying
to replicate what worked for years ago
just isn't going to work so we'll see
what Google has in store with this whole
October fourth announcement I'm assuming
it's just going to be two phones that
are going to probably compete on some
extent with you know without with LG and
Samsung s7 series and galaxies and all
that other stuff and then you know
obviously iphone still going to be
around people that like the Apple
products are going to contain to buy
iphones even though they're doing so at
a lesser extent now but anyway let me
know what you guys think the
announcement it should be a pixel in
pixel XL apparently so I you know I
guess I'm interested well I'm more
consistent this is going to be a true
game changer or if it's just going to be
another phone that we're going to have
to the existing phones at an orgy number
probably in the hundreds at this point
alright guys thanks for watching let me
know what you think by hey guys so a lot
of you asked me how do I get my foot in
the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
