getting started with pug tutorial series
for hipster code comm and in case you
guys haven't heard but the Pug template
engine that is used for nodejs and also
in other places is actually formally
known as Jade
so Jade's project changed over to pug
and you know it's basically the cute
looking pug dog but ultimately what it
is is a template engine that makes
writing HTML a lot easier so to get
started I have a basic node Express Jas
app and if you check out the beginning
node tutorial series on hipster cocom
you can see from the first video how we
got to this point where we have just a
basic application running we have the
pug View engine already set up and we
have a viewest folder which actually has
all of the Pug files that we need
there's an index file here and you can
see from our app that index is being
served here we have a title and a
message being passed back to the pug
template and you can see that they're
being used here so the first things
first when getting started with pug is
that if you want to specify a doctype
you just have to simply say doctype if
we go and we look at the code that is
running and I say inspect you can see
that the doctype HTML was added at the
top now you probably wondered okay is
doctype necessary with html5 it's
actually an optional thing with html5 so
it doesn't hurt to have it there but you
definitely need it for earlier versions
earlier browsers if you're trying to go
backwards with support we've already
looked at the title which exists inside
the head so the title is being set from
a variable pass to the template but I
could also just simply give it a bunch
of gibberish if I wanted to hey guys
what's up so thank you for watching this
next video in the beginning JavaScript
tutorial series for hipster code comm
and in this video what we want to look
at is functions and functions and
JavaScript are very very
very very fun and they can also be very
confusing and it's what makes JavaScript
and also a actual functional programming
language because a lot of a lot of
languages that are can that that allow
you to pass functions to other functions
as what's called first-class citizens
which mean you know treating functions
as if they're like strings being passed
around that's considered a first-class
citizen and JavaScript treats functions
as a first-class citizen so it can be
considered a functional programming
language to create a function we could
say variable x equals and then we just
use our function keyword open and close
parentheses and we could stay alert this
is a function but it needs to be a
string this is a function we call a
function by saying X the name of the
function whatever it is this is
arbitrary it could change it's just like
a variable it's you know I can you can
name it whatever you you deem fit
and assuming that it follows the normal
syntax that is allowed for JavaScript
function names or I'm sorry variable
names but in order to execute the
function you have to use the open and
closed parenthesis so if we ran this
code you can see this is a function it
gets executed if we didn't do the open
and close parenthesis it wouldn't do
anything it would run just fine it just
wouldn't do anything cuz you're not
actually executing the function if I say
console dot log X you can see that it'll
return that it is a function so it
returns the function itself and not the
execution of the function I could say
console dot log though and call it as a
function by calling it as a function it
actually executes the function
so that is our function functions also
have optional arguments we could have
alert message and this could be this is
just simply a value now JavaScript is
dynamically typed so we don't have to
actually it's actually a duck type
language it's interesting that I even
mention that but here's just this is
called a parameter it's a function
parameter and we say that our X function
takes in an argument that is in a alert
message and we will alert alert message
now we have a function that can act
dynamically so if I said I'm gonna call
X like this I'm gonna say this is a
mother crazy tutorial so if I actually I
can pass in this value the value is
going to be assigned to alert message
and then we actually just simply call
alert message inside of our JavaScript
alert statement so the function now has
the ability to be able to take in all
kinds of different stuff this is
different but it's you can see it so now
we have this this dynamic the behavior
it's flexible it can take in all kinds
of different stuff and it just works
it's because of this parameter that
allowed us to be able to take in
different data but still act the same
way
now what happens though if you try to
you know do something well it's even
more important we could say function AG
right so you're gonna see something like
number one number two so now this
function takes in two parameters each
parameter separated by a comma and
typically a space but the space is
optional but definitely have to have a
comma separating and we could say alert
number one plus now that's totally
multiply I'm sorry number one plus
number two so now what happens if we
pass in a string we're gonna get an
exception uncaught reference error X is
not defined
well that's the first problem because we
just referenced an undefined function
but now if we go to add you can see that
it says this is a mother crazy tutorial
so it actually tried to add an a string
and then an undefined value because we
didn't actually give it a value so let's
go ahead and say three so we're gonna
pass in a string and a number and try to
add the two together javascript allows
us to do that in the alert statement
it's really weird but if we said y
equals number one plus number two and
then we'll say alert y
it still allows us to do it so that's
the dynamic nature of JavaScript which
is really crazy you typically wouldn't
want something like that to happen that
can't be what you want let's look at
what what we have here so if we said
type of like what the hell is Y since we
have an integer in a string and how does
it work how did it possibly work it's a
string because javascript knew that the
alert statement uses strings so if we
didn't use this in the alert let's go
ahead and just say console.log type of Y
and you can see it's still a string
javascript is auto magically trying to
trying to figure out what it is that you
want to do now here's another issue like
let's try two strings because normally
that's what we want to do this is the
first string this is the second string
instead of type of we'll just we'll
alert why
so you can see it concatenated two
strings and concatenated means adjoining
or combining two strings into one string
so our function was able to do that
javascript this is part of what it means
when it says it's dynamically
interpreted and then also this can be
referred to as duck typing the dynamic
nature means that we don't have to say
number one has to be an int and number
two has to be an int we don't place that
restriction at all in fact ad could
could work with this could work with
integers and it could work with strings
and that's the dynamic nature of it it's
not very well thought out though I mean
as far as like if you use this in the
real world this would be a product
because you can't have add like add
should be associated with adding to in
two numbers and then if you didn't pass
in a number you should be throwing a an
error message you shouldn't be trying to
add a string to an int because you're
just gonna get gibberish in that
Internet effect so if you're gonna have
a very variable a function name called
add ultimately it should be adding
numbers because typically in your mind
when you add something you're thinking
of numbers so that's where the term the
duck typing comes in because they say if
it walks like a duck and it talks like a
duck it must be a duck so basically add
says hey if you pass in two values that
can be added together whether it's a
string and an INT or an int in an INT
we're just gonna call it what it is and
do it you know what I mean it doesn't it
just works and it's it's sometimes
flexible and sometimes can bite you
because you're like I never meant to add
a string to an int because I could think
of no occurrence where you'd ever want
to do that like ever so it's one of
those weird things but functions allow
you to do that and another thing with
with functions and why javascript is
considered a functional language is out
our third argument let's say third we'll
just call a third argument can be a
function and we can then call third
argument as a function from our function
so if I said I can now pass in a
function that says the function itself
alert I should probably just put this on
a new line down here like I'll put the
whole function down here on the new line
so let's say alert holy crap javascript
is a functional language this should be
indented so now we have three arguments
that were passing into our add function
first second third the third isn't an
entire function that's being passed in
as the third argument which is then
being executed down here so this is a
you know this is no it looks like we're
missing a
now one good thing and this is a
something you should take a look at and
I'm glad we ran into this but you can
see uncaught syntax are missing if you
click on this or if you click on the
little link here it actually will take
you to where it messed up and you can
see that we have a typo there it should
say function as as function so now if we
fix the typo you can see holy crap
javascript is a functional language so
this joker allowed us to in fact I could
even say alert why that way you guys
know that the function is being executed
later on in the code this is first
string the second string so I did what I
needed to do and then it called this
this function that we passed in this
term is something that can be very very
very complex with newer JavaScript
developers and it's something that
people need to understand how to master
because javascript is a synchronous
language which means that if you had a
function that takes a long time to
execute and you called one function
after another it's not going to wait for
the first function to execute before it
tries to call the next function and
that's because it's a synchronous in
nature and it actually is very
beneficial with JavaScript but it's
something that has to be embraced by the
JavaScript developer and understood in
order to be able to take this language
to the next level what we've done here
when we pass in a function as we're
using JavaScript functional nature to
use this is called a callback function
now callback functions can be very
difficult sometimes because you get into
something that's called callback hell
and callback hell can be very very
confusing when you have tons of callback
functions that are calling from all over
the place or you have callback functions
that you're executing from other
applications that aren't even part of
your application which can also be a
security concern but um that's that's
ultimately what this is doing but
callback functions are necessary when
you need execution of something to to
wait before it gets fired so for
instance
this function here this could be okay
let's look let's uh so one of the
reasons why you'd want to do something
like this okay let's look we can
actually pass in an argument to the
function that we're passing in so we
could say alert we'll just call this new
value and I could say new value and then
new value is going to be populated with
Y so now this function that we passed in
which is this function right here gets
assigned third argument we're executing
it and then we're passing in the value
which is a new value which then gets
alerted so this is uh this is where some
of the confusion I think comes in but
you could see that it only now gets
called one time but the actual alert was
being called from this past and callback
function all right guys so that's what
we're going to end this tutorial series
in regards to functions for the
beginning JavaScript tutorial series for
hipster code comm and the following
videos we'll get into some more
information and JavaScript language
alright guys thanks for watching have a
good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
