wanted to give you guys an update real
quick on my channel so I had a hipster
Co channel that I was doing a long time
ago I was kind of promoting and then I
stopped promoting it but it's just uh
you can see there's no videos or
effectors there's not not anything there
I have a 84 subscribers I'm which is
kind of amazing I think considering the
fact there's no videos there but the
reason why is because um you guys are
following me on Microsoft's channel and
then hipster code was something I spun
off and I did it obviously as you guys
know for this website down hipster code
com the reason why I'm mentioning is
though is because I do want to get back
into doing tutorials but I don't want to
pollute my own channel with the
tutorials no chronic I've kind of gone
back and forth lasting event you know
I'll do some tutorials on my channel but
for the most part those tutorials and
instructions and really just overviews
of technology and things like that will
probably probably be contained to just
one particular video that kind of covers
the entire thing and the difference is
like if I'm going to be like a Python
series or something like that then this
other channel I think is needed for
those tutorials that way I could have
you know 20 uploads for the learning
Python and things like that and then if
you guys are just trying to you know
listen to what you know what Chris Hawk
has to say or something like that then
you would just go to my normal Chris
Hawkes channel which is you know right
here so also a big thanks to one of my
viewers who created this new channel art
and I sent um a $25 gift card for doing
that so I know $25 isn't that much
whatever but you know it's uh it was a
nice gesture or not yeah I just want his
bar but also my part I think this is
better than what I had before although I
added my little hipster coat over there
I'm not sure if it fits and with all
that other stuff but um that's what I'm
doing there right now so as I close in
on hopefully a hundred thousand
subscribers by the end of the year so I
think that it's you know probably a
proper time to start going this you know
the second channel which is just going
to be the tutorials because that is
something that I really like doing it's
something that I feel like I haven't
been able to do as easily or as well
just because
you know the fact that like I said it
pollutes my Chris Hawkes channel and a
lot of you guys are checking in like
once a week or months every few days and
things like that and if I'm posting 20
videos on learning a liquor or you know
the latest version of Python or some
other framework or something like that
then it's too difficult for you guys to
find you know Caza that is not tutorial
related so what I'm saying here is
subscribed to hipster code this channel
is linked to my main channel this is
where tutorials are going to start being
uploaded so make sure you guys subscribe
there please I appreciate that
and then you know for all the other
Chris Hawkes credit content where I'm
talking about being a programmer advice
you're answering questions things like
that that's where I'm going to just you
know continue to do that on this Chris
Hawkes channel also for any of you know
sponsors that are out there as long as
I'm being sponsored than they're the
sponsorship opportunities and everything
exists on both channels so basically
they're getting more bang for their buck
as well because if somebody signed on
for a month of a month of sponsorship or
something like that then I will mention
it on both channels in both videos that
I'm doing so that is cool
alright guys so one of the things I
wanted to talk about after I get all
that you know all that out of the way
was that like programmer burnout I think
is real like and I know it's real so
it's definitely a real thing I've told
you guys before they're like I've never
really had it at least I didn't think so
but I think that there are times
honestly we're like I can get a little
bit of that within a week and then all
of a sudden like things just kind of
change you know change momentum and and
things are great one of the things that
we don't do enough of in my opinion and
we're too studied sedentary like we sit
on our asses all day long and program
generally we're not out there
socializing as much as we should be you
know going to the bar having a few
drinks media meeting people talking
about near different things a lot of
programmers aren't doing that they're
just simply like coding all day long
and they're not getting that kind of
social need that they that they you know
probably should have now and it's not a
popularity contest it's not like you
know going to high school or something
like that it's not
but the thing is like as you you know if
you are like a kid in high school and
you don't have a lot of friends it
that's fine as well but eventually like
you know people start to become I think
you know more respectable adults
especially in the workplace and and for
those reasons you should try to get out
I think and socialize with your
co-workers and things every now and then
if you can now some people are just
completely not interested in that and to
each their own now so the burnout thing
though it can last sometimes for like a
couple of days or a couple of weeks for
me it seems to like it starts with I
can't figure out something I'm stressed
out by a deadline all of a sudden I have
no confidence in my ability to be able
to get something done that actually
happens even now now I've told myself
it's real like you know trial and error
just experience and everything that
things will eventually be okay that I
will be able to figure out this problem
the deadline is generally not as bad as
I'm making it out to be and for the most
part I don't miss deadlines anyway so
it's like it's everything should be fine
and in worst case scenario if you do
that you just have to accept the
consequences of you know that particular
day that particular week and that
particular assignment that was not able
to be getting you know was not able to
to get done but all of those things I
think can kind of contribute to this
like what I would say is like a very
short term burnout type of thing and it
just really is it is a compounding lack
of confidence stress probably not enough
exercise and not enough you know doing
happy things I'm doing things that you
like to do recently I've been like
trying to figure out what I should do
like so I need to get outside more I
don't fish or anything like that but
like honestly like the other day I was
taking a walk by the river and I was
like you know what if I had a fishing
pole I would just like to sit on this
shore and you know if I guess your fish
that's fine the only problem with me is
I don't like touching them so having to
get them off the hook and all that stuff
is a major problem for me but I don't
know it's just like little things like
that it makes me want to you know get
outside be in nature more just do
something else besides staring on a
computer screen all day so by taking the
walks during your lunch
that helps a lot for me dealing with
with complex problems also during the
work day
there are times like you'll get there
first thing in the morning and you're
just pounding out code for like seven
hours straight and it's not like hey I'm
building this side project of this game
or this thing that's truly my passion is
like nope
you're solving you know your company's
problems sometimes it's monotonous
sometimes it's just like overwhelmingly
complicated and you do that for let you
know like I said six seven hours
straight you start to wear down and I
don't know if it's more with you know if
it happens more with age versus younger
people younger people can probably go
stronger then I would think older
developers and things when it comes to
like just straight coding form you know
1215 hours that's why I think hackathons
are so stupid to be honest with you like
these all-night hackathons let's shrink
a bunch of red bull and try to you know
solve some sort of problem I guess I'm
not I don't have I don't I think that's
stupid to be honest with you I don't I
have no desire to really do that kind of
thing although there have been times
that I've you know coated through the
night to to solve my own challenges or
but Nia being in a room full of nerds
hyped up on Red Bulls probably not like
my my idea of a great night out I would
say so when that like when that time
comes though there's a there are certain
thresholds and I've seen it with younger
developers as well as in an older
developers but you all of a sudden you
can't you cannot grasp things as well as
you could when you first started today
like you need that rest you need that
time away you need to be able to charge
about or the other day man I just I was
I was like by the time 4/4 already have
rolled around I was working all day long
and I like I even came back from lunch
early trying to get stuff done
I was spent like man I couldn't I
couldn't I just like I felt just drained
man like I was absolutely drained that
generally means that you had a good
productive day at work um unfortunately
but the only thing you can do like I got
to this point where it's like I knew
that my solutions to
to particular coding challenges that
were that I was faced with at that exact
moment I was not giving what I feel was
like I was not comfortable in the
solutions I was actually coming up with
and knew that like if I had a fresh
perspective I would be doing this in
another way and that is typically a time
where you do need to step away for a
moment before you throw in some
code that you're going to end up having
to refactor later on so for those times
man like it's best at okay if you have
routine like administrative items that
you have to do at work it's a good time
to take care of something like that
it's a good time to maybe go to a chat
with your boss or something and see how
they're going and you know what I mean
but just basically when you're at that
stage I feel like you know I'm starting
to identify that much easier these days
and then I know I can walk away for just
a little bit and then sometimes it'll
just mean or the next morning that I
come in and and like nine times out of
ten like that that solution I was
struggling with before or some of those
solutions I was coming up with we're
able to be done much better the next
morning so I'm sure you guys have seen
the same thing like you sometimes go to
sleep and in and you wake up and you all
you have that that solution to that
problem that was like bugging you the
night before but that's just this just
coding man so I think if you do try to
force yourself you know in that
situation to do a 12-hour day where
you're at that level like you're you're
not you're not doing anybody any favors
and including you're mostly yourself
it's bad for your health
probably bad for the company because of
the coder you're thrown in at that point
we need a rest we need a work-life
balance companies need to be aware of
that and we need to shape this industry
so that that you know people respect
programmers abilities and that you know
and they're the work/life balance like
that is very important and it's
something that actually drives me crazy
in the IT industry when it comes to
startups and things like that
with how badly they treat some of their
associates the other day and Guber a
developer who had had an opportunity to
work at Apple takes the job at uber has
a wife and kids and then killed himself
he was 33 years old self because of his
wife was at you
planning about the the the work-life
balance and everything over at Hoover
and how hard that they were working
people and how he felt like he couldn't
figure out anything so obviously he had
this inferiority complex imposter
syndrome and and and that can that can
take a toll because everybody's probably
being super proud of this guy like there
his father was like yeah you know he was
a had an opportunity to go to a Boyd
shows over because he thought it would
be the best place to grow and and then
nobody wants to look like a failure man
you don't want to like I just started a
new job like four months ago I don't
want to look like a failure but you know
in some cases some companies may not be
the best fit for us and if that's the
case man you got to walk away you can't
 kill yourself that's like that
is crazy like programmers and demand all
throughout the United States if a
company doesn't you know doesn't respect
you know proper work-life balance and
everything like that then there's plenty
of other companies that would and once
again it shouldn't even have to come
down to that because if if you are truly
working for seven or eight hours a day
coding that should be enough for anybody
anybody who's put in a solid seven or
eight hours of programming in a day
knows that their productivity their
solutions and you know just started
there's just a productivity drop off
it's like a plateau man it just it's a
straight cliff after that so you know
hopefully through this channel through
everything else I try to influence you
know as much as I possibly can but that
needs to be the way it is so if anybody
is as a manager business owner that's
listening to this man treat your
employees well respect work-life balance
and you know obviously don't work
somebody to death to the point where
they feel like that killing themselves
is a better solution than you know
basically bowing out I guess I'm not
sure but
alright guys man thanks for watching
once again subscribe to hipster code
that's where I'm going to be putting
some tutorials and I do plan on trying
to get to get into that and doing a lot
of different tutorials and things like
that I'm not promising that they're
going to be good but I think they will
be so yeah you know what I'll promise
you they're good even if they're not
good then I
colleges all right guys have a good day
man hey guys so a lot of you asked me
how do I get my foot in the door to
become a programmer and I just want to
take a moment to mention dev Mountain
