mountain coding boot camp I know you
guys know that I'm always pushing their
stuff but they've been my sponsor my
primary sponsor for about two years now
so please do me a favor
look in the description there's a link
to Deb mountain coding boot camp if you
are interested in learning how to become
a developer you want to go to a coding
bootcamp you can't pick a better one
check out Deb mountain they got good
reviews I appreciate it hey guys what's
up good evening so I'm actually sharing
this article that I read on reddit today
and it's a really good article because I
actually got it has a really good
discussion going on and read it I'm
gonna share the link in the description
but the article is essentially about why
there's such a disparity between the
best performers within a given company
compared to others and what I mean by
that is like typically whenever you're
working as a developer for a company
you're gonna have a salary range that's
gonna have like a minimum amount like a
median and then a maximum and that's
gonna be the guidelines and they're
gonna say you got to hire somebody we
want to like hire them probably towards
the lower or the mid obviously and then
you know the developers that are being
hired they obviously want it to be more
towards the high end but that's all part
of that that negotiation but that range
is is relatively static and and that
range is typically you know determined
by people probably not even NIT or
programming and it's probably in Human
Resources and they're doing market
research to figure out what they need to
pay you know what is the minimum amount
that they need to pay to be able to
obtain the talent that they're looking
for so once again these these ranges
like every company has them and every
developer depending on your grade you're
gonna fall into that range somewhere and
you could have people that are literally
making you know eight thousand dollars
more that are doing twice the amount of
work that other developers are doing and
I've seen that firsthand I've seen it
and multiple companies so it's like it's
not something that that's unusual
obviously with this article it's
showcasing that it's clearly like a you
know it's it's a thing across the entire
industry but it's not easily solved and
I really don't know that you're ever
going to be able to really solve
something like this but the thing is is
that the salary range and the fact that
it is static is actually one of the
reasons why developers pick up and they
they move to
different companies and they move so
often because they're they're gonna go
wherever they're gonna make the most
money and usually with with IT like
we're getting the biggest raises when we
leave a company and you know with
signing bonuses things like that but I
think honestly like if companies
reevaluate how they're they're like I
guess paying their employees I there
there's a lot of room for improvement
there if there is a developer that is
literally doing twice the amount of work
that another developer is doing like
they shouldn't probably make twice the
amount of money but they should be
probably making roughly you know fifty
percent more than that other developer
you would think and maybe you know at
the very least twenty-five thirty
percent I mean you would think at least
fifty percent right in a fair world it's
never going to be that perfect or that
fair but clearly you know people that
are that are doing that extra effort
they should be recognized and for the
most part companies are very good at
recognizing them but when your hands but
sometimes you could have management
departments and their hands are kind of
strapped behind their back because like
they're like okay well you know clearly
like I have these developers that
probably should be paid like you know
head and shoulders more than other the
other colleagues that they're working
with because they're doing so much more
but they're still not able to pay them
because they're the salary grade for
their job you know title and description
everything does not allow for it so that
ends up companies end up doing these
like creative things where you're going
to end up like creating new jobs
essentially that have like slightly
higher pay scales to try to justify to
the corporation like hey we have these
new positions that you know like DevOps
engineer DevOps blah blah blah like
DevOps wasn't even a term like we come
up with these buzz terms types of things
and like everybody want to be in DevOps
and anyway it's just it's kind of like
my point so it's like you might have
like a senior engineer to or something
like that and it's like you know what
senior engineer to they don't have a
bunch of Microsoft Azure experience so
we want to do this this DevOps engineer
to roll or DevOps engineer one and maybe
that's like slightly one grade higher
than than the previous senior position
but in again you those types of things
typically take a lot of work to because
you have to still pass through human
resources and everything whatever this
new job this new position is going to be
but anyway that's really just my
thoughts on it you're not going to solve
this problem
easily you can't measure somebody's
productivity by the amount of code that
they've written you could probably look
at the amount of shelves sets and see
like the you know what it like I would
say like you can probably glance at the
the lines of code that somebody's
writing but obviously it's not just
about lines of code because then you
could just put in massive amounts of
comments if you're writing a ton of HTML
that's gonna be a lot easier than
writing a bunch of JavaScript
and if you're writing a bunch of
JavaScript that's still probably going
to be easier than writing a bunch it
like back in server-side coding unit
tests and things like that so yeah
that's really just my thoughts on this
subject you're not gonna solve this
problem very easily
hopefully companies just become more
aware of who their top performers are
and that that that the salary grades
allow for like a pretty large disparity
otherwise you're going to continue to
end up you know losing high you know
highly talented workers to who are gonna
be looking for much more fair
compensation because I can tell you that
those people that they know that they're
doing twice as much as the other people
and they know it more than even the
managers know it and those and that rubs
people the wrong way like when they're
like damn I'm doing all these all this
extra work I'm writing all this code I'm
doing I'm solving business problems that
other people don't know how to solve and
then not being compensated fairly for it
they're they're clearly gonna walk
they're not gonna have that much loyalty
to the company that they work for so
again it's a problem at the top needs to
be addressed they're programmers
themselves aren't going to do it and
never try to measure a product a
programmers productivity by the lines of
code that they write because they could
be the shittiest code you've ever seen
again comments things like that you
can't ever do that but anyway guys
