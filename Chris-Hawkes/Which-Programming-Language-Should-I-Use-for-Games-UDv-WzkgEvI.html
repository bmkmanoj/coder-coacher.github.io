gotta I get this question a lot where
people are asking about the best
programming language for videogames
because let's face it a lot of
programmers are very interested in
videogames and they want to get into
that industry and so they're really
confused when we do like top 10 lists
and their label Python juice and web
webpages but you know is it good for
games on stuff so the answer that
question is probably not Python is a
dynamically interpreted duck type
language it has static type shot to read
up on that actually but it's it's
essentially it's not very fast it's not
like a compile down language when you
need like raw raw speed so you're not
going to see a whole lot of game engine
type stuff in Python and if you do it's
going to be more along
along the lines of like a Python wrapper
to like a C or C++ a graphics library
that you would end up using but if you
want to get into some basic like you
know some terrible-looking games and you
could use something like PI game which
has been around for a very long time so
Python in the gaming industry is
probably going to be more along the
lines of like actually tying servers
together and stuff like that there's
also the Python QT project which the
last time I checked on it there was some
work that still need to be done it
looked from a little little buggy but um
that is something but I would not really
recommend either of those two if you're
just getting started in programming and
actually want to get an actual game
working number one if you want to do
native games you want to do Android then
Java is the language for the Android
environment for so for the entire SDK
for Android studio and everything I mean
just start learning Java if you want to
go down that route but even beyond that
I would probably avoid that the reason
why C sharp is a good option for gaming
is because it is it's it's a language
that you can use with unity so unity is
a as a game framework that's that's
going to do a ton of work for you but
most of the hard core processing code
for this engine has been written in C
and C++
but c-sharp you can do that you can
write all you know basically your entire
game could all be written in c-sharp and
you could also use javascript and they
also have that proprietary language
which they called boo
thank Bo oh now with the advent of WebGL
though you're now seeing the graphics
processing inside the browser so the
open CL or OpenGL basically the
competitor to Microsoft's direct3d which
is how a lot of graphics are run for any
sort of graphics intensive software
application whether it be games or
something like you know video editing
and stuff like that but the the WebGL is
now you know the graphics standard
however you know we've been talking
about WebGL for at least six or seven
years now and there hasn't been a ton of
progress in my in my opinion in that but
um you do have some of these game
engines that are actually popping up so
like pixie Jas there's also something I
think the play framework or something
along those lines I don't have it in
front of me I'm sorry but you can see
like something like pixie to Jas you can
write games that work for browsers and
this is mostly 2d stuff but you can use
JavaScript right now if you want to do a
triple-a game engine you know something
like Unreal Engine arguably unity is not
quite triple-a but Unreal Engine is
something that you would end up using
C++ they also have their blueprints
which is like their proprietary way of
being able to do some some basic
scripting and stuff like that but
ultimately if you want to get into like
major game development with something
like Unreal Engine then you're going to
be using C++ at one point there was talk
of getting it ported over to c-sharp but
I think that talk actually dried out now
one nub big news here is that I don't
want to give my email anyway so one big
news is that CryEngine which is a
another triple a major title and our
game engine has opened up their their
platform to c-sharp as well so you can
now use c-sharp with Microsoft's tools
and stuff like that to have another
option now there's going to be a little
bit more looks like well it looks like
they're changing their pricing model
because there's a lot of money for these
game engines and licensing it to indie
developers number one they get exposure
number two you know they do have the
possibility being able to make
money off of them if the game ends up
hitting it big so CryEngine is another
opportunity there that's going to be C++
and C sharp for you another thing with a
c-sharp is if you're interested in more
of like an indie type game the model
game is a completely free framework but
you're going to end up having to write a
lot of tools there yourself so you're
not going to get a lot of hand-holding
and from what I've seen with this engine
there's going to be quite a bit of work
that you're going to have to do in order
for for an actual game to be released on
this platform another thing that I
mentioned which I had a video
specifically for the the go-go dough
engine it's actually pronounced go dough
I you know and from my American Way of
reading it I thought it was go dot so I
did an entire video where I was calling
it Godot so that kind of sucks but it's
pronounced go dough so it's mostly some
developers I think in Brazil that are
maintaining this however they just
recently got some venture or some
capital injected into the project via
Mozilla so that you might be able to see
this engine start gaining some traction
here in the next year so now they also
have their own proprietary language as
well which is very similar it's like a
Python but they call it I don't
remember what they call it sorry I'm
tired I don't remember what they do they
call they call it some sort of a their
own yeah I was hoping they had the name
here but anyway it's very similar to
Python it was originally in Lua and they
rewrote it in Python but once again it's
actually you know mostly all that
intensive stuff is being written in C
and C++ with a Python just kind of being
a scripting language to be able to
control it similar to how c-sharp is
being used with a unity engine alright
guys so that's really the scope of where
I am on the game programming frameworks
there's so many of them out there like
if you're going to go with C++ there are
so many most of like the hard core
physics engines that I've seen or all in
like C++ so you like if I see a physics
engine in c-sharp it's generally a port
from like something like pop box2d or
something like that which was all
written in C++ like a long or none yes
he plus plus a long time ago if I were
going to get into games that I've done
some
and stuff like that in fact I have a
little game project that I've been
messing around with just recently and
I've been using blender for my free 3d
program and then just using unity
because I think unity is really easy and
I happen to know quite a bit about
c-sharp so I just probably find that to
be relatively easier than dealing with
C++ and Unreal Engine and that stuff
ports out to Android not and stuff for
you so anyway guys that's my advice man
take care have a good day and talk to
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
