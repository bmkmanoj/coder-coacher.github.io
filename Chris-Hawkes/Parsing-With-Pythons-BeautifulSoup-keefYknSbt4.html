want to do now now we need to we need to
make sure that you guys have easy
install setup on your your Python your
programming operating system so you want
to look up how to install easy install
so I and use this setup tools under pi
pi org there's an MSI down here for
people using windows and yeah the
windows installer down here so you set
up tools that way you'll have the
ability to install certain add-ons and
 so here we go to our command prompt
here so if I said like easy install
after I set up Senate and that I set up
tools like I just said once you have it
installed you'll be able to do that you
can say like I think that's one more I
don't remember you'll see that it
actually went out and it installs
beautifulsoup
onto my my operating system so now that
my my Python programs can use this
beautiful soup programming module that
was created so beautiful soup is
something that allows you to parse HTML
web pages pretty easily so let's go
ahead and honestly I don't really use
beautiful soup that often but let's go
ahead and try to use this and see how we
can apply it to our MySpace program that
we just created so we need to go ahead
and import it and we'll say from a
beautiful soup import beautiful
and then then we need to go ahead and
build this all right so now that we
have beautiful soup imported into the
top of the file we can go ahead and just
say sube equals full so we're using this
import that we just imported beautiful
soup and then we'll say we feed it in
the parentheses we're gonna feed it the
our URL so if I know how to use this I'm
like I said I'm kind of new with it
let's go ahead and just say print soup
title and we save it program so you'll
see that it only printed out the title
because that's all that we asked for so
it's pretty cool so if we just want the
text like you see that it actually
grabbed the HTML container title title
so if we just want the text we can just
save text so that's pretty cool so you
can see that we grabbed it now since
we're going into scraping web pages we
really need to go and touch base on
logical operators which just means if or
else so you evaluate something whether
or not it's either true or false I mean
everything in programming is either true
or false essentially so we can let's
assign this soup title text a variable
will say title equals soup title text so
we know that that equals myspace right
now so say that I was building some sort
of automatic scraper and I want to
verify that I'm in the right web space
and like if I have us
Unleashed onto the web and it's going
out and grabbing a bunch of different
pages and I want to make sure that I
have the right thing I need to do like a
logical operator so we'll do is just
something relatively simple and we're
gonna say if title if and let's give it
a string to see if it's in there if my
space in title print yes we are in a my
space my space may be capitalized
because this is going to be basically
it's its capital sensitive so if my
space is capitalized which it probably
is and I think this is gonna fail but
let's just try it real quick so it
obviously failed because it didn't do
 so you always want to do like an
else statement you don't always have to
but in this case let's do an else and
we'll say print your did not work
so that way we know that if it does
nothing it's printing your did not
work so we know it didn't work so the
reason why is like I said this is most
likely capitalization issue my space is
capitalized as it's a title it's a name
it's a company yes we are in a MySpace
page so since we have a simple if-else I
mean you can just do additional stuff so
I mean we'll say we'll say the body
equals soup dot dot text I don't know
we'll just say let's just do that and
see if it does this I don't know what
it's gonna do no it doesn't do anything
oh let's fist we only assigned it so
let's just say print and body since
we're now in this if space of
programming because it's evaluated to
true so it's just gonna follow
everything and
here and if it was false it would just
do here and kill the program so
hopefully this prints the body if body
even finds anything so it doesn't even
find anything cant encode character what
that means is that we're using ASCII and
this is some sort of unicode character
that the print doesn't understand so we
can actually say body equals body I'll
have to look that up one second I'm
gonna look this up because when you run
into that situation it's actually you
know what it we're gonna go ahead
and just print this out to a file
because what would it you can and you
can look this up sorry I don't know off
the top of my head but when you run into
that situation you can essentially say
embody ignore you know these on unknown
characters that it's not able to print
out on the command prompt but right now
we're not going to worry about that it's
a simple issue because all that was
doing was trying to print saying I can't
Prime but it was breaking so we can
actually write it out to an out file and
let's just go ahead and do that out file
equals opened open and then the
parentheses will say projects training
and then let's name it we'll name it my
space and then write it and we've done
this in the previous tutorials and then
we'll see how file dot right
let's say I'll follow it right and we'll
say body because we're out outputting
this body soup body check so let's print
that run this over still trying to print
it I believe
son of a bitch son of a bitch alright so
let me let me look this up real quick
cuz this is not even gonna let us output
a file because of this stupid ASCII
Kodak error and we'll explain how to
resolve that here just one second yeah
it was actually on the right path with
this encode thing so we can say and then
we say we're saying in coda to ASCII and
then ignore any problems that you have
been trying to code it so we ran this it
actually worked this time so that's
actually an ugly way of fixing the error
utf-8 can be a complicated subject but a
lot of things are written in utf-8 which
is like cross-language encoding normally
when the programming was invented and
everything it was written for the
American English language so everything
was written in like just ASCII but now
there's so many different languages that
utf-8 is now like the common output but
like you see that there were code there
were certain characters in the utf-8
coding that weren't understand that
couldn't be understood by some of these
older Python libraries so it's a
complicated subject that I don't even
know enough about cuz you know I'm still
somewhat of a beginner but you know for
right now just don't even worry about it
you can do body body dot encode do you
really need that character probably not
so you know this fixes that so
let's go ahead and open this and then we
see MySpace body here and you see that
it just printed out all the text I mean
none of this stuff is like makes any
sense because we just took all of the
text and just printed it out so it's
really not that helpful but I just
wanted to show you that you can request
different things like we could have done
instead of the same body we could just
say soup we could say soup find
all and then he said what we're saying
is find alt P tags the body is now when
we run this it's gonna overwrite all
that trash that we had souped-up find
all
we're going to take out this encoding
thing here alright so this is a common
thing to you're gonna see souped-up fine
doll is gonna find all P tags which are
HTML paragraph tags and it's gonna
create a list of them so body is a list
so like if you look at this we're gonna
we could say we could do a for loop on
this like we've done before we could say
like for I and the body print and then
you're gonna want say print string I
because it's just you can see that it
printed each one of these P tags that
are found here so P class password so I
printed those things you can even do
print I dot txt so instead of having the
P characters in there it just prints the
text that is found so that's always
helpful so anyway it's a list so if you
wanted to output that to a file you need
to say for I and body and you're gonna
say out file dot writes and you're gonna
say string I and we can even say that
you know what you don't you can just say
I got text because I dot text is a
string and not a list item so let me do
this you can see that my space body has
now been written these things now it's
some sloppy looking because we
didn't put any newline characters in
there and this is a good time to touch
on that if you want to do that you want
to go ahead and say I dot text and let's
say plus which is a concatenation
meaning add on an additional string here
and if you put a new line like a return
statement between each list item just
say forward slash and it's actually a
back slash my bad backslash n which is
it means it means newline character so
when we run this again you'll see that
our file now has you know properly
formatted
for each P tag that we found so I'm
gonna go ahead and kill this tutorial
now hopefully it makes some sense you
really got to play around with
beautifulsoup and outputting files in
the way that you want and a way that
makes sense to you so let's go ahead and
kill this in in the next tutorial we're
gonna go ahead and parse a different
page we'll go after a Wikipedia page and
try to print something that makes a
little bit more sense than this MySpace
page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
