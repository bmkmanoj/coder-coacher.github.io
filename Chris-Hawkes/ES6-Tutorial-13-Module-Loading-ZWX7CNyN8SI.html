next biggest feature of es6 is module
loading and module loading is what
really is me it's allowed JavaScript
applications to become just little
scripts i got included here and there to
actual you know real programming
applications as they give way to react
and redux and angular and all these
other different very large project so
they're broken up in all these different
files so how do you get all these files
to actually converge together into one
big file and and that you need a module
loader or a module bundler and there's a
couple of choices that you have the two
popular ones are browserify which is the
older kind of way i would say a lot of
people use things like grunge or gulp
and then they use browserify to actually
import the modules that are needed and
this is some of it I think confusing
concept for beginners the web pack is
now the new front runner as far as being
the popular option for module bundling
so you can break up your your modules
and then require them as necessary so
we're going to use web pack in this
tutorial because at the time of this
video that is definitely the most
popular option I'm going to press ctrl C
to get our watch to stop and we're going
to go ahead and use NPM to install
webpack going to say npm install ice and
ice and save pipe and dev and then we're
shay web pack
alright so now the web pack is installed
what we need to do is create web pack
configuration file so we're going to
create a new file save web pack config
Jaya and inside here we needed a module
dot export equals and it's a JavaScript
object is being exported we're going to
give it an entry point which is going to
be the file that we currently have which
is first Jaya that's the entry point and
then our output is going to be an object
that has a path to marine for a surname
and then file name is where we're going
to say some bundles idea
I'm missing a coal in there we want to
tell webpack to do the watching just
like we did before so we're going to
watch true now we need to add a module
argument here because this is what we're
going to tell let back to actually use
Sabol in order to fill their projects
we're going to say loaders or add a
loader and this is we're going to say
the loader itself it is a sample and
here we can tell to exclude anything in
our node modules folders we don't want
that to be compiled starting to say
those modules like that so that way
anything inside the node modules will be
ignored finally we do need to say query
because we're going to tell if you use a
preset which is actually know what I'm
not going to tell to do a preset I'm
going to see if this will work without
the preset first all right should be
about good now we need to go into our
package JSON and where we added to
babble argument we need to now do the
same thing for wet socks so we're going
to run it the same way all right so now
we have that and if we go back to our
command line we should be able to stay
web pack or NPM run website now
automatically web pack is going to look
for the web pack configuration file its
going to look for the the first file
which could access that right first is
okay let's see what's going on here at
the web maggot thing he says I can't
find module babble all right so it looks
like because babble like dizzy the
babble that we have installed so far no
package.json we have just a babble
preset environmental CLI which works
great for the command line interface but
we actually need some additional novel
project that appears in order for this
all work correctly two of them appears
to be babble loader and babble Kapoor so
let's go ahead and install those real
quick we're going to NPM install gave
dad once again when you say battle for
then baffle loader babble odors should
actually killed that I mean I would
think that this would work event and if
that'll project changes all the time
about a fortune alright so now we had a
let's try this again
alright so that's the two dependencies
that we were missing that we needed in
order for web pack to actually go to use
babbles and be able to compile so now
the big question is going to be based on
one we had in first does this all
compile still the same way that we have
so it looks like there's some great
point here all right so now we're using
webpack instead of straight Pavel in
order to be able to build our files so
if we look at bongo here now of course
there's not going to be a sword slab
option at this point because babbles
babbles not building to force my voice
but here you can see there's quite a bit
more now in bundle now and this is a lot
to do with the what web pack is doing so
either way this is definitely the best
approach to go and i'm going to show you
why because we have first idea and now
let's go ahead and add another file
which we're going to call second is just
so we can easily differentiate first and
second and what i want to be able to do
is say we're going to say export default
function
test I guess I was out at second and
this is going to be just a simple
function it says alert unloaded alright
so now what i can do is i can now import
this this function here from second so
at the top of my file i can say import
test again from a knee with a file path
so first idea as I think that file Pat
this might this might throw an error but
what we're going to do is we're going to
test second by actually firing the
function from the first and let's make
sure what that is watching it looks like
this can't find file directory for
suddenly have that wrong let me get rid
of that dot
a dependency to entry point is not
allowed sorry guys it's late at night
I'm being stupid i'm importing from the
same friggin violent in which went back
there because you're not allowed to do
we're trying to import from second that
is ridiculous alright so and i even
changed this we can go back to having
their be like this so i'll explain the
differences between these two module and
boarding in just a second Plus let's go
back here oh now we're bundling again
just fine and we go to our file test
second is not a function alright so
through the file real quick just out of
curiosity I'm going to see what I'm
going to come console.log test second
i'm curious what test second actually is
coming through eyes because I told you
there's difference between using curly
braces which means that I don't have to
import the entire thing I can just
import a specific function on an object
or even on our class is being exported
by using this method but I'm curious if
anything even comes over yes undefined
okay that would make sense alright so
the real difference here is that you
want to just avoid these curly braces
for a standard function that is just
exporting default function because it's
just exporting this by default is saying
hey export this no matter how you import
this file here you're going to be
exporting this one function by default
let's go ahead and show you this this
will actually work now so import tests
tagging from second j/s we're now
importing javascript file as needed and
executing it and you can see unloaded so
it is actually loading just fine and
executing so what's extremely
interesting here and this is something I
didn't even notice until I tried it but
when we originally tried to do this and
wrap it in curly braces I didn't even
realize that this wasn't allowed and
it's kind of interesting how it's not
allowed because if I said test second
and I look
a second you would see that this is a
function that is being brought in but
for whatever reason it's not it doesn't
work when you say hey I want this to be
the default function and the reason why
you want to default function is that way
you can import it the way that I showed
you that was working but here here's why
it's interesting because if I created
another function here that's not the
default function I could export this is
what you commonly see you at the export
functions and other methods and then
we'll say alert another message all
right so now we have the second message
and if i were to import seconds or
another message from second digest and
executed then this will run no problem
so you can see another method is
executed it didn't complain it only
complained when it's the default
function because it basically says hey
dumbass like you don't want to import
just one piece of this module alright
guys so definitely plan around with
module loading because this is our like
it's at another huge part of es6 and not
just be at six foot on modern JavaScript
large project development and ja the
trip so hopefully this helps you out
make sure you guys vote up the video and
subscribe I appreciate your support and
have a good day Mike hey guys so a lot
of you asked me how do I get my foot in
the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a 12
week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here and now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course is geared to get you into
the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery no jf react angular how to use
github so a lot of the things that
you're going to need to do as a
developer as soon as you start they're
going to be teaching you in this and the
coding boot camp and the entire goal is
to be able to get you into the industry
within 12 weeks so if you guys are
interested in learning more information
about Deb mountain coding
can't just check out the link in the
description part of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
