follow-up video and I did a video that
gets quite a bit of attention and it's
um it's this video called is c-sharp
dying so I did this video and June of
last year said bent over over 13 months
since I've created it and you know so
what's changed in the 13 months to make
me want to follow up on this video
number one I didn't say it was dying I
said I posed the question is it dying
and if you watch that video there's
quite a few examples in there that I
gave as to why I felt like the language
itself could be on the decline and some
of those things work
just simply based on the fact that the
language itself based on like CoV index
school Google Trends and everything such
as that showed that it was on the
decline ever since about 2014 but since
that time and I really feel like you
know Microsoft saw the writing on the
wall they end up doing quite a few
things that you know turned a lot of
heads to make c-sharp a much more much
more I guess valid solution because you
know the age-old argument is that that C
sharp and dotnet only works on Windows
and even now people will tell you that
but it's not actually true dotnet it's a
Visual Studio code here this is a Visual
Studio code this just recently came out
this is written using I don't
remember anyway it doesn't matter it's
it's the hell is it written in uh damn I
just couldn't think of it was called
electron anyway so this Visual Studio
code is written in electron it's a
cross-platform solution to building
actual software applications it's
surprising evening writing and c-sharp
or anything but the reason why I
mentioned Visual Studio code is because
Visual Studio itself only worked on
windows to the longest time but just
recently Visual Studio got released for
the Mac and hopefully Linux is down the
road but yeah they're still valid
concerns with you know people saying
that it's serious of Windows only system
and and even now got net core is maybe
not fully production ready for a lot of
things that you may end up doing with it
like for instance I was trying to find a
database driver for Postgres outside of
in any framework and that didn't work
that was about probably least a
on sir go an hour or more but what does
few sharp down and dotnet core and like
you know have they turn things around I
really feel like Microsoft is headed in
the right direction where like if you're
a c-sharp developer I've got net
developer obviously you want to continue
to be one because you're going to get
your bread butter through that for the
longest time probably it's probably the
rest of your career at this point but
like if you look at Microsoft's you know
one of the reasons why they're going to
continue to be a potential powerhouse
and you look at in 2016 they make
sixteen point seven nine billion and
this is net income so this is profit
this is they're a very very profitable
company so even even as a company that
essentially failed with their Windows
Phone and their tablets and you know a
lot of other things that Microsoft
stride like Silverlight or edge browsers
a disaster well maybe not really ads but
Internet Explorer is a disaster a lot of
different things they've done even with
the Xbox the red rings of death smaller
self the Xbox has been you know pretty
pretty successful from Microsoft
obviously Windows has been successful
and you know there dotnet ecosystems
also been very successful like
businesses are running off with
Microsoft technology and that's going to
continue to be the case so when you're
looking for a job in this in this market
you want to go where there's you know a
lot of opportunity and for that reason
there's a lot of opportunity and dotnet
and that's going to continue to be the
case if we look at the most popular
languages there's really no no place we
can truly go to that but a lot of times
we go to the tlb index which has been
around for a long time but you can see C
sharp ears is ahead of Python they kind
of switch back and forth but yeah this
this list here obviously show you that C
sharps not going anywhere either now and
because of the fact that c-sharp was not
relevant in both of the tablet and the
cell phone market it really limits
c-sharp developers and their ability to
be able to make money in this industry
so it's like well what are they left to
do if Windows isn't a viable product for
the tablet or the smartphone and for
that reason Microsoft also saw the
writing on the wall so they purchased
Dameron so xamarin gives you the ability
to make cross-platform applications for
iOS
Android and and you can do so writing it
in c-sharp and and and it's considered
it's very similar to like react native
kind of thing but it's still you know I
think a little bit like if you were to
say hey Chris do you totally recommend
xamarin for mobile app development can't
really say that I'm completely convinced
I haven't spent enough time with xamarin
to say that it's a great option I know a
lot of people really swear by it but
there's also a lot of other products out
there that that could turn some heads as
well which is a react native especially
now that react native is getting into
their virtual reality and then you also
have you know just native development or
you even have cotton wind now that you
can write cotton for the Android SDK or
just simply writing native code with
Java or something so I'm not necessarily
saying that I could recommend c-sharp
for for mobile apps I might be better
off using those other technologies but
if you're already an established c-sharp
developer clearly zamarons can be the
best opportunity for you to get into the
ios and android marketplace it's going
to take the least amount of time if
you've already if you're already
familiar with the tool so you want to do
that now if you compare c-sharp to
Python can Python say the same can they
say that they have something like
xamarin for making mobile apps and they
really can there's there's this project
called keavy which is a cross-platform
solution for you to be able to write
Python code that can be ported over to
browsers but besides the fancy-looking
website this thing was nowhere near
production ready as of like a year and a
half ago and it's definitely not a
xamarin type solution and once again I'm
not sure that I'd recommend that over
native development either anyway so
where is another area that c-sharp
started expanding into to try to stay
relevant and that is with the most
important thing is without without net
core god net core is Microsoft
technology that runs on both Windows
Linux and Linux and Mac and and just
like with golang where you are actually
if you if you bundle up an executable
file and you distribute it bumbled in
into that is the actual runtime the
dotnet core runtime which will allow
your
program to run on Linux Mac Windows
whatever it is and it just again is
guaranteed to work so you don't have to
have the customer set up a virtual
machine or install.net core blah blah
blah this version of that it's just it's
distributable it's going to work so the
same thing with rust and go line they
both do the same thing so that's kind of
the future Lee nobody wants to have to
set up a tell their client machines have
to install the.net runtime and all this
stuff so it's like that that's that's
the step in the right direction so
dotnet core works another thing too is
that it's it's it's open source as well
so a lot of this stuff is available it's
freely available to take a look at like
their Rosalind compiler for c-sharp and
everything is all available on github
these are all different directions that
Microsoft's taken over the last few
years and it's all because of in my
opinion you know them being on the
decline the fact that they weren't
relevant and gaming and an app
development and even web development
they were becoming outdated in because a
lot of people were using node or Ruby on
Rails or Python there was no need to use
asp.net and spend a bunch of money there
was no need to spend a bunch of money on
Azure when you can go to Linux Orlin own
or digitalocean for a fraction of the
price but they've changed all this stuff
and now they're competing Azure and AWS
are going very very good and in the
cloud computing ecosystem so companies
looking to back up their data or to
really scale you know you're looking at
AWS measure the two liters so if you're
going as your route and it's the dotnet
ecosystem and there's maybe opportunity
there as well finally the last thing
I'll really touch on is that Microsoft
came out with this thing called via the
XNA framework which was it had a lot of
potential and even some you know some
major games were developed using it but
unfortunately Microsoft because they
were making a lot of money with it they
ended up disbanding it now if you wanted
to continue with XNA there's the mono
game framework which you can still use
which is runs on mono I wouldn't really
recommend this for gaming engines or
anything but they work closely with the
Uni Unity game engine and that's
actually the you know probably the best
news for gaming and c-sharp is that you
can you can create some successful games
using something like the Unity engine
and MC sharpen and have some decent
success there so definitely something to
take into consideration finally when it
comes to really database driven websites
a lot of a lot of data centric
applications and a lot of data centric
companies they need to have reliable
robust database solutions I'm talking
most of your fortune 500 companies to
manage everything from their marketing
campaigns to their customer accounts and
things like that they're using full
scale relational databases and one of
the most tried-and-true industry-leading
database systems out there is sequel
server which is also a microsoft.net
product and the tools that you can use
to integrate it into other microsoft
selfishness it's just endless and for
all of those reasons you know not being
a Microsoft fanboy or whatever that's
why done nets here that's why it's not
going anywhere
Microsoft has enough power enough money
they've had enough power and money for
the last three decades for decades or so
that they're going to continue to be a
force in this in this market here more
so than I would say somebody like IBM
like if I were going to Bank on
Microsoft versus IBM and Microsoft led
by a long shot is much more reliable I
think than a company like IBM and their
products and that's how you really knock
against in a big blue or IBM it's just
that like if I compare the two companies
or of like size and and Microsoft is
definitely much more suited towards the
long term clearly if you're a swift
developer with Apple you're in good
shape if you're a c-sharp developer with
Microsoft you're in good shape
he'll if you're a Java developer with
Oracle you're going to be in good shape
you know golang is going to be a good
option because go is going to continue
to drive a lot of their stuff if you're
a C++ guy then you know you know I feel
bad for you and I'm just getting enough
C++ is you know obviously here to stay
as well and then and then obviously one
of my favorite languages which is Python
and Python is very you know there's a
lot you know nisha industries so
depending on what you want to do with it
but if you compare something like Python
to c-sharp you have a lot more tools at
your disposal
to make you know real you know
real-world scaling cutting-edge
applications with more hand-holding
tools I think with dotnet compared to
Python but Python is going to give you
more customized ability it's going to be
much cheaper and it's not going to be as
fast but it's probably going to be
faster to develop so alright guys that's
really all I got man there dotnet
c-sharp definitely here stay for a long
time alright take care bye hey guys so a
lot of you asked me how do I get my foot
in the door to become a programmer and I
just want to take a moment to mention
dev Mountain coding boot camp is a
12-week intensive course that focuses on
the technologies of the here-and-now for
web development some of the things that
they're actually teaching in this
12-week course it's geared to get you
into the industry by focusing on things
like jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding boot camp and
the entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
