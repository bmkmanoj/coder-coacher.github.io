Kippy tutorial series and I changed the
name of my class that was initially
given to me because it's at first kiveat
but I just changed it the test app but
really I'm going to delete all the stuff
in here that we initially had from our
previous installation and one of the
things that we have to do anytime we're
creating @qp applications we have to
import Kibby first and foremost we're
also gonna say from Kibby dot app import
app and that is a requirement as well
and then we're gonna import a UX element
and use it UX is like or UI actually not
UX but you wise user interface so Kibby
has its own user interface library to
use things like labels and buttons and
grids and stuff like that so we're going
to import a label from that UI library
and it's called UI x dot so we'll import
labels so dot label and we'll say import
label make sure it's capitalized though
and then down here we need to create our
class of our application so it should be
the name of the file so I'll say class
test app and any class name because is
like the name of your application you
need to inherit from and the app the
cute app that we imported up here at the
top so Kimmy dot apps where I'm
importing an app and then inside here we
need to have a at least one build method
and the argument is going to be its
instantiation itself so you pass in
itself as its argument because when you
create an object from a class and that
object you created is self so anyway
most of these methods inside of a class
need to be referenced using self so
let's say return label and then we'll
just say text equals what up with yo
mama
all right and then now get out of their
class definition there and then in order
to be able to actually run the
application when this file is initiated
we're gonna say if name equals main and
this is a standard Python way of being
able to run the class by directly
clicking on it so I can look if I double
clicked on this file it should run but
anyway I'm gonna go ahead and just run
it through my editor oh my bad I didn't
my app because I was looking off of the
documentation as I'm doing this a test
app is the name of my application
I never go so we have a label and one
thing that's important to note about
this and you know I'm actually stepping
through the documentation myself to try
to get a firm understanding but whatever
you whatever this build method returns
is like the root widget so you what's a
widget so in it turn if it's the first
it's the root widget so from what I
understand it's basically you can have
widgets inside of widgets and things
like that so we'll get into that more in
their coming videos but this label right
here is the root widget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
