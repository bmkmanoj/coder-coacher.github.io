I'm talking about is this new feature
that I've noticed on on YouTube it's
probably been here for a while
but what I find interesting about it is
it's the closed captioning so if you
guys don't know that's you know this
text that you know for people that are
obviously hearing-impaired they can they
can read you know what's being said and
things like that so closed captioning
YouTube had this feature where you could
have people from around the world like
write closed captioning for your videos
and different languages and things like
that and they still have that feature
and I really feel like there's probably
a you know a future there for people
that want to make some money you know
Tran transcribing some videos I'm not
sure how much money is involved there in
fact I wouldn't want to do it personally
I'm just simply saying there's somebody
like I'd probably rather do that and
then work at McDonald's but you know
that's that's just me I mean I've never
done that for a living but I have worked
at McDonald's and that sucked
but anyway the the closed captioning
like I've noticed that YouTube's closed
captioning is absolutely like fantastic
so they are the artificial intelligence
behind it's voice recognition and
everything is like is way better than
anything I've seen in the past and I
guess it goes back a couple years ago I
was doing some videos where I was doing
some some cartoons you guys saw it like
some of those terrible cartoons some of
you guys I'm sure I've seen it and I
would do like you know robotic voices
for for the you know the text and then I
also was interested in trying to get
into writing blogs but by verbally you
know spitting things out and having it
right you know right the blogs for me so
I figured I would try some different
software and things like that to see if
that actually worked for me and software
just wasn't good enough like you could
not follow the conversation I'm somewhat
of a mumbler so I don't have like the
most coherent speech sometimes like I
can kind of I also use slang and things
like that too so a lot of people
especially like robots and things like
that they don't understand slang so that
is um so that is that's something that I
find very interesting that that YouTube
is now basically able to fully automate
that stuff and not just like you know
within you're talking about within
seconds to minutes like they have this
closed captioning that is actually able
to follow Chris Hawkes like so so
that that is weird and and the point of
this video is whether or not artificial
intelligence is going to put us out of a
job I mean that's really what the
conversation I've heard this
conversation a lot actually from senior
devs and everything that are basically
like yeah you know this is going to be
the next blue collar industry eventually
artificial intelligence machine learning
things like that is going to get to the
point where a you know artificial
program is going to write better
software than what a human can write and
and that's just in some ways it's to i
guess it's to be expected right I mean
you have a robot like any sort of
machine it can do a better job than a
human but it's very specific you know
it's it's built specifically for a
specific task and it does it better than
a human so somebody still had to build
the robot to and then you know program
the robot to work on a specific task and
that's kind of where we are I think with
machine learning to some extent however
obviously YouTube has something that can
clearly listen to its videos and pull
out fairly accurate information in fact
from what I've seen it's like it's it's
it's very accurate so that you know if
anybody's in that industry all of a
sudden they get it they get you know
just just this place I mean it's just
like you know if you were the guy that
built carriage wheels when everybody had
a horse and buggy you know it's how you
lost your job eventually you know the
printing press even bookstores like
Amazon's putting stores like Toys R Us
out of business and things like that and
um you know things just change right and
we you know self-driving cars in the
next thing so howhow is that going to
affect the market if we have
self-driving trucks what were those
million millions of truck jobs like what
are they gonna do I mean a lot of those
truck drivers are like former you know
this and that and the other thing and
then they retired and became truck
drivers in retirement and so it's like
you're gonna displace all those workers
I guess there's there's some concern
about whether or not there's a large
enough job market if automation and
robotics and artificial intelligence
starts replacing software developers so
you're probably what Chris
closed-captioning has nothing to do it
with with robots writing software and
robots can barely understand image
recognition and things like that so you
know who's to say that they're gonna be
able to do this well it brings up this
wired article from just the thirteen so
a couple days ago
and Google was basically saying that
they have an artificial intelligence
that's able to to build api's for them
so micro api's these api's are being
built by artificial intelligence and
through artificial intelligence there's
no human intervention there from what I
understand now
obviously you have once again you have
artificial intelligence robots that are
specifically built to do a specific task
but where the future probably will be
with with these types of systems and
especially when you start looking at
whether or not they can replace your
programmers it's really going to be it's
going to be a you know like a neural
network of a different AEI is basically
you're gonna have a bunch of different a
eyes that are focused on a specific
thing so one AI is gonna be very good at
cryptography you know another one's
gonna be doing something else and things
like that so not one single AI has to be
so fucking smarter that it can figure
out anything it just has to be smart
enough to know where the the smartest
person is for that particular you know
that particular category or topic so if
you know if an application consists of
40 different parts your AI is gonna go
to probably 40 different areas of
expertise expertise to then build you
know that API are there projects so am i
concerned about this no probably not
would I be concerned like just getting
into programming probably not
would I be concerned twenty years down
the road hell yeah like if I were gonna
be a like so for my kids by the time
they're graduated college and things
like that do you know do I want them to
be software developers I think I do I
mean but they can do whatever they want
like I've never been the type of parent
this I hate you got to do this you gotta
my kids can do whatever the hell they
want but like what I recommend
programming is as a career like right
now I would you know five ten years I
think I would but you know twenty years
down the line twenty five years online
maybe maybe not so do I think it's it's
a good option for people to be a
developer right now like even if Google
starts automating and creating a way to
to write software through through AI I I
think that you know you're probably
safer if that starts to become like a
mainstream trend and Google has a lot of
success with that tonight
you know that would be the writing on
the wall to make sure you're getting
some sort of an electrical engineering
degree that whatever sort of they you
probably balance out your degree with
some sort of business and technical or
you know accounting and technical say
something so it's something along those
lines I would saying just something to
kind of future-proof your your career I
don't know that I'd ever want to like go
to college just to be a programmer to
write code for 35 years dude like I
really don't think I would want to do
that yeah I guess it depends on the day
but like there's been shittier jobs no
question like I've talked to you guys
about some of the terrible jobs that
I've had but I'm I'm I'm 36 just I'm 36
I have a whole year to be 36 but I am I
don't go to work and struggle with
coding or anything like that but there
are days that I come home and I don't
want to code at all I don't I don't want
to look at code or anything and I I can
imagine that that would get somewhat
more difficult as you age as you get
older especially when you're learning
newer technologies and things like that
and with web development nothing seems
to be older than you know a few months
or years with most of the technology
that we use besides like the core stuff
like you know sequel things like that
but I think I think it I think we're
still relatively safe to be in this
industry even improve oh stars writing
software even with this this AI it's
like hey you need an AI just go ahead
use google's AI to build one for you
it's not going to just magically be able
to do that it's gonna take a lot of a
lot of work and everything it still
takes a lot of completely dedicated
focus to build these ai's to do specific
tasks things like that we don't have
anything that understands intelligence
like we don't even understand
intelligence enough to be able to
replicate it so there's mcgrann have
that it's still you know ones and zeroes
and just doing what it was programmed to
do so I don't know man that's a it's
basic format so you guys are always like
Chris Chris uh you know I could you know
I'm gonna be a developer a lot of you
guys are studying to be developers
there's gonna be jobs in coding for all
of our lives like it's just it's gonna
be that way even if they are still
writing code there's gonna be jobs for
us to do and that's why I really feel
like with electrical engineering kind of
side it's probably pretty safe you know
as far as being able to serve
these eight eyes and robots and
mechanical things that we're going to
continue to have in our future but the
software isn't gonna just magically
write itself no matter how good it is
like you're still gonna have to have
human intervention at least for the
foreseeable future now maybe there's
some magical breakthrough one day where
it's just like fuck this thing is I get
a mimicking free will and you know if it
could truly do that then I think you
truly have a situation where like you
could have you know what was that called
spine and or something like that or I
remember anyway alright guys thanks for
watching have a good day man oh and um
actually before I wrap up so I got the
the ten patrons that have now started
supporting me I've also sent some
invites to people in the past and make
sure you guys join the new slack channel
so there's gonna be some discussions
going on there there hasn't been a whole
lot so far really flames that you need
some some out there he's doing a great
job as far as trying to to get people
talking but right now there's only a
couple of people on the slack channel
and I've invited about ten or so more of
the people that contributed everything
so I've also changed it to a dollar a
month I felt like ten I first was twenty
because I thought I was gonna be
focusing a lot and to be honest with you
I feel like I could have a couple
hundred people and then still ask me
questions and I still feel like I'd be
able to handle it on the slack Channel
so you know definitely I think on a
dollar you know it's it's it's pretty
fair to just I don't know what we'll see
we'll see what happens but yeah only a
dollar a month you can join the side
channel and that means you have access
to me you'll be able ask me questions
things like that another thing that's
good about the slack channel is it is by
invite only so it's not like I'm posting
things out there for the entire world to
see so it is an invite only thing it's
somewhat of a more I would say private
conversation then something that I would
be you know probably saying publicly and
things like that so there is that and
then you know it's also just something
that I have access to easier in my off
time so if I'm at the grocery store
I mean slacks notifying my phone or
somebody's posting something so if you
guys want to try to get in contact with
me or you're trying to look for like you
know tutor or something like that and
it's probably the closest thing that I
can
right now in that regard and then yeah
that's about it also guys make sure you
check out this this passport tutorial
series if you're in the passport Jade US
which is the authentication piece behind
node.js for the most popular
authentication piece behind ojs Owen my
buddy also has my flame he he he created
this tutorial series and he's been on
this channel for a long time so whoever
this troll is a download and make sure
you guys go over there please upload
them if you would he's a young kid man
he's a kid that's in high school and
he's writing code that people get paid
$100,000 a year to write and he's doing
it for free in his own time and he's
looking at things and he's like hey I
don't know if I want to be a programmer
or not you know and like I mean the
thing is is he like most definitely has
what it takes to be a programmer if you
can do this shit just because you want
to do it like you can be a programmer
and you can make a lot of money doing it
and you probably always will be
successful doing it but that's uh that's
just my opinion obviously I can't
guarantee anything for anybody but
alright guys thanks for watching man
have a good day and take care bye hey
guys what's up so this video was brought
to you by the tech Academy so make sure
you guys check them out the link is in
the description tab below from the
courses list here they have Computer
Basics overall software development
github html5 CSS database and there's a
lot more courses and they're adding
courses all the time so make sure you
guys give them a look once again the
link is in the description tab below
thanks guys have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
