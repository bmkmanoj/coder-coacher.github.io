django website tutorial series and i'm
going to do something crazier and i've
ever done before i'm going to try to
actually build an entire website from
start to finish on online using django
so that can kind of promote to the
framework if you're ever wondering why
to use django some of the sites that are
used the django was built with our sites
built with django pinterest being one of
them Pinterest is the fastest growing
web site and history has 70 million
monthly users already instagram has
billions of videos so are billions of
photos shared and things like that
that's all done in django as well Django
is also power sites like the onion PBS
NPR discuss discusses a commenting
system it's built with Django that gets
up to 40,000 hits a second and up to 8
billion hits a month so to answer your
question if you you know Django is a
very powerful framework and it's a
conservative framework it's been around
now for nearly nine years and I just
seems to be getting stronger I mean it's
up there with if there's three top
frameworks out there I mean I would
definitely say Django is one of them
asp.net and then Ruby on Rails I think
those are the three strongest frameworks
and PHP has a lot of frameworks but PHP
just isn't as strong of a language as
c-sharp or Python or even Ruby in my
opinion either you know I don't dislike
PHP or anything but my whole point here
is that this is a jungle tutorial series
I'm going to be using django 1.5 I'm
going to be building this on a Linux
server using the node hosting and for
VPS about 20 bucks a month you could
probably get up to about a million hits
in a month just on $20 if you compare
that to cloud hosting on Amazon or
Heroku or you know some sort of app
engine like Google App Engine or Windows
Azure that you're going to pay
a whole heck of a lot more for that type
of traffic so $20 on the node can get
you up and running and get a very in
fast application going but this tutorial
series isn't setting up things on one
node the node kind of gives you your
free free roam on your server and you
have to set up everything so I mean that
is a very long and drawn-out process but
if you're feeling brave enough there you
know tutorials out there that tell you
step by step how to set up your low node
server so in this tutorial series I'm
going to just assume that you have
Python installed you have Django
installed it's not really a beginner's
level tutorial on Python somewhat of a
beginner type thing on Django but you're
going to really see like a production
website being built so just a few things
about me I own um new boobies comm which
is a site that I wrote in Django and
it's got probably about 20,000 pages or
so of dynamic data so you have pages on
you know different movies it's got a
rating system that created different
stars everything is all interlinked
together you got you know drag and drop
features using jQuery and Ajax and so I
mean it's got you know a lot of stuff
going on with it
it's even got search which is actually
turned off right now because I had to
restart my server so you have all this
uh this stuff you know new movies on is
something that's a constant work in
progress I do want to expand onto it
eventually more and more but for right
now now it is what it is it's it's it's
a decent site it gets them a decent
amount of traffic but the whole purpose
of this series is that I own a domain
name new music comm it actually got me
into programming and it's based off of
one of my favorite bands Bayside I
started listening to their music when I
was about like upper 20s and all of a
sudden I decided that I wanted to be a
program I want to build a rock music
website is what I wanted to do and I
ended up learning how to program you
know based on just wanting to build a
website so now I'm a full-time
programmer for a large corporation and
justyou know I do this stuff for fun and
and you know it's awesome I'm just
getting better and better I think you
know as I learn more and more and I'm
still learning a lot I'm not some sort
of expert programmer but I definitely
know enough about you know plenty of web
languages to be able to get by just fine
so anybody new boot new music is going
to be I'm hoping an awesome site and
like I said it's a little bit crazy that
I'm going to build the entire thing
online but that's what I plan on doing
so hopefully you guys will subscribe and
kind of you know keep me motivated to to
continue to try to to do something crazy
like this so let's go ahead and I'm
assuming you have like I said Django
installed you don't have to have this
set up on a low note server or a server
at all you could just have it running on
Windows if you want I have a folder that
I'm going to put everything in so it's
right now it's blank it's in my projects
directory and I have a music folder for
new music so everything's going to sit
inside here and then I just upload it to
the server as I'm going along you need
to be able to access your servers
command prompt and if you're using
Windows and you are set up on like Linux
you need to download something called
putty so that way you can log into your
server and get command line to access
and then to be able to transfer files
back and forth you need FileZilla which
is um right here they're both free
programs for Windows so that way you can
transfer documents back and forth stuff
like that so now that I'm in here let me
go ahead and I need to I'm in my music
directory so CD space music and there's
some stuff in here that I was playing
around with before for an older
application so I want to go ahead and
I'm going to take everything out of this
okay so we have a blank music folder on
our left this is how FileZilla works as
your local on the left this is your
server on the right after you've logged
in with all your stuff and if you're
running locally you want to worry about
any of this you're just going to be
dealing with what's on the left here so
for starters we need to go ahead and
just get the basic setup done let's go
into this music directory and you want
to be able to make sure that you can
type Django admin
and that it pulls up these different
commands that you have that means that
Django is installed and it's on the
Python path and Python knows where to
find Django or that your system knows
where to find the Django admin dot py so
when you do that the first things first
we want to go ahead and start our
project and we're just going to call it
my project and what that does it creates
a folder here of my project so let's go
over to our FileZilla so that we can
download that to our local setup and
when we refresh you see now that in this
where I put it on my server under Web
Apps music I now have this my project
folder and one of the things that I like
to do is I actually like to take this
stuff out of it and then just drag it
into that top-level folder and get rid
of the extra my project folder for some
reason I just don't like it I think it's
confusing having my project application
and having another my project module
inside of it I like to have my project
as the application and then any sort of
modules that we build on they're going
to be their own separate folders inside
here and just so you know with Django
you have this manage that people I file
which isn't allow you to do most things
you need to do settings is like your
cockpit your dashboard it has everything
you need for all your like config
variables basically URLs is how your
people request your domain that goes to
your URLs file and figures out what
method is going to handle that traffic
so we'll get into that more and more as
we go along but for right now let's go
ahead and download this my project
folder to music so I now have it over
here and if I go to my development
environment you can use any development
environment you want I'm using Visual
Studio it's a little bit unorthodox for
a Python developer to be using that but
I do see sharp development for my job
and asp.net so I'm using Visual Studio
anyway and it's really the best idea out
there I think but most people are going
to use things like sublime or some other
text editor that is more familiar for
Python users but bottom lines you need
to have some sort of a solution open so
that you can see your my project folder
now let's go ahead and create some basic
folders that every website is going to
need we're going to a resources folder
in fact I'm going to call it static
Miami thing static a resources would
want to call I'm going to call it static
because honestly I have other sites that
I call that already use static so I
don't want to make things dammit I keep
doing it more confusing so anyway let's
have a static folder and a static is
going to be the things like your images
directory so let's go ahead and create
that let's create another folder in
there for js4 javascript and another
folder for CSS so we have that all in
there let's create another folder here
for our templates as where all your
templates are and then inside the
templates create another internal folder
for base because we're going to have any
to spell that right we're going to have
a base folder that basically is a page
like all of our HTML pages are going to
inherit from so now that we've done that
we're going to jump right into getting
our settings file set up in the next
video but in this video we've already
gone in we've create a directory
structure we've created our first Django
project if for some reason Django admin
doesn't work it's because it's not added
to your command line to your path
variable so you have to look into how to
add something to your path variables
it's really not too too difficult but
hopefully you'll be able to get through
that it's just like being able to type
Python like because python is installed
on my machine if I'm on Windows and I
type Python windows knows that python is
located at C colon forward slash Python
27 because I'm using Python 2 7 so it
says o Python I know how to handle that
let me open up the Python interpreter so
that's because it's added to my path so
you need to do the same thing with the
Django admin if it cannot be found so
that way you can start your project and
the Django admin can be found inside of
your Django installation which is
located inside your Python installation
typically all right so if you guys have
questions with that just leave a comment
I'll try to help you out with it there's
a lot of resources online as far as
being able to add things to your path so
hopefully you can get past that part
this set up is going to be the hardest
part of the entire thing once we get
that done and out of the way if you can
it might might pull your hair out a
little bit but once we get that done
we're going to really gonna be able to
cruise along and we're going to build a
really awesome application so I just
asked you guys to subscribe if you can
and you know comment or like the video
if you would
I appreciate that and have a good day
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
