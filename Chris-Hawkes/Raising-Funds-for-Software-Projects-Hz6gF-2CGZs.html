been super busy this week really this
past weekend that said I have a video
tonight that I just want to touch upon
just two little issues I'm just going to
try to merge into one video because I
don't think either one really deserves
its own video I don't feel passionately
enough about it but the CSS referenced
IO is a website i want to share with you
guys which I feel like is a totally
awesome resource or reference that I
wanted to pass on because this isn't
something that I had available to me
when when I was learning CSS and I just
feel like this site has done a a heck of
a job trying to not just explain things
verbally or textually that they also
have these visual descriptions of how
this stuff works and i think it's just
it's very very helpful it's very similar
also to like you know the documentation
that we're really used to with the left
side navigation here where you can
scroll down and go to any one particular
CSS style if you if you have any further
questions about you know what is it
actually do so as we go down through the
demonstrations here i mean i'm not going
to demo of this or anything like that i
mean they're pretty much they speak for
themselves but these these explanations
are just very very good and I think the
visual reference does a lot because one
of the things that I struggled with a
lot is is actually clearing fonts enough
fonts with floats and trying to get
columns to actually you know expand to
actually have their content and have two
different column sizes but then still
have a footer that that would you
properly sit below those two columns
that I might have and you know bootstrap
makes that stuff a lot easier but
nowadays but you know there may be a
time where you don't have bootstrap to
rely upon and that you need to actually
come up with some of these solutions or
self and many of these solutions can be
found here in this this website is
reference so it goes on and on like it
goes a really long ways here but even
talks about like images and these
overlays it's just really good so CSS
reference io make sure you guys check it
out
and if you don't have a lot of CSS
skills I would definitely think this
would help you some of you guys asked me
to is CSS even necessarily more but it
definitely is if you're going to be a
web developer you need to have some
decent CSS knowledge because ultimately
if you're going to do anything to
creative you're going to be stepping
outside the boundaries of what a
framework or a template is going to be
able to provide for you all right the
next item of interest I thought was
really cool was font awesome five
actually went to Kickstarter which is
the crowdfunding website in order to
raise money and and just so you guys
know in case you're not aware of fun
awesome fano something I mean it I'm
sure you're aware of it if you're doing
web development but it's it's very
common it's commonly use it seems like
every website is using fun awesome and
it really it uses CSS font techniques in
order to display icons and these icons
can have different colors they can have
different sizes they can be bold non
bold and it's um it makes your website
looks so much more professional and one
of the benefits of it is that you're
just loading a CSS style sheet and and
has the capabilities of using all kinds
of different icons so if you look at the
latest version here 4.7 you can see all
these icons were recently added to the
standard I mean it's got stuff even for
the quora logo and the etsy logo here so
it even has company logos in case you
ever needed to reference them so you
don't you don't even have to get
permission really from the the company
as far as I know in order to be able to
display something like this on your
website you could turn the poor the
exact same you know Duke you that the
color of whatever sort of font that they
have and and use it as a reference
instead of having to like download an
image or reference an image somewhere
this is all just fonts that look like
images and the the amount of icon set
just come in the standard library is all
included here so there's quite a bit of
stuff you can do with this and if you
guys haven't used it I would definitely
suggest you check that out as well now
the reason why I mentioned von awesome
is because they went to Kickstarter to
actually create the fifth
standard or fifth iteration of this
project and I'm not sure if this is
going to lead into a new way of being
able to raise money for business venture
ideas I mean what do we normally do when
we're building software or a website
startup is from like that we reach out
to venture capitalists to try to get
them to invest a million dollars into
our site and I've already said before we
end up selling our souls in order to be
able to get that money because then
you'd a lot of venture capitalists so
they'll end up requiring that they
control pieces of the company and the
direction of that company including you
know who to bring in to make business
decisions so you could be the creator
and the person came up all the ideas or
the majority of the brains behind the
operation but slowly you start to lose
control of your company unless you're
very very careful somebody like
Zuckerberg he was always able to
maintain about 51-percent of his company
i believe which is by far the majority
shareholder a facebook but he was
obviously advised very very well from
from from Jump Street I mean when he
reached out to Peter Thiel originally
back when he was still at Harvard I just
have a feeling that a lot of very very
smart people who knew what they were
doing were guiding him in order for him
not to make a bad decision about turning
over too much of his company and then
losing control of it we've seen
companies like livingsocial that became
a billion dollar website startup kick
out their own CEO groupon did the same
thing and they also in the same industry
as well but these are community coupon
websites both groupon and livingsocial
both throughout their own ceos even
Apple at one point throughout Steve Jobs
so it's you know you can easily lose
control of your company and things like
that saw the reason why I think this is
interesting is I'm just wondering if you
have a community agreed upon product
like falling awesome where everybody's
like damn you know font awesome does a
lot for our product it does a lot for
our website it's so much easier to use
icons embedded as font style sheets and
it is to actually have to maintain all
these in these images and icons and
things like that and let's go ahead and
make sure this project continues to be
funded well 30 5550 backers pledged over
a million dollars to build the latest
version of fun awesome now that is that
is substantial because this actually
reminds me of what the Django community
did in order to try to get the Django
rest framework to be updated with the
latest versions of Django so Django as a
community they have quite a bit of money
because I mean there's websites like
Instagram and Pinterest at one point was
using Django a lot of what major
websites are still using Django granted
it's still a very very niche market you
know you're going to people that say
that your note is obviously more popular
or.net for all these other options you
have out there but the point is Django
is uh they have quite a bit of money and
what they ended up doing in order to get
Django rest framework which was one of
the only resources just a couple of
years ago for a serious restful api type
of infrastructure that works directly
with Django they paid a guy that created
this Tom Christie I think it was ten or
twelve thousand dollars or somewhere
around there in order to actually update
his own project to make to make it
worthwhile now had he actually gone to
Kickstarter who knows maybe he could
have actually raised a whole lot more
money because they would have said oh
you know like a lot of maybe more
individual people would say you know I'm
gonna go ahead and contribute to this
cause or whatever you know I'm not
really sure how many people would donate
to didn't Django rest and not to the
Django software foundation but the fact
of the matter is is that the Django
Software Foundation how to take the cash
that they use for their project and pay
Tom Christie who manages and ran the
Django rest framework and it was only a
matter of like ten thousand dollars or
something but you know Tom Christie was
probably like you know I have my own
businesses and job and everything I'm
not going to be able to do this without
the right type of money so it's just
very interesting you know it's it's it's
chump change compared to what font
awesome just did with 35,000 backers and
over a million dollars so that's uh
that's that's quite impressive and I'm
just wondering if that's going to change
the way that we try to raise capital or
could it the thing is with fun awesome
you can't just have an idea like font
awesome and
to Kickstarter and be like yeah let me
raise some money you might be able ready
some money but you're not gonna raise a
million dollars but when you have a
tried and true project like fawn awesome
that took it to the Kickstarter maybe
Kickstarter's just has a certain way of
crowdfunding that is just more appeasing
like I'm wondering if if Jago went to
Kickstarter or.net core even though
they're backed by Microsoft or somebody
else went to Kickstarter and tried to
raise their own community or campaign
what would what would be the outcome
would they get more money than then I'm
just trying to manage that from their
own website I'm not really sure I know
Kickstarter's going to get their share
of this million dollars but it's quite
impressive I mean clearly 35,000 nearly
thirty six thousand people were
influenced enough by this one awesome
project in order to contribute some cash
I didn't even know about this until the
campaign had ended I might have thrown
it a few dollars i'm not sure i
typically don't do that but fall awesome
is a project that if they were
struggling for money I would have no
problem throwing a few dollars its way
for sure so it's interesting where all
this this community back stuff is going
I me a lot of youtubers are using
patreon in order to try to raise funds
because they can't make ends meet doing
things on their YouTube channels and
people that appreciate the content are
willing to contribute in this might be a
new standard I mean because the ads and
things are just not working the same way
that they used to and even if if they
peppered you with ads on the font
awesome website said hey please donate
bow of luck you know it could have been
ignored because um you know it just may
be the community just creates like an
aura of success or motivation in order
to try to advance this project but
anyway guys that's really all I got to
talk about tonight and like I said it's
been a busy weekend so I just feel like
I haven't had much time to even think or
do any sort of programming for the most
part alright guys have a good day bye
hey guys so a lot of you asked me how do
I get my foot in the door to become a
programmer and I just want to take a
moment to mention dev Mountain coding
