this video and most of all thank you for
allowing me to hit the 10,000 subscriber
mark so today I was able to hit 10,000
subscribers I've been waiting for that
for years
10,000 just feels better than 9,800 to
be honest with you but um I'm really
really appreciative of all the support
that you guys have had for the most part
it's like 95 percent supportive and then
5 percent well probably three percent
troll and 2 percent just outright hate
for me so I guess those statistics
aren't as bad as they could be so I
don't get too much hate mail but um
anyway guys thanks for allowing me to
reach that mark I'm approaching a
million views and like I said 10,000
subscribers and those are both just you
know significant numbers I never really
thought anything become this channel and
if you go back to some of my earliest
videos they are just absolutely terrible
some of them and I keep them around
because it allows me to reflect and just
kind of see where I was when I was a
programmer back then compared to where
I'm at now and you know ultimately I can
look back just a month ago and be like
damn I was writing some really bad code
then where I've learned a lot over the
last month and it continues to be that
way even you know after doing this for a
while so I didn't want to just give a
10,000 subscriber video I felt like it
was kind of lame just to have a video
surrounding just you know 10,000
subscribers although I'm you know really
proud of that just want to give a shout
out to like Chris Cavanaugh Tara Cole to
Sean from Kenya and Caleb those are all
supporters that have been on the channel
you know following me for years now and
they've always been some of the most
active supporters as for as long as I've
had this channel and I definitely
appreciate that so I get a question from
Yasir and he wants to know Chris
when did you start programming and I
could just give the simple answer of
when I started but I felt like I would
kind of give a you know background video
just kind of because my story's a little
bit more interesting I think than just
saying you know with the age that I
started a lot of programmers start at a
very young age some are starting you
know and what would be considered like
an elderly age I've heard of people in
their 80s starting programming so they
say that you're never too old to start
programming which is good
in my case you know I I didn't really
look into it too much you know as far as
like what age I should have started
programming I think I was concerned when
I was jumping into it because my story
it goes back to when I was 28 it would
have been the early part of 2010 and
that's actually I'm sorry it would be
early part of 2011 yeah 2011 so the
beginning of 2011 actually guys I'm
completely wrong it was 2009 so the
beginning of 2009 was when I actually
started looking into programming
although I didn't really start
programming so I would have been 2028
around that time and when I started I
actually wanted to build a website so
the reason why I wanted to build a
website was because Facebook was just
getting popular and there was a lot of
like you know media attention
surrounding like you know these tech
startup websites like YouTube had just
been sold to Google just a year before
that so there's always like you know
tech news out there and I think that you
know was caught up a little bit in that
but I wanted to build a website yeah
basically that could compete with
Facebook at the time but then my
interest started changing once I started
looking into web design and early in the
early part of 2009 I was kind of playing
around with like Photoshop and Adobe
Illustrator and I was it was mainly just
building templates and looking into like
HTML but didn't really know anything
about HTML or CSS or JavaScript any of
that stuff I barely could tell you the
difference between them at that time but
that's where it all started I started
using these programs to kind of build up
these mock-ups of what I wanted a
website to look at or look like and it
wasn't really until I didn't take it
seriously at all because I wasn't really
doing anything during those times I had
to work a full-time job I had a family
and I would come home and I think every
once in a while I'd kind of look at you
know Photoshop or look at some book or
something but I wasn't really getting
anything done you know all through you
know that spring and the summer
into the fall and it wasn't until I
actually went to a concert in this dive
of a bar an auto bar and it's called the
auto bar in Baltimore Maryland it's a
little rundown joint and I ended up
seeing so it's like this tiny little
Club and I remember I ended up seeing my
favorite band right so my favorite band
was Bayside and this show in 2009 it was
one of the best shows I've ever been to
like I went to Woodstock 99 when I
graduated high school and I mean I've
seen a lot of different concerts seen a
lot of different genres of music like
everything from my rap and country to
rock and all stuff and like that Bayside
show for to me was just sick because
like for some reason at the age of 28 I
just felt old you know I like I felt
like with where my career was at at that
point like I was kind of stuck I didn't
have a college degree I'm not even sure
I was attending college at that point
and I just kind of wanted to do
something different but after this
Bayside show and and Baltimore Maryland
I remember like I think I got sick or
something but for like two days
afterwards I could like my ears were
ringing like the next day and stuff like
that because the show was so loud and I
just remember thinking you know I really
want to do something different and from
that point on that would have been
November of 2009 like I really started
you know trying to learn programming I
really started making an effort you know
every night to start learning it and it
kind of started off with CSS and HTML
and making those templates that I was
building in Photoshop into actual HTML
and then it you know started with some
basic jQuery introduction plugins stuff
like that so that goes you know all into
the beginning of 2010 and then from
there I started actually getting into
like scripting languages so that I could
try to collect data because my ultimate
goal was I was going to try to build a
rock music website to promote bands like
Bayside in a much better way you know
basically I thought I could do a better
job than like a pure volume they were
kind of an inspiration at the time a lot
of you guys probably never even heard of
a site like that they're not even
probably the top 10,000 web sites
anymore but for some reason I thought I
could build a better site and I allowed
that drive in a dedication to continue
to
carry on into 2010 so I started learning
Perl to collect data on the web
couldn't really figure that out I would
struggle really hard with that for a
long time and it wasn't until I moved to
Python and probably the summer of 2012
that I started not 2012 I'm sorry but
2011 that I started actually making some
decent progress because I remember by
the fall of 2011 you know two years
after this dream of making a website
like I had actually had websites at that
point like I built this a new music
website which got me started I mean I
remember I originally started with
Django and I moved a web to PI where I
met some you know really good Python
guys like one guy's a professor who
actually started web soup I his name is
Massimo and he's a professor at a
university in Chicago I can't remember
the name of it I I'm actually friends
with him on Facebook still but they
actually helped me a lot with getting
new music off the ground I put it in the
cloud for a while in Google Google's App
Engine cloud and then I eventually
transitioned it away from from the
Google App Engine and web to PI and
ended up going back to Django and I felt
like I really I grew a lot as a
programmer doing that and getting you
know getting involved in the Django
community quite a bit this was my first
logo it kind of brings back a lot of
memories for my new music site like I
ended up changing the design so many
times and changing the direction of it
and I don't know I guess it's kind of I
look back on the you know the three
years of having this web this YouTube
channel and you know the many years that
I've been you know trying to build
websites and program it's kind of it's
no no it's I guess it's touching
so by like the fall of 2011 I remember I
had new music up and I was promoting it
and it was getting some attention not a
whole lot and the website wasn't very
dynamic so there wasn't a whole lot of
server-side stuff going on it was a lot
of scrape data with Python scripts and
stuff like that and building static web
pages for the most part it was some
there was some database involvement
there but it certainly wasn't like some
sort of dynamic database driven website
so it was very it was new
you know and that was even two years
after being in the game for a while and
you're just doing it at home because my
job didn't you know have anything to do
with programming and I could only do it
at night and when I had you know
available time so there was just so much
involved
I remember by 2011 that I felt
comfortable enough to apply for an
Android programming position and I
remember I drove all the way up to the
to Washington DC from where I live in
Virginia which is a pretty good Drive
especially because traffic stops around
here and I remember you know when it is
this interview and I mean these people
had no intention on hiring and hiring me
because I didn't have a degree and I
really didn't have any you know real
corporate experience either and then my
websites that were up weren't you know
all that you know they weren't all that
awesome I guess you know they look good
but they they I had no skills basically
to get hired as an Android Java
developer I barely knew Java and
probably had no business interviewing
for it and I guess it kind of sucks that
I even drove up there and wasted my time
I remember that was kind of my low point
from you know trying to change my career
so two years after this you know fateful
concert you know that motivated me to
build this website you know I had been
shut down and I think that was like the
third time I had been declined for a job
at that point and I had pretty much told
myself driving back from DC that you
know I was going to give up and give it
up and it sucks because you know I was a
father at the time and you know I had a
wife and still have a wife still married
still have kids but um I remember like I
was just thinking like you know I've
wasted you know two years now and it's
just not going to happen and I was
honestly like really close to giving it
up like all of it and just kind of
moving on and maybe trying to do
something different and luckily I didn't
because the next year going into the
beginning of 2012 I was about April of
2012 and I still I hadn't you know
interviewed for any other positions
after that because the job a job
interview was just a disaster and I
ended up I ended up going back to a Bay
sad concert which was crazy so it was
like this free to a free concert that
they put on and in Baltimore again and
after the concert I actually got to you
know talk to the lead singer which was
really cool this guy Anthony Ranieri and
I remember I was telling him about the
website know so yeah we named our dog
after your band and all this stuff and
like and I was telling him about this
website I'm like man you know it for
somebody who isn't a real programmer you
know a day job still considers himself
to be a programmer at night you know
what I mean like I wasn't officially a
programmer but I considered myself to be
one because at that point I had already
started a web company and I had several
websites including new music that was
still up and I still you know was
working on different ways that I was
going to you know expand it and prove
everybody wrong eventually and he was
like telling us hey that's cool that's
awesome and you know if we were just
fans to him or whatever but it was still
I think meaningful because I ended up
going back to the drawing board and I
ended up building a blog that had
nothing to do with new music but it was
a blog that ended up getting a ton of
traffic going all through the summer and
into August and at that point I had
enough confidence again to reach out to
a hiring manager and I basically told
him like my whole history about your web
design being self-taught you know
motivated to learn all this stuff and I
told him about Python and my my data
scraping projects and all this stuff
because at that point I was pretty good
at data manipulation and data crunching
and and they were interested in and I
actually got hired right off and like I
got brought in as like a beginner level
programmer mainly focusing on just UX
where I was just gonna be like a you
know a UI and mainly just JavaScript CSS
you know HTML kind of person like a
basically a front-end web web developer
and from there I just kind of took that
opportunity and ran with it now I'm a
senior programmer I've been in
Enterprise Development for three years
now I still run websites at home still
get involved in technology obviously I
do this channel and I try to stay up to
date with you guys and new programming
trends and stuff like that but it's a
pretty crazy story I guess because you
know I could have given it up after
being turned down several times which I
know you guys have been turned down
before a lot of
of you guys that are self-taught I have
questions about how you get your foot in
the door and I don't think anybody has
the exact answer for you for in my case
you know I got declined a lot of times
and I you know I may have gotten lucky
with getting my foot in the door and I
still consider myself you know fortunate
to be in this industry
one of the things I will mention is that
I was going to college at the time for
you know an associate's degree in
Business Administration so I have never
taken a computer science course but at
the same time it's not like I wasn't
trying to pursue a degree so I think
just simply pursuing and being able to
tell a prospective employer that you are
actually working on that degree you know
working on bettering yourself is it's
going to help you a lot even if you
don't have the degree I think even just
taking some courses is probably going to
help you if you have a hard time trying
to to find a job somewhere so that's
about it guys I mean I started at 28
didn't win the job till about 30 or 31 I
guess 31 and now I've been in the
enterprise development world for three
years and I think it's I think it's a
great industry to be in so definitely if
you guys are thinking about becoming
programmers don't you know don't don't
give that thought up you know keep keep
trying it's going to be a lot of hard
work especially if you're not going for
that degree and you know hopefully you
guys don't give up when you're told that
you're not good enough or that you know
you just don't have the experience and
just keep working on that experience
there's a lot more ways of getting the
education now with the internet you can
learn stuff online there's free
tutorials there's even free
certifications you can certainly host
your own projects on github you can
contribute to open source projects you
could write your own jQuery plugins on
stuff I mean you can do so much stuff to
try to get your name out there as a
developer maybe just even answering
questions on Stack Overflow to try to
not just help yourself but help others
and you could start a YouTube channel
like this you know you just you know do
whatever you need to do to try to you
know keep up to date and you know just
trying to better yourself each and every
day and I think eventually it would
definitely you it would work eventually
it'll get that job but guys thanks for
the the ten thousand
subscribers like I said I really
appreciate that it's been a three-year
journey on this channel looking back on
my older videos it's funny I was very
you know immature and a lot of them and
definitely a terrible programmer at
times and I don't know it's just funny
but anyway guys thanks thanks for
watching have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
