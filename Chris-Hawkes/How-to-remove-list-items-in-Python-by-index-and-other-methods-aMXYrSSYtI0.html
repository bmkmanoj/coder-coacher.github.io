to show you something I'm whenever
you're dealing with a list a lot of
times you need to get like the last
element either you know check where it
is or maybe chop it off or whatever in
this case this wouldn't be the best
method to actually chop it off but if
you just need to get whatever the last
element is so in this case we want Billy
I can just simply say item equals list
one and then just negative one inside
square brackets and now I'll just print
item
and you can see that we grabbed the last
item in the list now another way to do
it which is a little bit less pythonic
this is typically what you're gonna see
whenever you need to iterate to grab the
last item and I said the other method
that we can do is we can say list 1 dot
pop
and we can see the same result now one
thing you want to keep in mind whenever
you're doing this is that we're gonna
iterate over the list and I'll show you
for I and list one prints I all right so
pop doesn't remove it now if we actually
did the previous method that we had
negative one you can see that pop
actually removes the item from the list
and I'm just getting it by index will
not actually remove it you're just you
know probably assigning it to a variable
no I'm going back to pop again and we
can actually remove by index so it
starts counting at zero so one would
take out John in this list and now you
can see that John is what we got in the
an item here and then it's no longer in
the list and then once again going back
to the other method on we could also go
counting backwards so
so you can see you grabbed John this
time if we went negative three we're
gonna go all the way back to Chris I
know the final method you're gonna see a
lot for deleting items from the list
you're gonna see and del and delete well
I shall even need the brackets actually
also we'll get rid of that real quick
actually you know I'm gonna keep that
takeout print item here so you can see
we took out Chris this will take out
John and then this will take out Billy
so anyway you're gonna see multiple ways
that people take items from a list or
they need to grab it by a certain index
or whatever sometimes you're deleting
items from a list sometimes you just
need to get an item that is in a certain
part of a list all right guys let's
pretty much it with lists and removing
list items using three different methods
all right thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
