Python for noobs and I wanted to clear
up on something the difference between a
list and Python and a tuple because they
look identical and there's a big
difference between the two though if I
have a list or name Lister it's a list
name Lister and I'll say in this list is
Chris John these are strings and then I
have a head so those are the three
names in my list and that's the standard
Python list now I can do the same thing
and let's just say I'll do a name to
pool Lister and I hate the name tuple
but that's what these things are called
and they're in the parenthesis and so
I'll say Chris John and shithead so
those three items one's a tuple ones a
list they look identical they both can
you know do for loops and print their
contents like for I and Lister print and
then just put string I and then for I
and tuple Lister
so if I go to my command prompt and run
this program
they both print out the list at the same
time the tuples advantage is that it's
quicker than a list the list advantage
is that you can do so many more things
with it but the biggest difference
between the two is that the list is
something called it's called mutable
meaning that the contents of the list
can change you can take things and into
or you can put things into them you can
take things out of them and the so you
can do that with a list but with the
tuple you you cannot change it it's
called immutable it can never be changed
once you define it you can't take items
out of it but it runs quicker like I
said so that would be the advantage if
you're really looking to try to boost
speed and you know that your list item
or your set of you know strings or
numbers or whatever it is you want to
put into the tuple because you can put a
list inside of tuples you can put list
inside of lists as well but and just if
you know that you know you're never
going to change it then you know that
could be an option for you if you're
looking at speed in my years of
programming I've never really run into
like a speed issue like I don't you know
develop games or anything like that
where I'm really looking to squeeze
speed or anything but that's kind of the
main difference now also in this video I
want to touch on how you can remove an
item from your list and some of our
earlier videos and we're building a
spider we're like we you know we have
these items as we're looping over them
and it's like some of them shouldn't be
there and you know one of the easiest
ways to remove the item is just to do
like a logical well you could do a for
loop over the list so like we'll say for
I and Lister and then just do a logical
operator saying if so we'll say if
string I equals shithead
will say Lister dot remove
and then let's go ahead and just give a
confirmation message will say print
removing this on wanted piece of crap
then you want to add string then we'll
just say down here after it's done we'll
say printing and a new list and then
we'll say 4i and Lister print string I
so what we're doing is we're we're
looping over the list and we're looking
for a string that says or equal shithead
and when it does equal shithead we're
saying hey remove that from the list
right here and then we're just saying
we're giving a confirmation message
saying hey we're removing this unwanted
list item and we print it out to the
screen then I'm printing the new list
just to kind of separate the content on
our command prompt and we'll say for I
and Lister print string I so let's go
ahead and run this and this is one of
those issues here where this thing oh we
didn't save it my bad my bad
alright alright you can see here that we
looked over the first list and we found
this unwanted piece of crap name
shithead so that was a list item that we
did not want in there and we can do this
even if we had like millions of list
items well it would take a long time but
you could do that and then I identify
here printing the new list when you have
it here and then the new list no longer
contains shithead so that's how you can
clean up a list and also that's the
difference between a list and a tuple
and hopefully that kind of clears things
up for you guys most of the time you
might want to just use lists but when
you see those parentheses that look like
lists that's what they are they're
called tuples which is kind of a dumb
name but you know
whatever all right now so I'm gonna go
ahead and clear up or finish this video
now and if you could try to rate comment
subscribe it would be nice that would be
great alright thanks guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
