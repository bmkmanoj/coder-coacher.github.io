we're moving along in our python
tutorial here the next thing that we're
going to do is start messing with
integers or this number so it's going to
create a variable named x and we'll just
assign the value of one and then we'll
have y equals two so if we want to add
these two numbers together we're going
to say Z equals x plus y and then we'll
say print Z and we'll save this as I'm
just saving it as the list file which is
what I had it saved as in the last
tutorial but you can see that the is the
mozy item is the value of x plus y so
those are numbers now I want to let you
know that you cannot add a string with a
number it'll break Python so if we said
y equals going to do it before we add it
will just write / y y equals this is a
string and then we try to print a Z
you're trying to add a string and a
integer and it's an unsupported type so
you can't do that now if we want we can
have a string number this still won't
work but we can force why to be an
integer p 1 so we could say y equals int
for integer and then the value of y so
we actually turn y into an integer that
will work so you can force these things
into being an integer lot right now why
is an integer but we can turn it back
into a string by saying str why and it
will break it again so you can't add
strings and numbers and that's a normal
thing now we had dealt with a list in
the last tutorial so we were adding
strings to the list you can have a
lister and equals so that's the name of
our list and you can have
you say lizard got a pen and will say
this is a string so we're adding a
string to it and then we'll say for
parent Lister us on the bitch I try to
add two things to it I can't do that
nevermind my bad so we're just doing
this ever stable Lister got a pen and
number four so we have two things in
here there's a string and then there's
also an integer so that is that and
there's also a difference between a
normal integer and then there's also
something called a float and float is
like the decimal so if you're dealing
with monetary values you're going to
want to use floats in a lot of cases so
you can say I let's just say float
number equals 4.0 and then we can say x
equals 4 so let's say answer equals
float number plus 4 r plus X prime
answer so it actually over writes in and
creates a float now if we wanted to
answer just to be an integer like I said
we could always force it to be an
integer we could say to answer equals
int for integer and sir so within those
parentheses we force whatever we want to
be an integer integer into the that
parentheses there now if we want to just
verify what type of what it just verify
that answer actually is an integer we
could say print
and then tight and then within
parentheses just put an answer and this
is a trick to see what type of value the
variable is so when we say this you'll
say type integer so we say type integer
you can see that it is a type integer
and we can change that integer to a
string by saying str that's a string or
a flute as a float alright so that's
enough with integers and next tutorial
we're going to move into files how to
open them and save them alright see you
then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
