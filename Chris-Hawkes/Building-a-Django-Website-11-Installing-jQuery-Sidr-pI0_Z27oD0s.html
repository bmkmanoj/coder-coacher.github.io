back to the 11th video of the Django
building and Django website series and
what we're going to do is add some
responsive navigation to the website
right now it looks like it's really
lacking in detail but back end it's
built pretty strong so far so we're
doing really good we're going to make it
look a lot better I think now when we
add this this navigation so what I'm
going to use is this open-source cider
project which is a developed under MIT
license so it should be free for any
sort of commercial use or anything like
that and here's the website here at
cider calm you can look at the the demo
is pretty cool so I when I go down here
I'm shrink this thing down you can see
that the menu appears on the top and you
can fluctuate through the pages and then
just simply close the menu and you got
this nice young responsive layout so I
think it's pretty of the response of
menus I was messing with I built
responsive menus from scratch before but
I really like to just avoid that entire
process because it can be somewhat of a
headache and it usually takes couple
hours to develop a solution and really
it's not going to be any better than
what they got here which i think is
pretty impressive so far all right so um
let's go ahead and let's go ahead and
download this and whatever you download
a package like this we're going to have
it in a zipped up files where the cider
package and we have both light and dark
CSS let's go ahead and just extract
those to our project
and then it's going to be located at one
of the sea projects music static CSS so
we'll extract those down there and copy
this link right and then I'm going to
extract this to the static j/s folder
and let me make sure that that is there
alright so what they're just fine so now
let's go ahead and take it from our
local settings here and upload that to
the server alright so let's go over to
the base dot HTML page so that we're
going to include the stylesheet now up
at the top and we'll use our static URL
again
okay and then we're going to do
essentially the same thing here but it
recommends that we actually paste this
at the bottom of the body tag here I'm
just going to go to jay s and the actual
name of the file is jQuery is this so
let's go ahead and do this now all right
let's upload a template real quick make
sure that the file can be found
so if everything goes well no actually
we do not inherit from the master page
on our index page yet so well to fix
that later on but here we go we have a
body i have a link relation stylesheet
that's not great let me change that this
is a this supposed to be a script
you
let's upload that again
all right now we have the script let's
make sure we can open this thing all
right we can so we know it's there and
then also make sure that we can click on
our CSS file that we just added which is
also there as well all right so let's go
back into our based on HTML page and
inside of our nav we're going to go
ahead and paste in this toggle menu with
a couple of
yeah there should be fine we'll try this
out see what happens
that's a that's pretty cool except for
the fact that the toggle menu icon
itself looks like crap so really with a
situation like this we want this entire
thing to be like a mobile will call this
mobile nav I guess
and by default will have mobile nav
hidden
ok
and here's where we'll have our standard
desktop now so i'll just call this dude
five singles
we'll call it stay in a standard now
because basically on the mobile views
will end up turning off standard navin
showing responsive NAB
let's just repeat this a couple times to
have page one two and three
I just want to see what it looks like at
the moment all right so we have our
standard navigation there that is still
being displayed I'll probably because I
didn't update my CSS
okay all right so our mobile nav is now
hidden so what we want to do is we want
to say when the screen size is a certain
size go ahead and display that so let's
go ahead and we'll add that now in our
CSS file we can simply say something
like this like at media min-width and
with 600 pixels and it has to be in
these little brackets here but we're
going to go ahead and just say that
mobile nav display inherit and then
we'll hide the actual desktop nav so
standard nav display none so let me see
how this works I'm going to upload my
CSS
I actually had the opposite effect of
what I wanted
so really what I want is I want max min
min width I guess one pixel and Max wits
with the hill that's not right
all right that might work I don't know
yeah I don't know that this could work
it might not
hope you're good all right so on the
small okay good there we go so on the
small it says hey display this on the
big you're going to display your
standard navigation so that's where I'm
going to end the video here in the next
video we're going to actually do an
alternate means of handling our media
queries because the site is going to be
completely responsive so I want to have
a separate CSS file that handles the
responsive is instead of putting that
logic inside of the actual CSS page on a
media query like this I want to actually
put that in the bayside HTML page that
detects that and then just calls a
mobile CSS file as opposed to making one
big-ass CSS file that could slow down
bandwidth and things like that all right
guys I appreciate you watching please
subscribe and thank you for everything
