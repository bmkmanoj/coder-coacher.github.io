to get some new hardware and software it
seems I've the last two videos I've
tried to actually post or create I've
scrapped him because in fact and not
only did I scrap them once I've scrapped
him multiple times because my computer
is just actually the first couple times
I was doing on my cell phone phones
shaking around looks terrible this time
I actually just got done doing a
15-minute video which I thought was
really good and then turns out i had to
scrap the entire thing what i want to
talk about in this video though is uh i
posted this this video today which is
saturday the day that i'm actually
recording this and it says a few reasons
why being a programmer is awesome so you
guys always give a great comments i
appreciate every one of them and a
dictator and Perpetua t I can't even say
that right he always has some pretty
great and great comments but I'm curious
about his background actually but he
says yeah it is awesome just make sure
you have a different career before you
were 40 so we're talking about this many
times in the past when you get older
like biologically do things just start
shutting down for you are you not able
to learn and things like that I think
science has proven that if you're
healthy of a healthy mind try to get
exercise drink water maybe practice
meditation just to make sure that you
know you're satisfied with life that you
can be a programmer some of the greatest
programmers that we've seen like like
look at Andres helzberg who's actually
designing typescript and who designed
c-sharp it means an older guy he gets
brought in by Microsoft he's a genius
when it comes to language design if you
hear the guy speak you know that he's
extremely intelligent and he's probably
in his 50s or so and he's going to
continue to be you know working at
Microsoft if you look at guido van
rossum he's working at Dropbox he used
to work at Google he could work at any
one of those places because he's still a
you know genius level program or if you
can create Python you can work into your
50s and 60s and the thing is though is
that with the current ecosystem I think
it favors young people because we have
this flavor of the week JavaScript
library language you know
your library's constructs just you know
new ways of accomplishing the same thing
seem to get brought up and put out there
like every other day it seems like and
it's hard for any one particular
developer to be able to keep up with
that stuff so you're like okay
everybody's talking about angular now
we're talking about angular 2 and we're
talking about react if you're going to
just react as well you know you have to
use redox or flux or and then if you're
going to be doing that you need to have
xmas script 2015 in your code so you
need to be able to compile that Owain
that we need Babel so you're installing
NPM and 15 different modules in order to
get gulp working with be able to minify
your code and to compile your jsx and
your xmas crypt 2015 out down into raw
JavaScript then you're going to get some
sort of manipulation and and bundling
going on with that and and it's crazy so
then you start bringing a web pack into
it and that's just so now we have this
crazy-ass ecosystem and where do we what
do we saw where did we get we didn't get
anything more than what we had before
except you know now we're playing with
it cool you know a few new cool tools
and granted when everything's all
working together enough you spend time
understanding with all those little
pieces are doing you step back and you
think all that steam that's pretty
awesome but am I better off like when I
came when I wanted to do the project
with hipster code I could have done it
in ojs I wrote a note j/s website for
somebody else in fact i had a website i
was working on when it came to jobs that
i was going to use and the four i was
going to use nodejs and the Express
framework on top of that but then I
realized that I didn't want to use
MongoDB so if I'm going to use my sick
wife to you sequel eyes and sequel eyes
has nowhere near the features is
something like the Django
object-relational mapping and its
database integration tools that they are
just at your disposal so I quickly learn
hey if I want to get a real website up
and running and not you know beat around
the bush i need a product out there
that's going to work and it's going to
it's going to work well then i just i
wrote the thing in Django and I just did
that a couple months ago why because
Django is tried and true and it works I
could have done it in ojs and I'm sure
that people can do in nodejs and have
something else but
even though it's a django website it's
still pretty awesome because i have
react running on in fact react is also
using flux and it's using webpack and
all that other stuff but I'm sure I'm
not as cool as some of the other
Trinity's just because i'm not i'm not
using nodejs or something else but you
know people i don't know basically
there's going to be that hype level
 that is going to get in the way
of anybody and it actually it benefits
younger people like i said before
because they're fresh out of school they
don't have a whole lot of they don't
have decades worth of knowledge and
experience that you know tell them to do
things a certain way and then all of a
sudden that network changing her mind
and doing things another way for
instance jsx and mpj has talked about
this on his channel if you check it out
fun fun function when he talked about
jsx like i literally laughed my ass off
because it was exactly the way I thought
about it like when i looked at j sx i
said why in the hell are we when we were
told forever that we separate our
concerns we separate our JavaScript from
our HTML and we don't combine those into
one thing but jsx is all about building
reusable components to build these
components and some of it has baked in
obviously the JavaScript functionality
CSS and the HTML and you're using it
miss j sx weird xmltype HTML type syntax
and he said he's like I hated jsx and I
felt the same way I hate it I was like I
the first time I tried to use it for
like a week and I put it down and
discuss it was even week probably but I
just I basically said this i'm done
with it and and i started writing
reacting and actual javascript and like
trying to do everything without looking
at their jsx documentation because it
didn't apply to the JavaScript side
would be using the tool sometimes the
right JJ SXRD and then figure out how
was compiling down the javascript so i
can just write the javascript myself and
eventually I'm like man I'm creating way
too much work for myself because this
isn't worth it so I ended up going back
to j sx like a couple months later and I
hated it again and I threw it away after
a while and I said I just can't do this
in fact I think I even ditched react all
together because I hated jsx so much and
then it was again a few months after
that I ended up getting back in the j sx
and for some reason something
clicked and you know how do I been doing
it you know daily for my my job or
something like that then it would have
clicked a lot sooner but you know when
you're tired you've been working all day
you're working on some sort of side
project at home and you're just trying
to play around and get things working
you don't want to spend near your time
you know ramming your head into a wall
trying to figure something out after a
long day you know I'm trying to play
basically so with that said you know I
feel like if I would have been doing it
at work I'm going to learn that a lot
quicker but basically things started
clicking I realized you know the
benefits of jsx an hour I actually like
it I like writing in HTML or writing my
HTML using jsx and and reacting it's a
cool thing and it doesn't it doesn't
take me being a younger guy to be able
to figure that out and I actually know
some older people that do use react as
well so that's a excuse we've
seen mark zuckerberg you know go out on
a limb and say that younger people are
just smarter and granted some young
people are smarter than some old people
and some old people are smarter than
younger people and it doesn't matter
what your color is but your races or
your religion or anything I mean
sometimes really I think the most the
biggest thing is determination and i'll
give you a side example real quick of
just something that most of us will
never be so the Elm programming language
is a functional language so it's a
completely new language in fact I never
even written written anything in Elam so
I don't know much about it but here's
this Evan complete ski kid and if you
look at his LinkedIn he's open source
engineer and no red ink which is like a
elearning platform and he hasn't been
there very long but obviously you can go
anywhere he wants because he was at
Prezi before where he was actually
building this Elm programming language
but he did some stuff at Google work for
Microsoft went to Harvard created his
own functional programming language why
am i bringing him up well there are
geniuses out there right when I'm when
I'm time was just getting started in his
general theory of relativity it was a
relatively young man working at the
Patent Office when he wrote all that
stuff which ended up you know being
determined to be true you know later on
I'm not sure how long after he actually
wrote it that it was determined to be
true and he actually became you know
worldwide famous but
I know by the time he became famous it
was for stuff that he did earlier in his
life and he did stuff after that too but
there's are there are examples of people
that have done things that are great
later on in life and but a good majority
of people that are like this kid I I
don't think that I in fact I know for a
fact that I'm not like him and I don't
think that most people are I really feel
like I'm not going out on a limb by
saying that that and I'm not trying to
be discouraging anybody else but I
really feel like there are going to be
certain people out there that that just
might have you know this brawl genius at
you know that there's somewhat born with
to some extent now you can build
yourself up to be good in anything and
here's the good news though is that nit
you don't have to be this kid because if
you look at some of the best programmers
some of the smartest people in the world
and IT they weren't the ones that became
billionaires starting their own
companies that you know there's being
that you can have a combination of being
relatively good at IT and being a very
good businessman and being very very
successful I say man or woman most of my
audiences males but that you know that's
it so you could have you could have that
mentality you could have it just a
little bit I tea and a lot of business
or a lot of business or you know a lot
of IT and a little bit of business and
you can find success in all kinds of
things that you do so are we going to be
out of a job at 40 no i don't i really
don't think so i hope not that would
suck I mean I I guess I hope that this
YouTube thing really does take off
because then if that happens I can be
like well least I have YouTube and I
could be a a what a saint or a something
for you guys to plead your case against
employers maybe we could start like a
worldwide class-action lawsuit against
every corporation in America that
discriminates that's a joke but the
point is I really think that if people
don't just sit back and you know work
within the same technology all the time
like you should be out trying to educate
yourself I can see already that a lot of
companies they don't want to have to
spend a ton of money educating their
associates they want their associates to
be interest
didn't programming and out their
learning and to be to me it seems like
why wouldn't you want that as one of the
you know the biggest qualifiers
regardless of age if this person is out
there and they're writing code and they
have projects they're all over the place
using stuff that they're not getting
paid to do and and then they have a
natural liking for programming and stuff
like that why wouldn't you want somebody
working for you like that i don't i
don't know i mean but I you know without
a degree I guess I mean is what I'm
saying because it would seem to me like
if I were hiring from my level of
experience that I would want to make
sure that somebody is actually
interested in programming and that I
don't have to tell them how to do
everything that they can you know learn
on their own but what do you guys think
man I'm opening this up to you let me
know if anybody's in the crew in the
field right now that is over 40 let me
know I work with quite a bit of people
that are more than 40 years old and a
lot of them are really good programmers
so I'm not sure how true that is I think
it's definitely true in Silicon Valley
but I don't think silicon valley runs
the majority of what you know what our
business products are and in the world
alright guys thanks have a good night
