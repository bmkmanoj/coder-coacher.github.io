problems with getting started with react
that I think is the JavaScript fatigue
because of all the stuff you have to do
to get it set up like you have to deal
with number one which version of react
you want to use you have to deal with
like what do you want to use like roll
up or webpack you want to use with high
one or do you want to use webpack - what
about like DVD use Babel and if you're
getting babbling use you know all the
configurations are getting Babel the
right version like yeah convert react
es6 and the 2015 also you know there's
just there's a lot to think about any
sort of a little bit like well everybody
is in redox form of X with reactant and
for all those reasons man it's it's a
real pain to get started but there is a
creative react app project that I think
is it's pretty good for making things a
lot more simple for people in some
degree and at the same time it's just
kind of covering up some of those
complexities but those complexities are
still there and and I think I'm kind of
like I have mixed opinions on whether or
not one should should need to know all
of those inner workings versus not
knowing them when I compare something
like reiax ecosystem and the JavaScript
ecosystem of today and you compare that
to like Python and Django there's a lot
of inner workings with Django or Ruby on
Rails a lot of things going on in that
core library that we don't really
understand but at the same time they're
very stable and they don't change all
that often so it's like we don't really
have to concern ourselves with the inner
workings it seems like as much but the
problem with javascript in es6 and you
know the modern-day react in angular 2
and everything is it all moves so fast
so without understanding some of those
core architectures like where things are
just moving all the time like look at
react router therefore 4.0 came out
broke a bunch of stuff in earlier
versions for dunno I mean react router
having been around for very long to
begin with in like it just things move
so quickly that it's like you kind of in
a way you're better off understanding
those core components and building it
yourself and going through
headaches but let me go ahead and just
show you if you were quickly just trying
to prototype something out and just you
know to quickly get started with react I
think create a react app is probably a
pretty good idea so in this video let me
go ahead and show you what we're going
to do here I'm going to projects
tutorials and we're going to go into
create react alright and then inside
here I'm going to CD into here sandy
we're going to npm install some you have
to have node installed MDM create react
just going to go through it and install
all right now we're going to rent run
the out create react app app there's no
underscores create react app alright
there we go alright so this is going to
actually do all the hard work of
creating the react app for us quite a
bit that it's going to download norton
everything although it does a very good
job of disguising all that i'm going to
open up my visual studio editor visual
studio code and do a new window and then
i'm going to open up a location Torrio's
clear-rite and we're going to open up
into that app alright so here's on what
was created for us in the project now
what's interesting to note is if we look
inside the source you can see that as
app dot CSS fjs this is like the core
app of the project
it even has test case so if you ever
wanted to unit test your code that's
another thing that's a real monster to
set up on your own especially after the
fact here is index FCS so you can see
that there's their CSS files that are
being associated with the apps that they
belong to so it allows the web component
based system of react to have confined
CSS so there's no possibility of
conflicts that's both good and bad as
well and I'll probably touch
that in another video but then you have
the actual index this is where it's
using react on reactant was split off of
the reality project because react
started getting into react native and
react VR and react Dom was all about how
the virtual Dom is created and even that
is actually undergoing a major change
with something called react fibre and I
plan on talking about that another video
as well but that is what react DOM is
that dipping engine it's the virtual Dom
that makes up react in your browser ok
so here you can see we just basically
have ok react on render this root
element
this is a basic node.js application and
let's go ahead and just show the
examples I'm going to go to where we
have this application another thing to
it that's using yarn which is the new
kid on the block for the package manager
instead of just NPM so number to fit a
VM start and we're going to have a
problem and the reason why is because
I'm not in my actual app folder from in
my app folder and I'm going to say I'm
game start alright so now you can see
starting to development server it
actually launches a browser for whatever
reason I don't know why being just
changed their thing so they think that I
want to be I want to use them and I
don't anyway so here's the react
application so here this is all using
the virtual Dom if we look at this we
look at the elements inside of here
these are there's the root so everything
inside the root you can see this data
react stuff this is all this is all the
rendered via JSX and react and
everything so it's pretty cool that
you're able to get something up and
running very fast so a lot of people
think oh you know let me just go ahead
and change something real quick and then
show you another thing that's so that's
pretty cool about this if I go in and I
go to like let's see we're going to
change this and you say
subscribe to screw and we change this
and now I don't even have to I don't
have to restore you can see subscribe to
curse hogs so anyway yeah I was going to
do another facility example but that you
can see what I'm talking about here it
actually is listening for the changes
its rear ending so that's it that's a
big head of headache as well because a
lot of times you have to restart your
server and stuff like that or you can
use no daman now so it's probably a
great way like I said to just get
started with react start building your
JSX components there's really no better
way to start with react now if you're
going to build something and you're
serious about using react I think you
need to go on your own instead of your
entire environment you can actually
follow some of the tutorials that I have
on it how to give webpack and babble all
working together I am going to be making
an updated tutorial video though because
things have changed
surprise surprise like things were
changed things are a little bit easier
now compared to the video I did like six
months ago on how to set all that stuff
up so my new video I think it is going
to be much more concise about how to get
your own environment set up so there's
no crazy going on you don't
understand another thing too is I do
want to talk about the CSS modules these
are essentially CSS files that are being
imported
these aren't CSS modules so to speak CSS
modules don't actually work I think I
call them CSS modules sorry these aren't
technically CSS modules they don't work
with create a react out but that's
probably good because I actually have
some major question marks about using
those in the first place but let's not
worry about that right now with let me
go ahead and just explain how this thing
is actually hiding some of the
complexities of the project because it's
not doing anything magical here this
package.json you're like wow how does
this project work link all it needs is
react and react Dom and all it has is a
dependency called react scripts and then
it's like oh and then these are all the
scripts that I can do like start to
start my server build so I can deploy it
so I can test my code eject I don't know
what the hell that does probably like
sluggish it out of the room or something
anyway you can see that like you're like
damn this thing is like very very
concise but what is this react scripts
Oh Deb dependencies let's figure that
out react scripts as many as I need node
modules and you're like where the hell
did all these node modules come from did
these two dependencies alone bring in
all this stuff well it may have but it's
more likely to react scripted so let's
go ahead and take a look then there's a
lot in here man all right here it is
react scripts and we look inside node
money or this time we're going to know
module let's look at its
package.json I think you're like oh
look at all this stuff what is all this
dependencies look at all these
dependencies look at all those
dependencies you'd have to individually
install all that out of this
project up and running the way that they
have it so very it's a very opinionated
project on how react should be run the
only issue with it being so opinionated
like I said it's because things change
so fast that if one of these projects
updates like react router did just
couple weeks ago and it breaks
everything you're not you're going to be
like I have no idea where to start
because you didn't assemble all this
stuff you didn't decide what goes in and
what goes out and that's a problem
because of this fast-moving ecosystem
and the reason why like I said I I would
would be your costume you guys about
that maybe you don't need half this
stuff you know it's it's your own
project so that is the magic of how
react create a rack react app is
actually working on it hides all that
complexity and a react scripts project
and then that gets brought in it brings
all the dependencies with it it does
very good job and keep anything simple
for people but the truth is it's not
simple at all so definitely if you're
getting started with a reactor I fully
recommend it there's really three
options out there there's reactors
angular and then
view and I think from what I've seen so
far angular2 still has a good following
because of the angular 1 height but a
lot of people still you know have you
know they don't want to learn typescript
react you can use typescript with it as
well
I'm just like an angular but react does
a very good job at creating a component
based system which is what the web has
been looking for for a long time so I
think we're going to continue to see
react jobs and things spring up I get
contacted all the time by companies
looking for react developers so it's a
very lucrative market right now
especially if you're at nubian Union you
learn react and you go out there and you
say yeah you know what I don't have a
degree but I am a kick-ass react
developer you're going to get hired
somewhere there there's no question
because they're the companies want to
use they want to use this and there's
just not enough real talent that truly
understands what they're doing with it
alright guys so that is about thanks for
