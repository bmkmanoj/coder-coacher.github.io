occurred to me recently and really
hasn't it's not recent but I noticed in
life man especially when it comes to
programming languages a lot of people
equate it to religion and the reason why
I feel like programming languages and
which ones are people's favorites are
such a hot topic is because nobody wants
to think that they've wasted their life
or that their time and because time is
like one of the only things that we
can't ever get more of no matter how
much money you have or how much power
you have in some cases I suppose money
can prolong your life if you're able to
buy organs and things like that but you
know for the most part we don't get we
get our a lot of time and we don't know
how long that is so the things that we
choose to do with that time is very very
you know important to us so if we chose
to spend thousands of hours learning to
program and Python over c-sharp then you
know we want to think that that Python
is just as good at c-sharp and we're
gonna make any sort of argument that we
possibly can and in some cases we know
that the arguments are false because you
know we we know that if we
enough people we can you know continue
to say that something is you know just
as good as something else and you know
because we know our livelihoods depend
upon it so if you're like a senior C C
sharp or a senior Python guy then you
know you know the inner workings of that
language and you're expected to be able
to earn a hundred and twenty thousand
dollar your salary so nobody wants to
pay you 120 thousand dollars a year if
they can pay some college kid you know
forty thousand to do the same job
essentially and probably even be able to
do it better than you can in some cases
so if you're a true to truly earn that
hundred and twenty thousand dollar a
year salary which isn't you know it's
not impossible or anything I'm not
trying to say that it is but you have to
be very very good at whatever it is
you're doing so you know typically we
all get better as programmers the more
we program but in order to really be
like a truly like a you know c-sharp
architect or something like that you you
have to know a lot about dotnet a lot
about where it came from a lot about
where it's going in order to be able to
give
good recommendations and things so I
just think that you know we're so
passionate about it because we don't
know what the right answers are and if
we've devoted thousands of hours to a
particular language or a technology Ori
or whatever it could even be you know
gaming or the music that we listen to
we're passionate about the music that we
listen to because we chose as
individuals to listen to that music and
to us it's more personal you know so
when you play a song from some band that
that somebody else has never heard of
and you make that recommendation like
you don't know what they're gonna like
you know and it's it's really choices
that they've made and in personal
preferences and things like that and I
think that a lot of that has to do with
programming languages as well like for
me I started off in Perl and then went
to Python because I hated Perl but any
first language you learn is going to be
a pain in the ass so whether it's Python
or C sharp or anything it's gonna be a
pain in the ass but once once you get
that down then I mean if you jump from
one language to the next like too
quickly then I just don't feel like
you're ever gonna be this this you know
$120,000 a year expert in a particular
language that's going to demand that
type of salary in fact it's kind of a
problem with the entire I would say IT
programming industry as a whole like a
lot of people you know there's a lot of
discussions about older programmers or
not you're not in the market you know as
much as younger programmers and a lot of
it has to do with just the fact that you
know the market itself has grown
exponentially but in addition to that
you also have the fact that older
programmers are having to learn newer
technologies and an older programmer
that's learning in new york-- technology
they may be a better programmer but if
somebody else can do it for half the
salary and be you know nearly as
sufficient and you know ultimately then
nobody wants to pay that increased price
for the older developer that's a topic
for another story but the point is
though is that I think programming is
you know a religion to certain people
because once again it's something that
we don't get back you know we have to
choose how to spend our time wisely and
we hope that we make the best decisions
possible many of us end up regretting
the decisions that we make because you
know ultimately the decisions we make
now
are gonna affect us down the road the
decision that I made to learn how to
program seven years ago was a good
decision in my opinion I'd let me to
where I'm at now but there was quite a
bit of time and you know if I reflect
back and I think oh well you know maybe
I wasn't as good of a parent or as good
of a husband or as good of an employee
or whatever it may be because of how I
chose to spend my time I think just
naturally we don't we don't want to
accept that even if it is true and and I
think that you know the it's really what
you make of it anyway so if you feel
like you didn't you didn't waste your
time or that you use your time wisely
then then I think that should be good
enough but ultimately whether you listen
to pop country rock whatever it is or
you program in Python or C sharp I mean
you just need to enjoy the ride I think
because none of that stuff and no in
people's opinions aren't really going to
and they shouldn't sway whether or not
you feel like you've lived your life
appropriately and with programming
language is just like anything else it's
a it's a major devotion of time and I
don't really think that there's any
wrong answer there so you know if you
guys like PHP go ahead and by all means
do it I won't recommend it but at the
same time I've also said I wouldn't you
know try to dissuade somebody from using
it either so anyway those are just my
thoughts today that religion music all
these things are just personal choices
to us and they mean a lot to us because
of you know the one thing that we don't
ever have more of and that's time and we
want to make sure that we're using it
wisely
alright guys thanks for watching please
subscribe and please like the video
thank you bye hey guys so I just want to
take a moment to give a shout out to my
sponsor Deb mountain coding boot camp
make sure you guys check out their
website we've talked a lot about whether
or not the college degree is worthwhile
and people have asked me that and you
probably shouldn't even be asking me
that because I don't know that anybody
has the answer to that but I can tell
you that with the technologies that are
being taught in school and typically you
know for $100,000 four-year universities
you know people are finding as they come
out that they're not really ready for
the IT world and that they're actually
learning a lot more from within the the
workforce and that's probably the case
with
of things but with IT it's even more so
because technology changes so fast so
with coding boot camps like to have
mountains they few technologies that
you're gonna use right away in the job
force and the idea is to get you into
the industry as soon as possible they're
gonna use stuff that's like that is
being used everywhere even things like
jQuery where you might be hearing you
know a ton about this or that or I mean
they're gonna be teaching a lot of this
and that that is you know of right now
but also a lot of what is being used in
the workforce so they're their entire
goal is to get you into the workforce as
soon as you complete the program so make
sure you check out the description links
that I provide in there for Deb Mountain
for all my videos they have the links in
the description alright guys thanks for
watching and please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
