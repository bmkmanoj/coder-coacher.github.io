what's up all right welcome to the
newest tutorial we're going to do we're
going to be messing with the mono game
the gaming framework for Windows Linux
Apple Android whatever it works on
everything so it may take a little bit
tweaking for each game but it's
definitely one of the top gaming
platforms out there right now probably
would like unity it's completely open
source so it's free to use and there
have been some popular games made on it
including Fez spelled Fe Z so that had
some decent potential behind it so what
we're going to go is mono game net so
that we can go ahead and download the
the installer it comes with so just
click on downloads and then there should
be so you should have visual studio
hopefully you do if you have a Windows
operating system and that's actually
with these tutorials based on is going
to be for visual studio so if not you're
going to probably need to use this
monodevelop for linux or mac but anyway
let's go ahead and see here so this is
the installer do you want to grab it
should be able to do everything for you
and since i have visual studio i'm going
to do the recommended download here
and I'm glad I sipping my coffee still
pretty early where I'm at right now I'm
in virginia in the united states and
it's about 10 so i guess it's not that
early but i just woke up not that long
ago decided i was going to try to
program some games so yeah it would be
interesting
right so
so for right now not a hundred percent
familiar with the mono game platform it
obviously doesn't have this pre-selected
so I'm going to go ahead and just go
with the recommended install we could
always add additional features later on
alright and that's it now that the mono
game is installed on your computer
system the next video we're going to go
ahead and start playing with the
framework alright thanks for watching
please subscribe thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
