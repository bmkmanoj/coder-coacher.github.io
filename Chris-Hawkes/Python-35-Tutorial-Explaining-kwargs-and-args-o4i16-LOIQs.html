this video we want to look at the Ark's
keyword in Python and how we use that in
object-oriented programming and not just
with object-oriented programming it can
really be used with any sort of method
and Python and the method doesn't have
to be constricted to a class but in
object when you're so if we go ahead and
let's create a method attached to our c
class and we'll just call this args
example that's in a reference self and
then the second argument that you're
gonna pass in is gonna be the keyword
ARBs and it's gonna actually have the
star character in it and that's really
just convention so it's it's kind of
like syntactic sugar but you don't
actually have to actually call it it
could be like keyword args or k arms but
you probably just want to get into habit
since it's like the the pythonic way of
doing star arms and what that allows you
to do is just be able to pass in an
arbitrary number of arguments so you
could think of it as almost like a list
container where you can pass it a
million arguments or a thousand
arguments or five or two or whatever it
may be and this method obviously is
going to be you know some sort of a loop
over top of that arcs to be able to
print it out so essentially you would
just do like a simple loop like for R
and arms and then one of the funny
things you need to keep in mind is that
you don't actually reference the args by
using the star character that's actually
not proper it won't work so just simply
say args which is their name of this
without this star a special keyword
there and then we can just say like
print argh
so now in order to be able to use this I
can go down to my object and then make a
call to that method the arts example and
then this is test one
two three so you can see this is just a
arbitrary number of arguments that I've
passed and I didn't have to have the
method be smart enough to take in four
strings that are being passed to it it
just has one parameter that basically
says I can handle whatever you throw at
me so if we run this you can see that it
printed out the arbitrary number of
arguments that were passed to it now the
other thing that you guys are gonna run
into whenever you're doing a lot of
object-oriented programming in Python is
the keyword args and what that is is its
name value arguments and it can be once
again an arbitrary length of name value
arguments pass into a method and the
method would still be able to operate
under those circumstances so let's
create a new method under the same class
that's gonna be keyword args example and
then this the standard is to do star
star kwargs which is keyword orgs and
down here we could just say for name
value and orgs dot items and then we
could say print and we haven't really
touched on this part in fact let me not
do that so we haven't really touched on
actually I do not remember if we touched
on this string formatting we might as
well go ahead and touch it here so in
Python you have an ability to format
your string by passing in arguments on
the fly so you can see inside the curly
braces here as a number this is going to
be the first argument since we start
counting at 0 so that's 0 so that's the
first argument and then here is the
second argument and then we're going to
say dot format and then you pass in the
first and second argument that the thing
needs so this could go on for like you
know we could have more arguments if we
had more to provide but we obviously
don't
so you can see first argument second
argument first argument second argument
and you could have a third and a fourth
and a fifth if that's what it calls for
but in this case it's just name value
because what this really is is an
arbitrary length dictionary so
dictionary if you remember is a key and
then the value you look up by key to get
the value and it's helpful because you
could just you could pass it things so
let's go ahead and do that now so let me
move this up and we'll say my object
keyboard args example and then here I
can just simply say like and equals
Bayside origin okay
origin equals New York
I mean if I go ahead and run this you
can see that we get banned equals
Bayside origin equals New York and it
could be any sort of you know this could
be an unlimited number of key value
arguments that are passed to this method
so hopefully that makes sense you guys
might have to play with that to let that
sink in a little bit it's a it's one of
the more I would say advanced features
possibly at least a little bit more
cryptic when it comes to Python Python
is pretty straightforward about
everything it's doing for you I think
the kid the keyword arguments is I don't
know I find it a little bit cryptic it's
not like it's difficult once you grasp
it but it's still something I think it's
just kind of an oddball thing to be
honest with you anyway guys thanks for
watching have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
