deaf mountain coding bootcamp if you
guys are thinking about going to a boot
camp make sure you guys check them out
the link is in the description tab below
they sponsored this video in this
channel thank you hey guys what's up so
in this video I'm just sitting outside
because it's a beautiful day right now
and it's just better to be outside on a
day like this in this video I'm
answering a question somebody asked me
why did I choose net over Java most
specifically is asking about c-sharp
over Java and the chance for that
question I've always gone where the jobs
are and I always recommend you guys do
the same thing I've never chosen the
technology or language or anything over
top of another I may not want to learn
angular right now but like if I were
paid to write angular I would learn
angular and I would I would write
angular or no problem it's not like I'm
gonna choose a job that is in react just
because I like react a little bit better
than angular I really think that we
should try to get away from that because
especially with today's with today's day
and age with our like web technology
changing we can't seem to even like
agree on standards for more than just a
couple months before we're rewriting
everything and I just I feel like with
that instability like more importantly
than ever like we can't define ourselves
this a Java developer or a c-sharp
developer or hell even a.net developer
you know it's like I think I think we
need to be opening up into as many we
need to expand our horizons as often as
we possibly can really and and that's
ultimately what I've done I mean I've
written Python now for eight years and
have never once been professionally paid
by another company to write Python
beyond like you know poke deals or
tutorials and things like that that I
guess you could say that I've made money
on Python but like I've never had a
check where I was writing Python code
for a company I think that like we never
want to like pigeonhole ourselves into
just in one particular technology so
that would be my advice for sure
I will say the one exception to that
probably is that both c-sharp and Java
are so ingrained in the the IT
infrastructure of really the United
States UK Europe and everything I don't
think it's gonna go anywhere anytime
soon like and when I say anytime soon
probably within our entire career so I
think there's gonna be C sharp
developers and Java developers 20 years
from now I guarantee it and maybe
they're like you know what modern-day
cobalt developers are like now that
could be a possibility but I really
think that that both of them are going
to be around for a long time so if you
were gonna really choose a technology
and like really try to become an expert
in that I would definitely pick one of
the larger ones that really aren't going
anywhere like C++ Java C sharp I would
probably even do that over Python like
Python is great but Python is a
dynamically interpreted duck typed
language like it's never going to
compete with a statically typed language
like C C++ or even c-sharp or Java
they're gonna have different they're
gonna they're gonna excel in different
areas and like for that reason though
well really Python excels in and just
rapid development you can develop stuff
very quickly with Python but that's
probably it's its biggest benefit it's
just simply that it's easier to use it's
not gonna be faster like a lot of people
think Python it's so fast and it is fast
like to a human mind it's gonna process
data like a million times faster than
human code but but it's still it's like
probably thousands of times slower than
something like C++ a lot of times you'll
see these bare bone like stopwatch
examples of different languages and
trying to figure out which one's faster
than the other and stuff like that and
they'll say Python served all these
different requests you know it's so many
requests per second or per minute or
whatever and compare that to like a seat
C++ or a c-sharp or whatever the fact
that matter is though is like properly
written code and c-sharp versus Python
is gonna be faster and c-sharp because
it's a statically typed language python
is not it's dynamically interpreted it's
just never going to compete on speed and
stuff like that what is my point behind
all that my point is that Python is cool
there are jobs in Python for me on the
east coast of the United States there
are far more
jobs in Java and c-sharp then there are
in Python and that's probably why I've
never actually been paid to write Python
professionally because there just are
not as many opportunities around me and
I think that that's the case probably in
most areas Silicon Valley probably has a
lot of opportunity for Python but anyway
my point is pick if you're going to try
to be a master in one language
definitely pick something like Java or C
sharp probably you can pick Python but
so go over the jobs are guys I'll talk
to you later and have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
