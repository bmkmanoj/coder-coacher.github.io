neighbor lady yesterday and she was
talking about the Zika virus how in the
United States that we've now have four
confirmed cases in the miami-dade area
which is unusual just because well it's
not unusual but it's it's the first time
it's significant because even though
there's 1,800 cases in the United States
maybe it's all been travel related so
these apparently are the first four
cases that have not been either travel
related or sexually transmitted so that
means that they're getting in from the
mosquitoes that are passing this thing
around which is a pretty messed up
situation because obviously it causes
birth defects and everything and I don't
think they know a lot about the virus
but she mentioned something that a lot
of her friends had been talking about
getting these bat boxes and I never even
had heard of it before but apparently
I'm sure enough on Amazon like they have
these boxes that you put up in your
backyard or on the side of your house
and like bats actually live inside of
them so at first I mean I'm thinking you
know people are probably like bats are
gross and all this stuff but I'm in
Virginia the bats aren't the kind of
bats that you see like or that you hear
about the vampire bats that come down on
top of you when you're sleeping in South
America and start drinking your blood
and all that stuff so you know these are
just fruit bats but apparently they
actually eat a lot of insects and keep
the mosquito populations down so I've
actually shot videos in my backyard in
Virginia Virginia and the mosquitos are
just ridiculous back there not that I'm
saying I'm worried about Zika because
honestly I can't say them I'm worried
about it at all or anything but I
thought it was interesting because
basically the people will find a niche
and almost anything and the point of
this video is just simply that you have
to keep your eyes and ears open to the
streets in order to be able to try to
recognize newer trends newer patterns
an example of that is I if you look at
like Palmer Luckey who was 19 years old
and Kickstarter was the craze a few
years ago everybody was talking about
crowdfunding the United States Congress
was talking about the jumpstart our
small businesses Act which essentially
allows investors like average Joe
average joe's to be able to take their
money
lessons and startups and on businesses
and that's traditionally reserved for
people that are considered to be ultra
wealthy angel investors and things like
that and we've talked about that at
length where you know in some ways it's
unfair that they're able to pour in
millions of their dollars make you know
sometimes you know ten times over what
they you know had initially invested in
some sort of company that may or may not
ever be profitable but they walk out
with tons and and who's left holding the
bag it's the you know the the common
shareholders and the actual employees of
the company if it goes under but we've
seen that so many times with tech
companies that don't make any revenue
don't make any profit but they're still
worth it you know so much money usually
the angel investors are the ones that
end up walking out without you know the
loss but with that said you know this
this whole Kickstarter crazy and Palmer
Luckey goes to Kickstarter he raises
several million dollars for his oculus
rift that he was developing inside the
grunt his garage and I don't know a ton
about this guy's story but I do know
that and eventually I went in just a
couple years he sold it to Facebook for
several billion and that seemed to me to
kick off this whole virtual reality
crate so now we have you know virtual
reality everywhere and it's it's a it's
a good thing like this this virtual
reality it's just a cheap oculus one
that came with the Sony f7 the Samsung
Galaxy phone you can get you know for
$100 that's actually it's very cheap
compared to the regular oculus but your
phone I'm not sure if you guys are
probably seeing if your phone actually
plugs in there and it's able to do you
know using the oculus technology and
actually it's pretty legit I mean but
when I when I use the actual games it
seems like I'm taking a step back into
the 1980s because even at 34 you know I
feel old saying this but I can remember
back in the late 80s and early 90s when
you know we had like the Nintendo Power
glove and we had this running mat for
the Nintendo that we played the
track-and-field games on and you could
gain the system so instead of running on
the pad you could actually just kind of
tap your feet and major guy look like he
was going super fast but you know when
that stuff came out people that always a
game changer this way all of our
entertainments going to be and then it
didn't really quite pan out so it took a
long time for
the wheat you to come out and that was
you know the whole motion thing was you
know a big craze there and then you know
that leads into obviously in fact I
would say still Wii U is probably the
most significant in that regard because
if you look like the PlayStation Move
and the connects and all that stuff or
is I don't remember what the Xbox one is
I'm a PlayStation guy but you know
they're not really impressive in my book
I mean I don't I don't think they're
really impressive but when you put on
one of these these headsets you can see
that it is truly you know the start of
something really good so even though the
games like pretty much suck real bad the
mechanics are terrible the graphics just
all clunky and everything but you can
tell it's the start of something big but
Palmer Luckey was able to you know use
something that was up-and-coming you
know this Kickstarter thing was
Kickstarter had only been around for a
short time when he was able to go to it
so you know and you know these things
they they just come along you can jump
in at the right time like a lot of
people are trying to jump on YouTube
because you know they heard about Buddha
pie or PewDiePie or whatever his name is
you know making 14 million dollars a
year on YouTube so everybody now wants
to be a YouTube star and you know with
that guy like he's literally getting
billions of views I'd probably like a
month and then maybe not month probably
a year I don't know what his views are
bees have a ridiculous amount of videos
in fact even markiplier who has last
time I checked like 12 million
subscribers I mean I saw one video that
he posted and within like two hours he
had like 50,000 comments I mean you
can't even possibly read through that
many comments there's just so you know
for you know these these select few
people sometimes dictate what these
trends are going to be so let people see
success from you know certain people and
they want to they want to you know copy
and their footsteps and I think a lot of
people end up spending a lot of time
like copying something and so you know
jumping in at the right time so you
always need to evaluate okay is you know
I'm keeping my ear ears and eyes open
and you know there's this new trend or
whatever but by the time you're hearing
about it a lot it might be too late so
I'm not saying don't try I'm just simply
saying that you know you're gonna end up
spinning your wheels on a lot of
different things
and you'll gain experience along the way
one of the experiences I gained through
starting the new movies website is that
I realized being a programmer is pretty
awesome because there's nothing that we
can't do like we can create a copycat
company or you know our own product
because we can pretty much be single
person operations I mean if you can if
you know enough about database and
setting up your servers and website
development and stuff like that you can
get a web presence and compete with some
of the best so like what new movies you
know I quickly realized that it was a
great learning experience from the tech
perspective but it was also very good
business learning experience too because
I realized if you're gonna do like a
content type site you have to be truly
passionate about what you're talking
about and I never really had that type
of passion for a field like that but
like if you look at you know the reason
why I've even had any sort of success on
this YouTube channel is because it's
actually a passion of mine I truly do
have a programming and learning passion
I like to talk about technology I like
to talk about business and how that
pertains to technology and IT and and I
think it's um one reason why I've even
found any success here but it could be
also because I started three and a half
years ago so if somebody was going to
start a tech channel now it might be a
little bit harder for them than it was
for me three and a half years ago and
for people that did hit three and a half
years before I did it you know they they
have a much much bigger leg up on me as
well so it all depends like on timing I
think timing has a lot to do with with
what you can jump into but one of the
great things like I said about being a
programmer is that even if you're
jumping in late you always have the
ability to innovate to the point where
you can take it to the next level you
can build a greater user experience you
can you know your own interesting niche
to something also being a relatively
small operation you have the ability to
change on the fly if you look at
companies like Microsoft or even Google
now it's very difficult for companies to
change their traction companies are
using legacy systems from decades ago
because it's so much of an effort for
them to be able to transfer over to
newer tech and things like that but if
you're a you know a single developer
that's coming up
idea you can go right to you know some
cloud stack whether it's AWS or Azure or
something like that and maybe IMDB is
still on mainframe systems I'm sure that
they're there I don't even think about
it mainframe but basically they're you
know they could be on you know older
technology they could have a bunch of
code written in Perl or something like
that that you know needs to be revamped
but they just don't have enough time and
you know so they had piecemeal
approaches and like you could design
your entire site and what it would take
for them to spend millions of dollars to
be able to change just certain tiny
things about how they're out there
website works so that is an advantage
and programming and especially when
you're doing it like you know you're you
know just a single single person
operation but even greater than that
it's awesome because you have the
ability to get into all these different
fields so if you wanted to actually try
to cure the Zika or raise awareness or
like you know help starving children in
Africa or even just be you know a
Content marketer or something like that
you can do whatever you want you can
jump in all kinds of different fields I
mean you could be an insurance or
banking and then move yourself into
missile defense systems and you just
never know where it's gonna lead you
because it's IT is wrapped in almost
everything that we do nowadays so I
think it's it's truly an awesome field
there are some negatives obviously but
this video doesn't focus on the
negatives and that's really all I got to
say today so the the bat boxes I thought
was an interesting thing because I was
like obviously somebody you know jumped
on this this bat craze and maybe it's
been around for a long time but all I
know is that it really took the Zika
virus for people to start talking about
bat boxes that they put inside their
backyard to control mosquito populations
so you never know where things are
headed I'm just you know I try to make
sure you're jumping on those trends out
of you if you do have the opportunity
alright guys thanks for watching over
the game bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
