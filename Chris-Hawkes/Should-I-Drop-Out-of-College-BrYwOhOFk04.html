wanted to take a quick moment I actually
found something that was pretty cool I
thought was from Elon Musk I'm actually
commenting on whether or not he feels
like a college degree is important
because a lot of you guys are interested
in that so in this video though here he
addresses whether or not a college
degree is actually necessary it's it's
it there's no need even to have a
college degree
at all we're in high school I mean if
somebody graduated from a great
university that may be an indignity an
indication that they will be capable of
great things but it's not necessarily
the case you know if you look at say
people like Bill Gates for Larry Ellison
Steve Jobs these guys didn't graduate
from college so clearly you know
somebody is successful as Elon Musk but
he acknowledges that there's a lot of
people in his field
you know innovators and everything else
that that have actually done great
things that happen didn't have a college
degree so I bring that up and everyone
is cool to hear from somebody like Elon
Musk who is successful as he is like I
said but then it comes like well
basically it's like well why don't you
put your money where your mouth is in
some sense and I don't know that this is
necessarily something that's like
against Elon Musk but he's one of the
most looked up to like people probably
in the programming you know industry
really when it comes to especially like
younger developers I would say like I
worked with a younger developer is
really smart but you know he really
looks up to people like a Elon Musk and
Mark Zuckerberg like he wouldn't wants
nothing more than to like work on the
west coast and in Silicon Valley working
for something like Facebook and to me I
feel like as I get older like I mean I I
think what they've done is great but
like I think my aspirations are a little
bit different where I just want to I
want to create my own things I guess
like I don't have as much of a want or a
need to work for like a Google or a
Facebook or something like that
so really the entire thought of even
working at a place like that is not it
like completely turns me off to the idea
all together right I think it'd be cool
to make Google money work on the west
coast you know maybe it'd be a Google
millionaire I don't know but I would
imagine the amount of work that Google
is trying to get out of you and and you
know the amount of competitiveness with
all the newer people bring brought in
like I would probably think that's a
nightmare but I could be wrong I really
could be wrong but the reason why I'm
you know I feel like you know I must
might want to put his money where his
mouth is is because of like SpaceX a and
there may be some sort of maybe
government stipulations because I'm
assuming SpaceX works with NASA maybe on
the technologies on the rocket launches
on like delivering payloads to the
International Space Center and all this
stuff so maybe there are like there are
implications or there are there's
criteria that is put in place by the US
government to say hey if you want these
contracts or whatever that you're gonna
have to hire people that have a college
degree why do I mention that because
position after position if you look at
all of these engineering positions
within SpaceX pretty much every position
here is saying basic qualifications
bachelor's degree in computer science or
any other engineering and this is for a
full-stack developer like some of the
best full-stack developers I've ever
worked with didn't go to college at all
let alone for computer science so but if
you look at like SpaceX it's just it's
just one after another and they all
require a bachelor's degree and it
regardless of what the position is even
if you're writing basic like c-sharp or
sequel code they're asking for a college
degree so my big question with that is
designs like well Alon if you have that
if you have that opinion then why is
like one of the companies that you fully
own like you fully owned SpaceX so why
is one of the companies that he fully
owns using you know startup technology
like you know Python and then not
allowing people that don't have a
college degree so yeah I mean you guys
can answer that for yourselves I mean
III personally think that it must have
something to do with maybe the
contracts or that he doesn't necessarily
think what he's saying there's also a
good comment here to point out he says
I'm in college dropped out as well but I
don't have exceptional ability my life
is by so that is actually why I
tell everybody on my channel to actually
go to college that day I'm thinking
about dropping out on all the and
like I'm always like do go to college
I'm not gonna be I'm not I don't know if
you're gonna end up like this too
because I can tell you that like if he's
truly because he didn't finish
school then like that is something that
you know you probably should have
finished school why you know I don't
know like people drop out because they
have going for them like like
obviously Steve Jobs like I mean look at
the Larry Ellison I believe he spent one
semester at University of Chicago I
think his mother like his adopted mother
died or something and then he he ended
up dropping out but like he had business
partners he had acquaintances that like
he saw the writing on the wall and the
opportunities over there you can't just
be like hey I'm living in my mom's
basement and I don't have going for
me I don't have any connections and I
don't know even a product that
I'm gonna make and then drop out of
college thinking you're gonna have that
same kind of success that's just being
stupid and probably being crazy and in
in that case like you definitely want to
go to school so I get some of the other
people that are leaving comments as few
as are as as low as a few hours ago they
were talking about like yeah I'm going
to college here I'm going to college
because I'm lazy well that's exactly
right like if you don't have if you
don't have the drive to learn how to do
something and that maybe you don't even
like doing like there are certain things
that we have to learn in computer
science that is not fun like we have to
pull our hair out like trying to figure
out how works and like you just
want to punch the Creator in the face
and like you have to put all that stuff
you have to push all that stuff like
deep down inside and let it all build up
until eventually you explode one day I'm
just kidding but seriously you do have
to learn stuff you don't want to have to
learn especially when you're getting
paid to learn stuff that you don't want
to learn but you have to do that stuff
and if you don't have that drive and you
can only learn inside of a classroom or
somebody's like telling you hey we have
to study this because you're going to
take a test to do this then you know
you're definitely not the type I don't
think - just just for going on
on your own and and you know be able to
get your foot in the industry because if
you do forego college like you're
looking at a more uphill climb to be
able to get your first shot as a
developer so that is something to keep
in mind like if you truly don't have
that drive and that inspiration that
inspiration to build something and and
really be working on it working on your
craft without somebody having to tell
you how to do it or to tell you when to
do it then you know college is most
likely for you so that's my thoughts I
think it's cool that Elon has said you
know as much and I hope that he changes
his position on his company I think
SpaceX even even if it deals with a lot
of like you know they're I'm sure that
there's positions there that they need
advanced mathematics or that there's
liabilities there where it's like hey
you know people's lives are on the line
so if it's something along those lines
then I think that the rules that
surround that type of thing is also
 because like I would imagine
that there's probably some very very
good programmers out there that didn't
go to college that could certainly
contribute to things like the Apollo
program and an even SpaceX or Tesla so
that that is my thoughts I mean I think
the motivation Trump's education as long
as the motivation has you know a decent
amount of I would say of know-how and
smarts as well that they go along with
that but on anyway clearly you know Elan
at least thinks the same way when it
comes to you know what he says verbally
to other people so anyway guys have a
good night bye hey guys so I just want
to take a moment to mention that this
video is sponsored by Jeff mountain
coding boot camp so if you guys are
learning how to program trying to get
your foot into the industry dub mountain
