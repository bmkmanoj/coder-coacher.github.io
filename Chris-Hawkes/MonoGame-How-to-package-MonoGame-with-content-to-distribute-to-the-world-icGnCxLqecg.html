back the last video we created a basic
application with a game that just loads
an image it's a single image there and
what we want to do in this video is to
actually show you how to compile your
application or actually distributed
basically and so we want to publish it
but you're going to notice out of the
box here with our game if we just
right-click and we go to publish it
should work but it doesn't I'll explain
why in here in a second so we'll just
say finish it will publish it to the
public folder once it's done it will
show the folder which it did right there
I don't know why that shortcut is there
and I have two versions of this I'll get
rid of the old one if you look inside
here you're going to see something
that's missing and that is the content
folder there is no content that's a
problem and I'll show you what up with
that here in just a second so when we go
to actually run this thing we will
install and it will end up failing
without any sort of your antivirus is
probably going to run because it's not a
recognized program by your antivirus
company but when this thing does run
here in a second you're going to see it
fails there goes it stops it doesn't
give you any sort of clue as to what
went wrong or anything like that so what
the problem is here is that if you go
into our game and you go into bin and
window is in debug and you'll notice
that in Visual Studio it's actually
compiling and publishing and things and
out of this debug so here's your content
folder and it has the me profile X and B
so number one we need to actually we
need to actually have the actual image
is missing so here's the situation the X
and B file needs the original image in
order to work so the reason why we need
to go over to me profile and you'll see
inside the little properties panel here
you'll see this copy to output directory
and we want to say copy always
alright so now we run this again and
it's in debug mode just game will run no
problem alright so game runs no problem
now when we go to inside the debug going
to go into our content folder and look
at images you're now going to see the
actual jpg image and also the X and B so
let's go ahead and try to publish the
game again and hopefully this will work
or actually publish the content if it
doesn't then there's one other thing
that we need to do I'm not actually here
to see if this actually work with just
that one setting so we go into
application files and we're still going
to have that missing I think it's not
going to work here but one second so
let's try this real quick
ok rni crashed and okay so that was a
slight bit unexpected but one of the
additional steps here they ended up
figuring out earlier was I was kind of
surprised by we need that content inside
the content folder so the bottom line is
that anything that is in content or even
in debug and all that stuff is not being
copied over on the publish and in order
for that to work we just need to right
click on content here and say existing
item and let's go back into our bin
windows debug and look at our content
folder here and we just want to drag the
images into content now when we publish
this thing in fact I'm going to delete
the entire published folder when we go
ahead and publish this thing now it
should actually copy the content over
alright so now we actually have our
content here and you have this me
profile a JPEG that's in there and let's
go ahead see if this works now
alright so now it's working so that is
what you have to do in order to
publisher your game so the first step is
um make sure you have your content
folder there and then you have to get it
out of your debug and just drag those
content folders into your actual game
content and then you can go ahead and
publish it from there there may be other
workarounds but that's the only thing
I've been able to come up with that
works at this point alright guys please
subscribe please vote up and thank you
for watching bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
