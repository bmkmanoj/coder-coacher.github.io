want to talk about webassembly for a
moment and in case you guys have never
heard about it
webassembly is a project that has the
backing of Google Microsoft Facebook and
Apple it was started a couple years ago
as a faster way for for browsers to be
able to run graphics intensive
applications going back about 10 years
ago the browser has implemented a
feature and enabling users to be able to
use their browser to communicate with a
the graphics card directly in order to
compile and run their program so it
allowed for 3d graphics and pretty cool
things you could do inside of a browser
like here's chrome experiments and these
are all just experiments that are using
WebGL so it's using you know the
graphics card directly on your machine
so originally people balked at the idea
because they thought that there were
security concerns
typically javascript is very limited in
to where it has ax or what it has access
to on a user's machine it can't write
files and things like that so it's very
limited but this this opened up the door
so that you could actually like I said
run things within your I'm not going to
use my camera here that's kind of cool
that it uses my camera but anyway so the
problem with WebGL is that you can see
here I have a lot of things running on
my machine but it's still pretty choppy
it's kind of you know it's kind of bad
really I mean some of them look better
than others and depending on the way
they wrote the code it can you know have
an impact on how this stuff gets
displayed like that's a nice one there
but uh anyway so WebGL is it's a it's a
port to the graphics communication which
is OpenGL and OpenGL dates back
literally decades it's a it's a graphics
specification essentially it's a way
that you communicate with graphics but
it's language independent so you're
going to have you're going to write
OpenGL and different programming
languages it's just it's a it's like
it's it's an API basically so
OpenGL goes back WebGL is basically
OpenGL but for the browser here it is 10
years later and there's still not wide
adoption with WebGL so it makes us
wonder like you know what is the future
of this is this ever going to pick up
like we thought it was when are we going
to have virtual reality with our within
our browser so that we can have a
headset attached to our computer and we
can work you know work in 3d or full
virtual reality so those are all I think
on the horizon and really not that far
away but there's a couple roadblocks
number one the WebGL specification or
the API is just not fast enough in order
to be able to do these graphics
intensive things and that's because it's
being run on the JavaScript runtime
which you know even with the chrome v8
engine which is what nodejs is written
in the chrome v8 engine for executing
javascript is extremely fast but it's
just not fast enough not compared to C
or C++ which you find a lot of games
written in and web assembly is hoping to
fix that so is web assembly going to
replace JavaScript the answer to that is
maybe and probably not but I'll explain
in just a moment what it will do at
least what I think so what I think will
happen and if I could step back for just
a moment Google's been working on this
problem for quite some time they had
something called Native Client which
they had been trying to release for
quite a few years actually and the
problem with Native Client is that
immediately it was not it was not
welcomed with open arms by Mozilla
by the creator of the JavaScript
language which is Brandon Ike or even
Microsoft or Apple they weren't jumping
on board either so Google was basically
left to develop his Native Client which
only ran and the latest versions of
Chrome and nobody else supported it so
they ended up getting rid of this and
they scrapped it you can see on October
12th they will-they inscribed it all
together but it said well it's bendy
stuff so I guess it's been on thrown on
the scrap heap as of last month so the
good news is is that this web assembly
which is machine level bytecode
that runs inside of the browser that has
the backing of Brandon Ike Mozilla
Google Microsoft and Apple so the big
players are all working together on this
specification which is good news because
anytime they come together it typically
means that we're going to change the
direction of the web in some way shape
or form so here is web assembly now the
issue with web assembly is it's made for
you know very fast execution and in
order to write to it this web assembly
language does not have standard types
that we've seen in c-sharp and Python
you don't have like strings and things
like that it's there's very limited
types and it's going to be very very
different writing code directly for web
assembly so in the sense that nobody's
going to want to use web assembly over
JavaScript to manipulate the Dom for you
know a fancy animation menus and things
like that you're just not going to use
this and replace of JavaScript that said
though if you needed to run a video game
inside of the browser you would
absolutely use something like this and
you would have to in order to be
successful now one of the things I want
to show you in order to actually use web
assembly which is being supported right
now in its early stages because it just
got it an MVP release last month or
actually maybe last week a couple weeks
ago maybe very very recent it got a
release and it's actually supported on
Chrome Canary now Chrome Canary is
basically Chrome but it has all the
latest versions with a daily or nightly
builds and everything and when you
install this it's not going to install
over top of your existing chrome that
you have you can actually run this side
by side so I would suggest that any
developers out there that are interested
go ahead and download this to your
machine because it doesn't hurt
especially if you're trying to port
something or test something some new
experimental feature out this is the
best way to do it and I'm going to show
you an example of running a some web
assembly inside of the browser which
which uses the Unity game engine so
Unity game engine even though you can
write your scripts and tie everything
together
using c-sharp ultimately the core
libraries are written in C and C++ so
effectively this web assembly is able to
handle all that all right so with Chrome
Canary installed if we went ahead and we
navigate to this actually not that one
if we navigate to this link right here
web assembly org forward slash demo it
will tell you that you need to actually
enable web assembly so even though in
Chrome Canary this is like experimental
times too because even in the
experimental Canary version this is not
on by default so we need to actually
specify that so you just paste this
right in chrome Flags enable web
assembly and then you want to go ahead
and say enable and then relaunch the
browser
all right so now if we go back to this
page we can go ahead and play this thing
and now you'll notice that the load time
is relatively slow which is um I mean
it's not out of the ordinary like right
now there should be some sort of splash
seal going on saying that that
something's loading but ultimately you
have quite a bit of information that has
to be downloaded so anytime you have a
decently complex video game you
typically have a pretty good download
time and install time and we know with
web assembly it's really no different
you're going to have to have you're
going to have to have them you have some
loading times and probably all right so
we're going to check this joint out so
keep in mind it's probably a little bit
choppy it's probably a little bit choppy
because of my video but it actually runs
really smooth so this is pretty
sophisticated for just you know simple
running in the browser and you can see
that it's a step above what we were
looking at before if I know how to
actually play this game
all right anyway so if you want to read
more about this you can definitely go to
the docs right now but there is going to
be a lot of changes with this this
project line here but one of the
interesting things that you'll know is
that or that you'll notice right away
really is that it's not like quoting
Python or C sharp or Java it's very very
difficult in the sense that it's like
more machine level lower to the hardware
which is what you need in order for this
thing to be fast now where this is going
to end up competing with JavaScript in a
lot of ways is that you can use tools
like c-sharp or Python which can write
code in a way that gets compiled down to
web assembly formats so essentially we
can write web assembly in the sense that
we can write Python because python is
written on top of c so python is easier
than writing c the same thing can be
said of you know some language that
might be built on top of web assembly
that is easier than the javascript but
where I think JavaScript is still going
to have a foothold is that like I said
for Dom manipulation and things like
that you typically don't need this crazy
execution however there's always the
possibility that maybe this this you
know this subset language that's built
on top of this web assembly it becomes
maybe better better to control more type
save maybe you know there could be
benefits editors who knows that makes it
easier to write JavaScript even the
standard dom manipulation javascript
within you know this higher-level
language that compiles the web assembly
versus just regular javascript i mean
we've talked about some of the the
problems with the JavaScript community
and things like that I mean you have
typescript CoffeeScript all these
different things that try to pop up to
basically take away developing directly
in JavaScript and you know obviously the
community has been pushing for something
else so I think that there is going to
be some push to try to get something in
replace of JavaScript I don't know that
it's actually going to be successful
a hundred percent but I do know that
this is going to be the best thing that
we've seen so far when it comes to
actually being able to have virtual
reality inside of a brow
our being able to play a game inside of
a browser and you know be able it being
able to utilize WebGL to its fullest
extent Java scripts just not fast enough
even with the v8 engine alright guys
thanks for watching let me know what you
think and have a good day make sure you
subscribe vote up the video bye hey guys
so a lot of you ask me how do I get my
foot in the door to become a programmer
and I just want to take a moment to
mention dev Mountain coding boot camp is
a 12-week intensive course that focuses
on the technologies of the here-and-now
for web development some of the things
that they're actually teaching in the
Suevi course it's geared to get you into
the industry by focusing on things like
jQuery nodejs
react angular how to use github so a lot
of the things that you're going to need
to do as a developer as soon as you
start they're going to be teaching you
in this and this coding bootcamp and the
entire goal is to be able to get you
into the industry within 12 weeks so if
you guys are interested in learning more
information about dev Mountain coding
boot camp just check out the link in the
description cab of this video thank you
for watching and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
