for noobs tutorial and we're back in
this tutorial I want to touch on some
time like some basic time dealing so
anytime you have a situation you're
trying to deal with like a date I'm
really when I'm gonna getting the time
on this video I just want to stick to
just working with dates within Python
which can be confusing enough on its own
let's go ahead and create a Python file
so that we can practice this with and
I'm just going to call this date and the
first thing we want to do is import date
time next let's go ahead and import the
regular expression module because we are
going to be using that in this tutorial
so for starters let's go ahead and build
a string and gate and this is going to
be a date which is fully spelled out so
we'll say January 10 2014
I'm not sure why I picked that date it
just came to my mind I guess so
now that we have that date and that is a
string so we need that to be an actual
date object so we can do things like
calculating seven days in advance which
takes into consideration leap years and
stuff like that and seven days in
advance isn't a good example but if you
had to go like seven years in advance or
something like that or you want to have
like the final three months of the year
how you gonna deal with all that crap
like it's very very complex when you
actually really think about how dates
and date systems work and stuff like
that so that's what we have this date
time module so you need to be able to
say okay how do I turn a string into an
actual data object so there's all types
of different strings that could be that
could define a date right this is
January fully spelled spelled out it
could be Jan or whatever so in this
particular format January 10 2014 I'll
give you an example of how we can turn
that into a date object so let's go
ahead and say date object is a new
variable equals date time
dot gay time and then we're gonna say
dot STRP
strip time and the first argument for
this method is going to be the actual
date object that we're dealing with or
date string I'm sorry so it expects the
string and that's gonna be our string
date and then the next argument and
double quotes it's going to expect the
actual format of the date so it needs to
know okay what type of data is this so
let me just show you by example so that
it makes more sense so the date
significance of the fully spelled out
month January February March whatever
all that if you since it's not the
abbreviation it's the fully spelled out
month so we're what that signifies for
these strip time function or method is
the hell was that
nevermind alright so what that signifies
is that we need to use a capital B so
it's a % capital B and then we're gonna
do a space % lowercase D and then
there's a comma and then % uppercase Y
for a fully spelled out a year okay and
let's go ahead and then say print date
object dot date and if everything goes
well that will be an actual Python date
object so it took a string and then
turned it into a date object if
everything goes well so we'll see if
this actually works
and you can see that this actually
printed out a date object so I took our
fully spelled out month/day/year and
turned it into a year Monday which is a
common way of expressing a date and by
using this date object we can now I'll
go like three days into advance and
stuff like that so I'll get into that in
just a moment but before we do that
let's go ahead and do a short an
abbreviation of January to just Jan and
watch what happens see it says it
doesn't match the format the reason why
is because the capital B here says I'm
looking for a fully spelled out month
January February March since this is an
abbreviated month we need to do B and
lowercase B now if we run this program
again it works just fine because it was
expecting this format so let's go ahead
and turn this back to uppercase and
looking at the actual day of the month
what happens if we do D so it actually
does not match now if we take out our
comma watch what happens does not match
the format the reason why is that we
need to have that common there it needs
to know what the hell that comma is so
adding the comma it then works now
obviously if this comma wasn't here we
wouldn't have to specify it but since
that comma is there like it routinely is
when you're dealing with dates it needs
to be in that spirit that string
representation which I guess is the best
way I would call it what do they call
this thing basically the format right so
I guess that's self-explanatory this
format has to be the exact same way here
so one other common thing that you're
going to run into is you're going to see
a lot of times the jan the dates going
to have this abbreviation on the end or
not really sure what the English term of
that would be the pronunciation may be
I'm I don't know either way you see that
all the time Jenny with a chance maybe
the second or something like that or
you'll see a lot of different
possibilities that that could be and
there's a regular expression that we can
call on that to remove the tense because
our the th anyway
the regular expression is a little bit
difficult because you don't necessarily
want to just get rid of a th or like st
I'm trying to think of different months
that because you might end up like
taking out a portion of the month if
you're not careful so anyway I'm most
likely you're gonna just need to copy
what I put here I'll put this in the
video as well so that way you guys have
it let's create a regular expression
compilation so we'll say X equals re dot
compile and then we'll say actually
that's not gonna be necessary we're
going to go ahead and say date object
equals re dotsub and just follow along
here
so before we actually have this code
here this would actually fail and it's
because the th so we need to be able to
remove that and when you're dealing with
dates you're gonna see sometimes there's
an ST sometimes there's an nd sometimes
there's Rd and then there's obviously
the th so those are like the most common
things that you may find on a date and
you need to remove those so they can be
properly turned into a data object so
that's what this regular expression here
does and now I'm just right here on my
bad so when I'm not a dumbass and I
actually remove that that space and the
regular expression then it actually
works the way we wanted it so you can
see that it took away the January 10th
and now this will work when we call this
other code as well
alright alright so this video is getting
a little drawn-out here so I want to go
ahead and sum this up with I'm adding a
some dates or basically what I had five
days on to our daytime object so let's
go ahead and do that now
so I'm go ahead and create a new
variable called end date and we'll say
it equals date object plus state time
time Delta and then inside time Delta
you just have to give the amount of days
so we said five and we can go ahead and
say prints and date date and you can see
that the new date we went from January
10th it is now in January into 15th we
have a pretty good handle on how to
remove some of the annoying formatting
that you'll find with date strings and
then how to turn those strings into
actual date objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
