part of using pseudo elements but most
people don't really know its purpose or
what you can actually do with it
so we're gonna explore a few things you
can do with it like adding quotation
marks create some little cool icons add
a tooltip and even add some custom
counters creating a whole bunch of
really useful stuff without actually
requiring any extra markup so as we saw
in the last video if you're making a
pseudo element with the before or after
you must use the content property or
else well it defaults to none and then
there's just no pseudo element created
at all so it's kind of useless we also
saw that you can write some stuff in
there so just as a quick thing here I
have my intro up there so if I come to
my intro and I do and we do a intro
before I can say the content is hello
whoops it's a string so it should be in
quotation marks hello and hello is
gotten added in before my content and I
can't even select it it's it's not
selectable it's it's a pseudo element
it's hanging out over there I mean we
can do a lot more with this content
property and one cool example with it is
URL and you can use this to insert
images just like a background image so
just as a quick example and this isn't
something that I'm going to explore too
much but I've seen some cool examples of
it used on splash it will just do like
100 by 100 for a small little image but
it can bring in images so if you had
icons or something that you'd want to
bring in some specific places you could
bring those in like that and of course
in the after as well you could do the
same thing and have things come in after
and style them like we were looking a
little bit with in the last video now
one thing that you can do that's really
cool is opening closed quotes and I used
to do this the hard way cuz you can I
know I could write in the quotation
marks and you get the right one you this
is really cool so on my block code here
I have a block quote so you know we have
a testimonial or something like that so
on my block quote we can go in on the
before and the after so let's bring that
in block quote
before and on this the content we can
just put in open quote and look at that
it just shows up that's so cool
I love that open quote and as you might
be able to guess I can also throw in and
after on this now you don't want open
quote because it's gonna not look quite
right but we're gonna switch that over
to close quote and look at that we have
the opening and closing quotes if you
wanted this to be a bit more interesting
obviously you could play around with it
a little bit so the font size could be
bigger the color could be you know
something that's a little more faded out
so it's a more of like a little hidden
thing or I could bring in my red color
if I wanted to color whoops
color red and it will bring in my red
color and I could change the positioning
on all of this to get it to be exactly
where I want it to be but I just think
just open quote close quote just like
that and it works super cool that they
make it so easy and you know I used to
use this in another way that worked but
this is just so much easier so I think
that's cool you can do open or closed
quote just like that really neat now
that's the simple ones now we can get
into some more interesting stuff as well
so we can create a nice little tooltip
without any markup so if I have a link
or something that when I hover on top of
I want like little extra information to
show up and so this is something where
we will spend a little bit of time
styling and getting to look good so the
very first thing I'm going to do is I'm
gonna come here on let's add a new
selector and I don't want to select all
of my s what I've done here on this
specific link is I've added a data tool
tip so you can do this any you know
these were added in as attributes that
we can sort of customize to create how
we want mostly used for JavaScript
purposes but I'm going to use it for
some CSS here so I'm going to do a but
I'm gonna add in a data tool tip so that
means an a that has a data tool tip on
it so
the or an anchor tag that has a
data-tooltip attribute on it and I can
give this some custom styling so I'm for
this I'm just going to give this a
position:relative because I want to be
able to absolutely position my
pseudo-element so what we're gonna do is
take this same thing but choose the
after they could be the before as well
however you decide to style it but I
just think it makes more sense as an
after for whatever reason and what I
want to do here is a whole bunch of
stuff so the first thing I'm going to do
is bring up that content property we're
looking at and we can choose the
attribute so I can choose the attribute
data tool tip and you can see that a
cool tooltip has just appeared here so
before that if I take this off you can
see it just says dollar set Hemet some
nice latin right there and when I bring
that back in the extra text a cool
tooltip it gets added and what that is
is it's taking my data-tooltip attribute
and it's putting its value a cool
tooltip into there so that the content
is becoming whatever I have written
inside of here so that's really neat
because right now it's kind of weird
we don't really you know there are times
where maybe you'd want something like
that but we can get to styling it now so
if I give it a display of block instead
and a position I've app solutes so it
comes out of the flow of everything else
and you can see now it's out of the flow
it's actually overlapping with my other
one so let's give this a background
color and I have some sass variables set
up so I'm just it's a color that I have
stored up if you don't know too much of
what sass variables don't have to worry
about it too much it's just I'm just
putting a background color on here
pretty much I can add a little bit of
padding to this so let's say I don't
know one m3m ish something like that
just to give it some size so there we go
we can start seeing it the color should
probably be white so we can read it a
bit easier probably look better with a
border border radius
I don't know 5 10 pixels ish just to sum
round the corners a little bit that
looks a little bit nicer and maybe the
font slicing me a smaller font size I'm
gonna do like 0.75 M just to make it
that much you know 75% pretty much of
this font size it's getting on the small
side but I think that's borderline
readable maybe we'll go with 0.8 just to
try and help out a little bit there
now let's position it where we want it
to be so I'm thinking we're let's go
where do we want it bottom zero and left
to 0 the left 0 for sure
oh that's not looking so good so let's
move this up a little bit bottom will be
does that make sense 100% yeah so we
want to start like right above that left
zero it's doing left and right of zero
we can give this oh we can stop it
wrapping if we do white-space:nowrap
which is kind of cool that should make
it there we go that's better
so instead of wrapping down it'll just
take up whatever space it needs to I
think that I help things out a little
bit now what I want is I don't always
want it to actually be there I only want
it to show up when my mouse is on top of
it so there's a couple of different ways
we can do this I could just like have
the opacity turn on and off one thing I
wanted to sort of like grow out of here
so let's do one thing let's do a
transform scale and we're just going to
set the scale to zero so it should just
disappear the scale is zero so it
doesn't really exist anymore and then I
want to take this and I want to add a
hover on here so when I hover on top of
a data-tooltip the after and it's
important the hover goes in between the
after and this or it's not gonna work so
it's when we're hovering on the
data-tooltip the data tooltips after is
gonna change what it looks like so now
we can say the transform
scale of 1 so when I hover it appears so
that's kind of cool right that's weird
it wasn't disappearing for so long
something's gone really slow here we'll
figure out what's causing that let's
keep going because we will obviously
want this to transition so a transition
transform let's do it at like I don't
know ease out and we'll have it take 150
milliseconds something fast so it should
grow and then shrink that's working
better now too so it's growing and
shrinking so that's kind of cool except
it's growing and shrinking from the
wrong spot I don't really like that it's
growing from up there I'd rather it look
like it was starting here and then like
taking off a little bit so I think what
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
change this bottom back to zero so it's
on top of my tooltip so it's not my
tooltip but it's on top of the text that
it's from and then we can also do my
bottom becomes 100% like it was before
and that just means this transition so
we're gonna have to transition so I'm
going to put it on different lines here
so we can see the two of them you
transform these not transform sorry
bottom ease out 150 millisecond so it
takes the same amount of time got a
comma separate them though so I mean
this could all be written on one big
line it just makes it easier to read
when it's not so common separated my two
transitions and we can see it grows out
of the text just like that so that's
kind of cool so we go up and it's
growing out of my text and we get a
little tooltip the tooltip is part of
the link so you can see when my mouse is
on top of that we can still click on the
link itself but because it's gone now
and the scale is zero I can't actually
click on it now it's only when it
appears so I think that's kind of neat
and fun and a cool way of using this
attribute content thing to do some fun
stuff with it um now we can also do
things with decorating sections
so the counters we're gonna get to in a
minute the counters are down there but
first we're gonna do some decorations so
let's just do decorations because I have
a whole div here for it and let's add
some padding because it's kind of tight
justice there we go so we can sort of
see where where this section is all by
itself and focus just on that so inside
these decorations if we go and look down
here I have my decorations and then all
my h2s have a class of section with deco
on it so what I can do here is let's go
and grab my dot Section SEC section with
deco and let's do some stuff on here so
one thing we can do just remember we
looked at the whole image thing so just
to give you an idea of if you had images
you could do something like this with
content and use that URL thing and do on
I'm just gonna use my own splash it
again but if you had sort of a saved
image that you wanted to use or
something you could do this now when you
first whoops this should be before and
unsplash this should be a dot and there
we go
now obviously you wouldn't want
something like that but then if I do you
have to remember there display:inline by
default so it would display block and
look at that I can get these nice little
second section separators or something
if I had a nice icon or an image that
could separate wherever I had my
separations or something like that or
another really cool way we can use it is
with font awesome so I'm going to add
the font awesome link so this time we're
going to do a little caret is equal to
and we can do HTTP so anything that
starts with HTTP and I'm not going to
put the s and I'm not going to do
anything else so it's a TTP it should
pick up s or not s and after I'm just
gonna copy this paste it in but we're
gonna change the icon over here from
that one that we're using currently
because it doesn't make sense to say
that's a PDF we're gonna change this one
over to f-35 D now
it's not gonna work you can see that I'm
getting a little icon there and the
reason for that is or not the right icon
and the reason for that is this is part
of the pro it's not one that is free but
if I change the font weight to 900 now
it will work and I'll get a nice little
external link icon and there we go so
that looks nice it's showing that it's
an external link now I find that one's a
little big big personally so font size
maybe like a point 0.8 m or something
like that to shrink or down just a tiny
bit and it's an external link so if I
click that it will bring me to another
website yeah a nice little addition that
you can do and so you can use the font
awesome just watch out for the whole
font weight thing and again just take
out the cheat sheet and I'll put a link
to that in the description for that and
now last but not least the one that I
think is the most fun and probably least
knowing about or really understood is
the adding in counters counters are
really really cool I love how this works
so basically you can just create no we
haven't we have numbered lists right you
can just do in a Noel an ordered list
and it's gonna it's gonna work like an
ordered list now the cool thing with
this is you can do a lot of other cool
stuff with it we can use the ordered
lists we can pretty much turn anything
into an ordered list which is really
cool so if we look here I have my
counters so in my counters drew let's go
find counters and then I have my h2
class of section so in counters itself
in this whole div here what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna do something called a
counter reset and let's with the way the
counter reset is is you need to give
your counter a name and why it's a
counter reset is every time it gets to a
class of counters it will reset itself
so if I had five divs that had lists in
it and I wanted to use it like this
I could have my list reset every time it
comes into a new div with this name so
my counter reset and then you just put
whatever counter name you want this is
your choice of counter name so for this
example we'll just go with counter name
why not I can't think of anything better
since
it's just a counter name so on my dot
section so my section if you remember is
all my h2s
so all these section titles here are my
dot section so on my section of four
what we're gonna do is I'm gonna do a
few different things range of counter
increment counter name so what that
means is every time so we get into my
counters div and it resets so we're
starting off we're at zero then every
time we get to a section it's gonna
increment it so one two three four five
pretty much it just means every time you
find a section before count add add one
add something to it add one to our thing
so add an increment to our counter a
name then for the content content all we
do is put counter and then write the
counter we want so counter a name once
again and we should see there we go some
numbers pop up so one two three four
five and if you needed to over here you
could come in and just add a space as
well so this is a string so I'm just
putting quotation marks around an empty
space it can't be together because then
there's nothing in there but I put the
space there so then it's numbering it
and keeping them apart or we could even
just you know drop in a period or
something you know whatever whatever you
need in there and it will work nice and
clean and look pretty good so basic it
already looks good but we can make this
look a lot better so I think we should
go and do that so let's take this off
because I won't need it anymore
and I want to put these in a circle and
position them where I want so the first
thing I'm gonna do is say that once
again my section is position relative
like we did in one of the previous ones
and now in here we'll change this to
position absolute then we can also with
that we can move it over on the left so
let's do like negative I don't know 2.5
m there we go so it's floating off in
away from everything
so that's a good start and with that now
let's see what else we can do do it so
let's give it a background background
white ok let's give it some padding to
give it some size show you about padding
let's do give it some padding and see
what happens one M let's just see what
this looks like that's a little too big
I point five m and actually no the
problem with these is it's not gonna be
a perfect square and I want to make them
into circles so instead of that I'm
gonna give them a width of I don't know
2m height of 2m and let's see what
happens there we go so now we have
perfect squares to work with the only
problem is the numbers not right in the
middle so the easy way to do that is to
make my before a display flex and then
just defy content center and a
line-items
Center and it should put that number
bang in the middle so you can see that
just because we're working on a simple
pseudo element you can do a lot of
really cool stuff with it so now I can
do my border radius 50% because I
mentioned I wanted to make it a circle
there we go
it's already looking pretty good I want
to move it up a little bit because I'd
like my number to still be lined up with
my text I don't know how much I need to
move this up top I have no idea to be
honest with you negative 1 M is gonna be
too much 0.5 is not enough probably that
looks pretty close I'm gonna leave it
there so that looks pretty good
I think should I change anything else
let's give it a border border of I don't
know 2 3 pixels solid clear color gray
there we go
that moved it down a smidgen eh oh
that's but if I did border box sizing
border box would that fix that oh it
does good so that means that the the
borders included in the width in the
height whereas before it wasn't so it
just keeps my alignment
a little bit more in check I'm also here
with this just a change also going to
change my color of the text to the same
color as my border I think it'll look a
little bit nicer yeah and I think that
looks pretty nice um so you know we can
get our numbered list just like that and
you might be thinking oh that's cool but
what about you know lit actual I have an
oh L and I want to do the same thing
well you can do the same thing with
actual lists as well I won't style it as
intently but if we look at this is my
counters o L o L so every time I get to
a new ordered list inside of counters I
want to do a counter reset and we have
to give it a name this one should have a
different name right so let's give this
one a name of ordered list because
that's what it is and now before we have
one other thing we're gonna have to do
but just to show you what it why we need
to do it let's go to our li and before
because we want to target our list items
now so the counter increment once again
ordered list so we're every time we get
on one of these list items we're
increasing the increment then what we
want to do is we want to do content
counter ordered list and now what's
gonna happen is did you Jew and
nothing's showing up because this should
be counter is not counter let's scroll
back down and now you can see it came up
said the problem now I have is I have
1.1 2.2 3.3 so on here I do want to do
list-style:none just to turn off the
original ones now my list isn't looking
as good as it originally was so when you
first see this you might be going like
oh my goodness it's it's so much work to
make a worse off list why would you do
it well first you could you know take
the time to make a nice change of style
for what your numbers look like or
something like that another thing you
could do is you could change what's
going on
so on my content I could have it say
like list item and then I'll add a space
there so it's list item space one and
then I can come all the way over here
and then add another space inside of
quotation marks so a list item one list
item and then of course you know it
could be the color of it is different or
even you know maybe this would make more
sense you put the that so it's whoops I
put that in the wrong spot list item let
me do this here so it's list item one
two three yeah I don't know why you'd
write list item like that but then or
even say then you do fontsize whoops
that's not in the right spot my goodness
I'm all over the place here let's get
that back into place font font size is
point 8 m color is color red whatever
you want it just makes it easy to put
whatever you want for your list and then
just to show you that how the counter
does reset here if I take another Oh L
whoops I copy that and I paste it you
can see that the numbered list is so
it's 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 as you'd expect
with a no L but what if I took this
counter reset for ordered list and I
just had it on my whole whoops well just
to do G where's my if my whole counters
so this is the big div that they're
inside counters if that was my reset
then it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so it's two
different lists but the list keep
counting because they're all part of the
same big block so maybe you have Lippert
lists that are separated by paragraphs
but you want the numbering to continue
you could definitely use this for
something like that there's more stuff
you can do with the content property too
but this is the big stuff that I think
covers most of the bases so I hope you
like this I hope you learned something
watching this video and thought of some
cool ways that you could use it in your
videos
