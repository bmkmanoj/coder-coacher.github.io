we're looking at what github is and how
to use the github desktop application so
github itself works with git in the last
video I did we looked at what git is so
if you missed that video it might be
worth checking out
so while git is really awesome github
gives us a place online to store all the
stuff we're doing it's not just local
storage anymore it's now somewhere that
we can share our files with everyone we
can work on teams and all sorts of
really awesome stuff another really cool
thing with git is it allows us to fork a
project so if it's a really big project
such as bootstrap that is publicly you
can get onto their github page you can
go and check it out and if you want to
make a change to it you can't make a
direct change to it with a branch like
we saw with the previous video because
then all sorts of people making all
these branches and doing who-knows-what
with it so they do use branches in their
project but it's a little bit different
how it works because what you want to do
is make a fork of the project you're
copying their project on to your own
account and then what happens is you can
do whatever changes you want and then
take those changes and a request that
they get pulled into the actual project
there can be a review we can leave
comments back and forth discuss the
changes that you're trying to make fix
anything that you might have to and then
eventually maybe one day they'll
actually get pulled into the final
project which is really cool so in this
video we're going to be exploring the
basics of how the desktop application
works how you can make your own projects
in there and how you can fork something
like bootstrap into your own account
make changes to that and push those
changes towards them or put in a pull
request and all of that so let's jump
right into it ok guys so the very first
thing you're going to have to do to use
the github desktop app is make a github
account so you'd come in here sign up
just put it all in here sign up I
already have an account so I'm not going
to go through those steps but once
you've signed up for it you're going to
want to go to desktop github.com and
that's where you can download github
from if you it should auto detect
whether you're on Mac or Windows but you
click the big button here and if it for
whatever reason gets the wrong one there
the links here for whichever system you
do need it on so once you have your
github account you log in you'll see a
screen that looks a little bit like this
except you won't have any repositories
but it probably looks something like
this but for the moment let's worry
about github itself or the not github
itself at the github desktop application
so when you open it up you'll probably
see this no repository selected mine's
probably going to go over and select one
no usually it does so you'll probably
get this this side will be empty but
we'll be adding in a repository in one
second now really quickly you can add in
repositories here you can add one that
already exists on your computer you can
create one here if you don't already
have one or you can clone a repository
from the internet into onto your
computer so if it's already on your
account you can clone it into here now
you can create one this way but for me
the easier way to create one is actually
to take an existing file so let's
minimize that so we can see my desktop
and I've made this folder here github
beginners and it just has a blank index
basic template folder right here for now
that we're going to use and if you have
something like that all you need to do
is take it and drag it right in there
and drop to create repository so think
of a repository is just a folder either
on your desktop or what will end up on
line that's pretty much what a
repository is when you drag it in it's
going to ask you for the name and it's
going to take your folders name it's
going to just put the local path
automatically and there's this get
ignore here none or you can add in any
programs you might be using so I am on a
Windows computer I'll just select
Windows for now really quickly if your
folder has a space instead of a hyphen
it can have it but it's going to tell
you it's going to create it with the -
anyway it's not doesn't allow for spaces
in the name so any spaces will
automatically become hyphens and I'm
going to click create repository with my
git ignore already in there if you do
none I'd suggest going back later and
putting in a git ignore there super
useful to have it just stops any hidden
files or things windows
I don't think you'll end up with any
windows file on there if you're on a Mac
I strongly encourage putting the OSX in
there because OSX ends up with a number
of hidden files so let's just choose
Windows I'm going to create my
repository now you'll notice right away
how it okay there's a few things that
just happened really really fast first
of all let's look over here on github I
have two repositories already I have for
my responsive website tutorials that
I've done this is listed under other and
that's because it's on my computer it's
not actually on github right now and I
didn't get it from github it's all
coming from my computer so it's just
listing it under other right now you'll
also see when we made that it sort of
went kind of crazy and this all popped
up and you'll see there's a few
different things going on here so when
we made the folder github desktop
application added a get attributes and
the git ignore files by itself and we
can click here and see what they are so
they get attributes it auto detects text
files and performs normalization and
blah blah blah a little description
there and get ignore this is the GUID
ignore file that we had it create and
it's actually ignoring some OSX system
files in here too which would be
convenient if you're working with you
know some people might be on Windows
other people might be on OSX on your
team and the thumbnails and all of that
so it's ignoring all the windows and or
operating OS X operating system files
right now which is perfect I can also
click here and it's showing these are
the for the files that I had in this
folder to begin with so not those two
but it's all those other ones it's the
four files and they're not actually
committed to anything right now they're
here and it's saying that I you know
this little plus sign means they've been
added but I would need to push these
into the master so let's just do basic
template files and I'll commit that
right now commit to master so now
there's no local changes so if I click
here there's the get ignore and get
attributes files that were created I can
click here and I can see my basic temple
eight files are created and then I can
go to the current live version where
there's no local changes I can open this
in Explorer which just means it's going
to open it like that which is cool I can
also click this to open it in Adam Adam
is created by the people who make github
so they've linked it together if you
don't use Adam as your code editor
there's no problem whatsoever you can
use any code editor you want there is
some integration that we'll see in a
second with Adam and with github but not
terribly important at the moment but
what is important is how do we actually
get this online and it's really simple
there's this nice little publish button
that they give us so I'm going to click
on publish it's going to ask me for a
description but I don't have to give one
I just need to have a name and it's
going to keep the name that we already
have description is completely up to you
I have had times where nothing was
selected here I just saw this little
down arrow with no name and it wasn't
letting me publish just if you see that
little arrow with no name click on the
arrow and select your name I don't
hopefully you don't run into that
problem and it's just because it has to
be on a public account we can't make a
private repository right now because you
have to have a paid account if you want
to have a private repository and I'll
click publish to github beginners oh and
then when I'm just going to hit publish
once again because I just sort of set it
all up and now I'll click there we go
I wanted to see that little sinking
thing going it takes a little while to
sync for me it does anyway so we'll give
that a second you can see the progress
bar at the top and that's it it's synced
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to open up this I'm going to refresh and
I should see that repository there it is
github beginners and I'm going to click
in there and I can see the project in
here so I can see all the things these
are this was with the basic template
file so that's the comment that I put
when I published that this was the
comment that it was added automatically
when it made these two files for me and
you can see there's one branch there's
only my master branch there's only one
contributor so I'm the only contributor
and there's been two commits the basic
template files and the
added get attributes get ignore files I
go to two commits we can see the list of
them and who they were by and we'll go
back to the code so let's go back to
here cool and what I'm going to do now
is I'm actually going to make a branch I
want to make some changes to my project
so I'm going to create a branch right
here so I just click on that new branch
name add text add intro text it's
basically just the basic description of
what you're going to be doing whoops and
it should it's going to do it with the
hyphens for me so I'm going to create
the new branch for that or we can just
call it add text actually add text
create new branch and you can see here
it's you can see that it's visualizing
that we're on a branch now so it's
branched off like that now I'm going to
click on my little atom thing here
because I want to edit this in atom so
there we go
atom has opened up position that just so
you can see the whole window and one of
the cool things we can see all my
project files here but we can actually
see that I'm on the add text branch so
that's really cool it knows where I am
because I'm using atom which is
integrated into the whole github
experience so we're going to see some
other things as well as we work so let's
actually open this up in the browser as
well and we'll shrink that down so we
can see what I'm doing we don't need
this anymore so there's nothing in there
my index is currently blank so let's go
over to my index and let's come in here
and add my text h1 hello world close h1
and I'll save that and I'll refresh over
here and we should see my hello world is
not appearing I'm just going to cool
see how this is an orange what's
happening here with the oranges it's
showing that this is a change that's
happened I can even come down here and
look it's an orange one line has been
added to this file that is not yet
committed but I'm just going to do a
show and explore and I'm going to open
it again mmm it's working
github beginners okay anyway it's
working nicely now hello world and just
to make sure that it is working ah hello
yeah so it's we're working fine so let's
get rid of this just up yeah okay that's
weird
save that again refresh over here so
we're at our hello world let's say we're
happy with that that was good
everything went well we can go back to
our github application here and it's
going to say that there's been one
change and I can say h1 text added or
let's just do title title text title
added and I'm going to do commit to add
text now maybe I add in a paragraph of
text here as well
so paragraph goodbye goodbye world
closed paragraph save that go back to
here another change goodbye world
I can commit to add text no more changes
and I can see the whole timeline
progressing here so my master branch was
there and I mean that I'm in my add
texts branch and then maybe I go in
actually here's another good point if I
click on them I can see what's changed
so here I've plus so it's added a line
of code and there's the code that's been
added I can come to this one I deleted a
empty line that was there and I added a
new line that was hello world with the
paragraph and I might go you know what
that's kind of depressing I don't
actually want to add that I'm going to
do revert and that's going to create a
new commit that reverts the changes in
this commit so I can hit revert
it's going to keep track of the fact
that this was added but it adds a new
one where it then gets removed so it's
not deleting the fact that this ever
happened it's keeping track that that
happened but it's deleting it and it's
moving me on to a new line and then this
is my current one where everything is
good now let's say that I'm happy with
this this is what I want my site to look
like I'm really you know everything
looks good
well first actually let's publish this
just so it is we can find it on our
thing up here so I'm just waiting for
this to load and just as a bit of a
warning sometimes for me the syncing is
sloped there we go it has gone through
I'm going to hit refresh here and we can
see that ad text was added and I can
compare if I want to and I can see here
there's two branches so I can go up
there I can see that there's been
changes made to both my branch it's
active and if I click on add text I can
go and take a look at what the add text
so add text was updated one minute ago
but and there's been five commits to it
and just for fun we can go back to my
master my master has only been updated
nine minutes ago so the masters the the
real one nothing has changed on that one
yet but if I look at my add text my add
text was just recently updated now if
I'm happy with this these changes are
exactly what I want everything here I'm
happy with I can do a pull request so
what this means is I want to pull this
branch back into my master so I'm going
to hit pull request add text I can you
know this is the name of add text to
master the description you can give a
description with more detail in here if
you want and I can send my pull request
in and then I can click here to view it
on github or I can just come over here
and refresh everything so I'll go to my
github beginners it says that I have a
pull request so I'll go look at that it
says add text to master I can go and
click in there
and I can see what was done so no
description provided the title added
goodbye world revert goodbye world all
the things that we're done we can go and
look at all of them it says there's no
conflicts with this so there's nothing
conflicting with this version of the
file with my current one so we can merge
the pull request now one thing that's
really important is I can't merge the
pull request here you have to go to
github for it to get merged the other
thing is generally speaking it would be
someone else who's doing the merge it's
not yourself unless it's your own
project obviously but usually you're
working in a team and then you're
getting it approved by someone else
they're going to look at the code maybe
they don't like it they can come in here
and leave a comment saying looks good
but I'd like to see these changes made
hit the comment you could make those
changes and then put in a new poll
request but in this case we're just
going to do merge pull request I can
confirm the merge and really important
the pull request has been successfully
merged and closed do you want to delete
the branch yes in general you want to
delete the branch it just keeps
everything nice and tidy and all of that
so deleting the branch is important and
if you ever needed to you can restore
the branch too if you want to get it
back for whatever reason now if I go
back to yeah that's all done so now I
can go back to here and we can see that
this has been updated it's saying four
minutes ago because that's the last time
that anything had been changed but
everything is up-to-date now there's
only one branch and everything is live
and good to go so the last thing you
might want to do with github is to fork
a project off make some changes to it
and try pushing those to see if they're
get taken so I've opened up bootstrap
here on github and they have their own
repository on here where you can make
changes to it and all of that but
obviously I'm not part of their team and
you can see just to give you an idea of
a big project there's been almost 16,000
commits there's 20 current branches 41
releases and almost 900 or 850 anyway
contributors let's just jump over to the
branches really quickly and you can see
they're working on version 4 now so
you'll see the active branches there's
issues there's a
we can go and look through a lot of that
but just for this video all I want to do
is I want to make a fork of this project
so we don't want to clone or download it
even though that's the the big button
that's on here right now what I want to
actually do is come up here to fork it
so I'm going to click on Fork and this
might take a little while because it is
a big project it says a few seconds but
it might take a bit longer than that and
there we go that didn't take very long
and I am now in the the fork so this is
on my account
it's in Kevin Powell / bootstrap so
things that I do in here they're not
touching the original project at all I
can come in make any changes I want in
here so I'm going to go over to github
and now I'm in the desktop application
and I can come into here and I'm going
to clone bootstrap to my computer
because I want this to be on my computer
it's going to ask me where do I want it
so I'm going to put it on my desktop and
just click OK
choose the folder that you want the
folder to be inside of because whatever
folder you select it's going to make a
new folder inside that so if you made
like a bootstrap folder on your desktop
it's going to make a bootstrap folder
inside your bootstrap folder if that
makes sense so I'm just choosing my
desktop I'll find it once this is done
it's going pretty fast I'll show you
where it is on my desktop there you go
so I'm just going to right click on here
and you open an explorer just to show
you desktop bootstrap and even where is
it on my desktop there it is so we can
see that it's made its own bootstrap
folder on my desktop with everything in
there so now I could open that up in
atom and let's just go and look so
quickly I'm just going to open up there
get ignore just to show you what a
proper get it more might have so it's
ignoring Ruby files it's ignoring the
gh-pages file log file zip files all
sorts of stuff project files idea files
it's all for oh s and folders sublime
workspace lint files all sorts of stuff
these are all things that it wants to
ignore some Jeckle so things that
shouldn't be brought up
in here let's go look at distribution
and CSS and let's just go look at the
grid for fun and let's just make a
change in here have a body I'm just
going to save that I'm not going to make
any big changes in here it's just to
show you what type of thing we do so
it's showing me the changes there I have
my change here example I'm just doing
this as a quick thing I'm going to
commit that and here we go we have just
made my little change right at the end
now I'm going to sync that and it's
going to sync it over to my account and
remember none of these changes are
actually going over to the bootstrap dev
I would never push something silly like
that over to their code and don't push
random stuff like this you know if
you're going to be making a contribution
to something make sure it's a worthwhile
contribution so that is done we'll open
this back up let's go and take a look at
here so I did the latest commit one
minute ago and you can see here now this
branch is one commit ahead of the tee
WBS version for dev so I'm one commit
ahead of where there's is and I can
compare mine to theirs
and I can put in a pull request so I'm
going to click on that but I'm not
actually going to go through with this
because I don't want to do it but it's
able to merge there's no issue with it
so there's the base one there's my fork
I can compare them together and I can
take a look so the big difference here
is I've added this in pretty much
there's the big difference that happened
I've added a whole bunch of lines of
code and if I wanted to I could discuss
and review the changes in this
comparison with others so I'd create my
pull request it would go over to them
they could leave comments tell me what
they think of those changes and if they
liked them they could even pull them in
or they could tell me you know what not
bad make these changes to it or just
what are you doing you know if I
actually submitted this it would just
get ignored and they would delete it and
yeah nothing would really happen
this is just to show you how the fork
would work
you come in you make your fork and then
you put in a pull request and that's
going to go back to the original person
so if you do want to do this to one of
my own repositories you you saw
something in one of the sites that I did
that you want to make a change to by all
means go for it or in my future videos
when I'm making them as I go along if
you're following along with my series by
all means you can follow along in my
github which will be a few days ahead of
the video so you get a bit of a sneak
peek that way and throughout the whole
process if there's anything you want to
do by all means you can fork it off and
make pull requests at any time now I'm
just as a very quick thing here I'm
going to go back to my own repository
come over to Kevin Powell repositories
and I don't actually want to put this in
right like that would be silly to to
keep this I'm not planning on working on
the bootstrap so if ever you do want to
delete something you do have on here
you want to go to it so I'm going to
come into here and it's over in the
setting so I'm going to click on
settings I'm going to scroll all the way
down to the danger zone
and there's the make private which it's
not going to let me do plus it's a
public Fork I can transfer ownership so
if I wanted if this is a big project
that I didn't want to be involved with
anymore I could transfer ownership over
to somebody else or I can delete the
repository from my account which I'm
going to do right now I just have to
write the name of it is it just github
bootstrap github bootstrap and now I can
delete this it's just saying be really
careful its permanent there's no there's
no backsies on this one it's gone once
it's gone so delete that because I don't
want it in my account anymore thank you
