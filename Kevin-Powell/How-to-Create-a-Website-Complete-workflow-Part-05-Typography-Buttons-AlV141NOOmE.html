video in this series in this video we
are going to be looking at doing all the
typography and the buttons normally I
would have done this stuff before the
header and the hero area that I'd
started working on already but I think
it's more fun to sort of see it all come
to life with the you know parts of it
already done now we can really bring in
star bringing in the fonts and making it
look a lot better and it's more you know
I'm you're watching me do this I want to
make it as visually pleasing as possible
for you guys now which order you do it
in doesn't really matter but just to let
you know normally I would have probably
done those the other way but this just
seemed to make more sense enough of me
rambling around let's get started and
actually start putting all of this
together now so I mentioned we're
focusing on mobile first so the
typography might have some changes to it
later on once I start working on the
larger size but for now where I'm going
to do is make a new file I'm going to
you save this in my base and I'm gonna
call this one type type type type type
type I'm gonna call it type just because
I already have a typography file and I
don't really want to mess them mix those
up they probably should be the other way
around
well type save that go to my main SAS
and I want to import that import base
slash type so let's go over there I'm
not gonna be working on the header or
the hero so I can close those I might be
jumping in here a little bit I'm not
sure yet so for the type I have already
have the body style set up I did that
way back actually I did that off video
but I didn't mention it a little while
ago if we go to the vendor and normalize
right at the top is there where they set
up their fonts so I set up a little mix
in for my fonts and I use that to set up
for just Roboto that we're gonna be
using and a basic line height so that
part of its already been
but we definitely have some other stuff
that we need to change here so I'm gonna
close that down so one thing I'm going
to do is I always like sort of doing a
bit of a reset on my margins and
everything because they're always kind
of awkward so let's just do it
two h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 I don't think I'm
actually going to use all of those but
whoops I don't need those and what I
want to do is just do a margin
I want the 0 on the top 0 on the left
and right and something like 0.75 M is
usually a nice little default that I go
with not having any on the top does make
my life a lot easier so I'm sort of
doing a reset on that and then at the
same time what I like doing is having my
h1 last child and I'm going to copy this
two three four whoops
four five six I think I need seven of
them paragraph so I have an h2 h3 h4 h5
five my h6 and my paragraph and what I
like doing with this is I like saying
that there margin is zero so we don't
actually see a big change or any change
come up right away on that but what this
is doing is it's saying that the if I
have say five paragraphs in a row the
last paragraph it's not gonna have any
merchant bottom on it or if I have an h1
and it is it's always if it's the last
child that it will not have any margin
on the bottom of it and for me that's
important and the reason I like last
child and not last of type you know if
we look here at this h1 just for fun if
I did last cuz people mix up last child
and last of type sometimes last of type
so if I do last of type and I only have
one h1 well that means that there's no
margin on that but I
want this to have a margin so it's only
going to look at it if it's the last
child in something so here this
paragraph it's not the last child so
it's keeping a margin on the bottom
which is important where as we come down
to these ones here just if I do an
inspector over here this paragraph has
it and then this peril it's not the last
child again do we have a paragraph
somewhere that is a last child my call
to action and now they're all ending
with buttons sales points should yeah
but I don't have any text in it great I
didn't do my text but it's just say you
can see the image I have my h2 you can
see that there is a margin on the bottom
and then my paragraph has no margin on
it if we go and look at the box model
there's no margin on that paragraph so
it's just just stop some strange spacing
things from showing up I'm getting extra
spacing whoops I didn't want to close
that so I find this just is a nice
little tip or trick or whatever you want
to call it that might make your lives a
little bit better down the road okay so
now I do want to get into styling things
a little bit more now one thing with the
design this heading was bigger than the
rest of it so this I have all of these
including this one here and including
this one here is H ones but this H one
and this one have a special clasp on it
to make them bigger than everything else
so this is sort of the standard h1 the
other thing we'll see yeah so that's my
standard h1 anyway it will look like
that so I'm going to set I'm going to
look at this one to set it up so my age
having this weird delay going on today
here h1
I want my font size we'll stick with
something like 2m we'll try to Remy I
should say which shouldn't really change
it the line height is definitely way off
which is normal because it's a larger
font size
we'll attack that in a second font size
is okay font weight should be 300 we
want it to be light or what am i doing
it should be font
super and again that's something that I
set up when let's go look at it in my
type
oh I thought I called that typography
but I only called it type so I have to
type files whoops I was sure I called
that one typography okay I should have
called this one typography then I said
it was gonna be more organized in this
and I wanted to call that one typography
and I sort of screwed it up well we'll
fix it now save as type our graphi save
we will look inside my base here type
can be deleted and last but not least we
need to come into my main dot sass and
just update that so it's importing the
right file type auger fee that makes
more sense I'm happy I didn't screw that
up actually okay so super duper that's
all looking fine so in my whoops I just
closed it in my type I have my font
light font normal font bold and font
black I'll set up for my weights there
so I can just use font light for my
fonts wait there we go um and I
definitely need to into the line height
line height well what if we do like a 1
it's probably a bit too close 1.15 that
looks ok I know it looks really messy
down here right now it's all gonna get
fixed up in due course but it looks ok
so this one here though obviously needs
to look a little bit different if we go
and we look at the original design that
font size is a lot bigger and I don't
have them
one of this is the only thing I have but
the font size is you know this is small
this one's a lot bigger so that one
header text I think your title large so
title large dot title large font size
we'll go with three rim for now because
it should be bigger good good good
font weight is going to be font bold to
even font black and the span will be
font weight of font light there we go
that's what I was after is all of them
all caps actually all of them are all
caps so we need a tips not that we need
a text transform up upper case let's
just make that just want to make sure
that looks okay that's not too bad
should next level always be on the same
line
no that should be fine maybe should this
be a display:block no cuz that's gonna
look weird it's some of the breakpoints
that's just gonna be super strange so
we're not going to do that we're gonna
leave that as it was cool okay good
so take your up to the next level this
font size here too is a little bit small
paragraphs should be font size 1.2 rim
oh wait no that one's again that one's
different right
that one's bigger than all the other
text whoops I think I also gave that its
own class right text intro cool
I don't usually have so much time
between the projects and usually you
sort of powering away at them text intro
and we'll bring that down okay paste
okay cool I'm actually gonna go back to
my base for a second just I put this at
95 I think I'm gonna do 90 yeah I like
that better just a little bit more space
on the sides it was getting really tight
on the edges there and now it's just a
question of those buttons looking a
little bit better those buttons do look
kind of ugly so for the buttons as you
might guess they get their own sass file
and in this case it's going to go in the
components oh I did a save as whoops new
save there we go sass components buttons
dot sass
so if you haven't used sass before
you're probably seeing a little bit of
what I'm doing a screenshot you've
probably seen a little bit of the the
cool power of it right now right where
you can do a lot of these really nice
things we're just organizing your sass
or your CSS becomes easier because
you're not scrolling through this big
giant file you're just picking out the
little pieces you want so for our
buttons there's a few different things
we want to do right our buttons had
within our buttons have our buttons have
a few different classes that we we
played around with so we had our basic
button class where I use this to set up
the padding all the time Oh point seven
M 2.5 am I always go with a lot more
padding oops and they get that padding
to work proper
I do need to also do a
display:inline-block
are these not buttons I did it again I
didn't import it so come up to here
again this wouldn't normally happen if
you were doing sass through the command
line one of the problems with the pre
approach is you is this did it but you
would also have to import it properly
components add import / buttons there we
go my buttons are working properly now
sweet buttons so and they're not always
you know they can't go next to each
other they just look kind of weird now
because the padding is so big but they
don't have a background on them that's
okay another thing I usually like to do
is text transform uppercase for my
buttons actually since I'm doing this a
nice thing you can do text transform and
text decoration and then so it's a cool
thing you can do with sass you know with
the indenting I have my text and then
it's a text transform and a text
decoration so a nice little trick there
if you didn't know about that
I think that's all I need okay so now we
have our different buttons so we had the
button primary so the background on this
will be my accent color let's see that
click in just one of those not the
primary a secondary primary BT and
modifier classes get the devil there we
go and I want a color of whoops text in
verse in verse I have my button
secondary which will have a background
of no not a background I'll have a
border of two pixels solid white no text
in verse the main reason I'm doing this
for my button is the color will be the
same as the border and that way if I
ever change the text in verse color it
will also change the border color at the
same time color is text in verse don't
forget the dollar sign for the variable
awesome possum because this is setup
with a border and this one's not using a
border it actually sticks out a little
bit so one way to not have that stick
out a little bit is just a port a border
of two pixels solid accent and then that
should make them exactly the same size
Coolio um is there anything else I need
to do on those they look okay except
they're stuck together which is
obviously really ugly like this they're
okay but when so I'm happy you actually
with what they look like that I need to
I'm gonna put a hover effect on them but
they look nice but now they're stuck
together so I can prevent that from
happening actually and another little
thing we can do so it's a button I want
to do button not last of type
margin-bottom one in too much point 6m
that looks better so I'm saying this is
just taking a button so button not the
last button if I have a lot of buttons
not the last button we'll get a margin
on it all the other buttons we'll get a
margin on the bottom so we can separate
my buttons will that cause no it won't
cause any problems
I don't think super so it looks good
that looks good let's give these a
pepper effect so my button primary which
is this one here we'll give that one so
and hover and focus we will give it a
background of darken we will darken my
accent color by how much 15% so you can
see it there clicking in it's getting
darker when I go on top I'm tabbing
through right now and you can see it
gets darker this is something to assess
which is super handy and nice and makes
life a lot easier so we'll stick with
that and I'm actually no the second
everyone is different so here we want to
do and hover and focus we will do a
background of text in verse as maybe
being I should done white anyway text
inverse and the color will have to
change to Lois primary text primary text
primary
did I not call it text primary
do-do-do-do-do type use the colors
whoops oh I did text main I keep
screwing that up today text I used up
whoops
sorry sorry sorry where are we buttons I
used to always use primary and I've been
using main lately but I'm not used to
the change yet there we go
okay super so that's working and it's
looking good and that section is pretty
much done we do need to change some
colors my text color is should be the
little that blue actually I'm using text
in verse before that I'm using anything
else but ideally that blue color would
be my my default color so on my base
let's come up and to say body color is
text for rain whoops and I made a
mistake on my colors may normalize
buttons to power colors my text main
should be my main color yeah there we go
that's better
good good good so that's looking nice
I'm happy that that I'm trying to see oh
my H twos need to be fixed up I didn't
do a lot of type stuff on these for now
we'll just worry about the h2 and I
think that will be it for this video
cool so let's go and check out what do
my h2s look like there are all caps
they're bold
let's zoom in a little bit on that my
age shoes they're all caps they're bold
I have some letter spacing on them and
they're not super gigantic
okay cool they're actually pretty small
so for that we will come to here h2 font
size will be something like 1.2 R M
maybe the text transform is uppercase my
letter spacing will be something like 1
point 5 pixels line height is something
like 1 just so you know if ever you're
doing stuff with all capped X Y or all
capped X line height should be a lot
smaller you can almost always just set
it to like 1 if you're getting two
really big font sizes it's actually
getting it was smaller than 1 because
Alltech all caps don't have like
uppercase or a little like J's and G's
and Q's that go down underneath you can
really pull those a lot closer together
if not they look weird they look like
they're too far apart let's just make
this even like two for my letter spacing
on that yeah cool I only have that one
luckily I've actually set it up because
I have others that should be over here
that I didn't get around to doing so
that looks pretty good I think that's it
for the typography guys and thank you so
