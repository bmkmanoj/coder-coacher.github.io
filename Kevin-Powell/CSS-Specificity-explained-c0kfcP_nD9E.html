people don't really understand in this
video I'm not just gonna look at what it
is but I'm gonna look at what some of
the best practices are as well so we can
make sure we don't run into issues with
it now the basics of it is your
selectors can be more or less specific
and the more specific you are the more
important a rule is and this is well
important when you're trying to
overwrite thing so - I understand
specificity properly we also need to
make sure we understand the Cascade and
so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna jump
over to here and we can see that my body
has a color of white on it so all of my
text is white and if I come down here
and our a body and I switch this so I do
color to blue all of my text is gonna
change over to blue and then if I switch
this body color thing all of my text is
gonna switch over to pink so it's always
the last rule that wins so right now I'm
not being any more or less specific it's
just going okay here's my body my colors
white oh no here's my body my colors
blue oh no here's my body and my colors
pink so because all of those have equal
specificity that none of them are really
it's just the last one that wins there's
no other importance to them so the last
one wins so you might sometimes also
hear that there's an order of importance
between an external stylesheet and
internal stylesheet and inline style and
that's sort of true and it sort of
follows with the Cascade a little bit so
here I have all of this and you can see
my body actually has a background on
here so my body's backgrounds down here
because I was going to use this for
something else and so we're gonna just
focus on that so here's a greenish color
on my body and if I come over onto here
I also have an internal CSS style in the
tag here and that one has this yellowish
background on it but the one that's
currently winning is this inline style
I'm gonna talk a little bit more about
inline Styles later on if I take this
inline style off and I save my internal
CSS is winning but this isn't because
the internal CSS is more important
this is falling down to the test
it's a little bit different when I had
my inline style over here but for
internal CSS like this if I just take my
external file and I move it below this
and save you can see that now this one
is winning because it's reading this
rule then it's reading this rule and you
could sort of say well then when it's an
inline style it's just going in order
it's reading this one then it's reading
this one and then if there's an inline
style it's reading that one that's the
last one and that one wins but it gets a
little bit more complicated than that
because right now we're just dealing
with things being all the same value
let's get our red background because
it's a bit easier to see everything it's
a bit bright but that's okay
so if we come back over to here and
right now I'm using my body and other
things so I could also do a P and we
could say color is green and my
paragraphs will change to green so here
both my body and my paragraph these are
just tag selectors so I'm selecting all
my paragraph tags or my body tag this is
the lowest level of specificity you can
get now I could also overwrite this
green style by writing in div P and
saying color is yellow and then that
nice yellow color comes in right there
so this is looking for all of my
paragraphs inside it if and you probably
never actually write something like this
but it's still there and if we come and
look it's I'm just just to show you we
have our paragraphs that are inside a
div now the difference here is if I take
my color green and I actually put that
down underneath so first I have this one
and then second I have this one when I
save this file and it updates it's not
actually changing over here and I'll
just show you I'll refresh just to make
sure and it's still yellow so this green
one is getting ignored and it's because
this is being more specific than this
this is a paragraph inside a div so this
is more specific than just looking at
all of the paragraphs on my site so
because of that this rule no matter
where it is is always going to win over
this rule now you've probably never
actually write div space P right that
just seems a little strange
you'd probably target something if you
really wanted something specific by
using a class so if we get rid of and in
this case I have a class of definition
and a class of source so let's go and
grab my definition over here and we're
just going to do it up here and I'm
going and we're gonna say that the color
on this let's make it a little easier in
the eyes is black not blank black and
even though this is coming before this
one and before that one this one is
winning now and the reason this one is
winning his classes are considered more
specific than tags now to help you
understand what's actually going on here
let's open up a calculator that shows us
what we can do so the link to this is in
the description below if you want to
come and play with this and you can see
here it's this little calculator so if
you have things that are competing
against each other and you want to know
what's gonna win you can use this to
help you figure it out and this is a
really nice visualization so you can see
here elements which is just our div and
our P these tags like that and these are
elements and also pseudo elements
they're worth sort of one point we're
gonna see why it's not exactly one point
but it's worth this level of points and
then a class is worth in this area here
so if I do here my dot definition and I
over here I do my day of space P I can
see that this is only worth two and this
sort of worth 10 so this is obviously
gonna win out over this one which is why
so this is being more specific so it's
overriding it so that's why this is
black even though it's coming before all
of this other stuff just to be just so
you really understand what's actually
happening here this actually isn't two
points and ten points it's a little bit
different than that so just to help show
you this I'm gonna take a look at
example now of something I never want
you to ever find yourself in so this is
the situation that I never want you to
find yourself in and I don't think you
ever will be but let's go take a look at
how this would work so here I have my
selector for my 15 divs and so let's go
and change this we'll say the color
is going to be pink and you think this
would be worth 15 points because it is
15 element selectors and that would be
sort of right but here if I do a color
of blue this still wins so what's going
on exactly well what's happening is
these points always just add up in this
column so you could have a hundred divs
a thousand divs it doesn't really matter
one class attribute is gonna overwrite
whatever crazy selector you've just come
up with now this is super bad practice
and I hope you're never doing stuff like
that but it's just to say a lot of
people see this is like one two nine and
then all of a sudden this is ten points
it's not exactly true even though for
the most part you can't see it like that
because it should never happen that any
of these get passed a couple of values
you know you don't want something that's
overly nested or selected in an overly
nested way now as you can see here on
the calculator I these are worth more
than classes and that makes more sense
because I these are more specific than a
class but in general we want to avoid
IDs they're having an extra layer
specificity to our documents that we
don't really want to have to fight with
because as soon as I do something on
this ID I can't override it with a class
or I can't override it pretty much
without doing anything and it can be
really annoying with stuff like that so
just I think you get the idea of what's
going on but here if I have my dot
source color is green and then my ID of
source color is yellow its it's gonna
get the yellow color on there and while
this isn't a super realistic example you
might have something that has an ID on
it and a different class and you're
using that class in ten different places
and the ID is overriding it and doing
something you don't really want it to do
one way you could overwrite it is you
could use an inline style so I said we
would get back to inline styles
so style equals color black go back to
black and this will overwrite it so that
is here we can see in line styles are
the king in inline styles just overwrite
everything if you put something in line
it wins out there's nothing you can do
about it or almost nothing I should say
but we want to avoid inline styles like
the plague because you're never gonna
find them you're not gonna remember
something is there they're a nightmare
the only time they come into play is
when you're using JavaScript really and
even then it's often better to simply
add or remove classes with JavaScript
instead of styling the actual thing
which I was script if you can one way
you can overwrite anything pretty much
is with the important so if I come on my
paragraph here and I say this green is
important oh my good look they all
changed even the one that had the inline
style on it here down at the bottom well
how did that happen the important pretty
much means this is more important than
everything else so no matter what
happens it needs to override everything
but don't use this please because what
happens when you do this it's the same
problem that you probably run into and
you had your ID you're using an
important now because you want to
overwrite something now it probably
isn't on a paragraph thing like this but
I see it a lot where you might have a
class of like green and you want to make
sure that the color on this is used and
you need to overwrite stuff because you
have selectors that are just more
complicated and adding this isn't
working so you go and you do something
like that you add the important but then
you get to your source and you really
want the source to be yellow but there's
something that's important that's
getting in the way well you can still
overwrite it because once you put
important on something I can come down
here and add important and now your hole
specificity war starts over again so you
have your paragraph important is being
overwritten by my source which is
important and the important just causes
problems it if you're having to use
important I mean see if you can think of
a better way to write your code there
are times when maybe
can be used and there's always an
exception to every rule but rule if
you're using important you better have
an amazing reason for using it because
for the most part you shouldn't have to
use it it's something that should not be
needed because you should be writing
nice simple CSS and the simple way to
stop from running into issues with
specificity don't use paragraphs don't
use element selectors if you don't have
to now a paragraph is one I use because
you have lots of paragraphs on your site
but for the most part use classes as
much as possible be really generous with
your use of classes so I really really
would have something like this if I
wanted these two to be styled
differently I would definitely have a
class of definition in a class of source
on these two paragraphs so I could style
them separately like this and then I can
control these paragraphs exactly how I
want I would probably have a class of
title on this if it's the title of my
page so I can select it with a class by
doing that you're keeping the level of
specificity the same across the board
you don't have to use nested selectors
so if I wasn't using classes on things
often you'd end up having a div class
and you'd want to select something
inside of there so you'd have your div
which you know you can't just go div so
in that case you would actually have a
class so say you have like a section one
and then there you might have an h2 so
you have to select it like this because
you're not using a class and you want to
make a special change to that I could
have my section one and have all my
styling for that and then I could have
my section one title and then this title
is something that I'm styling separately
if that really needs its own styling for
it this might not be the best maybe I
could just have it as a section title
and all of my section titles get the
same styling and that's something that I
could reuse in lots of different places
so in general is a general rule of thumb
try to stick to classes only try to
avoid nesting your selectors as much as
possible
just to keep everything on an even
playing field and it's gonna stop any
problems you might run into when you're
dealing with specificity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
