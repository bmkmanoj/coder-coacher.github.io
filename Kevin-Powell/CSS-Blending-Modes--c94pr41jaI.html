name is Kevin and if you don't already
know this place is all about learning
how to make the web and how to make it
look good while we're at it in this
week's video we're gonna be looking at
something really really cool which is
CSS blending modes now if you already
know about blending modes it doesn't
mean you shouldn't stick around I'm
gonna be looking first at the basics of
them so how you can mix an image with a
background color and after that we're
also gonna be looking at how you can mix
them with gradients and with multiple
images or two images and a gradient and
how you can put multiple blending modes
and stack your blending modes as well so
all of that is coming up now now before
I jump into the crux of this video I
just want to apologize I'm a little bit
late on this video I actually had
another video plan something a lot
bigger than this one recorded the whole
thing and the audio was absolutely
garbage it was just really strange what
happened so I had to scrap it don't have
time to get it out this week so I'm
doing this little short video normally
I'd want to balance out the short ones
with the long ones and series and all of
that but it's two quick ones
back-to-back this time because of that
so with that out of the way let's take a
look at what CSS blending modes are and
the first thing we're gonna have to do
is put in an image because they use
images so the first thing I'm going to
need to get this to work is just to put
in a div in this case I'm not actually
going to put any content in here just
cuz I'm exploring the blending modes but
of course you could have some content in
here div class is equal to let's just
call it background image we won't be
very original with this one so I'll save
that let's jump into my CSS and in my
CSS I'm gonna select my background image
and do a few basic things so let's give
it the background let's start actually
with a height of 100 viewport height and
a width of 100 viewers with just to make
sure it's the full size of my viewport
and then of course to get this to work
whoops we need to put in a background
image to start with so I'll do a
background image URL and it's a
step-back images and super kid Jake
and let's just see that load in it's
took a big image background size will
help with that background size of cover
so it takes up the space there we go so
I have my image in there and if you know
how background images work you can also
have a background color on there so if I
put a background color let's come here
and do a background color
we'll start with red just for fun now a
background color I don't see it because
my background image is on top so if I
there's my red and if I add the image
the background color disappears and the
image is on top of it so that background
color is still there the red is still
there but my image is covering it and
this can be really really useful if ever
the image doesn't load for some reason
the color will come in so if you have
some white text on something and it's on
top of a picture you might want to put a
background color on there too just in
case the image doesn't load at least
there's a solid color there and people
can still read the text and in this case
to get the blending modes to work you
need to have both an image and a color
so if you've used Photoshop at all you
probably know what a blending mode is
and a blending mode is pretty much
taking my image and blending it with the
color that's there they all work a
little bit differently there's lots of
fancy algorithms that are involved the
best thing especially if you're not
familiar with them is just to play
around with it until you get the look
that you're after
or you know do it in Photoshop first
maybe it's easier just to see to get it
to work it's a nice long run background
and blend mode so a long property to
choose from and as you can see I do have
a nice little choice of them there even
though it's not actually sure oh there
we go I can scroll down so I have a
choice of all of those which is pretty
good some of them are more useful than
others
the default is normal which means
nothing will change it's just a normal
mode I'm gonna
let's try multiply first multiply is a
popular one it's gonna darken the image
screen is the opposite screen focuses on
the lightest things so if something is
lighter we'll see that and if it's dark
it sort of disappears so screen and
multiply are kind of the office opposite
overlay focuses on neutrals accepted
shouldn't be giving me that whatever it
will jump in to darken so darken is a
lot like multiply it's gonna darken
things lighten is a lot like screen it's
going to lighten things color dodge
gives you some interesting results
usually but doesn't want to work for me
all of these hmm
then we also have things like saturation
whoops saturation focuses on the
saturation so it's a little bit of a
weird one you probably won't use that
too often a color is a nice one cuz you
can use it not color colors a bit of a
strange one too actually
of course and then luminosity and there
you can sort of use that just to color
your image I do think we have a few
other choices in here yeah there's
nothing exclusion and let's see in the
list hard light whoops is you know you
can start getting into some of the
weirder ones if you're familiar with
Photoshop you'll know which ones you
like he was a good one for coloring the
picture too actually in this case it's
giving us some crazy results so you know
as I mentioned you're probably going to
have certain ones that you want to use
and I'm really curious why overlay
didn't want to work before let's just
try overlay again hmm is it because
we're focusing on the neutrals let me
just try firebrick aha yeah is because
of the color of the red and this is
where depending on the color you chose
you're going to get different results so
let's just switch this over to steel
blue so now overlay is working properly
those do jump through a few of them
darken will look like that lighten will
look like that you'll get different
results depending on what your
background color is so that's why I
suggest playing around with it a little
bit to see exactly what you're going to
get because depending on the colors in
the image and the colors your background
color that you're using you will get
some different results every single time
now there's some other really cool
things you can also do with these it
doesn't stop there so if I take off my
background color let's just say this is
my background
you can actually blend in some gradients
so if I do a comma and do a linear
gradient and I say still blue to fire
brick I get my gradient and the blend
mode so I get the overlay blend mode
with my gradient I think that's really
cool and if I'm doing this where I have
and I'm just separating these with a
comma so it's actually putting the two
of them on my as a background and what I
can do if I'm doing this if I can bring
in a linear gradient why can't I just
bring in a second image and I can so I
can do another URL again comma separated
IMG / oops i am g / side walk jpg and
you can see i'm blending two images
together and in this case it doesn't
look so good i don't know if any of
these will actually look good you can
see i can actually blend the two images
together and get this weird sort of
style that I am getting right now and
depending on the blending mode you get
you will get different results so I find
that really cool and you know why not
let's just pull in a linear gradient on
top of that red yellow and now I'm
blending all three of them together so I
know this is probably a little bit of
overkill even just blending two images
together can be kind of awkward I'd
probably do it more with the background
and then a linear gradient rather than
two images or two images and a gradient
basis so you can keep going going and
going and we're going going going so why
not you can actually stack up some
blending modes at the same time so if
you do have multiple images you can set
up multiple blending modes so I have an
overlay for the first one and then my
second one can be set to lighten and
again that's gonna completely change how
these look so let's just do a screen on
the first one and a multi ply on the
second one and really fun thing to do
again if I was doing this without just a
solid color I probably wouldn't have two
images I'd probably stick with one image
and then do some sort of linear gradient
with it
just for my personal use the most
popular ones and this is from my days in
Photoshop but the ones I've used the
most or generally screen which makes
blacks disappear and makes white show up
screen multiply which is the opposite
again so this is gonna focus more on the
darks it keeps the darks get hides the
whites and overlay which focuses on the
neutrals it's sort of in-between the two
of them so it focuses more on neutral
colors and not on the whites or the
blacks it hides 50% grays or 50% yeah hi
it's 50% great so just to show you one
thing it could be fun let's actually get
rid of this and your gradient you can
also stack the same image just really
really fast since I like doing this in
Photoshop sometimes if you're stacking
the same image on top of itself you can
also get different results so let's just
take this off there's the default so if
I do multiply everything will get darker
if I do in overlay let's start with
screen actually everything will get
lighter and if I go with an overlay it's
just gonna increase the contrast of the
whole image now you know this may be a
cool way to increase the contrast
without having to go into Photoshop and
change it but do be aware this isn't
fully supported on every single browser
so according to can I use com Chrome and
Firefox are good to go you can do
whatever you want
opera also supports it as of the current
version ie and edge both have no support
whatsoever for it big surprise I guess
but they will have zero support for it
whatsoever and Safari for some reason
supports it but it only supports it for
everything it doesn't work for hue
saturation color or luminosity but all
the other blending modes do work just
not hue saturation color in the
luminosity and then there's also the
mobile where it's a bit more hit and
miss iOS apparently supports it the
exact same way Safari does which makes
sense Opera Mini just doesn't
Android browser and Chrome for Android
both are supposed to support it so you
can get away with using them but just be
careful it might not always work so
don't rely on it unless you're you know
if you're going crazy using flexbox and
you're really you know counting on the
future and stuff like that that's fine I
love playing with these things just know
that it's possible that it's not gonna
work and that's it for CSS blending
modes I hope you like this video again I
