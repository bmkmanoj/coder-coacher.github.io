in building a mobile navigation if you
haven't already watched part 1 there's a
card up on the top right now where we
look at styling this whole mobile
navigation using flexbox and in this
video we're going to animate the whole
thing using jQuery and then at the very
end of the video I go back into the CSS
to fix a mistake that I made with my
navigation when I go to add a hover
effect in there and it just we run into
a little issue and so we we fixed that
to what I'm gonna do is create the
hamburger menu and then make the
hamburger menu work so when I click it
it makes my what we're seeing now on the
screen appear and disappear I'm just
going to actually give this a write
value of a hundred percent no not right
left zero left is 100 percent there we
go so that's sort of the animation that
I want to happen so you can just see
there it's gonna slide out and 100% when
you click the button it will slide away
like that but obviously I don't want to
see all my text and stuff sticking out
the sides here either so because that's
a bit of a problem we do need an
overflow:hidden I always do none hidden
there we go
so that will hide that away so it
doesn't get in our way
now what I'm gonna do is come down here
this markup this commenting here if
you're not used to sass this is a sass
only comment it won't show up in the CSS
just do a mobile burger menu so what I'm
going to do for my hamburger menu
there's a few things I'm actually have
to jump into the HTML to start this off
and I'm going to come in here to create
my hamburger menu so I'm gonna have a
nav toggle and inside of that I'm going
to have a hamburger whoops I want that
to be a small age there we go
and that's it so nothing should change
right now good in my
yeah in my nav let's come back to here
so my hamburger menu we are going to do
a few different things so we have my nav
toggle first my nav toggle is what you
actually click on to make it appear and
disappear so let's just do a
display:block and give it a background
of pink for now so we can see it and
some padding I'll just do one M right
now just so I can see things I want to
see if there's my box so good it's
working and now I need to position it so
position will be absolute and right will
be zero top will be zero I'll just do a
right of 1m and a top of 1m there we go
that's more or less where I want it I'm
not worried about the shape or the size
of it because once I put my hamburger
menu in there it's going to change a
little bit and I'm gonna change my
cursor to pointer so when I put my mouse
on top well if it was a mouse icon it
would turn into a pointer just to show
you what I'm talking about you can see
now it's turning into that so if we did
see it it would turn into that okay cool
that's it I think for there now what I
want to do is style my hamburger so
hamburger and for this I also need my
hamburger before and my hamburger after
cuz we're gonna use a few pseudo classes
or elements pseudo elements to populate
this display will be block let's go with
a width of 2m a height of 3 pixels and a
background of white and there we go you
can see those are starting to come in
the only problem is they're sort of
overlapping each other and all of that
so
need to change how they're positioned so
I'm gonna use my hamburger before it'll
be the first one I do this one will get
a transform and a trance about their
translate X Y X up and down is y
translate Y because I'm using a height
of 3 pixels I want to move it up by 3
pixels so minus 3 pixels and you saw it
move up except it didn't move up enough
I want it to be separated 6 there we go
so it should be 3 pixels than an empty
space of 3 pixels and then my 3 pixels
there and then that's it I'm gonna copy
this whole thing and paste it and put
after here except I don't want negative
6 now I want positive 6
or is it positive 3 positive 3 I always
mix those up so there we go you can see
that's all there I can turn off my
background pink now I don't need that
anymore and it's actually positioned
pretty much where I wanted to be so that
worked out really well cool now what's
gonna happen when I click on the
hamburger we want it to rotate and all
of that let's start by creating our
JavaScript file yeah I'm gonna make my
do I already have one actually no I
didn't have it did I link to it already
I think I have my link already I just
didn't create it oh I never even linked
to it ok and I'm gonna be using jQuery
for this so I also have to link to
jQuery I forgot to do all that I just I
generally just take the this one here
minified and grab all of that and close
and paste that in there's other people
that hosts it too you can get it off
google and all of that so I'll close
there so that's good and I also want to
link to my own and I'm gonna put a few
comments in here actually this is my J
a query I have font awesome awesome and
all the way at the bottom is usually
where I put my own my own scripts so
we'll throw those in there so I need a
script SRC is equal to j s slash scripts
J s closed script save that file and
make I had my new file we'll save that
as a yes and we'll call it scripts guess
one might as well start with the best
practice document ready whoops read ur
ready so when the document is ready we
want to do a function and this is well
put everything now I've put my jQuery
linked already although my jQuery my J
JavaScript my own link all the way at
the bottom so technically speaking this
shouldn't work until the document is
ready anyway but this will make sure
that the whole document is loaded before
it starts trying to do my scripts just
to make sure this doesn't slow down the
loading of my page at all so what I'm
gonna do is we want to I'm gonna split
this to the bottom actually uh split
down I usually work with the split
screen left and right but I like being
able to look at things as I'm working on
them I mean there we go so I want to
select what do I want to select I want
to select main nav and what I want to do
main clap on click we want to do a
function whoops function and the
function will be what will be my
function my function is when
I click on it we will select this so we
want to select our main nav and we want
to add not add we want to toggle class
and I'm gonna create this now I'm gonna
call it we want to toggle class is open
let's save that and let's test it out to
see if it works and I click on it it
should be logo main nav is here it's not
working but something is changing and
I'm not getting a console log error
let's go look at my console cuz it's not
working hmmm ok guys I'm really dumb I
don't know why I selected me nav here
let's go and try and fix that to put a
nav toggle instead because that's what
we're clicking on save that and yeah we
can see there it's adding in the is open
class so that was not smart of me but at
least it's working ok so I did
everything right let's just put in a
little comment here so you know if this
gets more involved we know what's going
on I am burger menu toggle okay so let's
close my scripts and now we just have to
come in here with more more in our CSS
so what do I want to look at I want to
say when oh no I did that wrong I sort
of had it right I have to open up
scripts again yes sorry I don't want
this I want I want to select my when I
click on this I want to add the class to
my main nav ok so when I click on this
my main nav gets the is open there we go
that makes more sense so let's close
that now because the reason I just
thought of that is I want to
where is it toggle nav I want my nav
toggle is open to have a not my nav
toggle Oh guys I'm not doing good here I
want it to be all the way up here my
main nav so my main nav is open gets a
left of zero there we go
hey guys it's working super and I want
to animate that I just don't want it to
appear and disappear like that so let's
just come up to my main nav and add a
transition on there
so transition I'll just do it all ease
in out and we'll do 250 m/s milliseconds
let's see how that looks
that looks pretty good I think there we
go awesome cool I'm happy that was nice
and easy the only thing left to do is my
hamburger menus so my hamburger menu
except my hamburgers not inside we're
also gonna add the class to my hamburger
I keep closing scripts here so main nav
tag class is open
daaad burger will also get in is open
I mean Ave is getting it and whoops my
hamburger is also open okay so actually
let's leave that open so we can see that
this is working so my hamburger is open
will actually this should not go here
this should come up
she actually I don't have anything
that's just hamburger okay we'll do it
at the bottom my hamburger is open gets
a transform rotate will go with a 45
degrees cool and then what I want to do
is I want to say my actually because
this should work hamburger is actually
what am i doing I can just do after will
do after rotate trans form rotate 90
degrees so it sort of makes that X that
we can see coming together there and my
before gets a display of them and look
at that perfect oh I think that looks
awesome
so when I click that it should go normal
and you can see it's jumping back and
forth between the two the only thing
that I want is I don't want again I
don't want jump I want it to sort of
fade in and out so on here we can add
our trans transition all ease in out 250
milliseconds as well so now it should
enemy
I don't like the animation actually that
it's swinging too far that and I need
it's going the wrong way
they're both rotating the same way so I
find it looks really weird what if I do
a negative 90 on here instead of so yeah
that looks a bit better they're sort of
crossing each other now instead I'll
just show you what I did let's slow that
down a little bit let's make that like
one second and I'll put this back to 90
so when they're both going the same way
I find that see the way that they're
spinning there looks a little odd to me
you can also see the top thing is just
disappearing when it clicks and it's
because my display is going to none
let's change the opacity on that instead
opacity zero that should but then that
ships it down that's okay it's just
getting in the way so I think if I do I
remember right negative just to push it
back to where it oh whoops
you can't have multiple transforms on
something well you can but you just
negative six why is that moving Oh
cut paste again I think that should be a
three
that's moving it that way this is an ex
that I wanted there we go so that should
make the other thing fade in and out too
which I think looks a little nicer so
you can see they're both turning in the
same direction and I don't really like
the way that they're both turning
they're in the same direction I find it
looks kind of weird so that's just why I
prefer coming in here and doing this one
as a negative 90 so it spins in the
opposite direction I know this is the
wrong way - there we go okay so it sort
of just makes them cross each other like
you would expect it to happen and now
obviously that animation is way too slow
so let's bring that back to 250 250 save
and there we go I think that looks
really good it comes in it comes out
it's working perfectly the only thing I
could add in here is a hover effect for
these so we might as well do that even
though most of the time probably won't
do much but we can do it anyway so we'll
do an a and let's just yeah might as
well do it the SAS way and hover oops
that should be indented actually and
hover so when that's hovering it will
get a bad round and I'm just gonna do an
RGBA and I'll show you why in a second
RGBA again of it let me get darker so
zero zero zero and just do point one
zero see what this looks like we also
give it that a focus however and
focus I just so I can tab through oh
that's not gonna work ah what if I did
that on my list items instead let me do
it on my list items I don't see why not
oh except I can't I can have a hover
effect on it we can't have a focus on it
but you can see it's working
the focus won't do any things we can't
focus on them sadly but that does give
us this hover effect and the advantage
with doing the rgba instead of giving it
a specific color is if I later decided I
don't like this background color and I
actually wanted to use my main color
it's still gonna darken and it's gonna
stay with that or if I want to darken my
secondary and it still works perfectly
fine and I'm gonna stick with accent
okay this is me a little bit from the
future cuz when I was editing this I was
ashamed of myself a little bit and I
made a huge UX mistake this is a really
big one guys I'm embarrassed by this one
I put the hover on the list items
instead of on my links and that's
terrible
because if someone is looking at this
and they're hovering over this looks
like you can click on the whole bloody
thing and even if I couldn't see this
hover effect if I was on a mobile screen
I wouldn't really be focused on clicking
on the word home that looks like a
big-ass button that I can just click on
with my finger so you know this looks
like the link just doesn't work I'm
clicking I'm clicking it looks like the
link is broken you have to go on to that
little thing here this little space to
click on it that's terrible why why
would you do that this is things that I
get mad at other people for doing I've
actually seen buttons that are sort of
done like this and I've been so angry
that somebody was so lazy to do that and
I almost did that and I'm really ashamed
of myself for that actually luckily it's
really easy to fix I'm gonna put a
background color on my link just so we
can see how this is gonna work so I'm
gonna do a background of light blue so
we can see that come in okay so what I
actually am going to do is take off this
align items and justify content because
I don't actually need that on there that
was a mistake on my part I wasn't
looking far enough ahead on this one
so when I save that you can see it's
actually they're actually taking up the
full height now and the reason for that
is by default flexing things sort of
grow to take up the whole space but this
is a line item center is would stop it
from doing that so I can take that off
the justify content I also don't need
and I'm gonna hit save now this is where
things of flexbox are a little bit weird
but we'll see how it works in a second
the only I want this to grow to take up
that whole space so I'm gonna do a flex
basis of 100% just to make sure it takes
up that whole space now what I was
saying was a little bit weird is to get
this to go right in the middle you know
you wouldn't necessarily think that you
could do this because this the text is
inside of the a tag so the text isn't
another tag like here I'm doing a flex
and it's changing my link into a flex
but I can actually do a display flex on
here so I'm doing a display flex on my
link and then what I want to do is do an
align items Center Center and it centers
it vertically so even though this is
just text inside of a link I can still
have it do that and now you can see that
I can click on that whole area and now I
can do my justify Content Center so I'm
just taking that aligned items and that
justify content that I had on my list
item and I'm bringing it down and
putting it on my a it's just really
important that I also have the display
flex on my a or those won't work and now
they're perfectly centered I might as
well take this hover effect off of here
and drop it onto here so they will get
darker and I can take this light blue
background off and there we go it's
we're working perfectly awesome
super super happy with that so yeah I
can again really nice thing with flexbox
is you can do this align items even if
it's not on another you know it's
affecting other tags it's affecting the
content that's inside of that a so now
that whole space is actually clickable
so I could come in I don't have anywhere
for these to go but if they did go
somewhere the whole thing is a clickable
link now so whatever you do don't do
what I almost did and make a little link
inside of a big thing that looks like
you can click on it yeah that pretty
much wraps up this video I do hope that
