CSS selectors and specificity so more
advanced ways to select things instead
of just looking at h1 h2 paragraph or
specific classes we can be more specific
and do more powerful things so let's
jump right into it so we know that we
can select a tag so my I can select my
paragraph tags by bringing the P or
again select my body by writing body h1
h2 and all of that and then in the last
one I showed that we can select multiple
ones at the same time so let's just say
I could do also my P and may h1 and I
could say color is green and the color
of my paragraphs and my h1 will become
green so that's nice so here's one thing
that's really important that I didn't
mention before that I completely forgot
about that it's really important though
is I've declared my paragraph color and
my h1 color up higher so I have a body
color I have my h1 color and I have an
h1 color here and I have an h1 color
down here and this one is winning and
it's always the one that's farther down
that wins so a lot like when I looked at
my links before and the order that they
were coming in it it's the last stuff at
the bottom that wins so something you
know if you're trying something that's
not working maybe you accidentally you
know you're trying to change your
paragraph color maybe you already
changed it lower down just something to
keep in mind that the one that's after
always wins so that's one of the things
I wanted to look at the next one is I've
changed my layout a little bit here so
the layout looks much the same but I've
come and I've added a class of intro to
my paragraph here and then I've put a
div of body text here that has a few
paragraphs a few links and I've even
added a class of important link to one
of my links over here so this link here
is an important link so let's come back
into my CSS and what I want to look at
now for the selectors is how we can
select certain things so we know we can
select all of my paragraphs with by
putting a P tag but what if I don't want
to select all my paragraphs what if I
only want to select
these two paragraphs here well they're
inside of my class of body text and we
know we can select my class of body text
by putting docked body text so if I do
body text let's do a few things here I
want to put a background on there just
so we can sort of see the area and one
thing I found out between one of my
earlier videos and this one if you just
do not even CSS just running color
picker do a su Google search for color
picker you don't need to go to any links
or anything like that like I showed you
last time you just get this awesome
color picker right here and come through
choose whatever color you want and it
works really really well so let's just
go and choose a blue I'll copy my hex
code and let's put that as my background
color background background color save
that with my and I have my background
and now I want I don't like that my text
is touching it on all the sides so I
need more background think about it for
a second we've covered this before how
do I get more background I need to do
what is it hope you said padding I'm
sure you did and let's just do padding
50 pixels on all sides refresh there we
go yeah so there's my intro paragraph
and I've done that but now I need to
change this a little bit I want to
change the color of my text to white and
then I my links in there and I want
those links to be different as well so
what I can do is because if I do P it's
gonna select all my paragraphs but what
I can do is body text space P and what
body space space P will do is it's going
to select my paragraphs that are inside
of body text so now if I do color white
those ones become white but it ignores
this paragraph so this is a really
important thing to know that we're gonna
be using shortly and I really want to
highlight it it's very useful and very
good to know
so just to replicate that again it's
hard to see these links here this color
is really similar to the background so
let's go to dot body text space
a-and let's come to my color picker
again and choose a new color let's get
something that stands out
copy that color oops I need to write
save that and oh I still can't really
see that it's too dark it's a little bit
better and I can even right now I have a
hover effect on these and I that hover
effect is gone is I so I can now do my
body text a hover and let's just make
that a color of say ddd which would be a
very very light gray there we go so I
get my little hover effect on those and
those are now different from these ones
because they're inside of body text and
if I got rid of this here save these
would now get the same hover so all of
my links are getting the same hover
because this hover is replacing that
hover that I have up here so let's undo
that save that so it's a nice way to
distinguish between things without
always having to add new classes to
things and all of that I don't need to
give all of my links at class I can just
say that all of my links inside of this
one thing have this style to it and when
I did this important link I'm gonna add
this class up here to a class important
link and the main reason is just to show
you even more that we can do with this
so if I have an important link and let's
just say the color is yellow it's
important so we really want it to stand
out and this one has become yellow but
this one hasn't become yellow even
though this one is an important link so
that's kind of weird right so what's
happening in this case is something
called specificity which I'm probably
saying wrong and I struggle at it so I'm
not going to keep repeating myself but
basically we can actually get a
calculator for this so it's a
specificity calculator CSS right here at
the top and what's happening is we have
our important link right here and our
other link is a our other selector that
we used is this one let's copy and paste
it so this link here is a link inside a
body text but it's also an important
link and what's happening is my a body
text space a is sort of with 11 points
so specificity and what it is it's how
specific our CSS is so what's happening
is this is worth all tags are worth
effectively one point is sort of how it
works and then all of my classes are
worth 10 points so if I had three
classes I'd have 31 just for an example
so even though I've put an important
link directly on that link it's not
coming in because this selector is
winning so my a body text is more
important than this one even though this
is an important link and that one should
be winning so that's kind of annoying
and can sometimes get these annoying
problems that come up so what I could
say here is that I have my important
link my important link is also let's
just do a comma and say that this is dot
what should I call that body whoops ha
dot dot body text space dot important
link so my important links inside of
body text and I look at that now they're
both the same come back to here and just
to show you this is now worth 20 points
because it's two different classes so I
guess I should have done this one up
here
so obviously this one which is 20 is
bigger than 11 so this one when
and I'll put a link to this in the
description below if you want to play
around with it a little bit but you can
imagine then if I have another Dave over
here that has another name and then my
important links aren't working and I
have to add another selector to it and
then another one and another one it can
get annoying so there is a way around
this and it's by putting a space and
then writing important but it's a super
important not to imbues important so I'm
going to save that and refresh and just
show you if you put important on
something it means it's just gonna
overwrite all the time pretty much so if
my important if I have my important link
is color yellow because this is
important it doesn't matter how specific
anything is this this is gonna overrule
any other CSS rule some people abuse
important and they start throwing it on
everything either they've done a bad job
of organizing their website or they've
done a bad job of organizing their CSS
and it just gets into this important
battle because then if you have two
things that are important that are on
the same thing you run into the same
problems that you had before so whatever
you do important is a last case scenario
like okay this is gonna get annoying and
I have to make a whole bunch of
selectors when I should only need one go
for it
most of the time you shouldn't need this
this is a last ditch like okay this one
thing needs it and that's it it's not
something you're gonna use all the time
and I can't emphasize that enough so
that's it that that's CSS selectors just
a little deeper dive into CSS like
there's nothing too crazy here I hope
you liked the video I hope you hit the
little like button right now you haven't
done it on any of my other videos hit
the like button if you haven't commented
in any of my other videos and you've
made it this far where like 15 videos in
or something like that if you haven't
commented yet and you've watched 15 of
them leave me a comment below and say
I've made it this far just let me know
even if you don't like them I'm guessing
you like them if your 15 videos in you
get the point let me know say hi say I
like the video or it's confusing or
anything you want to just give me some
feedback I really appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
