and this channel is all about learning
to build website and learning how to
make them look good while we're at it
this week we're gonna be looking at
writing better code by keeping it dry or
in other words don't repeat yourself and
at the same time at the end of the video
we're gonna look at a cool button effect
that we can try out too so let's get
started so what we're gonna do is I'm
gonna take a look here at a file I'm
gonna do sort of things the wrong way to
start with and then after that we're
gonna go through and look at a better
way of doing things now the one thing
that's really important to know is this
isn't like essential knowledge but I
think it's really good things to know
especially early on if you actually want
to do this as a living you're gonna need
to know this anyway and even if you're
just doing it as a hobby or you're
building you a little website right now
this is a really important thing to know
it's gonna make your life so much easier
it's going to make your lives just
better so let's get to it so as you can
already see on the screen I have a very
simple basic website here and if we take
a look at what I've done so far I just
have three sections here sections start
section middle section and each one has
a container inside of it and a heading
one heading to a paragraph and a little
link down at the bottom we can see that
there I haven't done too much in my CSS
but let's go jump in and just see what
I've already done
I'm bringing in a Google font bringing
in two comaat infant is this nice one up
here and then lotto or late oh let's
call it lotto right here
so Vlad I said to my body I've turned
the margined to zero on my body because
that always gets in our way
for my age ones I've put a comma on
infant put the weight up to 700 change
my font size to 75 pixels and just put
my margin to zero to get rid of a bunch
of extra space on my aged ones on the
h2s I've just made the font size a
little bit smaller got rid of some of
the margin that was on the top and made
sure the font weight was 400 so it's not
bold and my paragraphs I've just
increased the line height and the links
I've just switched the color over to
inherit for now because they looked
really
with that blue color the last thing I've
done is just putting my container here
with a width of 70% and margin:0 auto to
center it on my page now what I want to
do is I want to give each one of these
sections its own color so let's start by
doing this I want to set it up so it
looks nice but let's just start off with
the first one start and we need to come
in here any company with a background
color and I already have a few colors
picked out RGB 41 60 to 70 so that's the
color I want for that one over here in
the middle buddhu did you find my color
my middle I want to have a background
color of 150 for 199 150 95 I did
something wrong our GB there we go a
nice lighter version of that other one
and the last thing I want to do is my
end just to make it more interesting
let's give this one a
background-image:url is go back my image
folder and MTL dot g PG there we go a
nice picture of my hometown this sadly
I'm I'm a teacher and a lot of my
students give me files that look a
little bit like this let's just go and
fix the colors a little bit here to the
text is hard to read color I did have it
when white and we're here let's do
another color white so we can actually
read our text a little bit so I get
things like this for my students so
first off just going a little bit into
the whole making it look good thing make
sure you put some padding when you're
using background colors it looks
terrible when our things are stuck like
that so obviously what I could do now is
I can come to my Start and do padding
top
whoops I'm having some trouble here top
100 pixels ah that's better
and padding bottom 100 pixels ah there
we go that top ones looking a lot better
but now we got to go do that in the
middle one now so okay let's go to the
middle padding top 100 pixels padding
but bottom 100 pixels ah there we go
and oh I gotta go do that on my third
one now - wait a second this video is
all about not repeating ourselves we
don't want to repeat ourselves this is
getting repetitive and what if I decide
I don't like those I think it would look
better if it was smaller or bigger and
then I have to go and change them all oh
my goodness that's just way too much
work I am lazy keeping it dry lets us be
nice and lazy which I like a lot so I'm
going to bring that back down to there
and let's just make our life so much
easier
section all of these happen to be
sections and so section padding and
let's keep it even shorter 100 pixels
top and bottom and zero pixels left in
right there we go all of them get it in
one shot oh you know what that would be
better if it was 120 pixels all of them
update at the same time keeping it dry
I'm not repeating myself I'm only
putting my padding on one line of CSS
instead of spreading it out over each
one of my classes that needs it and it
makes my life so much easier for updates
and so much easier for changing things
so by doing something like this where
I'm just settling all my sections giving
them the same padding and I'm good to go
and then I go you know what this middle
one that one could actually use a
different from the rest
I want that middle one to be different
padding one that's a 250 0 whoop I did
that on my start I meant to do it a
middle but that's okay it shows you the
point anyway padding is different on
this one those ones so I can always
overwrite this if I need to but in this
case I don't need to so again keep them
all the same and I think that looks nice
and nifty and pretty good now if any of
you have used something like bootstrap
or foundation or anything though
frameworks that are out there you've
probably used a lot of dry stuff
especially with stuff like buttons and a
few other things as well and I love how
they treat buttons so I'm gonna do my
own buttons I treat my own buttons like
this normally anyway as long as I have
different types of buttons so you see
here I've made a link normal button a
link of ghost button and a link of
normal that last one should be normal if
that last one should be an awesome
button because I have my button awesome
class on there and again I see lots of
people who do this so they have their
first button so it's a stew of my button
normal and I am going to start display
let's give it a background color
I don't have one pre pick that's
actually a pretty good color so let's
try that out
save and there's my background okay I
need to do my text-decoration:none I
need to give it some padding say one M
two M's is usually a nice little balance
and the spacing is a bit off because I
need to change the display to
inline-block alright and that looks a
bit better okay that's actually pretty
good now my button normal let's come and
do a button normal hover I don't need to
change anything here actually
except my color let's just make it a
little bit darker and there we go I have
a nice little hover effect on my button
okay but now I need my Ghost button over
here so let's start there I want my BTN
Ghost I need this to be
display:inline-block
I need the text oh wait a second I'm
repeating myself again I don't want to
repeat myself so let's just delete this
and we'll come back to that in a second
it's something like display:inline-block
all my buttons need that
text-decoration:none I want that on all
of them
get out of there padding out of there
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make another class here and this if
you've used bootstrap or something is
something you might have seen
before is the button class so my button
will have a display:inline-block it will
have padding of one M two M's and it
will have a text Declaration of none and
now obviously it's not working properly
I actually am not using this class I
have to come back and I'm gonna have a
button and it's a button normal and I'm
stealing bootstraps naming convention a
little bit they don't have a button
normal but they have they always do
button button something that styles it
and I just like that for keeping the
consistency I know this this class works
with my button because it starts with
the little shorthand for my button so
I'll save my HTML file there and I'll
come back oh just saving it all of a
sudden these properties are applied so
we can see that it's working really
nicely and now let's just go and add
that BTN here BTN and let's come down
over to here and do another BTN and
let's come over to here and you can see
that padding is being applied here and
my inline block and the text decoration
is gone on all of them so my button is
this a global setting just like I was
using my sections before I was taking my
padding and applying it all of my
buttons need display:inline-block all of
my buttons I want this padding on it and
all of them are gonna get my text
decoration done and then I'm using
separate classes to style what they
actually look like and make them a
little bit different from one another so
now I can come down and do my BTN ghost
and this one's a border let's say two
pixels solid white the color is white
there we go and then I can copy hover my
border is actually gonna stay the same
but my background will change to white
and my color will change over to black
and I get a nice little hover effect on
that one and very little CSS I'm not
repeating myself again I'm doing
everything I can not to repeat myself
and it makes my life so much easier
so that's gonna go into my button
awesome now just again my button awesome
actually I'm gonna make it a lot like my
button normal I only need this one
button awesome let's just save that so
we can see my button over there and then
I can come in what I want to do for this
one and it's not really gonna work with
this background so let's just ditch the
background um should probably shouldn't
have used that background let's just
give it a nice let my color Pickers
having some trouble let's just give it a
nice light gray and if I'm doing that I
need to turn off there we go
and there's my button awesome there's my
button awesome oh I have my color set to
inherit but normal the color should
always be white on these and color white
I think that looks a little bit better
than that black that was coming through
and now let's do a BTN awesome hover
alrighty so for my button awesome hover
what do I want to do I want to give this
one I wanna make this one a little bit
different I'm gonna do a box shadow of
let's say two pics so no I want to do is
zero say Chi pixels down three pixel
blur and I want a negative three pixel
spread and let's give it a RGB a we want
black so it's blacks nice and easy and
maybe point six let's see what that
looks like
jiÃ¹ jiÃ¹ jiÃ¹ oh I don't want that am i
hover I want that let's just copy that
because I'm going to need a box shadow
anyway save oops
save means that too much hmm we barely
see it
0.75 what if I just put this to 0 for
now actually let's make that 4 and make
that negative 2 I want to see that
little shadow and I want to be subtle so
we see there's a shadow there it's
disappearing when I'm hovering it's a
really subtle shadow but that's sort of
the point and then what I want to do is
just delete this for now I want to
transform this and I want to do a
translate Y so I only wanted to move up
so transform lets me move things well
transform I get a lot of options
translate lets me move and translate Y
means I'm only moving it on the y-axis
so let's move it 10 pixels up and you
can see it's jumping 10 pixels so that's
you know kind of fun hover effect I
guess but not really what I'm going for
what I'm really going for is I want it
to look like it's moving but the shadow
stays in the same place so we have to
take our box shadow again fog shadow I
still want that to be zero pixels but
now I'm moving it up 10 so I'm gonna
take this my original shadow is down 4
pixels I'm gonna put this at 14
I'm gonna keep my blur the same and
let's just keep that the same for now
and my rgba is the same and let's just
see what that looks like now when I do
it so right away you can see it looks
like it's jumping up and the shadows
staying there it looks kind of weird
though so this is where it's really cool
I put the negative 2 on this just
because if it's at the zero for my
spread you can see the shadows sticking
out the sides a little little bit it's
super subtle but by putting it at
negative 2 ish
it's not sticking on the side so it's
only on the bottom so it looks like it's
a shadow sort of being cast on the
ground and now what I want to do is I
want to take that shadow and I want to
you know if something lifts in the air
the shadow sort of changes so I'm going
to do like a negative 10 maybe and now
you can see it looks actually this is
gonna have to be bigger straight 18 just
because this negative spread is sort of
playing with how that's working so now
let's make this blur a little bit bigger
to 8 so there you go it looks sort of
like the box is lifting up in the air
the only thing is it's on and off on and
off on and off on and off so it doesn't
look very realistic that something would
just hop up into the air that fast so
what we now need is a nice transition
I'm gonna transition all these in out
and do it over 250 milliseconds so
transitions if you don't know them is
just to take a whoops and that
transition shouldn't be here that
transition should be here it's taking
this state and we're transitioning all
the properties over 250 milliseconds and
we're easing the animation in and out
and now I get this nice little hover
effect so it's looking and this shadow
should probably become maybe we do point
six there so it gets a little lighter so
it looks like the box is moving up in
the air the shadow is sort of moving
down and away from it which is sort of
what would happen in real life
so it gives us the buttons lifting up in
the air like that you know fun little
effect that you can play around with and
there's a lot of cool stuff you can do
with that so I really encourage you to
play around with it and see if you can
come up with something that's a little
bit more fun or maybe more realistic I'm
doing this pretty fast but I'm pretty
happy with the result that we just threw
together now the last thing is this
transition could probably go and I could
put that on all my buttons and save and
then I get that nice transition here I
get the transition there and I get the
transition here so again don't repeat
yourself we want to keep the transitions
Oh
my buttons another thing you could do
which is kind of fun
if you're using your transitions for
everything a lot of the time we want our
transitions to be on everything is you
can put a nice little star up here which
selects everything and do a transition
and hit save and that should work for
absolutely everything except for some
pseudo elements so if you're using stuff
like before-and-after like I did in my
last video on navigation so you could
always check that out you'll have to set
this transition up to be on the before
and the after because if not this star
doesn't actually grab them because
there's pseudo elements you have to save
those err style those along with it so
this makes sure that everything on my
site has a transition as long as there's
a hover effect or whatever type of
effect that I might be after so that's
it again we're taking a look at putting
in some dry code trying not to repeat
ourselves and try to make it look good
with some transitions as well as I tried
to show you a few different button ideas
here and fun things you can do with
buttons that keep it out you know try
and stay away from too much of the norm
without making things too complicated so
just really nice skill if ever you see
yourself repeating the same code over
and over again you're putting the same
padding on everything come up with a
class just for padding that you can use
all the time
anytime I need something to have a
margin bottom of 50 okay well I'm
putting margin bottom of 50 on six
different things I'm gonna make my own
class for that and I'm just going to use
it everywhere all of my sections what
doesn't matter they're class they're all
getting the same padding well I'm gonna
go and just say all my sections have
that if I'm creating my own buttons I'm
gonna make my own default button that
just sets the foundation for my button
and then I'm gonna style my buttons
separately with their own classes on top
of that class there I really hope you
