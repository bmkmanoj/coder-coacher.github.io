before and after's pseudo elements the
before and after sewer elements are
really good ways to add extra style to
your website without adding extra markup
that you don't really mean the problem
is a lot of people don't understand
really what's going on when we're using
before and after and also the the power
that they actually have this video is
the part of a three-part series or enemy
exploring sewer element in this video
we're exploring how they actually work
in the next video we're gonna explore
the contents property a bit more and
just really what I can do in some of the
really cool stuff you can do with it
that you probably don't know about and
in the third video we're gonna be taking
a look at actually how to use it to
spice up your designs and to make some
really cool looking stuff so here we
have a super basic example where I have
a paragraph just sitting in the middle
of our page now I can select this
paragraph pseudo-element and there's two
of them there's the before and the after
sewer element so we have two of them
that we'll look at I can do the before
element by writing it out like that so
it's P double colon and the word before
as a side note you might see some
tutorials online or some mentions of it
with one colon like that technically
that's wrong the original specification
for it was written with just one when we
got the level 3 specification for it
it's when they they made it with the
double colon and it's to represent a
pseudo element whereas the single one
would be something like your a:hover so
that's a pseudo class so was when they
did the whole css3 thing level 3
specification for a lot of these things
they changed it from pursuit they
changed it to distinguish pseudo
elements from pseudo classes so
technically this is the right way to do
it but browsers still support it with
one just because they don't want to
break all of the old stuff and how it
used to be done so they support both of
them so to actually use a pseudo element
I can do a whole bunch of stuff in here
and nothing's gonna happen so just to
show you if I do like background red
display:block position:absolute top:0
bottom
zero left:0 right:0 I do all this stuff
and nothing is actually happening I
can't see anything and it's because
there's no it doesn't exist yet my
pseudo element is not there so what I
need to do to actually get a pseudo
element to work is add content and just
do that for now I just put two little
quotation marks single or double and all
of a sudden it works so its
position:absolute to the page top bottom
it's just covering everything I'm gonna
take just display:block we'll leave it
like that for now and I'm just gonna do
with I don't know ten pixels and we'll
give it a height of ten pixels and we
should see a little red thing up here
there we go so content tells it that
well there should be some content if we
don't add this it defaults to none and
no matter what you try you can't use it
as I mentioned earlier on I'm going to
have a whole video talking about what
the content property is for now we just
need to know we need to include it there
now to understand what's really going on
we're gonna jump into our dev tools
because a lot of people this is what a
lot of people don't really actually
understand so here in my dev tools I
have my paragraph and I'm gonna open up
this paragraph and we're gonna see that
there's a before inside of it so let's
just make that a bit bigger I'm gonna
zoom in so we can see that here's the
content itself and here's my little
before thing that I just created
now the misconception that a lot of
people have is they think that when
we're using P before it's something
that's being inserted before the
paragraph itself but that's not true
it's getting inserted before the content
of that paragraph or if you're it's on a
div it to be the content of that div so
it's the same story with after so if I
take the exact same code I already have
here so there we go if I take all of
this and I copy it and then I paste it
and add an after here and we'll see that
pop in in one second and so before my
content of my paragraph and the last one
is after the content of my paragraph so
it's all included inside the paragraph
itself and that's
main misconception people have a lot of
the a lot of the time especially at the
beginning people think it's coming
before the paragraph and after the
paragraph and that isn't what's
happening it's important to understand
that especially when you start styling
stuff with it because a lot of them time
they're going to be using some
position:absolute on these and knowing
how that works is really important so
I'm just gonna close this off and I'm
actually going to add in my HTML here
I'm gonna add an image it won't be going
anywhere I'll just do what alright would
just be a placeholder on splash it 500
by 500 and the reason I'm doing this is
it's really important to know that
sometimes it would be really useful to
add a pseudo element to an image you
can't do it so just to show you here if
I do so I'm gonna do my image for let's
say content there's nothing once again
just a blank content display block with
100 pixels height 100 pixels and
background of purple nothing shows up on
the screen and if I do an inspect on
that we're gonna see that on my image
there's nothing there's no before or
after or anything like that and this is
because there is no content or perhaps a
better way to think about it is that the
image is the content images are
something called replaced elements which
are weird and really confusing and I'm
not gonna get into that now except just
to say that they don't really fit into
the typical content model of CSS the
images source is the content so they
behave differently so and I'm talking
about this because one time I went on
for a long time trying to figure out why
am i before wasn't working on an image
and I couldn't figure what the hell I
was doing wrong I don't want that to
happen to you so don't try putting
pseudo elements on images it will not
work but with that out of the way let's
I'm gonna change my content here on my
before let's just take this after off we
don't need it right now I'm gonna just
take my width and head out for this so I
have nothing much but I'm gonna add in
here I'm gonna write hello and you can
see hello shows up and actually let's
take off the display a block as well
there we go hello
you can see that the hello is showing up
and it has a red background on it and
it's there and that's cool I can write
stuff before so again it's showing up
before this and I can style this however
I want I can give this its own font size
font size of say 8 10 pixels font weight
of 800 maybe tens a little small logo 20
and there you go just yeah you can style
this completely separately from the
other stuff so that's kind of
interesting now you probably won't be
necessarily writing things like hello
but we're gonna see more useful options
of this and of course if I take this
exact same thing just like I did before
and I switch it to after we'll get the
same thing over there maybe this could
say goodbye so you can see where the
elements are fitting in there and one
thing you may have noticed is that these
pseudo elements are in line by default
they're lining up with the content
itself but of course I can change that
display block and now they're block
level and they'll each take up there
oops that's on this one copy paste and
now they're both block level elements
you can already see a little bit of how
I could use this maybe as a design
element instead of putting in text and
the cool thing with before and after is
it lets us add some really neat things
without needing the extra markup that
you know you might need for this
especially for design elements where you
don't really want to be inserting gives
just you know I have an empty div just
for a design element I don't have to do
that I can use my before and after to do
that yeah they caught them the content
property is something that you can do
some really cool extra stuff that I
don't see a lot out there so I'm
assuming people don't even know that
it's available so we're gonna check that
in the next video and as I mentioned
we're also going to take a more global
look at awesome ways we can actually use
this but before we can really do that
this video I think was instrumental
because you need to understand what's
actually going on before you can do that
and there you have it I hope you have a
better understanding of what the before
and after pseudo elements actually are
and how they work
