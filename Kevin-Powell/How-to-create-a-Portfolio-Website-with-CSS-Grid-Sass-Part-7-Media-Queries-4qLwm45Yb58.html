we're working on our portfolio website
using the CSS grid in this video I'm
building in the media queries to make
everything responsive so there are a
number of things to do in the site if we
go and just take a look I haven't done
the navigation yet and I haven't done
the pop-up that's gonna happen when we
click on our projects those will all be
done in future videos what I'm gonna do
now is just focus on we've already done
to make it responsive then in the next
video I think I'm gonna do the this
pop-up thing and then in the last video
we'll be taking a look at the navigation
that's sort of my plan of action right
now and we'll see how that goes there's
not too much I think that have to be
done the main things they're gonna be
interesting are taking a look at this
area because this gets completely
redesigned at the larger screen size if
you remember we have it looking like
whoops we have it looking like that
right now and of course this area which
is going to get redesigned to look like
that
quite simply actually and over here the
contact form which gets redone to go
like that so I don't think it'd be
anything too complicated we have a few
font size changes and other things to do
as well so you might as well jump into
that one thing I just want to check
right now my font size there was tore
that wasn't so 2088 yeah it was bigger
and 160 it's almost double when we get
to that screen size all right
and I have all these saved as assets
that's 50:32 okay so everything's pretty
much getting bigger cool
so the first thing we do is on my body
um let's come in here and just do an ad
whoops not there we're going to come
right in here and do it at media man
width and we're use 50m and 50m comes
out to about 800 pixels so I think I'm
just sort of guessing at that but I
think it's a number that I'm gonna that
will work well on this but we might
modify that as we go I could build this
a mixin or something to do it because I
do think I'll be using this in a number
of places yeah but for the moment let's
just try it out so the font size will
change 21.125 REM i save that nothing
here should change the big difference
will be in the bodies font size there
you go we can see right away this font
size here gets bigger so let's just
shrink that back down we can see it
that's at a pretty good spot actually I
like where that's switching cool so we
do have a few other things that we want
to change to the font size of my h1
should change so you know what let's
make a mixin for my media query here so
we're gonna go into my modules and into
my mix-ins and we're gonna call it that
mix in what should we call this one I'm
just going to mq for media query and it
will have a variable that I'm going to
put on this so it's going to be a width
but I will give it the default of 50m so
if I don't put anything it will default
to that and what that mixin is going to
do is it's going to give us an at media
with a min width of with
and then what we do is hearing in at
content and what that at content lets us
do is it lets us add in content in there
because obviously that makes sense to
have so we could definitely come up with
more powerful mix-ins for you know you
we could have one for individual screen
sizes and have it all sort of work
magically and and with some variables
and it can work really cool but for a
simple website like this i think this
one will be more than enough so let's go
and make sure that's actually working um
so here it would be just take all of you
off and it would be at include media
query it's let's just make sure it's
still working and there we go it's still
working awesome
good good good so that would just make
our life a little bit faster too right
so right here on my h1 and you know what
that's not there that is my welcome in
my welcome section I'd nested in h1 so
that had the font size there so what
we're going to do is let's just come in
here and add my @include media query and
we're gonna say that the font size it's
gonna pretty much double so I'm just
going to put it up to three and see what
that looks like
oops I did it like that oh I had my span
that's okay the span is the bottom part
then okay all right
obviously get rid of that let's do a
save and so on the span we will have
this and let's move it up to 10 and see
what happens yeah that's probably it a
bit too big what I'm wondering is
instead of doing it like that maybe what
I'll do is let's make it so it switches
over to like will try viewport width
instead so when it clicks now it should
grow with the screen
cool good good good anything why don't
we do the exact same thing on you but
we'll switch that over to like three
might be kind of small let's see what
happens you know what that works out
pretty perfectly awesome make be getting
a little bit big on a really big screen
so I'm actually gonna bring that down to
like a 2.5 and a 7
that'd be too small it's kind of small
you know what let's just let it get
really big and if you're doing this for
your own or you what you're sort of
boring from this this is it's gonna get
massive mm-hmm this is where a max font
size little thing would be really really
handy I'm gonna leave it like that but
if you find that it's getting too big
you could always add another media query
just to stop it from growing when you
get to the really really big sizes
definitely an idea for that but I'm
happy with how that's working one thing
that just by pure luck on that really I
got is that when we hit the media query
the barely barely changed now that
people are often playing around but it
just so it really worked out well on
that one actually cool so that's done
let's move down the only thing here that
I need to really change is the font size
of making it happen
and I believe that's just my age too yep
so we can go back to my
bass and by h2 is to ram I'm gonna go
back to my design just to look so the
original size of that was 32 which is
exactly 2 so that's kind of good
whoops and we got it up to a 50 here not
quite double okay so my h2 we can do an
@include media query and the font size
will become will do 3.5 Ram it's a
little bit too big I think that's gonna
do better yeah I'm liking that good good
good so that's done so these first ones
are really easy I don't want to spend
too much time on them because I do want
to focus more on the grid stuff which is
where we're at and now so when I get to
my breaking point
right there we do want this to change so
let's go look back at this and see so I
and let's move this over so we can
compare what it looks like now and what
we want it to look like so I want the
title to go from down here to moving up
I want this to move from over here to
going over in this empty area and I want
all the text just shift up into that
empty area as well and I'm wondering now
we're gonna have to see with this one a
little bit that means and we'll see what
it works with this media query we might
have to play around with that one a
little bit so that would be the about me
yeah that makes sense right about me
okay so I think let me just think here
for a second I'm gonna go the about the
picture the picture is gonna change a
little bit just move I'm gonna make this
a bit smaller so the picture right now
let's go find my about image just has a
max height on it and nothing else and
this is for my floats to make sure my
floats were working
so I'm not gonna touch that one because
that's one of my fall backs about image
I just want to see did I do
a do I have me about image here so I
have it doing one over to for my row so
I'm gonna change how that row is working
because I don't want it to do that I
actually wanted to take up all the rows
the reason I wanted to have it take up
all the rows is because just trying to
think I want to take up all the rows
because I want to make sure that nothing
comes underneath it nothing has the
potential of even trying to come
underneath it so if I do my at include
media query and I change the grid row to
one over four
I think that's not what I thought would
happen but that's okay oh this is moving
up let's do a little inspect so we can
see the grid so now you can see that the
image is taking up for when it's
starting on there's one two three four
lines there so that's why the name the
name which is on one of two one of two
there it's aligning self to the end so
it's going to the end but it's going to
the end of that the of itself so it's
not actually really moving so I maybe I
was wrong with this let's take this off
for now I do want that to go up and I
want the other things to move okay so
anyway let's put that back I want the
name to be up there I also want that
name to be bigger we'll get back to that
in a second
I want my name to be there and I want
this now to come up and to go over here
instead so I want to change this this is
I want both of these not to go from port
start to port end anymore
I want these at include media query
instead of going from the port start to
the Portland so this was my port start
all the way to port end I wanted to go
to the starting at the image end
and going over to the end so the grid
column is going to change grid column is
image and over port and ha there we go
cool good good good so that worked so
that's bringing it into that space over
here I'm gonna have to put a little
margin on that to make that work
properly but that's working cool cool
cool that looks pretty good now I have
the problem of some things overlapping
that I don't want to be overlapping
so why the title is 1 over 2 so that's
fine and the text and subtitle
why is everything starting at the top
there so let's just move let's just make
sure that here grid Row start to pop up
that moved my title and not my title
that moved my subtitle down oh but then
they're both starting at the same place
so let's save that I'm gonna have to add
some stuff here so we're gonna have to
say my about subtitle is a grid row of
two over three because this is line one
to two so line two is right under
portfolio so I want to start that one at
two to three so if I save that it will
move down now what's happening is this
is sort of forcing its way at the top so
we also have to say that my about text
is a grid row of 3 over 4 ah there we go
cool so I'm saying this one is going the
titles going from 1 to 2 this one's
going from 2 to 3 and this one's going
from 3 to 4 I don't think we'd normally
run into those problems but we have to
overcome the things that aren't in our
media query and I think that was causing
a little bit of issues with everything
so here we can also add a margin left of
1m whoops margin right of 1 it know
about image Oh what am i doing margins
for when I'm working with the grid I
didn't put this on before I didn't put
this on before I should have just used
grid gaps before I think I'm just
worried that's gonna cause a bit of an
issue so I'm going to say actually let's
just see what happens if I do a column
what I need to do a grid grid column gap
I think I can do it when in might be a
bit too big and I'm just worried that
might cause issues at the small screen
sizes no we look ok there
and then it pops up like that cool and I
just want to see it the big big big
screen size yeah that looks alright
right let's close this down I think that
looks pretty nice I just need to make
this his name a lot bigger and otherwise
I'm pretty happy actually with how that
looks that looks really really nice and
this is what I like about the grid we
can do this my gap is too big but it's
you know these overlapping things and
more interesting layouts and being able
to rearrange layouts without really that
many lines of code let's make this point
five maybe yeah it's a bit more what I
want and this I believe is my h1 so
let's go to my base h1 @include media
query font size of 5 r and 4.25 Rim I'll
go with that
so that looks nice and then it gets
smaller and then it goes down underneath
how I wanted it I like it a bit more
when it's broken on two lines but I'm
not going to force it we could always
server BR in there if we really wanted
to have it cool cool cool good awesome
and this this is already changing font
sizes just because it's an h2 so they're
they're following just why that one was
already bigger so that's all done
awesome now let's move down to this one
because this is just getting way too big
now now this is one of the places where
I think it actually is a really really
there's a really cool thing we could use
but it's not really gonna work in this
case but I'm gonna show you what it is
anyway because I love it but then what
we're gonna do is actually a lot simpler
so we can close about me that's done
that should be done that should be done
base I'm going to leave open just in
case we need to jump in here and we're
gonna go over to my portfolio so the
really cool thing let's just find where
the
grid is in here so in my grid right now
I have it just repeating two columns
with one fr each what we could do is
instead of having something like that we
could have repeat and do an auto fit
let's just make this a little bigger so
we can see what I'm doing auto fit and
then we can even do like a min/max on
here so I'm in max of say I'll just do
pixel values for now 160 pixels 160
pixels that's easy that's 10 so 10 M + 1
fr so it has a minimum size of 10 a
maximum size of 1 fr and it's just going
to fit as many as it can in that space
so you might like how it can do this
because you can see like I have the 4
here and then my big one there's enough
room it's gonna sort of rearrange it
automatically I just don't like you
because they get this empty space down
here if you don't mind that you don't
even need a media query and you can
adjust these numbers obviously maybe we
can make our minimums a bit bigger but
and then it rearranges to the sort of
the style but then still I'm getting
this happening cuz I can they're their
minimum size so they're sort of stacking
there but if you had a lot of items this
could definitely work and I really
really like how this this functions you
can do some really nice stuff with it
but in our case we're just gonna do
something and include media query and
we're gonna say that the grid template
columns is gonna change to a 4-1 fr so
nothing too complicated but pretty much
I want four columns instead of two
columns so what's gonna happen is we go
like that and then when we get to that
point well it goes like that and then
that's just gonna keep going
I know I built in the media query that
stops it from being full screen and I
did that mostly for my floats so we
could get rid of that but I kind of like
having the space around it now that I'm
seeing it and I'm also afraid that this
image would have gotten too
big if not so I sort of liked the fact
that it is stopping at a maximum size I
think I think it looks a little bit
better and I'm actually debating if I
should use a grid gap on this 0.5 M
let's just say make that bigger we can
go all the way up to one I'm wondering I
I said I didn't like it when I did it
last time
no I still don't still not in love with
it but it is kind of cool that you can
do that but I'm gonna stick with just
like I said last time I was working on
this I'm gonna stick with it having no
gap cool
so that was disgustingly easy and fast
so sorry if you're expecting something
more exciting for that but this is why
the grid works better than flexbox in my
opinion is just because we can go from
having two columns to having four
columns with one line of code like oh
that's and and having this big box maybe
there's a way of doing that in Flex box
that I couldn't figure out but my
goodness that's just this I find the
amount of code you write is so much less
it's it's insane what you're using this
depending on the lay what you're doing
obviously but you really leads to being
able to do a lot less coding cool so
portfolios done we're down to the
contact so over here in the contact
let's go and check out how we built that
we did it we using we're in my contact
right though I thought that I built-in I
just used I display flex okay
that's fine but we need to build in so
actually it's all gonna be my media
query then that's cool I got a little
lazy on that when I didn't really first
see my media query so I think what I'm
gonna do so let's just see the forms
display flex so that's fine and that's
gonna stay like that and what we're
gonna do is let's do our at supports
display grid and we're gonna change this
to display grid and I don't think
anything will change good but we're
gonna build in some grid template areas
so grid template areas so at the normal
screen size it's really really simple
we're gonna have a name I'm just going
to name name email and message right so
if I did that correctly oh we need
somewhere for the button to so I'm gonna
do is a dot space button so the dot
means that it's an empty space I don't
need the dot I'm listening to button I
think we can just do it like this and
even we might as well just there we go
line it all up so just to make sure this
worked though I need to do this yeah
we're doing a tutorial series normally I
don't think we'd I'm sort of adding
unnecessary code in here this is we're
using flexbox is shorter and I'm really
sorry I forget your name someone just
asked me why I didn't use the grid for
the entire thing and it's because you
don't need to use the grid for the
entire thing in something like this it
really depends on the layout but
everything is just stacking one on top
of each other it's a two-dimensional
sort of section by section there's no
need to really use it and you can see
here I'm trying to build in grid
template areas I got my layout to work
like this with two lines of code pretty
much so now I'm coming in with this and
it's getting really complicated and why
would I be bothering with this so I'm
not you know just said it yeah why would
I be doing all this work when I can get
it to work with Flex box like that it
doesn't really make sense but we will do
the media query in here but I'm gonna
delete all my grid areas for a second
and let's add in our @include media
query and let's move you
into here okay
so if it supports grid when we get to
our media query it's going to work and
we're gonna have a few areas we're gonna
have name email then we're gonna have
message message whoops I'm sort of
screwed that up it's like this and I
like spacing it out just so you can see
more of how things are lining up so
message message and then nothing space
let's do button here and I'll put my
there we go
so if you put a period when you're doing
grid template areas it just means it's
an empty area I don't know if I could
probably do button button cuz the way
I've set it up but we might as well just
ensure that we have a little empty all
right over there and we can keep going
so that's on my form so we're also going
to want to do okay so I actually did I
give these classes I have to go check
out my index for a second here label how
many of these classes to class equals
name just because it's easier to select
stuff I could select based on the
attribute but email message good good
good
this is button I'm gonna also add form
button just as maybe I should have form
in front of all of them this is sort of
a precaution making sure that if I did
have a button somewhere else on the site
that what I'm about to do wouldn't style
it so that's good okay so you know I'll
be a bit lazy here I'm just gonna nest
everything it's getting super nested
it's sort of bad practicing but we'll do
it anyway so we have a my name my grid
area on that one should be name
then I have my that I save you save name
email grid area is email and I just
realized that wasn't we should be
checking to make sure this is working
act cool yeah it's okay
this should sort of sort itself out in a
second then we have my message grid area
message and my button how's the grid
area button hack awesome and the easy
way to fix that grid gap one em and we
have my spacing cool we have too much
spacing there though so this will be a
grid column gap only there we go so it's
not adding space up and down and my
message text area should have a height
of like 10m sure why not that looks good
again I don't I I probably could have
had this as button button and I think it
would have worked just the same but
there we go Oh interesting I would have
thought they would have been equal sized
by default and not that whoa that's
weird that they're doing that display
grid grid column is when fr 1fr there we
go
why is email so much longer than you
know it's still not working
it's splitting it properly but when I
resize it's going whacky so there hmm
okay guys so I've just opened this up
you might notice a small difference in
Firefox nightly cuz I was in chrome and
I couldn't figure out what was going on
so with Firefox it seems to be working
fine even if I go back to my 1fr 1fr I
don't seem to be having that weird
resizing issue at all it's just working
exactly how I'd expect it to I tried a
whole bunch of stuff let's see so go
back to exactly where we were I'm pretty
sure yeah so I'm wondering if that's
some weird bug that's popping up so what
I'm gonna try and do is just say that on
here I have it set to width 100% I'm
also going to give it a min width of say
like 20 M which is just over 300 hots
gonna scrub my button do I have to then
min-width okay I don't really like
having to do that actually that might be
even be too big right because that's
gonna make it will do like 15 even just
to be safe 15 might even be too big
let's see what happens if I do 15 so it
seems to be okay and let's go back to
Chrome and see what's going on in chrome
now so it's still bugging out in weird
ways but it hopefully won't shrink all
the way down now yeah it seems it's
stopping at that minimum width that I
wanted it to so now I'm getting
side-scrolling because of what
because I have this phantom freaking box
sticking out the side of my screen undo
undo undo save refresh so it's all good
again that's gonna shrink that down is
it giving me the side-scrolling no let's
put those back in you know like my
contact box even is getting these weird
things going on I've never had a problem
like this like even this is stopping
here now even you can see the background
on it's not filling up that whole space
yeah so weird um but yeah I'm pretty
happy with how that's turned out so
let's just double check in and since I'm
in another browser Coolio
so that's looking good I'm happy with
how this works on the large screens now
I hope you're happy too really sorry
about this bug I spent a long time off
screen trying to figure out what was
going on and I still have no idea so if
you do know please please please let me
know as I mentioned in the next video
we're going to look at doing the pop-up
thing so making this thing show up I'm
gonna do one video where I design it and
then the second video is going to be
doing the JavaScript and then we'll do
the navigation and then the first video
will be just actually that one might be
just in one because that's styling of
the navigation I can't imagine will take
me too much time and that is it I hope
you liked this video if you did please
hit the thumbs up if you have any
questions or if you know how to fix my
weird bugged out contact forum please
let me know in the comments down below
and until next time don't forget to make
your corn in the Internet just a little
bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
