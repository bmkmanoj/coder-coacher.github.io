beginner series my name is Kevin and
this is a little bit of a long video
compared to some of my other ones we're
looking at text properties and well how
to style our text using CSS and there's
a lot of different things we can do I've
tried just a stick to the big ones the
most important ones but there are a lot
but I'm doing my best to make them ones
that you know matter these are the ones
you need to know to really be able to
handle your text properly and typography
is so important when in the world of web
to actually make websites look good so I
try and show you you know the good the
bad and the ugly and best practices for
some things just to help you out and
make your life a little bit easier but
I've already said this is a long video
and this is turning into a long intro so
let's just get to it
so as you can see here I've set up we
have our pages like we did before but I
just I give us a new page here just with
a few paragraphs on it an h1 at the top
right here styling text and an h2 with a
little you know it's my little subtitle
with the paragraphs here underneath so
I'm gonna jump over to my CSS cuz this
is where all the real magic is gonna
happen in this video we've already
looked at a little bit of styling text
in our previous videos we've changed
font sizes and we've changed colors in
this video we're going to be doing a
whole bunch of other stuff before we
really get into this I just want to say
I'm only looking at the basics of
styling text I'm not gonna dive really
deep into it there's lots and lots and
lots of font properties that we can
modify and I really don't want to
overwhelm you at this point a lot of
them are for some extra stuff that right
now you know it would just be like why
is he showing me this I'm never gonna
remember it the other thing is at first
because there are so many properties it
can be a little bit overwhelming and it
can seem like you're never gonna
remember them all
I teach HTML and CSS to classes and so
when we're in class some of my students
sometimes they're just when I'm first
introducing these things they they're
overwhelmed they go there's no way I'm
gonna remember this and within a day of
doing it it's second nature repetition
repetition repetition and you'll have it
down pat so you know
if you're watching me do this and going
holy crap there's too much your practice
a little bit and you'll be surprised at
how fast you remember at all so with
that out of the way let's jump to it the
first thing I want to talk about is font
families and something we call font
stacks so when you first put in text I
never told this what font we want to use
I have a font size and I have colors set
up here but I've never told it what the
font family in one news and obviously it
has to render text it's just going to a
system default some systems will have
different defaults so right now this is
going to look different on different
computers and I don't even know what
it's going to look like in other
computers is it a serif is it a saw
serif probably all serif fonts just like
it is now but you can't be sure it
depends on the person's computer this
system defaults and all of that so it's
usually a good idea to say what font you
actually want to be using so I'm gonna
come up here my body if we remember my
because everything is in my body any
styles I put on here cascade down and
apply to everything inside of it so if I
come here and I've already done this
before but font family family saw serif
I'm gonna save that and it turns into a
saw serif font and in this case it's the
fog Arial because I'm on a PC and if I
was on a Mac it would probably be held
Etica so if you're working on a Mac it
might look a little different but you
should have a saw serif font but you
know it's kind of boring just saying
serif or saw serif what if we want to do
something you know you what if you
actually want to choose what font you
want to use well we have to be a little
bit careful with that we actually have
we can't use any font you you might have
gone to a website and downloaded some
really cool-looking font you can't just
use any font like that you need to use
fonts that somebody else has on their
computer as well so as an example let's
switch this over
- Kelly Brie that's a font I save that
and refresh and that's turned into
Calibri now the only problem is Calibri
is a system font on PCs and not all Macs
come with Cleary so if I did Calibri
like that it might not work on a Mac
it's possible some some Mac's obviously
will have it but there's a good chance
that it doesn't actually work and you
know if it doesn't work it could fall to
a you know let's let's come up with a
font that is popular on Macs but which
isn't popular on PCs like huge I don't
have future on my computer most Mac's
come with future is a font on their
computer and so if you're on a Mac and
you try that it will probably look like
future which is a serif font you can see
it's looking like my default if I don't
even have a font family now and I save
that I it looks exactly the same because
my computer can't find Futura it's just
not working I can't use it and I can't
see anything
and well that sucks because I really
don't want it to look like this so to
stop problems like this from happening
we use something called a font stack
which means I can say Futura put a comma
and then I can come down and say saw
serif and what this is going to do is if
future it doesn't work my computer can't
find Futura it's going to just go and
default over to another whatever the
system defaults a serif is so future is
not working but it's going over to Arial
which is my default saw serif font on my
computer but you know it's annoying
trying to figure out the whole font
stacks because in general you don't want
just a future doesn't load saw serif
comes in you can actually get quite
complete with your font stacks the other
thing that you might not be too sure
about or what you know what fonts I have
on my computer our system fonts and what
are fonts that other people might not
have so I'm going to give you guys a
link it's in the description below and
it's a super handy site called CSS font
stack calm and it does exactly what you
think it would it's pretty much groups
thing serif font Oh Sarah saucer serif
mono spaced fantasy and script and the
cool thing about this is it tells you
what computers are running on the font
so if you take Ariel for example well
pretty much every system is running
Ariel 99% of Windows computers and 98%
of Macs have it whereas if you go with
some font like avant-garde well only 1%
of all computers or even using
avant-garde so you probably won't have
someone and you know maybe that's not
your best bet
um in general you want to pick a font
that most people are going to see
because you want to make sure that the
site actually you know people are seeing
the font you chose but the nice thing
about this lets go with the colibri here
where I have most Windows computers have
it but not all of them and some Mac's
have it so it's a pretty safe one and I
just click this little icon right here
and it's going to copy that onto my page
will minimize that down and I'm gonna
delete that oh it took the whole thing
okay
delete even the font family and just hit
command V to paste and you can see I'm
gonna stretch this out to see the whole
stack that it gave me so it's doing
Calibri and if Calibri doesn't load its
gonna do Kundera and if kandar doesn't
load its gonna do ps-aguié sigelei and
if that doesn't load say you 8ui if that
doesn't load Optima if Optima doesn't
work Ariel and God forbid Ariel doesn't
work it's going to go to the system
defaults a serif font and the idea here
is if Calibri doesn't load find
something really really similar to it so
this is the closest font they have to it
and if that doesn't load let's go to the
next closest and if that doesn't load
let's go to the next closest and the
next closest and eventually we give up
and just say ok make sure your saw serif
you'll also notice here there's some
differences in coloring
more importantly this one here is in
quotation marks basically when you're
writing out your fonts if it's one word
so Calibri one word you can just write
Cleary if the font has more than one
word in it one font that most of you
probably know as Times New Roman so we
can't just write Times New Roman it gets
confused you see even the coloring of
its off and everything so you just have
to put it in quotation marks if you're
choosing a font that is more than one
word and everything will be fine and
those quotation marks can also be single
so single or double quotation marks as
long as it's the same you know not a
single the start and a double at the end
it's either a single or double and so I
don't want it to be Times New Roman
we're gonna go with Calibri and save
that and I'll come back and refresh and
there we go
now just like let's shrink this back
down so we can see my page at the same
time just like with font size we can
overwrite things our color so for
example my color here on my body is this
dark color but my h1 is using this
brighter blue I can come onto my h1 and
say I want a different font family
actually let's come back to CSS font
stack calm and let's pick another one
I'm gonna go with a let's go with a slab
serif and see what it happens and
refresh and there we go my slab surf
comes in so my h1 is using a VAT font
and over here we have my Calibri on my
other fonts there now another thing
you'll notice is there's a lot of
spacing that's automatically here and
that spacing is automatically put on all
of our text so all of our headings have
a spacing and all of our paragraphs have
a spacing and the way all of those
spaces are created is with margin top
and margin bottom so if you remember
margin creates empty space around things
we're
pushing things away so by putting a
margin on the top and bottom it's
creating spaces around it and it's
usually for pretty much all of them
except the h1 equal to the font size so
this space here is roughly the same or
exactly the same as the font size H once
it's a little bit less but more or less
just think whatever the default is
whatever my font size is is the space
between so I see that I have a really
big space here and I don't really like
that space so I can come on to my h1 and
I can say that the margin bottom is 0
pixels I'm gonna save that and hit
refresh and they get a little bit closer
together but it's clearly not zero and
the reason for that is I got there's no
margin left on my h1 here there's no
space underneath but my h2 here has a
space on the top still so all of my text
has a margin top and a margin bottom by
default so what I can come down and do
is now my h2 so I'm going to select my
h2 I'm gonna choose the margin top this
time and put that one to zero and I'll
do pixels for consistency and hit
refresh and now they're pretty much
stuck together now I'm not saying that's
the best thing to do but I just want to
show you that the spacing is always
caused by the margins so just for fun if
I go to my paragraph so I'm going to
select my paragraphs and say margin
bottom let's just do 50 pixels for fun
save it will create bigger spaces
between my margins and if I make that 10
pixels I get smaller spaces except I
still have my margin top and I'll do
margin the top zero pixels the reason
I'm doing zero on the top is right now
let's just delete that for a second my
margin bottom is 10 so my margin bottom
is very small but this paragraph here
still is a big margin on the top but I'm
going to take the margin top off all my
paragraphs and this is something that's
pretty standard to do
you just remove the margin top so you
can control your spaces with just the
margin bottom there we go so I have a
small space if I move that up to 20 I
have a bigger space and if I bring it
all the way up to 50 I have a much
bigger space so for now let's just bring
that back down to 20 pixels so we were
just looking at the space between our
paragraphs but what about the space
between our lines now anyone who's
coming from a print background or a
design background probably knows the
space between our lines in that world is
called letting in the web world that's a
little bit different the name of it's
different and the way it functions same
purpose function we'll get into a little
bit later but it's pretty
straightforward and it's called line
height and I don't want to do that on my
age one actually we want to do that on
our paragraphs let's just bring that
there so on my paragraphs line height so
this is let's just say this is 40 pixels
and I'm gonna come here and refresh and
now there's a really big space between
my lines the weight line head is
calculated as it looks at the middle of
a line so I'm going to start the middle
of this line and it's like right right
in the middle of the letters and it's
gonna put 20 pixels on the top and 20
pixels down on the bottom that's how it
works and it equally distributes it from
the center of the text 20 pixels top 20
pixels bottom to give me a 40 pixel line
height works much much like letting does
in the end even though the calculation
of it's a little bit different so if
you're if you're copying a Photoshop
file or something the letting number and
the line height will match up so the
bigger I make my line height the more
space I have and the smaller I make my
line height the less space between my
lines have so now they're sort of
crushing up against each other now you
can do this in a pixel value if you want
but I'm much prefer doing it just as
without a unit so if I just do one and I
save that it's going to make my line
height equal to my font size so right
now my font size is 21 pixels that we
put up on our body
line-height of one means that it's the
exact same thing so the lines are a
little too close together in general a
line height of one doesn't work well
until you're in big font sizes or all
cap text but one and then so if I do
1.25 I'll get a little bit more space if
I jump that all the way up to 2 I'll
start getting double spacing which looks
ugly as well
so in general we want to use something
between 1 &amp;amp; 2 ones usually too small
unless you have very big fonts in which
case you might want to start using it
and 2 is generally speaking too big so
let's just do 1.4 for now and that looks
pretty nice just go based on what looks
good especially when you're just
learning it the next couple ones are a
bit easier to remember and they all go
with the font group so we have font and
you guys know font size already let's
just change this so we can see it whoops
so we can see it change so my fonts get
bigger or smaller so we have font size
another one that we have and the nice
thing just jump back to line height now
that I changed my font size the line
height change with it because it's 1.4
if this had been say 25 pixels before
let's delete that save so that doesn't
look too bad it's looking okay but if I
change my font size to 30 pixels now
you'll see that the line height isn't
very good anymore the letters are
starting it's smushed together a bit so
another reason to just go with things
like 1.4 at 1.5 or whatever number you
want without a pixel value just so if
you do change the font size the line
height automatically changes with it so
yeah we've seen font size and you'll
also notice what I'm doing font and
getting all of these things and I'm not
going to get into all of them because
there's just a bunch here and a lot of
them are very obscure so I'm going to
show you the big ones
there's font style whoops and you might
use a font style we have italic makes my
text italic you also have oblique
and you'll notice a small change there
so let's just undo this
I'm gonna save I'm gonna hit refresh but
look at my text while I do this
you'll notice a small change there um
you might notice a bigger difference
with serif fonts in general you won't
really use oblique as much as italic
oblique is sort of a fake italic sort of
designers out there might be yelling at
me a little bit but just figure obliques
a bit like a fake italic whereas italic
is a real one it's usually a nicer
option and if there is no italic version
it can go to an oblique anyway just use
italic if you want italic text you know
you want your text tilted over a little
bit font-style:italic and you'll get
your italic nice and easy
we have font weight font weight and
you'll see here bold so that probably
does what you expect it to you probably
also saw there is bolder and that should
look probably the same right now
boulders a weird one what it's going to
do is take whatever current font weight
you have and make it one step bolder
than it was and the reason for that is
there is a font there's light and
lighter so light normal and I don't have
a light version of this font let's try
it lighter whoops I don't think the
lighter is gonna work cuz I don't think
there's a lighter version of this font
oh there you go see I got a little bit
thinner so if this was my default and
then I had something in here that was
set to bolder it wouldn't go to bold it
would just go to the normal and then
using bold it actually gets bold let's
show you what I'm actually talking about
here let's put a span span class equals
bolder and close span
and let's find another one here span
class equals bold and close spam safe
so let's come here
so Boulder font-weight:bold there that's
it and bold will be a font weight of
bold and what I did here just jump back
up for one second I use spans which we
looked at briefly before and I give each
of my spans a different class so I have
my Bold class and my bolder class and
I'm selecting those in my CSS with my
period so my period is my class Boulder
and then I have my period bolt so my
class of bold and my class of Boulder
and I'm changing their font weights so
I'll save that and I'll refresh and
they're right here
so this one so if you remember our font
weight is set to lighter so light means
sort of skinnier and you can see here
that this one is the normal font it's
not bold this is my bold and this is
just going back to the normal so Boulder
means one-step bolder than we currently
are whereas bold just means bold it
doesn't matter it's gonna jump all the
way up to the bold when we do our font
weight I'm not going to font weight
whoops didn't there's also the normal
which is just what you'd expect it to be
there's all these numbers um and I'm
gonna get into those in another look and
taking a look at google fonts and until
we get to there we don't really have to
worry about the numbers but just in case
you're curious somebody look forward to
we've seen font family already as well
which is what we use to choose what font
we want to use and so now we have a one
last little batch of ones that I want to
show you guys and just to confuse you
the first ones are all dealing with font
and the next ones all start with text -
so I'm gonna start with text aligned
because most people know what that is
and let's just do a text-align:center
refresh and my text becomes centered
and I can do a text-align:right and my
text will become right-aligned and my
last option is text align justify and
text align justify will justify my text
but as a word of warning justified text
in the world of web it doesn't look so
good we don't have hyphenation like we
do in the world of print so depending on
your screen size your font size you'll
start getting these really big spaces
between some words I've seen this on my
phone so many times and it drives me
bonkers there's a lot of people working
really hard at finding ways of improving
justified text online but for the time
being just don't use it please it's just
not a good idea just don't do it don't
justify your text another one is text
decoration so text decoration I have
actually it's put these on my spends
because these will make more sense on my
spans and through whole paragraphs so
text declaration I'm going to do line
through and that puts a line through
sort of the crossing out the word I also
have underlined that's what you think it
would it underlines my text underline
text can look ugly you can see the line
is passing through the G there there's
not much we can do about that underline
I also over lined which I don't see use
very often but it does exist where you
can put lines on top of things and I do
believe that's it so we have those three
options for my text decoration I also
have a text transform and I love text
transform um here's all the options we
have for it we can capitalize our text
we can do lowercase text we can do
uppercase text or just no transformation
there's also this full with one in here
it's actually I don't think it's
actually been fully implemented yet and
from what I've looked into it it doesn't
really apply to anything we'll be doing
so yeah I don't think you'll ever if you
try using it it probably won't work
right now anyway and unless you're
dealing with other languages using
different characters I don't think it
really applies
to what you'll need to worry about
looking at some of these other ones
capitalized will capitalize your text
and people sometimes make things
capitalized it's just taking the first
word and let's make that span have two
words in it instead of just one and it
capitalizes each word so the first word
will be get a capital letter on it if
you want the whole thing to be uppercase
which is usually what people are after
it's text aligned a text transform
uppercase and then the whole thing will
become capital so just a quick you know
two little differences there and people
mix those up all the time and you can
also do a lowercase so if you have
uppercase text you can force it to be
lowercase so as I mentioned there are
actually a lot more properties out there
that we can modify with their text but
these are the big ones our text
alignment our font size our font family
our font style for when you need a
little bit of italic text or bold text
our text alignment we have our font
weight our text decoration our text
transform and that covers most of the
bases and don't forget the spacing
between things is done with margin top
and bottom as far as this video goes
that's it as I mentioned there are other
properties that are out there these
aren't the only ones that exist but
these are the big ones so just a really
fast recap the space between all of our
text is always done with a margin top or
margin bottom the space between our
lines is done with our line height and
then we have all our font properties we
have our font size or font style and our
font weight as well as our font family I
really encourage you to use CSS font
stack calm again that's down in the
description it will you know it's a
lifesaver this one if you're going after
you want to know what people actually
have and to come up with reliable stacks
it's a really nice site to use
and then we have all of our text
properties so we have our text align so
if you want to change your alignment of
your text right align left align as well
as your text decoration for putting
lines through lines on top or lines
underneath and last but not least we
have our text transform that lets us
turn stuff into uppercase text without
having to retype it and make a really
embarrassing typo so that's it I hope
you enjoyed this video make sure you
subscribe so you don't miss out on any
future videos hit the like button if you
liked the video if you've made it this
far I'm guessing you liked it because
this was a bit of a long one if you've
made it around this far too please leave
a comment down below and let me know you
actually made it the whole way through
cuz I think that's a bit of achievement
with a long video like this one and yeah
I look forward to seeing you in the next
