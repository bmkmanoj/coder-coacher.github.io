previous series where I built a website
using bootstrap for the thing is back
then it was in the Alpha and things have
changed since then
I used Bower when I installed it last
time and Bower has been depreciated so
what we're gonna be looking at is how we
can actually do it with NPN instead this
is if you want to have a nice build
where you're customizing the SAS files
that you're bringing in so we're gonna
be looking at how we can install it
using NPN and then how we can take those
files and look at a bit of the SAS
structure because the structure and the
way we're importing things has changed
they've gotten rid of a custom folder or
we used to customize the variables and
stuff like that so we're going to look
at all of that in this video okay so the
first thing I've done is I've created
this empty file and inside of here are
its a folder not a file inside of here
there's absolutely nothing so what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna open this in my
code editor which is vs code you can be
using any code editor you want for this
so now that I'm here I can see I have my
welcome screaming get rid of that and we
have my bootstrap 4 with nothing inside
of it here now one of the reasons I like
vs code is because it comes to the built
in terminal so if I press ctrl + the
back kick button which is right above
the tab key I get this terminal opening
up now if you're on a Mac you and you're
not using vs code you're using something
else you can just do a spotlight search
for terminal and if you're on a PC you
can use Cortana as a little search bar
at the bottom or push the Windows key +
R and that will open up a little run
thing here and you can just open up the
CMD and you can do everything that I'm
doing here you can just do that where
you see this now the advantage of having
it done inside of terminal is it because
I opened my project or inside a vs code
here is that it's already in the right
spot and if you're instead using either
terminal or the command here what you'll
want to do and it's really easy just
push CD space and let's just minimize
this for a second
so change directory so CD space and then
I'm going to take this and just drag it
right in and it puts in the full path so
I push return and now I'm in the right
spot so that's how you can do it either
in
terminal or in the the command here you
can also be using PowerShell or there's
lots of other customized things a little
bit also so anyway that's how we can get
into that folder but I'm just gonna be
doing it over here in vs code now once
you're here what you want to do is type
node - V to see if you have node
installed on your computer this will
tell you if you do or not if I have node
installed on my computer so it's telling
me what version I have so this is saying
node and then version if you don't have
it installed you get an error and say we
don't know what you're talking about so
if that's the case you need to install
node on your computer luckily installing
note on your computer is very easy to do
all you have to do is go to node.js org
and this the link for this is in the
description down below and you can just
click this right here and install the
latest recommended one for users or the
current whichever one you'd want it will
automatically know if you're on a
Windows or a Mac and you'll download the
right thing and you just install it once
that steps done and it's all installed
come back to here just try it again node
- V make sure that it sees node on your
computer once that's done and with you
being inside of the right directory
we're gonna write NPM space in it and
what this is saying is NPM which is node
package manager so when you use the
installer to install node it's giving
you the node package manager node
package manager is a very popular and
useful package manager that does a lot
of really cool things you can also use
this to be using gulp and browser sync
and compiling sass and a bunch of other
stuff as well I'm not going to be
looking at in this video we're just
looking at how to install bootstrap and
give yourself some file structure so NPM
in it and I'm gonna push return it's
gonna ask me some questions now it's
gonna ask me press C any time to quit
package name what do I want the name of
it it's taking my folder name if you
have a space in your folder it's gonna
give you an error if you try and keep
that so you might need to give it a
different name but I'll switch return
version 1 I'm just gonna pass
all of these I'm just pushing return
over and over and over author there we
go is this okay yes it is and we're done
now one thing with when you're working
the terminal here that can be annoying
is this when your screen is full of
stuff so you can always write clear and
push return so it's as clear returned
and it just gets rid of everything so
it's not in your way anymore now when we
did that NPM in it what it did is it
installed this package JSON file and
this is just explaining the basics of my
project right here so the name the
version the description all those
questions that just asked me it use
those to fill this out
so if ever you want to change something
you can just come in here if I wanted my
author I could just come in and write it
like that and save my file and I've
updated that you don't really need to
come into here for anything though so
that's done now that we have NPM
initialized in our folder what we need
to do is so now we can install bootstrap
so we can write as NPN again install
boot strap now if you just install
bootstrap it's not going to install
jQuery or popper Jas and bootstraps
JavaScript relies on those so what you
if you do want to install all of them
you can also do jQuery space popper j/s
and we're also going to do a - - save at
the end and what this does is it's gonna
save it in to our project to let them
know these are things that we're using
in our project and we'll see how that
works in a second so I'll hit return
well wait a second because it needs to
install all of those you should get a
little thing pop-up and this is the
progress bar as it progresses along and
it's installed them all and now you can
see because I put the - - save here it's
actually updated this package JSON file
and it's put them as dependencies so
it's saying this this project that I'm
working on Rick is dependent on
bootstrap version for jQuery and popper
j/s so that's why I wrote the - - save
here it also created a package - lock
Jason I look in here it's more
information on those so there's my
bootstrap for all of this stuff for that
my
jQuery and my popper jeaious stuff here
and lastly it installed this node
modules thing if I look in there there's
a bootstrap at jQuery and a poppers Jas
so all of those have been installed onto
my system so that's exactly what we
wanted
so with that downward I'm gonna do next
is I want to organize my files a bit and
on the stuff I want to be working on so
generally when something's in the node
modules you don't actually touch it and
we're not going to be touching it these
are saved on the side and then so what
I'm going to do is I'm actually gonna
make a new folder so in node in vs code
here I can just click on this to create
a new folder you can also do this
however you want but I'm gonna make a
new folder I'm gonna call this source so
this is my source files this is where
I'm gonna be working and in my source
here I'm gonna make a new folder for my
s CSS and this is where I'm gonna be
putting in all my own CSS CSS files or
my sass files and the last thing I also
do while we're add to here is I'll make
a new file called index.html and I just
want that to be right in my source file
actually so in my source I have my
index.html and in s CSS you can also
have a JavaScript folder eventually end
up with a CSS folder as well and all of
that stuff so in this s CSS folder I can
make a new file and I'm going to call
this one my it's my main one so I'm just
going to call it styles dot s CSS and
this is where I want to import
everything too so if you go into my next
series you'll see a bit more of how I
actually organized my file structure and
all of that which and you can follow
along with that series but there is a
big difference and it's because they got
rid of the custom folder they don't they
no longer have a custom folder with
bootstrap so I'm actually going to go
into my node modules here and into
bootstrap into a CSS let's go all the
way down and you'll see here there's a
bootstrap as CSS where they're importing
all of the stuff here and I might
we just going to take this coffee this
whole thing and then go into my own
styles and paste all that in there and
all the way at the top here let's put in
a little comment this is boot strap
imports oops I should have just done
this is a there we go boot strap imports
you don't need all of these and this is
the big thing that I talked about in the
other one but right now it's not
actually going to be important if I
tried to do this and I'd set it up so my
sass would compile this would currently
give me an error because this isn't
where I am so I just need to come in
here and I'm just pushing control if
you're on a Mac you can push command and
this should be in the same in any text
editor you're using you can place your
cursor in a whole bunch of places all at
the same time so I'm just placing my
cursor all the way down almost there
almost there almost there
okay so we're currently in my scss
folder so I want to go one step back so
dot dot goes one step back so I left my
scss folder I'm in my source folder
let's go back a step again and now I'm
in my main root folder so from my main
root folder I need to go into node
underscore modules and from here I need
to go into boot strap and from bootstrap
I need to go into s CSS and now I'm
navigating into the correct place I
don't want to be touching their files
but I want to be importing them into my
own project so this is the easiest way
just to import them into my project
without touching the node modules folder
so I'm just importing directly from node
modules into my project and then the
other advantage here is I can come into
this and pick and choose the things that
I want to be using so for example on the
project I'm doing I'm not going to be
using this so I can comment it out
tables I won't be using forms I won't be
using buttons I definitely will be
trying to you know some of these you'll
definitely want to be using and other
ones you probably not want to be using
so you can just comment out the ones you
won't be
and this is gonna really help out
because it's going to limit the amount
of extra and CSS you have are not CSS
the limit the amount of extra compiled
CSS that you have at the very end
because you will definitely end up with
a whole bunch of CSS if not and it's all
these things that you'll never actually
using so just comment out everything in
here that you're not actually using in
your project and the nice thing about
this is later on if you decide oh you
know what I actually need that you just
come into here you remove your little -
save your file and then all of a sudden
you're up to date and everything is
going to be working fine the last thing
I want to say is just the way that the
custom files work so if you go and you
look in their CSS folder I'm going to
find their variables so they used to
suggest to overwrite their variables to
actually come in and change whether they
had a custom folder that they
recommended you used and they don't do
that anymore but because they've placed
default in front of everything what this
means is you can come in here and just
use them however you want so in my own
variables file so let's go find here in
here I'd probably have another folder I
probably have another folder but just
for demo purposes I'll just make a quick
file underscore variables dot s CSS and
say I don't want to be using you know
their colors exactly like they are here
or I want to change the blue I could
just come in here copy this paste it in
take off the default tag that's on here
and just change this to anything I want
blue let's just write it in blue like
that so it's a different blue this is
going to overwrite the other one once I
import it and I could actually import it
and import my whoops variables I could
import it at the beginning because
they're using the default flag and
because I'm not using the default flag
it doesn't matter where I overwrite
their styles I can overwrite them
anywhere I
and my my variables will win out so you
probably want to be overriding their
variables here so when it's bringing in
all of this stuff here that it's using
your variables instead of their original
variables just do to be safe and then
you can also start working on your own
stuff along the way it doesn't have to
be variables it could be a custom folder
it could be whatever you want to call it
but I'm just saying that you to
overwrite them you're doing it in your
own CSS folder anymore they don't have
the custom one that used to be part of
where they'd recommend bringing it in it
used to be something they recommended
doing they've gotten rid of that and
just say they just say do it in your own
do it in your own files don't do it
within our files anymore
so that's it everything else should work
the same way I did in my last series so
if you want a bit more details on all
this stuff I did go and check out that
series where I go into a lot more detail
and I use a lot of these things there
are some little differences between some
of the syntax that I've used because
they have updated things they've changed
some class names and stuff but there's
nothing that's revolutionary in how it's
done it's really the NPM install that
has changed compared to how I did it in
my previous video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
