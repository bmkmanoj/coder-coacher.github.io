gonna be looking at how we can use the
CSS grid in a really simple way but to
build a really cool-looking portfolio
section for your website alright so the
CSS grid is here and you might have
already seen my last video where I did
on it but that was me really exploring
the grid I was looking at it trying to
figure out how it worked cuz I've never
used it before so I was fumbling around
a little bit by the end I think I
figured it out and made a pretty nice
layout when this video it's just I want
to show you guys how you can make
something nice using the grid that isn't
it doesn't have to be complicated when I
first started looking at the grid
there's so many properties to it
I thought flexbox bad like this is a
slick home thank goodness you can name
things there's the rows the columns all
the different properties you can put on
a bunch of stuff and it can seem a
little bit overwhelming but the more
I've played with it I've realized it can
be really really simple and powerful at
the same time so that's what I want to
look at in this video the simplest way I
can I figured out how to use it to make
something that still looks really really
awesome
after this video well just in general
for the next at least like month maybe
two months I want to spend more time on
the grid it's really cool it's really
awesome it's where the future of layouts
are gonna be so I do want to focus on it
a lot and it's I guess more and more
complicated as we go along that's not to
say that every video I do is going to be
on the grid there might be some other
just random videos in there but there
won't be a long series for the next
little while
but then maybe what I might do is once
we figured out the grid once you really
comfortable with it then I'll do a big
long series where I build a full website
or at least a single big web page with
it like I've done with flexbox and
bootstrap and other stuff like that so
without further ado let's go okay so
here's what we're going to be trying to
build this is just a simple thing with a
sidebar on it that in our video will
probably actually be on the top I put a
little media query in for that that
we'll see in a second but this is the
main thing that I want to be using the
grid for and there's other ways of
achieving this but I find the grid makes
it really easy to do so we're gonna see
how we can do that and I'm going to turn
on my guides here and now I've put in
all these guides it's in Photoshop so
they're spilling up the sides but the
main area that's going to be my grid is
this area right here so we can see that
the grid itself we're gonna have one two
three four five
I've columns and we have one two three
four five six rows I'm gonna get
something that looks a little bit like
this but it's me fully responsive so
that should be pretty cool I've put some
names in there but we're not gonna be
using those names because it's not
really gonna be squares exactly probably
just because if it is responsive it
won't really add that you know it won't
stay a perfect square there's ways we
could also play around at that to make
sure that they were but in this case I
think it'd be nicer and that they expand
properly with the screen so let's go and
look now I have done this using code pen
so let's start with the HTML I've
already set some of the Styles up on
this because I really do want to focus
mostly on the grid itself for this so
here I have a sidebar which is this area
at the top and the reason it's my
sidebar is there we can you know we can
see that it's actually a sidebar at
large screens and then just with some
nav items in there nothing too fancy and
then my main content area so I have my
main content and then inside there I
have my portfolio the reason I did main
content and then portfolio is just the
idea of if this were a larger site you
know I go to my boat page I can still
have a main content class that I don't
need to play around with and then my
portfolio is really giving me what I'm
using the grid on for this I'm not using
the grid to build the layout for the
rest of the site on this it's really
just for that simple thing that I showed
you with that square area that I did and
we're gonna be building that out but
it's for making layouts it's a really
cool thing and you're gonna see how easy
this is so actually let's just keep that
like this I think it's an easier to see
the code and let's trip over to the CSS
I am using sass to do this so here I've
imported my Google font I've set up a
whole bunch of variables we're not going
to worry about those too much but if you
come into the code pending here yourself
you can check it all out in a bit more
detail the link is in the description
some general styles here just to set up
my colors and all of that on my body I
have put a display flex and the reason
for that is I know you know people are
wondering with Flex box if the grid gets
rid of flex box it doesn't get rid of
flex box it is a tool that we can
in conjunction with flexbox and I
thought it'd be easier because I don't
have a three-dimensional layout here I
just have one you know I have this on
one side this on the other side and I'm
gonna go this way it's one on top of the
other I don't have to worry about
multiple boxes
I thought flexbox made more sense for
something simple like that
so my sidebar is just a flex at 20% and
then my main content is a flex at 80%
and that's it it's nice and simple and
this just has a padding of 10% to give
me the space around I have put a color
on my portfolio items just so we can see
them right now I'm just giving them a
background color yeah he already would
be too you could have the text on top
and then also give them a background
image and put it in a little link or
something like that I'm here why don't
we do a display flex as well and then
just do a just 'if just defy content
center and a line items Center just to
keep that's gonna put everything in the
middle of each item and it look a little
bit nicer so before I can get into the
portfolio items themselves I do want to
set up my whole portfolio so I'm gonna
do portfolio and we're gonna do a
display grid on there because that's the
whole point of what we're doing that
shouldn't really change anything because
we haven't set anything else up for it
yet
another thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
give it a height of 100% because I there
we go I want it to take up the height of
my main content area I want it to be the
same - obviously the padding here but I
wanted to take up that full space so
right away you can see that that works
if I take the display grid off it
doesn't work so it's one of the nice
things with display grid flex I think
also would do the same thing but with
the display grid the height property
works the way you'd expect the height
property work so hundred percent fills
up its parent container which is nice
and handy now I need to build those rows
and columns we looked at so let's jump
back to here as I said we have five
columns and six
Rose so that's really easy to set up
there's some new properties that you
might not know so we have grid template
Rose and we have grid template columns
you can actually name your grid your
rows and columns as well which is really
really cool but you can't do it with SAS
whether you're using SPSS or SAS the
naming of things involves the square
brackets and it can't compile assuming
it's going to eventually get fixed but
right now we can't name our rows and
stuff and for this example it doesn't
actually matter but for other ones I
plan on doing in the not-too-distant
future I might do it in regular CSS or
cross my fingers that they update SAS in
the meantime so what I wanted you here
for my rows it was six rows so I mean it
this is nice and easy I can just do
because they're all gonna be the same
size so I'm gonna do repeat and then I'm
gonna say repeat 6 times because I have
6 of them and how big I want them to be
so I could actually say like be 100
pixels each and we could do the same
thing on this next line we're going to
see it's sort of things are going to
fall into place if I do this there we go
so things are sort of falling into place
and if I wanted to make sure they're all
perfect squares I could do something
like this where I'm giving them an
explicit value and let's just so we can
actually see them better new grid gap of
20 pixels and that's just going to put a
space between them and let's just switch
this really quick to 3 and 3 and so you
can see I have well three and two I
guess so I have three rows three columns
so one two three let's make this two
actually there we go so right now I have
one two columns and 3 rows and you can
see the space between them the thing and
as you can see they are perfect squares
but I don't want them necessarily to be
perfect squares and because 100 pixels
isn't a responsive I could obviously use
percentages but one of the nice things
about this so I wanted this to be 6 and
5 instead of using pixels or percentages
or anything else there's a new unit
called the fraction 1fr and it pretty
much means fill up any available space
whatever available spaces there use it
so it's a nice responsive unit because
it's filling up all the available space
and that's it it just takes up any space
it needs to so it's a really really
handy unit the fr unit just each of
those is going to be the same because
they're all one fr and so they're all
taking up the same amount of space and
they're just adapting to the side as
they need to be so for my portfolio I
believe that's it so the main portfolio
is done now we need to work on some of
our portfolio items I'm going to come
back up though I have given them names
whoops let's go back down so let's go
ahead and take a look at it just really
quickly at the HTML here and we can see
that what I've done is I've called the I
have medium large medium small tall and
wide so just go look here at my
Photoshop designer was like and this is
a normal medium I should say so medium
large medium small tall and wide and
let's go and put those in now so what
I'm gonna say is um my portfolio item
and I'm gonna do in ampersand so any
portfolio item that has a class of
medium is going to get these specific
things and if you don't know what the
ampersand is if you're coming from the
world of regular CSS this would just be
the same as writing portfolio item
medium just like that no space because
go back I'm not putting a space if I put
a space it would be like having this
basement the ampersand just replaces
whatever this is because it's nested
inside so my medium one let's go look at
what my medium one looks like again so
my medium one is going taking two rows
and it's two columns I should say as
well as two rows so let's shrink her
down so that means that my medium one is
going to have a grid row and it's gonna
span two rows and it's gonna have a grid
column I'm gonna span two of these so
now it's going to across and two across
you can see it's double the width here
it's taking up two of the normal ones
and the height is also taking up two
there so that's really really candy now
I could actually start these at a
specific place I could say start at the
third line now I'm gonna screw things up
a little bit there if I do it like this
oh that's my road whoops it's gonna make
more sense I think if I do it on my
column so I'm going to do three
overspend two so what this is saying is
you have to start at the third third
part so we have one two you're starting
at the third column and your spanning
two columns that means though that all
of them are going to start at the third
column and it just creates this big
empty space and they sort of stack on
top and it's kind of awkward looking
because it's going one two three and
then four and then five and six anyway
it's kind of weird but you can specify
really where things are starting as well
but this is a nice simple case because
we're not gonna worry about starting and
finishing we just want everything to
sort of slot and spill into place so my
medium is done now what I can do is do
and and we'll do my large my small
doesn't actually even need anything but
so we'll do my grid row the same thing
and in this case I want it to span three
and my grid column I wanted to spend
three and there we go my big one is
spanning three here so we can see it's
going one two three of those and it's
going three down so this one was
originally two and then this one is two
so it's going halfway so it's taking a
three height three wide it's awesome the
small one I don't actually need to do
but I'm going to put it in anyway and
might not might as well keep them in
order so this shouldn't actually change
anything grid row span one grid column
span one so nothing will change there
but I just like having that in just in
case if someone was looking at my code
and they wondered what small was at
least they can find something and
understand it somebody my large next we
want my dot tall flips and I forgot my
afternoon
these I don't really need these to be
nest you know it doesn't have to it
would work just as well like this and
I'm not usually a big fan of actually
doing things like this but I found in
this case that sort of made more sense
just in case maybe on my about page I
have some sort of weird grid and it's
gonna be different from this one and I
want to use these tall and widen all of
those different things I thought that it
made sense here so that's why I did it
okay with that out of the way my grid
row it's a tall one so it was a span to
because that's fit with my medium whoops
I didn't spell grid properly grid row
and my so you can see there it has
doubled in height I don't know sorry
this is a tall one so it should be three
tall and it's also going to be a grid
column span too and the last but not
least is my wide so my wide we can do a
grid row and in this case it's span two
because it's too high and then my grid
column I think you get the idea by this
point span three and it fills up all
that empty space and it looks really
good now one thing just as a bit of a
disclaimer here um if you put these the
other way around
sadly it doesn't just like magically
swoop in and fill in that empty space
which would be really cool if it did I
before I mentioned you can tell things
where they should be going so this is my
tall yeah you also see the height is off
now because my grid itself it was
stopping here it doesn't know how big
the next grid item would be and it's not
actually Auto creating one so it's just
it is making it taller but it didn't
know how much taller to make it so it
just gives it this little arbitrary
height on it which is probably the same
20 pixels we add here so there is like
this implicit grid but anyway it won't
get into
for this one I just want to show that
you could move it up but I wouldn't do
it with something like this because this
is tall it should technically be a
generic term that I could put onto any
of these but on my row one two three if
I did a three over span three oh it
wasn't what I expected it to be machine
you can see it's completely moved would
that be a four then maybe not what I
expected either um we'd have to go with
our column two one two three four there
we go so you could move things around
and position them exactly where you want
them to be but it can be a little bit
hard especially if you're just numbering
it this is where the naming of things
can be a lot easier because you can say
start at the start line or my middle
line or my top or bottom and you can
actually specifically name where things
should start and where things should end
I'm the same with this I don't have to
use a span three I could say go from
this is my roast so from four to six and
and it's going from four to six
I think that's cuz that's anyway seven
eight this wouldn't be the very bottom
yeah so you can also say start here and
end here but I find the span option a
lot easier and yeah I just want to show
that you can move things around and get
them to be exactly where you'd want them
to be and I just screwed all that up
mm-hmm
why is it not working you know oh
because I switch the order of these yeah
let's go put those back and now let's go
and actually just to show you what we
could do with this if you wanted
something like this to be an actual
portfolio that you have on one of those
so let's say - I'm gonna give this a
name now - let's just call this one one
that's good the big one it's a big
picture it's nicer - yeah just to show
you it is you know it's gonna shrink and
grow and you could always build media
queries into it as well but it is going
to be fully responsive which is really
nice
so now if we go down and I could say doc
to and I probably wouldn't actually call
it - but my portfolio item - I could
give this a background image and I'm
just gonna use a URL from on splash on
splash it I don't really let say 800
pixels by 600 pixels background size
cover background position center
actually that's just for something fun
here let's say top left top a little
left yeah I won top left let's also give
this a background and background color
of black and and a background blend mode
of what should I do
um multi apply cool good and a color
maybe of white just mean actually see
the text color light gray maybe is what
I called it there we go so we can
actually see the text and Ian that I
should probably of a link in here so
when you go it you could actually click
on it or something but now what we could
do is on hover we could have it to do
what could we have it do and me hover
let's change the background blend mode
none let's have the background position
change to Center
we should probably animate all this too
right transition all ease in out 300
milliseconds let's just see what that
looks like why is it just moving up and
down I can't do back initial maybe oh no
you can't I thought you that's annoying
that looks like crap top left it oh it
must me filling up the whole space
background sighs what if I just would
like to actually cover um background
size 150 percent yeah I don't like that
at all we can't play with backgrounds as
much as I thought we could what if I
just changed ever it's not gonna work
the way I wanted it you okay well we can
do the same thing though I'm gonna take
that off and that off and have at there
are not add and before actually this
should be in after so I want to be after
the text no I want to be before the deck
at before content is nothing yeah this
makes sense content is nothing display
is block background is black position is
absolute top 0 right 0 bottom zero left
0 and I just broke everything
oh yeah that means this should also be
opposed and relative cool so it's
covering it and then I just need to
change
capacity of like 0.8 my color white it
is covering that the picture moving
doesn't bother me but it does not moving
enough and however before opacity of 0.2
maybe and transition all ease in out 300
milliseconds there we go
so you get that nice little hover around
there I just want that text though and
again that would be something you could
click on and actually go and see what it
is we just want to make that more
visible right so my light gray what if I
just did a z-index of zero is that index
of 10
laughs there we go negative one we'll do
it you take that one off then what we're
not okay whatever I'll leave it on and
last but not least and before and before
hover and let's just add and hover on
this one too because they can't see the
text now color is black no I still can't
see it forget that color and text shadow
of yeah text shadow should be fine a
text shadow of 0 0 rgba black is a zero
zero zero zero point five
how much am i blurring it by whoops of
three pixels Blair do I not have it
oops I forgot my semicolon let's make
that a bit bigger and and and and last
but not least portfolio item font size
just make it bigger - I'm probably too
big for the small one but at least I can
reach it 1.5 there we go you hover over
you can see the picture a little bit
better
and now you've a nice-looking portfolio
that obviously means a link in there and
the text could be the link they go on
top of the text you could even have the
fancy text effect on it if just your
text is the link you could even give
that a position:absolute so it's filling
up the whole space and that's the
background that's changing on it
whatever you want to do with that but
it's a nice quick easy way to do a cool
lay
and then when you're bringing in
different items you can play around with
those items a little bit to have them
look a little bit different or different
sizes and different things if you have
three new things to add in you could
easily just very easily yeah actually
let's go back to here so you had three
new portfolio items you wanted or let's
say you had two portfolio items I know I
went with a wide it's gonna add another
wide one and another medium one will
forgive ignore the numbers that are in
there so say you added two more in
because your portfolio got bigger and
then you could just come in to your
portfolio and say now I have more
because I had one two three one two and
one two three four five six
I now need eight rows and like magic it
just all of a sudden adapts to what you
need so again if I wanted to add more I
just have to come up into my rows and
that or if I wanted to squeeze more
stuff in the sides say this is just
getting really long and I wanted to get
more stuff coming you know adding a new
there in the columns I could easily just
bump that up to seven at one point it's
gonna break everything in the time being
but as I add my content I just have to
play around with it and I can adjust it
on the fly this was originally six five
eight five films there we go so yeah
really really cool the grid is awesome
this is just a really simple example
where we're using the repeating and you
could definitely build a really nice
simple layout using the grid or complex
layouts it's it's a really cool thing so
if you'd like this I really encourage
that you dive deeper into it and learn
as much about it as you can because it's
really really really cool and that's the
CSS great I hope you liked the video
