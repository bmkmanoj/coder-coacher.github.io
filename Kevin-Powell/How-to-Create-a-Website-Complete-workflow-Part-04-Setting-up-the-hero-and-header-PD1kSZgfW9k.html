video in my series on building a
responsive website from you know
everything the whole workflow in this
video we're going to be looking at the
hero area and the header the logo the
navigation and the you know the thing
with the phone on it there I was a
little bit all over the place in this
video so I do apologize but you're gonna
see it gets focused pretty quickly yeah
and that's it let's get started on this
one so I'm going to create a couple of
files here so I'm going to save this one
as did you do what is it called base
base base base base it's sort of the
base styles things that I use and it
gets saved in my base folder base SAS
and one thing I use in here that I like
to do this is sort of just things that I
don't really know where else to put them
I guess you could say just like the
general things that I use all the time
so I had import base slash base so in
here are my you know if I had a clear
fix I'd put it in my base if I had I
might have a few other things that I at
one point throw in here for the moment
the only thing I'm going to do is throw
in my change my border box so a star
star before and my star after will all
be to the box-sizing border box just
because I find that makes my life a
million times easier is there anything
else I'm going to leave it like that for
now I'm probably going to jump back into
this folder every now and then there's
file so I will leave it opened I'm going
to make a new one save we'll call this
one header header I'm going to do a
couple right now
just to get things rolling a little bit
jump into sass into layout
header dot s a SS and the other one that
I'm going to want to have since we're
here is euro si SS since they sort of
work together with one another so much
and let's go over to my main and import
them all so that's all in layout so at
import layout slash I did my header and
I did an import layout here Oh
let's just go layout header okay so my
header and my hero my hero let's give
this just so we can actually start
seeing what we're doing a little bit
hero on my hero I want to give this a
background right we want to be able to
see it and it is that gradient so back
whoops back ground linear gradient
primary secondary and you did not do
primary I closed my colors today I call
it main I did call it main ok there we
go and so that looks good we just want
this to we don't want it to be going up
and down we want it to be going from the
left to the right so - right there we go
so it's going to the right now and this
little box has been driving me crazy
this happens when you copy and paste
text from Photoshop or I'm guessing
other programs too if you have a soft
return which is a shift enter it's a
line break instead of a paragraph return
when you copy and paste the text it does
that so I just want to get rid of that
really fast
whatever it might be and you'll see here
that's actually stuck together and if I
put a space it's going to put the space
but it keeps that little box there so
sometimes you actually have to delete
like a full whoops an actual character
and then put it back and that seems to
fix it not quite sure why that happens
but that's okay
on our hero so we have our background
that looks awesome and I'm also going to
change the color of all the text to text
in verse and you might be saying whoops
I didn't spell in verse properly in
verse there we go what I was saying is
you might be wondering why I'm calling
it text in verse and I'm not just
putting color of white and it just is
you know I in my colors let's open those
back up for a second I might change this
white to something else and then I might
have to modify my text in verse to keep
it being white or I might at one point
when all the colors changed later on in
this project which could always happen
it could be there's some changes text
inverse might not be white anymore maybe
I need that to be a different color so
it's nice to keep those as two separate
elements so I can control them
separately if I need to and it's not
necessarily locked together is the main
reason I'm doing that I haven't done
anything in header this is my main
header I could just you know be using my
header selector but I as I mentioned
when I did my markup
I like having classes for as much as
possible just because it helps with my
specificity and so main header it will
be position:absolute which will help me
position it on top there we go
oh that shrank it everything down so my
logo actually shrank and now if I do my
top of 0 a left of 0 a right of 0 my
logo starting to get big again yeah ok
which is fine this is where I like
having my logo I think that's what I
called it we'll find out in a second
with
with with with I think I'm going to go
with a percentage I'm going to have this
change let's just try 30% and see what
happens
25% looks a little big right now 25 that
looks a little nicer and I do want to
prevent it from getting either too big
or too small because of course I can get
really really really big and of course
if I go a lot smaller it's also going to
shrink down and get really really tiny
so we want to stop that from happening
so I'm going to go with a width of about
25% but we will lock that in with a min
width and whoops I'm not sure what I'm
going to put yet though max width we're
going to try a few things here these I
will do with REMS so 10 RAM and 15 REM
did so let's say we're going to see how
that does let's just go bigger and
smaller
whoops though that's as big as it's
getting and it's a little bit that'll
probably be okay I'm missing the top of
my screen because of the margin on this
text right now so I can't see exactly
but that looks okay so you can see it's
it's growing we have a little growth in
shrinkage right there going on
I think I'm happy with that and I do
need to put our do I even need that
actually yeah I do okay
or else it's just always going to be the
max width which makes sense put that
back in my logo is also going to be my
main header needs to be a display flex
but BA I need I got smaller when I did
that hmm that's interesting
this will be a flex of one let's just do
0-0
no I shouldn't need that but for my
navigation for my navigation was it main
nav main nav with can I do this 60% when
things don't work how I expect them to
background of pink I like seeing where
they are logo background of light blue
they're both inside my it was main
header right yeah
so they're both inside main header main
header is flexing let's get main header
a background color now drew drew drew
background of yellow if it's display
flex and flex wrap wrap why aren't they
going next to each other if that's such
display flex and spec org
oh this is the container is inside
whoopsie doodles that would make sense
why that's not working so actually let
me uh main header I can take that off I
don't need that there save because they
are inside of the grid and I haven't
started setting that up at all layout
I'm not going to build the whole grid
system now I just do want this one that
I save SAS layout grid dot SAS s so I
have my grid and the basics for my grid
is going to have a display of
flex on there right yes so my grid is
display flex and that's still didn't do
what I was hoping
oopsy doodles ah I do this a lot this is
one of the problems with pre prose that
sort of drives me nuts a little bit if I
save something before I bring it into as
an import here it's going to export it
as its own thing so it's exporting my
layout into the grid there and then it
sort of screws that whole thing up so if
ever you do that I can delete that move
to trash that's gone I can import my
grid so at import layout slash grid the
order that I put things here I just like
having my grid before I get into my
other things but just you know this is
the order that it gets exported into my
CSS file as so if that's sort of why I
put my grid before my other things and
there we go
they go next to each other like I want
them to cool so just now that
the parent is display flex so now that
this parent is display flex these two go
next to each other like that and we see
everything is sort of falling into
columns now just by doing that the grid
display flex is the first step in that
whole column system and it's going to
really right away helps us out a lot we
can turn off our background colors I
guess now header turn off the background
color turn off the background color save
save
now obviously my main nav isn't going to
be there but even this width of 60 I was
just trying to do something that would
make sure it fits I think even if I got
rid of that it would still yeah I want
to save that for another video because
it's going to be long just to do the
navigation I want to make a mobile-first
navigation it's going to be a hamburger
menu then a larger screen sizes it won't
be let's just finish finish fixing this
up a little bit for the moment actually
let's just do a main nav display:none
just so it's not overlapping and it's
not in our way and we're going to come
right back in the next video to fix that
one up but for now I don't want my logo
on top of my text obviously so what I
need to do is I need to move everything
down a little bit so my hero I think
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to give it a little bit of padding so
padding top and these are really just
serve 10m padding top a little bit
smaller 8m padding-bottom 8 I'll go with
8 for now does that make sense okay so
what we're going to do is we're going to
fix this up and make it look decent and
I'm going I'm going with a mobile-first
approach on this so I do want to be
looking at smaller screen sizes that's
okay for now
we could fix that right away actually
base image width is max width 100% and a
drew drew drew height of auto should
there we go that looks a little bit
better so on my hero I also have my hero
image which will be display:none for now
that looks a little bit better we're
also going to want to do a
text-align:center on this that looks a
little bit better on my grid I usually
have some padding on that that's all my
columns actually I don't feel like
building out the grid just yet I'm going
to leave this as is oh but I haven't
even done my container yet um Abdo to do
container with of let's just do 95% for
now max width of 1200 pixels and what
should we give it we should do a margin
of 0
Auto there we go just to keep stuff from
sticking to the sides okay so it's
already better we are going to now need
to start fixing up my typography a
little bit to make that look better I'm
not going to do the buttons man I'm all
over the place in this video a little
bit I really do apologize I thought it'd
be easier to do it this way oh no I have
another one of those little boxes to see
what I said about being all over the
place
sexy pictures sexy pictures oops there
we go so that looks a little bit better
okay so what are we going to do what are
we going to do my logo is going to stay
there exempted with a little hamburger
menu here that's going to pop out but I
should get we're gonna make this look
nice and where yes we're just going to
make this look nice I'm not going to
worry about the typography just yet just
get in the basics of the layout down for
now so a polishes should not be touching
the top so when I just do one M here
keep that off the top there we go and
that should help with my hamburger menu
as well the positioning of everything
there isn't too bad actually then what I
want to do
okay new plan guys we're going to build
the whole site responsive and then we're
going to come back through the entire
thing and fix it up for larger screens
that's the new plan and part two of the
plan is we're going to end the video
here and the main reason I'm ending the
video here is it is getting a little bit
long and I've sort of set up the layout
and the basics of what's going to make
everything work the next video is going
to be my navigation no the next video
will be setting up the typography a
little bit we want to get the typography
looking a little bit nicer because right
now the spacings are off the site font
sizes are off so the next thing is just
going to be setting up the typography
which will also include my buttons once
that is set up we will tackle the
navigation once the navigation is done
we'll start moving through this and
that's going to mean really making our
grid system work properly the first
parts of the grid system are we're going
to be pretty basic but they will be
developed upon and we are going to make
them look a little bit better as we go
through because once I go to the larger
screen size it will be the the last
video or one of the last videos will be
going into the larger screen size and
that's really going to be developing the
whole responsive navigation responsive
navigation responsiveness of the the
column system and really seeing the full
power of the column system I think that
is definitely going to make the most
sense for how I'm going to build this
out because I'm sort of getting all over
the place right now and I want to focus
a bit more so I apologize for the sort
of skittishness of this one again I'm
usually have all of my typography set up
and I know I wanted to show you my
actual workflow but I wanted to be a
little bit less abstract for you guys so
I want you to be seeing things as I'm
working on them so I thought this would
work better and the next ones should be
awesome I hope this one was awesome too
not too you know I don't want this video
to feel bad I think I did a pretty good
job on it it's starting to come together
we're starting to see the project go in
the right direction so actually we might
as well
I'll finish this one off by by
committing all of this I'm not really
sure what my comment is going to be on
this one because I did a whole bunch of
random stuff pretty much what have I
done I do want to do all of that
let's first
branch branch from I I'm not want to go
back to my master branch branch from
master branch so we create a branch
there branch name will be what did I do
in this one we'll call this one basic
layout oops
basic layout create a new branch started
the basic layout stuff not too awesome
but we can commit that to there there's
no local changes let's publish it so
that is online so if you guys do want to
come in here and check out what's going
on it will be on github I'm going to
wait to merge this back in once we've
done a little bit more work and awesome
