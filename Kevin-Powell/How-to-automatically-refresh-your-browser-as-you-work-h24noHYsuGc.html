browser Auto refreshes while I'm working
in my videos so I thought why not make a
video about it there's actually a few
different ways we can do it and we're
gonna be exploring those in this video
hi there if you're new here my name is
Kevin and I make videos about how to
make the web and how to make it look
good while you're at it before I get
into this week's video I just want to
give a really big thank you to both
Angelique and Qahhar I hope I pronounced
your name properly at the end of the
bootstrap series I made an announcement
that I was launching a patreon and
thanks to them I've unlocked my first
goal yeah what this means is I'm getting
a code pen Pro account and that's cool
cuz it unlocks Professor mode as well as
some other stuff as well that's all
gonna benefit you guys so you guys
should say a nice big thank you to them
as well both of them as well as anyone
else who's pledging $10 or more a month
is going to be able to follow along in
some of the videos I'm making live in
professor mode on code pen so there's
the little chat system that's in there
they can pause it while I'm working clay
in the code hit play again get back up
to where they are so that's really cool
so you can check that out if you want
there's other rewards at different tiers
as well so you can check out that my
patreon account if you're curious about
that and if you have no idea what
patreon actually is if there is a link
in the description below go click on
that I have a welcome video over there
that explains it in a little bit more
detail also if you do head over there I
put up a bonus video this week but it's
on the patreon account it's free to
anybody you don't have to be a patron to
get access to it but it is over on
patreon that video is looking at really
cool and fun button effects you can do
most of them using some pseudo elements
so you can go check that out
on my patreon again the link is down
below and with all of that out of the
way let's talk but auto-refresh finally
now that I've used auto-refresh I don't
think I could live without it it's such
an important just makes your life so
much better there's a couple of
different ways to do it some of them
cost money and there is a free way as
well the free way does take a little bit
more setup and it's using the command
line I'm gonna start this video off
looking at code kick and pre prost which
are pay ways of doing it they offer you
a lot of different stuff though they're
not just Auto refreshing your browser
and after that I'm gonna jump into the
command line and we're gonna look at how
we can do it for free all set up using
NPM and in
manling so the first way to look at is
code kit which is a really popular
option and it's only available for mac
though the link is code kit app comm you
can get it down below in the links all
the links I will be talking about will
be down in the description below so if
you want to check any of these out you
can you can see that it's $34 and it
does a lot of other things as well it's
not only for Auto refreshing it does a
bunch of other stuff but Auto refresh is
the focus of this video but just know
that it does a lot more and we're gonna
see a little bit more of the features of
what else it can do when we look at this
app which is pre pros now this is the
one I personally use and I'm going to
show you how it works it's really cool
and it has as far as I know the same
features as code kit the big difference
is it actually is a little bit cheaper
it's $29 instead of 34 and it's also
available on Windows and Linux so it has
a free trial and it's an unlimited trial
it just gives you a little pop up so you
can try this I would see if you like it
I'm gonna get rid of that and I'm gonna
open up pre pros so here's the pre post
app I've already downloaded and
installed it I have a license for it I
use it on all my projects and I want to
bring in this new project in here all I
need to do is drag and drop it and it's
added in my Auto refresh project right
there you can see the files that are in
there it's actually an FTP client as
well and if we take a look quickly and
my settings settings so the really big
things new you'll see a few things that
all look similar there's the file
watcher the live preview browser sync
and live reload they look like they're
doing a lot of the same thing this is
what files is it watching for changes
and the live preview involves it running
a custom server the browser sync
involves synchronizing multiple browsers
together and this can be really useful
if you have a laptop and your main
computer and your phone and you want
them all working together you're
scrolling on one of them and it's
scrolling on all at the same time and
the live reload is what we're really
after right now
the FTP and the compiler settings this
is the really big thing that I use it
for and I like it for as well we can
compile sass
or less or other languages if you're
using any other languages markdown
stylus lots of other stuffs you can turn
my sass into regular CSS it can also
minify my CSS he minify javascript it
also has the autoprefixer built into it
so i don't have to write prefixes on
anything it will automatically do it for
me again I came in fi my CSS and all of
that and with the JavaScript it can
Uggla Phi which is same as minifying my
CSS so it does a whole bunch of stuff
but as far as auto-refresh goes it's
really easy to do i just have to click
this little icon here and hit preview
and that will open it up in the window
let's move this over now and I already
have this project open in atom which is
my code editor of choice so we'll open
that up let me just move this over and
we'll take a quick look here's my h1
which is right there and let's just
change this over from that to white save
and look at that it refreshed
automatically and I'm gonna do an undo
hit save and it's changed if you're
using it in here let's you know auto
maybe I want to put a hyphen there
instead I'm gonna save and it adds that
right in there like that
so that's cool and I'll save without it
and it's gone super awesome and cool and
really easy to use and again as far as I
know code kit and pre proce work really
similar to one another
I've never used coke it so I don't have
any experience with it but I know it's
very highly regarded and I use pre pro
so on all my projects and I love it so I
can't recommend it enough now we are
gonna look at a free option and this is
called browser sync and it's actually I
think what you know it's browser sync
it's a very powerful thing it's not just
refreshing your page it can also
synchronize browsers just like I
mentioned so you can mirror browsers it
also live reloads URL pushing it's a
really nice and free way to do what I
was just using this for it's easy to do
but to use it we have to use the command
line and you need to have node package
manager so you have to look up node J s
you
have to come to here and install the
latest version whether you're on a Mac
or PC it'll probably auto detect what
you're on I would just go with this one
the recommended for most users one
download that and install it it's just a
really simple installer it's nothing
complicated it's a normal installers so
I'll go and open that up and we'll see
it's just a straight-up installer
computing the space requirements is
taking a very long time for some reason
you just click Next accept next tell it
where you want to install it now I
already have it installed but I would
just click Next it's going to install it
no problem whatsoever and when it's done
you can use it so I'm gonna exit out of
that because I already do have it
installed now the reason you need to
have node is because you need to use the
node package manager to use the browser
sync here and you can see any time you
see something saying use NPM it's NPM
stands for node package manager so if
you're in a Mac you can open up your
terminal if you're not sure how to open
up the terminal just open your spotlight
search thing and type in terminal and
you can open it like that what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna push the Windows key + R
which is gonna bring up my run dialog so
I have my run here we can do this just
with the regular command line or command
prompt so there's my command prompt I
just find this really ugly looking I
don't like the fonts it uses I don't
like what it looks like at all so
another thing I can use which is pretty
much the same I'm gonna do a command R
again and I'm going to write PowerShell
and PowerShell is pretty much the same
thing but it looks a lot nicer now now
that I'm here all I need to do is type
and it tells us what to do actually
that's let's go look right here it's
telling us how we can install it so just
NPM space install we're gonna do I - G
which is the same as writing global so
we want it to be a global install we're
installing it out in our entire system
and we're installing browser sync now if
you've never used the command-line if
you want to do things for free this is
the way to do it a lot of what I'm using
pre pro support can be done for free you
just have to know how to do it through
the command line and most of it is done
through NPM NPM is a really cool thing
so now that I've hit return it's
installing it doesn't take too long but
it does have a bit of work
do say MPM is an awesome there's tons of
things that are built it on top of it or
using it there's things like gulp and
grunt that you might have heard of and a
lot of other really good and useful
things is the autoprefixer that i really
like i can do with this i can compile my
sass with this you know a lot of things
so getting used to the this whole
command line thing can be really really
useful so we can see that it is gone and
installed everything I need I'm
adjusting it clear and hit return to get
rid of all that so we can be back T here
so right now it's on my users Kevin and
I'm gonna do a CD space see these stands
for change directory so I want to change
directory and I want to go to my desktop
so I'm gonna write desk top and now I'm
on my desktop and then I'm gonna write
CD space because I want to change and I
want to go into my folder now you might
be going well I don't know how to
navigate to my folder I put it in a
strange place I can't find my desktop
whatever it is so I'll show you the easy
way to do this I'm gonna go back so two
dots is a backward step so we'll go back
to where I started and I'll show you the
easy way of doing this
we'll go back to my desktop for a second
here I can write CD space and I can just
take auto-refresh here and drag it in
there and it's gonna set it all up for
me I push return and it's in the right
spot so you don't actually have to
remember how to CD through and get to
where you want this is by far the easier
way of doing that okay so we're in the
right place and that we want to be able
to use browsersync so it's really easy
to do I'm just gonna write in browser
sync and put a space and I'm gonna write
start because I want to start doing a
few different things the first thing is
for browser sync to work properly needs
to start up a little server so I'm going
to - - and write in server put a space
and do a - - and write files so the
servers are going to start automatically
you could tell it to only start the
server in another folder that's in here
but just by writing server like that is
going to start for the files though we I
do have to tell it what files to watch
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
put a star dot HTML because I want to
watch all of my HTML files and I'm also
going to put a space and put star dot
CSS forward slash star dot
CSS so in my Auto refresh folder it's
gonna look for any HTML files and Auto
refresh them and it's also going to look
in a CSS folder and find any CSS files
and refresh those so I'm gonna push
enter on my keyboard it shouldn't take
long and it should automatically pop up
and you can see that it's watching files
so and it says browser sync is connected
so obviously to know if it's actually
working we should test it out so let's
change our color just like we did before
I'm just going to change that over to
red and instantly as I save it changes
which is really cool and then let's go
over to my index and over here let's
just get rid of auto refresh and make it
refresh and hit save and pretty much
instantly that changes as well so really
really neat let's put auto back put a
small R Save awesome it's so much fun
watching things out of refresh like that
and we'll go back to where we started if
you are using this one thing you can see
here it's light it's noticed the file
event there was a change so it reloaded
my browser so every time you make a
change that will probably pop up now
when you're finished with this I could
just close this out but if you want to
stop it because you need to do anything
else in your command line if you're on a
Mac its command C and if you're on a PC
its control C it's gonna ask if you want
to terminate the job but yes and there
we go I'm back to here and it's not
watching my files anymore just to show
really quickly you can also do this with
a bit of shorthand so I can do browser
sync start I can just do - s - F and the
same thing I did before dot HTML CSS dot
CSS hit return and it will be exactly
the same every time you do this it will
automatically open your browser again it
lets you know that it is connected and
just one last time let's make it yellow
and it's literally as I'm pushing the
Save button it is changing so it's
really neat so there we go that command
line stuff wasn't so bad now was it and
don't forget you can do it a lot faster
now you've we've gone through the whole
setup of everything we had to do
everything to get it installed on our
system now for each project it's just a
few lines in the
it goes really fast and easy and it's a
nice free option that you can use now
don't forget about the bonus video over
on patreon go down to the description
below find the link from my patreon and
you'll easily find the video over there
