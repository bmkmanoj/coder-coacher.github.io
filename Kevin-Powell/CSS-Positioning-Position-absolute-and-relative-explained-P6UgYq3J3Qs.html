video we're going to be exploring
position:absolute how it works a
position relative and the Zed index I'm
going to try and do it in as short of a
time as possible so when I first got
into the whole web thing I was having a
lot of trouble until I learned about
position:absolute and then I went crazy
with it I started using it for
everything I come from a print
background and I'm used to just being
able to position things exactly where I
want in the program I click drag and
it's there and obviously with CSS I
couldn't do that
but with position:absolute I could until
I realized that was a really bad idea
and this was before responsive web
design it still caused its own problems
and now that we're responsive it causes
even more problem in this video what I
want to be looking at is how the
position:absolute works in relation to
the whole page then we're going to look
at how it works in relation to when you
put something else in position:relative
and how you can layer things with the
z-index and how the z-index actually
works already so we're in code pen right
now and if you look down below in the
description you will find the link to
this if you want to play around with it
yourself basically I just have a div
here inside my div I have a paragraph I
have a child
div and then I have more text so the
parent is this big aquamarine toward of
turquoisey color I have my two
paragraphs of text and in between them
this red box which I've just called the
child and I've made it red and give it a
width and a height just so we can see it
and see everything and we're going to be
playing around with mostly the child to
see how this whole position:absolute
works so what I'm going to do is on here
I'm going to put a position:absolute on
here so position just like that now the
main thing with position:absolute is it
takes things out of the flow of the rest
of the document so here it's a paragraph
followed by my div followed by the
paragraph which obviously makes it all
line up like this but as soon as I put
absolute on here it's going to come out
at the flow and you can see the other
text is going underneath it so by
default it will stay where it is but
it's no longer in the flow so other
things pretty much ignore it it it's as
if it's not there and you get this thing
where it's going to be jumping on top of
other stuff and pretty much anything
in the normal flow Noma even though my
paragraph comes after this div it will
the text will still go underneath it
everything will go underneath something
that's positioned absolute by default
now we're position:absolute gets
interesting is we can give it the top
bottom left and right properties so I
can come in here and say that my top
property is zero but you'll notice it's
not even staying inside the parent
anymore it flies outside of the parent
and goes all the way up to the body and
let's just do a left zero on there as
well and it's going to the top zero left
zero and this is pretty much how far
away from the top are we and how far
away from the left side are we so we're
zero pixels away from the top and where
zero pixels away from the left and then
I could replace top with bottom and it
will jump all the way down to the bottom
so it's now zero pixels away from the
bottom another interesting way you can
use this let's get rid of our width or
height and it will disappear for a
second but I can say a top of zero a
bottom of zero a left of zero and a
right of 50% and that's what's going to
make up the total size of it so the top
is at zero pixels away from the top zero
pixels away from the bottom zero pixels
away from the left and 50% away from the
right side and if I put fifty pixels
instead of 50% it will be 50 pixels away
from the right side and you can put any
unit you want here 50m away from the
right side so on and so forth and you
can mix these up so let's say I keep my
top and bottom but I could also give
this a width of 100 pixels it will be
zero pixels away from the top zero
pixels away from the bottom and it has a
width of 100 pixels now and now how
absolute relates to relative is as I
said this is all relative to the body
right now and everything will default to
being relative you know this top is zero
pixels away relative to the body so it's
zero pixels away from the top of the
body but what if I want it to be zero
pixels away from the top of the parent
that's where that position
whoops position:relative comes in
position:absolute items will look for
apparent and it could be a grandparent
it doesn't have to be you know it can go
farther there back it's going to look
for something that has position relative
that it's inside of it if it doesn't
find that it will default to the body so
by changing the parent to position
relative now its top is zero the bottom
is zero and the width will the width is
staying the same but we could even do
left let's say left 25% and a right of
25% and now it's top bottom zero left
25% away from the left and twenty-five
present away from the right and this
really is the most common way to use
absolute position elements for me anyway
is that the parent has the position
relative on it so I can control exactly
where the child will be inside of the
parent and it just makes my life so much
easier being able to do that for certain
things honestly guys the thing to
remember the most when using position
absolute is the parent it's always
relative to the last thing that has a
relative on it position relative on it
and if nothing has the position relative
on it then it will be relative to the
body and the other thing to remember is
that it does take it out of the flow of
everything else so if I go back to
having a width of 50 pixels and a height
of 50 pixels so it goes out of the flow
of the rest of the document and other
things will go underneath it and you can
also use your Zed index now so Zed index
of negative one will actually push it
backwards and it disappears because it's
behind this background now and you can
use that index for layering things so
that index of zero will be there because
that's the default is zero on something
let's just say we do my dot parent P
whoops as that index will not work
unless you have a position on it so I
can do possession position relative just
so it keeps with the flow of the
document relative we'll keep the flow of
the document normal unlike absolute and
then I can do a Zed in
of ten and the text will jump on top of
my absolute position thing so yeah if
two things if you need something to stay
with the flow of a document but you need
to use as that index you can use a
position relative on it and if you want
it to come out of the flow so we can
either go on top or behind other things
you want to use your position absolute
and then you can position it exactly
where you want it to let's just do a top
hero and a right of left of zero on
there and back onto this one position
relative and there we go
it's stuck in the top left I can put
whatever I need there it's out of the
flow these are on top because they have
the higher Zed index but if I don't have
the position relative that Zed index
will not work you need to have a
position on something for a Zed index to
work and that is super important and
that's how position:absolute works so I
hope it makes a lot more sense to you
now but if you do have any questions
please leave a comment below and let me
know I'll be glad to help you out with
it and also I'd like to know if you have
any other questions about some core
concepts with HTML and CSS because I'm
assuming if you're watching this you're
relatively new to the whole world of CSS
and all of that so if there's any major
core concepts something that you're not
understanding properly leave a comment
down below and please let me know about
it because I'd like to make a video that
could help you and others out I do have
a series there should be a card up there
somewhere right now linking to it that
is about core concepts it's different
things I've covered the media queries
and some other stuff in there so you can
check that out but if you don't see what
you're looking for in there let me know
about it so thank you so much for
watching this video if you haven't
already subscribed to my channel I do
bring you weekly tips tricks and
tutorials just like this one and some
more advanced topics as well so if you
are interested in that sort of thing
please hit the subscribe button and
until next time take it easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
