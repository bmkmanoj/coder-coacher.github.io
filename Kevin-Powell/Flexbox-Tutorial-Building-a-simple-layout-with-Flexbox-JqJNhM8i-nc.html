flex box for beginner series we're gonna
be building out of a nice simple layout
so this is the end of my flex box for
beginners series now that doesn't mean
that I'm finished with Flex box I'm
gonna keep using flexbox if there's
enough questions maybe I'll make a more
advanced series but I will be using
flexbox in most of the things I do now
it's it's here it's it's not even the
future flex box is here it's what we're
using
so in this there's me three different
sections than I'm building the first one
sort of a standard hero section with
just a big background name into the
landing part you know above the fold
stuff then we'll look at a nice little
simple three column thing and we'll
finish all that off with some cool
call-to-action type of section where all
the text is moved over to one side all
right Kay so for the late there were me
building I've already done all the
markup because I just don't want to
waste some time on this and it's pretty
simple markup I have a hero here with a
paragraph each one and another paragraph
then for this area down here I have
three sales points so I did that really
really easily I just have a div sales
points and each one has a sales point
inside of it within each two in a
paragraph another sales point HQ
paragraph and once again and down here I
have a call to action that we're gonna
style a little bit so for this call to
action I just have my CTA then a CTA
text so I'm using that as a separate box
inside of it with just h2 a paragraph
and a link inside of there so what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to focus on each
one a little bit separately and we'll
look at what I've already done just to
style it and then we'll look at how we
can use flex to make it look a little
bit a little bit nicer
so let's look here at my hero I've just
set a background color and a background
image and a background blend mode on
there if you don't know about background
blend modes I do have a video on that
there should be a little card popping up
you can check those out the important
thing here is I've set my height 200 VH
which is a viewport height it's a lock
in in just so it's the full size of my
screen so no matter what my screen is
it's taking up that full height I have a
little bit of padding on it just to keep
things off the side and I've switched
the color over to white so what I want
to do for this now is I do we can trip
my JavaScript all the way there
and let's get this so there we go this
is what we're looking it's for this
whole hero what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna do a display of flex and you're
gonna see it's gonna cause a lot of
issues so right away it causes some
problems here and it's defaulting to a
row so that means it always defaults to
putting all of our content one after the
other and as much space as it can so the
very first thing if ever this happens
and it's not what you want you just have
to change the direction of it so that
would be a flex direction of column so
that's always the first thing if things
are going in the wrong way do your flex
direction column and it will fix it now
my awesome already I can see it's an
issue because it's taking up the full
size that which is not what I wanted it
to do I want it to be smaller so what
I'm gonna do and the problem with this
is by default everything is stretching I
don't want my things to stretch I want
to have them take a less space but in
this case I just want everything to be
in the middle so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say that I want to align my
condoms I'm gonna I align my items not
my content align my items in the center
so that should pop them right in the
middle it gets rid of that stretch issue
that we were just dealing with and then
I will also want it to be centered this
way so that's really nice and easy I can
do my just deef just defy content center
and bang it's in the perfect middle the
easiest way with CSS you ever will to
get the center something super so that
looks good and that's that that done
that's how easy it is to Center
everything if ever you have this big
area and you just want to Center
everything in it by far flex box is the
way to go now let's go on to my sales
points here so for my sales points I
want to have three sales points on one
next to each other if you would go back
to the old float days you would have to
have a float left on all of them to get
them to float you'd need to deal with
clears to stop this called action from
coming up underneath we don't want to be
doing any of that and with flexbox
luckily you don't have to worry about it
so I'm gonna shrink these down so we can
see all I have is sales points and then
each individual sale point inside so I
have some padding on the top
text-align:center because I wanted to
centered and then I put some margin on
the left and the right just to separate
them a little bit and all we need to do
for this this is the easy one display
flex and boom one next to each other my
margin here if I got rid of my margin
all that's gonna happen is they're gonna
sort of be really close to one another
so by putting a bit of a margin I'm
doing one viewport width item so it's a
really small amount of space just to
give myself a bit of space let's give
that a background color background red
just so you can see about what that's
giving it and one thing but what this is
really the one viewport width so I've
the one there and then I have two here
two here and one here one thing I could
do if I wanted to instead if I had no
margin on that you can see they're
actually touching each other you might
think that I could use something like my
space around or all of that the only
thing to be careful with is because of
the way these are they're taking up
multiple lines of text so that might not
work what you could do is you could do a
width of say 30% so that it leaves all
this empty space over on the side right
because we have 30-60-90 we have 10%
left over we don't have to worry about
margins like I was just doing you don't
have to suddenly start trying to
calculate margins I could come on me
here I could do just TFI content and do
space around and now there's an equal
amount of space around all of my items
and it keeps it off the side so
sometimes people mix up space between
with space around if you get stuck to
the side and you go oops I chose the
wrong one I'm just going to switch over
to the other one so that is a nice thing
I can just do a width and it will set a
solid width or alternatively I could say
flex zero 130 or this would be the same
as as we saw a Flex basis of 30%
Flex basis and width are going to work
very similar to one another so a flex
basis of 30% and
should work now I could know what we
could actually do here why don't we do
that is build a media query into this so
what we could do is I'm going to do flex
direction of column so they're actually
gonna stack one on top of each other and
then what we could do is at media min
width of say 40 REM select we want my
sales points to have a flex direction of
row so here they're one next to each
other they have that nice equal spacing
and then when I get to that forty REM
boom they pop one on top of each other
instead and obviously we wouldn't want
that red background to be on these let's
get rid of the red background so it's a
really nice way of using the Flex
Direction column and row at a media
breakpoint to get them to stack from
side to side to one on top of each other
wherever you want that to happen so
there's a nice little solution that you
can use in your designs I use this all
the time for navigations it's really
nice yeah navigation that goes all the
way across mobile size its stacking one
on top of each other and the last thing
I want to look at here is the call to
action so call to actions well at mean
it's not something I called this call to
action because I didn't know what else
to put in there this is a nice little
simple one that I want to do where you
have a big background image but your
text is only on part of it so my text I
only want my text to be over here on the
right side and this is by probably the
easiest one to do of all of them so on
here as usual a display of flex and
nothing will change when I first do that
because I only have one item in here
let's go look I'm making my CTA display
flex so the only thing flexing is this
one box and nothing's gonna change and
nothing's gonna try and squeeze around
no weird things are gonna happen the
only thing is I only want it to be on
one side so I want that big nice
background image but with this only on
this side so just like before I can do
my Flex basis of 50%
and it will take up 50% of the space
this is as I said similar to using a
width of 50% now what I could do on here
is I give this a justify content flex
and and it's gonna shoot over to this
side so it's still it's a it's sort of
like doing a float right but again if I
was using a float on this all of a
sudden my background would disappear I
get all these weird issues and all of
that
and that would be doing the float on
this thing it just it causes some weird
stuff to happen so by using the Flex and
just flex and it aligns it where I want
maybe I think this is a little bit too
close to the end here so I could just
give it some padding say like um just
give myself some space all the way
around it or even like a zero top and
bottom - left and right just to make
sure that it's staying off the side a
little bit and then again this is
somewhere where a media breakpoint could
you be useful because now it's starting
to look a little bit strange so I could
do at media I'm in with 40 REM just to
be the same breakpoint as we used before
and I could do my now my flexes is 100%
whoops I mix these up this should be 50
so by default it's at 100 and when I get
to 40 REM so you can see that it's
taking up all the space and then once I
hit 40 REM it switches over and takes up
50% and there you go so a nice easy way
to use flexbox in your layouts it's just
a few little examples if you have any
other ideas are things you'd like to see
done with flexbox please let me know in
the comments below I'll gladly make some
more videos on this I love flexbox it's
a really awesome tool and there's the
nice simple layout again I didn't go
into anything too complicated here but
it's ways that flexbox if the simplest
form can work to make you a layout much
easier than the old floats and clears
could work so if you're still building
layouts with floats and clears unless
you need some really old browser support
try doing a flexbox one with your next
project thank you so much for watching
this if you still have any questions
about flexbox please let me know down in
the comments below if you haven't
subscribed to this channel there is a
new video like this one every single
Wednesday so consider subscribing and
until next time
forget to try and make your corner
intranet just a little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
