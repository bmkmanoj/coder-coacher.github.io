in HTML and CSS for beginners today
we're going to be looking at HTML lists
how to use them and how to style them so
I saved this video for a little bit
later and a lot of the time you'll see
lists introduced and then later on how
to style them but I feel that you know
understanding really how lists are
working CSS can help show us a little
bit of what's really going on so first
we'll look at creating our lists and
lists are pretty easy to do
I'm sure you've created lists using
programs like Microsoft Word before and
we have two different types of lists we
have ordered lists and unordered lists
and these are like the bullet lists and
the numbered lists from Microsoft Word
so I'm going to start with an ordered
list markup is really easy to remember
you have an L and if I have an oh L I
have to close my o L so this is my
ordered list and then I'm closing off my
ordered list now a list can't just you
know if I save that in refresh I won't
see anything on my screen I have to put
some content in there I don't put
paragraphs what I'm putting inside of my
list is list items so Li list item and
close list item and just put item number
one I'll save that I'll refresh and we
see one item number one and just speed
things up let's copy and paste that a
few times and I'm gonna select all three
lines and push tab on my keyboard to
move all of them over at the same time
and then let's put in number two and
number three number four I'm gonna save
that and hit refresh again so we get all
of them and you can see it's numbering
my items automatically this is I'm not
you don't see these numbers anywhere in
my code they're just automatically
coming up because it's an ordered list
and by default ordered lists are
numbered lists the other one that we can
do is a unordered list and this is a
bulleted list so if I do a ul close you
well and it's put some comments here
that ordered list so oh well and my ul
unordered list and let's refresh my page
and there you go you can see there's
bullet points so just like in Microsoft
Word where you can push your little
button to get your numbered or bullet
lists same thing here
using Oh L and ul and if you made a
mistake you can come and change that
over to ul and it will automatically
change and I can change this 1 over 2
and O L and now that becomes my ordered
list so very easy to use so for creating
lists it's pretty simple that's about it
as far as the markup goes and that's why
I didn't devote a whole video to it it's
very short a couple of things you'll
notice lists are automatically indented
so it's not perfectly lining up with my
paragraph it's indenting my list a
little bit and it's automatically giving
myself some space between my lists so
the first thing I want to do here I'm
going to select my ordered lesson but in
oil for my ordered list and I'm going to
come in here the first thing we can look
at is something called list-style-type
and you'll notice that there's all of
these popping up and these are all of my
different options so some of these are
more suited towards ordered lists and
some are more suited towards unordered
lists but you can technically put
anything you want so if I did take a
circle for my ordered list it will no
longer look like an order list it's
changing it over to it just a different
type of bullet point so let's undo that
and I'm going to change this instead of
being there I'm gonna do a upper Roman
let's just start with that one
save so instead of numbers it becomes
Roman numerals we can also do a lower
Roman and then I get lower case we have
things like lower alpha
and instead of numbers now it's alphabet
and the upper okay so you know we have a
whole bunch of choices there and on my
ul I could technically change my ul to a
list style type of let's go with my
alphas again so I could make my
unordered list look like an ordered list
but I don't actually want to do that
let's explore some of the other ones we
already saw a circle which gives me
instead of bullet point it's did I
misspelled circle it's very cool and
said bullet points it's little circles I
can also use a school where so I get
square points instead of circles I have
other stuff other options in here as
well disk is the default one so disk is
just a regular bullet point so you can
style your list just by changing the
list that's on there Oh another one you
can do actually is none
list-style-type:none will just take away
the bullets so you still have your list
but the bullets are gone so that's kind
of interesting as well another really
cool thing you can do and instead of
using a list style type you can do a
list style image and list style images
are pretty awesome
so I'm in here its URL so it's a little
bit like a background image or exactly
like a background image really and in
here I have to put the path so I've
added an icon I'm gonna do IMG / icon
dot PNG and that's not gonna work it's
dot dot slash so as a quick refresher
with this dot dot what's going on is
let's open up my file
I'm currently inside this folder this is
inside my CSS document so I'm telling my
CSS document it has to go up one level
so the dot dot means go back to my first
website and then from there I'm going to
my image folder and then I'm finding
icon dot PNG which is my new icon that
I've added into here so with that setup
I'm just going to save my document and
hit the refresh button and you can see
it switches over to the icon that I've
created just be really careful with this
it's going to take whatever icon you
choose at full size so let's just say
for fun instead of this I wanted my
little hamster jpig as my image it's
hanging off the side here we can't even
see it in my document because it's going
off the page and it's the full size of
the picture so if you are creating your
icon you want to use a custom icon
instead of a bullet point or whatever
just make sure that you choose a very
small icon or you create a very small
icon so because there's multiple parts
to a list we can also style those parts
and let's do this for on ordered list
here what I can do is I'm going to give
my whole list a background of pink so we
can see what my list looks like and you
can see it's this big block like that
and the reason it is that size is I'm
selecting my whole list so my whole list
is one big item that has some items
inside of it so it's one big block and
let's just add a little bit of padding
to that so I can see things a bit better
so padding 20 pixels just to make it
look a little nicer I would normally add
a background to a list like this but
let's make that 50 actually it's causing
some issues on the side here there we go
so I have my my list like that but I
also have list items so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to choose my
unordered list list items and I'm gonna
give them a background of red when I do
that it's going to highlight just the
list items but it looks like one big
block just to show you the margin five
pixels just to create a bit of space
between them and just to show you there
they're not one big block each list item
is its own big line here so I can space
out my items just by using margin
that margin-bottom 15 pixels so I can
use margin top and bottom to create the
spaces on my list items the same way I
could do for my paragraphs and now you
also notice that I did my list items
inside of my UL so we looked a little
bit at this in the previous video with
this type of selector so this is my list
items inside of my UL if I only selected
my list items it would do all of them so
I would choose my list items here and my
list items here which I didn't want to
do I only wanted the ones that were
inside this area so similarly I could
take my oal and give that one a
background of light blue with padding of
50 as well and then I could come down
and give my Oh al allies a background of
background of blue and hit refresh add
my margin on there margin bottom 10
pixels and we can't read the text so
let's just change the text color over to
white there we go it looks a little bit
better one thing really quick you'll
notice even though these are hanging off
the side so my list item really only is
this text and this is sort of this extra
stuff that's getting added by the
browser automatically the color of this
will match the color of your text and
that applies to regular icons as well so
if my icons it's a picture so we'll
always keep the same color but if
instead of that I just use the regular
bullet points the bullet points will
match the color of my text now there's
one more property that I think it's
important to show you and it depends
what browser you're using Firefox does
this a little bit different than Chrome
and Safari so you if you're using
Firefox you might not ever run into this
problem but you have to take into
account all the browser's and what I'm
going to do is for my whole page I'm
just going to text-align:center so let's
go find my body tag I want everything on
my body
text-align:center and you'll notice that
what it's doing is its centering the
text inside of the list item but it's
leaving the bullet points and my numbers
off on the side here in Firefox it would
actually bring the things in here and
let's just change the length of my text
to show you really how this bullet point
number one or item number one let's do
list item number two and I'll leave the
other two the same just went if the list
items are different lengths now because
I have a background on here it doesn't
look too strange but we'll take our back
wrong document we'll take my background
color out
so my background blue let's take that
out and I'll even take out that light
blue we don't need that oh and the color
white so we can actually see really
what's going on and you'll notice this
looks really weird I get my list items
here in the middle of the page and I get
the numbering or the bullets over here
on the left and that just you can't
really read that people won't understand
really what's going on and this is one
of those browser defaults it's a bit
weird but on my o L I can change the
list style position and the choices are
inside outside or inherent which we
haven't looked at really the default
right now is outside and again outside
is the default in Chrome and in Safari
inside is the default in Firefox and I
apologize I don't know what the default
in Internet Explorer and edges I'm not
too sure so I'm going to switch this
over to inside I'm gonna save and you'll
see it jumps to the inside like that and
just to show you what this is actually
doing I'm gonna take it on this one as
well one one on my ul
and jumps to the inside so the
difference in inside and outside is my
all of my list items are even if the
text is very short the list item is
taking up all this space so it's a
really big list item even if the text is
small like this so when our text is
left-aligned we don't really notice
because my text is lining up right on
the left edge here and my numbers are
right there but what happens is when I
Center a line my text is jumping to the
middle of that box but my icons are
staying and over here and it looks a
little bit strange so the whole point of
this switching it over to inside is it
brings the icon from the outside of my
list item to the inside of my list item
and the numbers or bullets or whatever
icons I'm using will jump to the inside
of the list so if you are Center
aligning or right aligning your text it
will look much better and that's it for
list items you probably won't use them a
ton at least in standard lists like this
but they're actually used more on
websites than you might imagine so as
usual I really hope you like this video
