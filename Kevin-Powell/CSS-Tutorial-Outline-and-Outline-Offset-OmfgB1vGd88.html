channel we learned how to make the web
and how to make it look good while we're
at it with a new video every Wednesday
today we're going to be looking at a
little coding quickie we're going to be
looking at the CSS property that I
didn't know about for the longest time
but which I really love now the name
about it
outline the outline is fantastic for a
nice little extra touches from the
design of our sites and it's a lot like
the border property but it has a few big
differences so I've set up this code pen
as so I'm going to share the link to
this in the description below you can
come in here and play around with it if
ever you want to so the first thing I
wanna look at then one of the cool
things with the outline is it goes after
the border so we always have our border
that goes as far out all the way on the
edges so let's set one of those up on my
box here so we'll just do a nice simple
border let's say five pixels solid black
and I get a border all the way around my
box I'm assuming you guys know how that
works so if I come in here and I give
myself an outline and let's do five
pixels solid and we'll do red just so we
can really see it and there you go after
my border I get that red outline that
comes in there so that's nice that I can
sort of give myself a double border like
that so that's really neat one of the
first big differences that you'll see is
that with a border we can specify what
side we want to be working on so instead
of doing border like that I can say
border bottom and have a border only on
my bottom I can't do that with an
outline outline won't work that way so
if I do outline bottom it's just not
going to work
there's no outline bottom left right or
top it has to go on all four sides so
you might be sort of wondering what the
point of it is now right now it just
seems sort of like a not-so-good border
or dumbed-down border but we have this
really cool second property that comes
along with outline and that's called
outline offset and this is what it makes
it just amazing as far as I'm concerned
so let's change this let's leave it red
for now and I'll come down and add an
outline offset and I'm going to do of
five pixels
and you can see that's pushed it away
from my object by five pixels and let's
just make that a little bit bigger so
you can see it a bit bigger of a space
that's a bit more obvious so I can move
away from my object and one of the cool
things with this is it's not actually
going to push anything else around so if
I had something over here this would
actually overlap it's a little bit like
drop shadow or my box shadow and things
like that where it's going to cover
stuff it won't actually increase the
size of my container with the box model
the same way that padding margin and
border can do and also with that I can
do a negative offset so if I put that is
negative 20 it's going to go inside
instead of outside so I can add sort of
a border the stroke inside of my box
which can be nice as well for a bit of a
design element so instead of red maybe
I'd make that white and it would give me
this double border like that or if that
was a positive so let's just bring this
back to five pixels and give this the
same color aquamarine as my box and then
I sort of get this cool little double
box thing going on that looks really
nice so I really love the offset it's a
nice little thing it gives us a bit mm
you know a new way of expanding you have
a border that's always stuck to it so I
can break away one nice little use case
that you can use this for is buttons so
let's just make a quick button a href is
equal to nothing class is equal to
button hello
closing so that should give me my link
there it is and let's just style that
button a little bit so my button will
have a few things um let's do a text
decoration of none to start with and
let's give it a display:inline-block and
a background background of steel blue
padding of one m3m that looks all right
color whoops
color will be white and then a nice
thing we can do so as I mentioned I
bring in my offset so it's might not my
offset my outline will do a nice little
outline of say three pixels solid steel
blue and it's just adding to the overall
width of my button there so I have that
and obviously when I hover on top right
away it is give me a little flicker
it's a little bit of a weird thing with
the outline actually if you don't
specify it in the hover it just doesn't
exist it's usually the hover will copy
everything you have automatically but it
gets rid of the outline when I hover and
we'll see in a second how that can do
some interesting things but button:hover
oops here and this is where it can get a
little weird if I give this an offset
now outline offset of say five pixels I
you'll see it doesn't actually work it's
kind of weird that way but if I come in
here and I give this an outline of three
pixels solid steel blue now it's going
to jump out and away so I'm not sure why
it works that way but I do need to
specify my outline here and my align
over here and the main reason I want to
do that is because I actually want this
to transition transition all ease-in out
300 milliseconds and it gives me this
cool little hover effect going on right
there where that little thing you know
the whole box expands outwards and I
like that and again if I didn't have
this outline on there I would get this
weird sort of disappearing outline maybe
like that I find it really awkward and
confusing so just for whatever reason
you need to specify the outline in both
places for it to actually work properly
and if I don't have the outline here it
sort of works but it's not really
starting from any
so it sort of just fades in maybe you
like that I like having the outline in
both of them so it just grows out and
grows back in I find that looks a little
bit more natural and of course say I
made this white instead of and then did
this with a negative offset you could do
the same thing going inwards when you
hover over your box sort of goes that
way one thing that's really important
with the negative offset is because the
outline is on the outside so let's just
make this red it's like a border it's
going on the outside of my box and we'll
make this red too
so it's coming five pixels inside but it
looks really small because it's doing
five pixels inside but this is three so
I'm left with only two there so if you
really want a five pixel space all the
way around I'd want to do eight so I'm
going five plus three and now it's going
where I'd sort of expected to switch
those back to white just so we can make
it look a little nicer and seeing it
this this type of effect going on there
for a nice little hover and that's the
outline property so it's really not
anything too complicated but again I
didn't know about it for the longest
time I don't see it used very often so I
don't know if it's because people don't
know about it or they just don't know in
what cases to actually use it so I
encourage you to check it out try it out
if you do use it anywhere let me know
share it in the comments below if you
have any questions about how it works or
any ideas for other videos just leave
those down in the bottom in the comments
if you like the video make sure you hit
the thumbs up let me know that you liked
it and I'll see you next Wednesday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
