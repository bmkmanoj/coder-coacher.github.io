where I'm continuing my series on how to
build a complete website from scratch
responsive using flexbox and all of that
fun stuff we're going to be building out
this section that we see on the screen
right now it took me a little bit longer
than I thought it would I was hoping
this video would be really really short
because it looks really simple but I ran
into a bit of an unexpected problem when
I was trying to position this box
properly and just with the spacing that
I had on the top actually in the
previous video I'd already made my home
promo sass file which is being imported
already so everything is set up your for
it to work I don't know if I really need
that padding but I'm gonna leave it on
there for now and we'll adjust that as
we need so the very first thing I want
to do is get this app is amazing to be
in the box in the middle I'm not sure
well let's start with that I called that
one title box I think so let's go with
top title box let's see what happens
here I'm gonna give it a background of
accent yeah there we go perfect oh and
the color is obviously gonna have to
change color is my text inverse that
looks better awesome
now obviously it's stuck let's just fix
this a little bit so I want to be
focusing on mobile if you haven't been
following along the whole way just so
you know I am doing this at mobile first
so I'm designing the whole page mobile
first and then we'll jump in after and
switch it up to work on desktop at the
end we'll just run through and do all
our media queries so that looks okay and
my title box I might actually take out
of home promo because this is something
that I could use in other places on the
site if this site was gonna build up and
I don't think I'm gonna want to keep
that I'm just gonna take that off for
now it's creating this massive space on
the bottom that we don't really need
yeah okay so this app is amazing I'm
gonna leave that there for now
another thing I need is I need I want
doing great things for you all of that
should be in a different background
color right
so I'm gonna split my HTML down for a
second here split down just because I
want to see that's my hero area sales
points per Omo section so I did title
box and then I just put a column with my
button in it and then my other column
which has my image in it I'm going to
give this column another class and we'll
just call it background secondary
primary I think it was my primary color
primary and this too I'm putting all
these in the promo because it's for this
and I'm gonna leave them here but we
might move things around because these
are classes that I could definitely use
in other places if this site was bigger
these are more general classes I would
say background primary did I get it
right whoops I didn't call it primary
called it mean I switched my naming
conventions recently for my main from
primary to main I think I'm gonna go
back to primary I like that better but
that's okay and color of text inverse so
we can see it all that's good it
obviously needs some padding padding in
this case I'm not inside a container so
I actually do want to give it some
padding on the right and left as well so
let's just try giving it padding of 2.5
m the whole way around and see what
happens that looks pretty good I'm happy
with that
except I'm gonna need more on the top
because this box should be moved down on
top of that one a little bit for my
mobile view I don't want this to be too
columns I'm actually going to make this
disappear on the mobile side I think I
think it would be better you know I
don't want a giant picture like that it
looks a little weird so I think I'm
gonna make that one disappear the same
way let's just open up my Photoshop
document so I don't want two columns cuz
there's not enough room really for two
columns and I don't have this big phone
showing up in the mobile view either
that's only going to show up once we
start doing our desktop I'm gonna do the
same thing with this picture this
picture is not necessary it's just sort
of getting in the way
bitte so we're just going to get rid of
it at the mobile view and it's going to
appear at the larger screen sizes so
let's just focus on this year I think
that looks okay um I just want to sort
of position this properly now
and actually it's go back to photoshop
for one second I have a lot more letter
spacing between these than I have here
I'll fix that
once we've positioned this better so I'm
going to jump back into the title box
and what do I want to do I want to
Center that on the screen so let's just
do a margin of zero Auto so it's going
to Center it that's nice and easy I want
to give it some padding padding of 1m
maybe I don't want as much on that
that's not too bad actually and the main
thing now I want to move it down so to
move it down the easiest thing to do is
a translate y transform sorry transform
translate Y and a translate y 50% so
it's exact the middle of it is exactly
here now the one thing with translate is
it will make it's moving this but as you
can see it's sort of not affecting the
flow so even though that's moving down
let's just take that off for a second so
it's not this space here is actually
getting a lot bigger when I do that
because it's not changing the flow if I
do an inspect element on that one
see the section promo hasn't been
affected even though that has moved down
so whenever you're using transforms to
move stuff around just be aware of that
it might cause some spacing issues so
I'm gonna have to come in and fix that
and before I do that let's just fix the
padding padding top let's make that five
so I'm going to double it and then 2.5 m
2.5 M so it's five on the top 2.5 on the
left and right and 2.5 on the bottom and
I'm actually going to give it a little
bit more on the top let's go with 6
just to get a bit more space there yes
yes yes I'm going to go back to
photoshop really quick this has a lot
more space around today but on the
mobile sizes that's not really gonna
work I will give it a bit more padding
though what about - okay that's not too
bad and now let's go so a few things to
fix now so I'm gonna fix this big space
here so let's go right to there now that
should be in my layout home sales points
and padding is 10 VH on the top and I
think I can actually just do a 0-0 so
I'm gonna have 10 padding on the top and
I don't think I need anything anywhere
else let's just see whoops
saving the wrong thing save my sass file
there we go no normally if this didn't
have that translate on it they would be
touching each other but because it has
the translate and it's moving down I am
getting my space there this is still too
close now that I look at it again these
are way way way too close to each other
so home promo again the top let's make
this like 8 I need a lot more room there
that's better so we're coming down let's
just see how this looks now as a whole
I'm coming down promote your app that
looks nice that looks good this app is
amazing super yeah I think that looks
nice that you can definitely even on the
mobile size it lets just if I shrink
that it's not causing any side scrolling
so it's okay yeah hmm well I'm going
really small though it's a scooter or an
iPhone 5 and then iPhone 6 and obviously
best-case scenario I would be testing
this on an actual phone I wouldn't be
just using this but for now and for the
video that's okay mmm it's a bit of a
problem for me in my opinion right now
that this is taking up that full space
why is it doing that where does it hmm
just because when it's like this this
looks like two different sections right
now and when it's like this it looks
like it's clearly like because of the
way it's overlapping you can sort of
tell that they belong together a little
bit more
and what's that overlap disappears you
can't really tell that they belong
together as much it really looks like
just like two different sections and
it's also screwing up a few things okay
so what am I in it do you is this gonna
work
margin padding what if I just do a max
width on this of max width of 90% I
honestly don't know if this is gonna
work but what I'm hoping this is gonna
do just the reason I'm trying this is
max width won't make things bigger if I
just did width 90 percent it's gonna go
to 90 percent but max width it's gonna
stay at its actual size but if it has to
get small that should be min width not
max that worked yeah the biggest it's
allowed to be that I was right so you
can clearly see that these go together
now the only problem is the spacing is
stokin off but again I'm way too narrow
nothing's that size but let's go back to
the iPhone 5 because that's small now
it's hmm I don't feel like building in
media queries for this but I'm wondering
if I'm going to need to this space is
kind of big you know I like that space
look better is that just oh because it's
moving down 50 percent and that 50
percents a lot more now because it's
pretty tall
so when it when it's not as tall let's
just jump up to a larger screen size it
doesn't move down as much so this space
is smaller but when it gets really tiny
when the screen gets tiny oops wrong way
this is getting taller so it's moving
down more and it's creating a bigger
space here
and I'm trying to think of a clever way
to fix that and off the top of my head I
can't let's just see yeah let's turn
that picture off for now because I know
how to do that whenever I'm stuck on
something and this is supposed to be
about my workflow so whenever I am stuck
on something I tend to just move on
instead of trying to waste time on that
one thing and sometimes ideas just come
along and worst case scenario you have
to go back and put the time into it
anyway but yeah let's just turn this
picture off so we don't see it now I'd
called that column and I called it image
box and I'm gonna give it another name
I'm gonna call it a large screen and I'm
gonna use this in a few spots I might
have already died I'm really not used to
working on projects so slowly guys um a
hero image how come I don't see my hero
I'm in today I turn the hero image off I
must have I keep saving the wrong file
save save I just want to see my hero for
a second hero hero image display:none I
was sort of cheating with that okay so
let's fix that at the same time then
I'll go back to my index hero image will
also be a large screen we're gonna
remove this from here cut save that so
my phone's gonna show up now and I'm
going to go to my base and in my base
it's a sort of basis where I put a lot
of my helper classes so large screen
this one actually has to be built into a
media query or no display none for now
so if it's large screen its display:none
that should didn't they call that large
screen I hope I have to save this over
here to save that should disappear good
and now that other picture should also
be gone good what I do with my large
screen is it's just I'm only want that
to appear on large screens this is
pretty much what it is
so nice and simple so that's okay and
I'm just gonna leave hero like that now
I can close hero down and this is okay
now large screen is good my base now
these should actually title box I'm
gonna take out of home promo
now remove it from there and I'm gonna
move that into my typography because it
belongs with my typography so I have my
title large I have a title box my texts
intros my bigger paragraph text so this
really belongs in typography I'm
modifying a title and it even goes with
the naming conventions that I had a
title large I have my title box all
things like that go for me in my
typography the other one that I'd thrown
in here BG primary is to give anything I
want a that type of background color so
it's not typography at all it's more
just something that would go in my base
file it's something that could be used
anywhere so I'm gonna paste that in here
it's just something that could be used
throughout a site anywhere it's a helper
class so yeah I'm throwing that just in
my base style and my home promo is
actually going to be an empty file for
now I'm gonna leave that file there and
just leave it empty for the moment just
in case actually maybe I should put some
margin on the bottom I put the padding
this padding though is really specific
to this one box because I'm worrying
about the height on the top there so
it's not really a base style if it's
really specific to this the background
color and the text color are and because
it is something that is setting up a
background color it should have some
padding so I'm going to leave my 2.5 M
on there for now save my Texas new
underneath and then in home promo let's
go back to here for a second
let's go find it in my HTML column and I
just called it background primary um
background primary and I'm gonna call it
what I could do and this is again one
talk about my workflow and how I work I
could do something like promo BG primary
and for those of you who aren't used to
SAS that's just the same as you know
writing it like that
my background primary that's inside of
promo I could do that but I don't like
doing stuff like that because it's
harder to maintain it makes it much
harder to maintain stuff like that
because you're getting more specific if
you need to overwrite it again or you
need to use it somewhere else it just
doesn't work much in this case title box
I want to call it almost like after
title box because that padding on the
top is necessary if I'm using my title
box cuz that's being moved down I'm
wondering even if I could build that
into my title box but I wouldn't be able
to you know if I had my title box plus a
BG primary back padding top was it eight
that I went with oh it should be a
period so I could do something like that
where anytime I have a title box
followed by a BG primary it has to have
automatically a padding top of eight
which sort of makes a lot of sense right
because anytime I have that it should
normally be followed by that I'm gonna
leave it like that for now
so anytime where's the title box and it
has a sibling of BG primary that sibling
will get a padding eight
the top so we get that space that we
need the next thing I'm gonna go and do
and fix is in my tape aughh Rafi let's
jump over to typography again I have
that open oh I'm already in my
typography so in here my h1 I need some
letter spacing on this um letter spacing
it's pretty big what I did
let's try like five pixels yeah that's
right for that looks okay now is that
gonna screw this one up that doesn't
look so good and I don't think I did any
letter spacing oh I did have letter
spacing there okay so I can leave that
on I'm not rude it's a bit too big with
this screen size three and that's okay I
sort of like that now three works for me
and the reason again I jumped to that
because I want to focus on this and I
still don't know how I'm gonna do that
so I was jumping ahead a little bit
hoping to get an idea on how I could fix
this space because let's just jump over
to responsive it looks good I'm really
happy with it there and then right as
soon as that becomes two lines which is
right around 500 pixels so I could build
a media query into there but I find
right there the space just well it's
this basically it's a little bit too big
that's not the end of the world really
when the space jumps there it's when it
jumps right there now it's massive now
it's way too big
what can I do to stop that space from
getting really big I could build a media
query into it that I don't really want
to do that might be the best solution
though let's just say title box at media
width of 495 pixels it's not even on my
title box that I'd have to do this this
is really ugly guys let's go back then
this is gonna have to be on my sales
points where my padding is gonna get
adjusted on the bottom and that's gonna
screw everything up this media query
can't go here this media query will go
yeah so media query goes there so it's
inside the sales points and it's padding
bottom of zero
oh wow they take that it's not gonna
work at all so it's not really how I
wanted this to work but I'm gonna try
doing this a little bit differently
let's destroy 20% that space is too big
padding top of say six now let's do 30%
actually it's still pretty obvious that
this is the title because it's
overlapping and I think this is a nice
compromise it's not right 50% now the
one thing may be important here is you
don't put it like 45% it's gonna overlap
the text a little bit right now but if I
do 45% it's so close to the middle but
it's a little bit off it looks kind of
weird if you're not gonna perfectly
center something just make sure that's
more off and it looks like it's more
it's done more on purpose now and my
space here is a lot more reasonable and
then as this gets bigger so right around
there and I could build a media query
into that so I could say at media
min-width
of 495 pixels my transform translate why
whoops is now 50% and now it should be
it's there and when I get to 495 my
translate changes minimum width
except of course it's not working let's
go take a look at what sales points
promote title box
why is my media query not working guys
hmm that's weird I'm gonna go look at my
rendered CSS and see how that's coming
out I haven't opened this up in a while
waving to normalize and all at the top
dududu normalizes most of this
here it is
so at medium in with 495 title box at a
minute min did I min oh that's why I
misspelled wit haha spelling mistake
suck min-width
there we go that's better and the other
thing we're gonna have to fix is that
padding top I don't like having tons of
media queries or stuff like this but
oops that should be indented and I
didn't really want to get into them yet
but whoops I'm talking and writing at
the same time it's not my strong suit I
mean with 495 padding top becomes 8m I
probably want a bit more space on the
bottom I like this space here I want to
get a bit more space down there at the
bottom just to make it it's a little
like this it's it's still a bit too
tight there to do that was in my base
that I closed it no I have it down there
so yeah let's just change this padding
top and left and right
I think 2.5 makes sense but top and
bottom let's make it even as big as like
5m that looks better that bigger space
down at the bottom looks much much nicer
and let's just see yeah cool there we go
so that actually took a lot longer than
I thought it would I thought this would
be a really short video but there we
have it it is done it's looking good on
mobile screens and yeah I hope you liked
