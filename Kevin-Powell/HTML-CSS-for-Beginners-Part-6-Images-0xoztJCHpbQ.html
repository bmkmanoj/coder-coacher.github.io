series on HTML and CSS for beginners my
name is Kevin and today we're looking at
putting some pictures on our website so
let's go and do that right now
the images are a pretty big part of the
web today and without them our pages
would be pretty boring so let's see what
we can do now image tags are one of the
few that don't have a closing tag one of
the other ones we've already seen with
that is the meta tag up here so when we
put our meta tag in you notice I never
closed the meta tag other ones include
things like BR and Link and yes there is
a link but tag but it's not the same as
our a tags that we've already looked at
we'll worry about that later and there's
a few others that don't close but
there's not too many and images are one
of them and it doesn't close because all
the information we need is in the
opening tag so let's let's go and put an
image in the image tag is nice and
simple so I'm gonna I have my first
paragraph here right after my first
paragraph let's delete that comment that
I don't need anymore and put in IMG
that's it that's an image tag but
there's something missing obviously and
it's a little bit like links a link
without an href doesn't really do
anything cuz it's not actually linking
somewhere so an image tag just like this
let's save and refresh and it makes a
little space but there's nothing there
because the browser doesn't know what
it's supposed to put there sadly it's
not the href attribute again that would
be too easy an image it's SRC image
source so same idea as before I put my
two little quotation marks and we're
good to go
so the first one I'm going to do I've
got this beautiful picture of a sunset
right here so I'm gonna come here and do
copy image address and um this is
somewhere else on the internet so I'm
going to take that and I'm gonna paste
it right here and I'm gonna save that
and hit refresh and there's my sunset so
just like my links this is an absolute
path this is somewhere else on the
internet I don't have a picture of a
sunset on my computer anywhere this is
on another page that I found if I'm
linking somewhere else I need to put the
HTTP without that the image will not
work properly but what if I have a
picture that I took or a picture I have
my computer that I want to use well it's
a lot like this and as I mentioned early
on everything we need has to be in our
root folder so I've already gone and
saved a picture here and I've put it
into my root folder so I have my index
that we looked at in the last video we
created the page to really quickly and
then I have this hamster dot JPEG that
I've brought in and just dropped into my
first website folder that was on my
desktop so let's add that let's go and
put this one after my second paragraph
so I'll come in here and put IMG SRC and
what I want to do now is I want to put
my the name of the file so ham ster dot
jpg I'm gonna save that I'm gonna
refresh and it didn't work and if ever
you see this it means it can't find your
picture and I always have a little
trouble spelling hamster so because I
put a P in there hamster instead of
hamster let's save that and refresh and
there comes my picture so spelling is
very very important that's the same for
links but it's a little different for
links if you're working on a link and
you you know say I put Google without
the e well it just won't find the page
so somebody clicks on it it doesn't go
where they were expecting it to with the
picture though when you misspell it so
like me I like spelling hamster with a P
it gives me this little broken image and
it doesn't look so good
so get rid of that make sure you spell
things correctly very important and
there's my cute little hamster and the
page is looking much better now there's
something missing though for an image
tag to actually be valid and acceptable
code we need to include a second
attribute and the next attribute so I'm
going to come right after this quotation
and I put a space and write alt equals
and put my quotation marks alt stands
for alternate text it's pretty much a
description of your picture so a
beautiful sunset and let's come down to
my hamster al t is equal to an adorable
mr. with no P refresh and it looks
exactly the same it doesn't actually
change your picture when you include the
alt text or alternative tech I'm always
just going to call that alt text since
we're just writing alt and it's much
easier to say so alternative text serves
a really important purpose and for an
image tag you need to put it for the tag
to begin server valid and there's two
times where it gets used or maybe more
but there's two important times it gets
used say someone for some reason it's
disabled images on their website or
let's say the Internet's really slow for
some reason the image just doesn't load
or there was a problem they will see the
description so that's kind of handy and
it's also for people who are using
screen readers you know they might have
a visual impairment they're visiting the
site they can't really see the picture
the screen reader is reading all the
text and when it gets to a picture it's
actually gonna read the alt text some
people try and cheat systems a little
bit they're using their alt tags for
search engine optimization which is a
completely other topic but if you're
doing your alt text properly it should
be a description of the photo you should
be able to read this and know what the
photo is without actually seeing it you
can get very detailed in them a
beautiful sunset with orange guy over
you know the ocean with some rocks here
it would be an adorable hamster on a
grey table with a blurry background you
know we want to make it as clear as
possible for the person who's someone
who's visiting the sites you might not
be able to see what they're looking at
so alt text is something that's
important and you should use it properly
now another thing that's sort of an
important thing with images is you might
see them written sometimes like this
I'll do it for both of them so a space
they're at the end and then with that
because there's no closing image tag the
image is just an image and it works like
that so because there's no closing tag
in the old days of HTML 4 and previous
you had to put this forward slash in the
opening tag just to also let the browser
know it was then closing you're closing
it without having to add the extra tag
with HTML 5 you don't need to do this
anymore some people are still into sort
of more strict writing of code
but it's becoming more standard and it's
not necessary html5 is smart enough to
know that what's going on so I'm never
really gonna be doing it but just you
know if you ever do see it with the
forward slash close in there and what
it's doing and why people are doing it
but again if you want to go ahead
there's nothing wrong with it it works
perfectly fine and if it makes more
sense to you
awesome but I'm lazy the less keystrokes
I have to do the better so I don't
bother with it anymore
so we've got two pictures on my site now
the first one using an absolute path and
the second one using a relative path and
well that's it and I hope that makes
sense if you have any trouble getting
images to work on your site for any
reason leave a comment below and let me
know I'll see if I can help you out hope
you like this video like it if you did

I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
