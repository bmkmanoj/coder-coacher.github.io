series now sadly this isn't exactly the
video I wanted to be making but we're
going to do some good stuff in here
we're gonna do some troubleshooting and
bug fixing and since we're gonna be
continuing with the navigation we're
also gonna make it work as I put in
these links but currently when if we
click on one nothing actually happens so
we want to fix that and make sure that
it does and at the same time I just want
to give a big shout out and thank you to
sa bukhari John Mercier Andrew cash in
the three of you guys help point out the
a couple of mistakes that I made along
the way one of them is just a complete
oversight by me and the other ones this
weird bug or there's a couple of weird
bugs that popped up and I still I think
we know if I figured out how to fix them
but we'll get there in a little bit so
this video is all going to be about
fixing some some strange bugs as well as
actually getting these links to work
which will mean a little bit more
JavaScript so what the first thing is
which was a complete oversight by myself
was when I click this I get this nasty
scrollbar down on the side here which is
no good I don't want to have side
scrolling on my website obviously so
that one luckily is a really easy fix
I'm just gonna jump right over here my
base CSS file I want to be right on my
body and on my body what I want to do is
I just want to say that the overflow X
is hidden so I'm gonna save that so what
that just means anything that's
overflowing left and right will
disappear we won't be able to see it and
I'm gonna get rid of that so we have a
bit more room so let's click that and
now see and there it goes
amazing so that's nice and handy now the
other problem though is a bit more of a
bug and it's not something I could
replicate in Firefox I am using Firefox
nightly but I also try to do it in the
regular Firefox and I didn't see it in
there
and what that is is in so if I come in
look in the responsive mode here
everything seems to be working all fine
and dandy and I can even take the little
hand icon because they put it up there
and there's a little delay but that's
normal because they're just trying to
set it up - it looks just like it would
on the phone the problem happens when we
come over to Chrome so in chrome
everything's working fine it's looking
great we think it's all good but if I do
my inspect and I'm in responsive mode so
here again everything is working fine
I'm going to go into responsive mode and
I'm gonna click and everything's okay
and we'll now watch what happens when I
click this close that was weird right
did you see it I'll do it again and
we'll close and it's this weird little
flash and thing that's happening so just
to show you and give you a better idea
of what is actually happening I'm just
gonna come in here and I'm gonna take my
nav and let's just slow this down a
little bit I'll put it up to one second
but I'm still getting that weird buggy
thing so it's working okay but then BOOM
and the thing that's even weirder about
this as far as I'm concerned is if I
find my nav where is it might have here
so it currently is a width of 343 pixels
and it's gonna come and when I click the
X the width goes up and it goes back
down and then it goes back up and even
if I just click on Avenue or if we go
off and on its back to 343 so for some
reason the width of the navigation is
getting toyed around with in responsive
mode only and this also means this is on
your cell phone as well I don't actually
know what's causing this one thing I
tried doing is instead of setting it all
up like this
I just gave this a width of 80% and I'm
gonna save that and I'm still getting
the same problem and then I said well
maybe oops that should have you know
it's still ni8 gets even worse now
because now I get this and I can't do it
and that's a weird bug that's only
happening sometimes but I'm still
getting it and then I said well what if
I even gave it a whip like a set width
so if I set a width of 600 pixels so
even with a width of 600 pixels well
that's probably too big let's try
300 off to refresh my page when I close
its just bugging out completely now
which is really weird so refresh close
and it just bugs out but if I go over to
Firefox it's fine
so I honestly I honestly don't know
what's causing this review do you know
please let me know well I sort of know
what's causing it I've narrowed it down
to one thing and it's position fixed
here I'm gonna undo and go back to the
original code that I had this set up
with and I'm not sure why but if this is
position fixed and I tried position
sticky distr see if that wouldn't change
anything it doesn't but if I change this
to position absolute all my problems go
away oh my goodness look at that
isn't that weird so setting it to
position absolute instead of position
fixed solves all of those issues which
is really really nice the main issue
that is still left over is when I click
on that if I'm using position absolute
it means that I can scroll down and
that's not something that I want um and
while I'm here now that I've scrolled
down I can see this lid a little line
down here and a little while back
Anthony L suggested using the the not to
be able to select that and honestly I
should have done that from the very
beginning and I just didn't think of it
when I was doing it so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take this border bottom off
and we're going to come onto here I'm
gonna say at so this is my I'm going nav
Li and then I want to say not and then
in my not I can say which one I don't
want to select and I don't want to
select my last of type so I'm selecting
all of them except the last of type and
what I want to do for that is I want to
put on my border bottom so it should
look exactly the same it should just
took it should just take the this bottom
one off so I'm gonna save and there you
go you can see that that one that was on
the bottom is now gone so that looks a
little bit nicer and now we can get back
on track with what we were doing
and so what we were doing was we don't
want this to be able to scroll with this
being on position:absolute so in this
case I want to limit the the overall
height of everything right so I'm I was
gonna put it on my container all but I'm
wondering if I should just say that the
body is is set to the maximum height so
we're gonna try that I'm gonna say that
my nav is inside my nav is open again
I'm gonna do and no and I'm gonna say my
body and no that's not gonna work oh I'm
being silly
if Navis open F is open as a class that
is being applied to my body so what I
can say is if nav is open which means
the body in itself the height of my body
should be 100 viewport height and should
have an overflow I can just do
overflow:hidden now I don't have to
worry about X or Y so I'm gonna save
that and oh it's still sprawling if I
just do it overflow Y hidden oh now it's
working there it's working so once that
comes out you can see now I can't whoops
that's not what I wanted to do that's
sort of screwed everything up because
it's open just refresh I want to make
sure this is working properly open no
scrolling I have my links still no
scrolling close now I can scroll again
and that also makes sense because when I
open this I generally want to be able to
close it right I don't want to scroll
down because then my little X would
disappear so this probably makes more
sense anyway so that's good
I think that's fixed that problem um the
last thing is when I get to here I want
to be able to click on one of those and
actually go to that area so for that
we're gonna go over to my index and I
need to set up these links so I'm gonna
do my welcome and this home one is kind
of useless cuz we're already at the top
but anyway ID is equal to
we'll set it up anyway I guess I could
put it on the intro but we'll leave it
there I'll have an ID is equal to about
well have an ID is equal to port folio
and we'll have an ID is equal to oh it's
not on that one
let's roll down down down down and here
we'll have an ID is equal to contact so
I'll save that the page should refresh
and now I should be able to go there and
when I click on this it should go to
there hi it worked
except it didn't really work because I
don't want to be looking at that and I
can at least at least I can scroll but
it's gonna be causing some issues
because the whole body height thing so
if I go to contact and it go to contact
but that's not what I want I don't I
want and have is this is just you know
it's not working properly and I'm locked
into a height because of my overflow
thing and all of that jazz that I was
playing with before so I'm gonna refresh
my page and we're gonna come over to my
nav
j/s again so we're gonna bring another
variable so I'm gonna reading Const and
this one isn't me the navigation itself
so this one is equal to my document
query selector and it's gonna look for
my nap I could do a query selector all
and look for all of my nav links but
what you're gonna see this is going to
make it a little bit easier so I just
want to select my nav itself the main
reason I want to do this is I'm adding
in another event listener so I'm going
to dive add event listener we're going
to listen for a click once again and if
somebody clicks we're going to do
something it's very similar to what we
did before so let's just make sure this
is even working so I'm going to do a
console log click save that and let's go
see if this works so I'm just going to
open up my console and let's go find my
navigation so if I click on anything
here we should doesn't matter where I'm
clicking and of course it's bringing me
there
but we should be able to click anywhere
inside our navigation and I'll just
click on this one a few times so we can
see that it's working and it's
registering my clicks so I know that it
is working and the advantage of doing it
with my nav and not looking on each of
them is right now I'm adding one event
listener if I did my query selector all
first of all it'd be a little bit more
complicated to set up the JavaScript
because we'd have to go through the the
node list of all of I think it's a node
list right the query selector all we'd
have to go through each one and we'd
have to set up an event listener for all
four of them if you had five that's five
or and if it's six then you have six and
event listeners they're not free of
charge they can cause some performance
issues you want to limit the amount of
event listeners you have to the least
amount possible and it doesn't matter
what we're clicking on here the
important thing is when we click we want
to make sure that the nav is open is no
longer open so I'm gonna do my document
body class list and instead of doing
toggle I'm just gonna do remove I don't
want to take any chances so I'm gonna
remove nav is open this might seem
strange you might say this is a bit of
overkill to remove and you know I could
have turned abstracted this out into a
little function and made it a little bit
cleaner but the reason I want to do this
is a remove is the only thing I want
this to do is remove no one can click it
when it's off the screen but who knows
if somebody manages to do something
weird so I'm just saying if somebody
manages to click on one make sure that
you're removing it and you're not
toggling it so if I click on home it
should close and it did if I go on a
boat it should bring me to my boat and
it looks like we have a new bug no let's
get out of here
I just want to see how this is gonna
work here see it works Chrome you're not
being my friend so now it's working
properly
it's kind of weird I guess that the page
has to slide back in when I click okay
so I'm not really sure what's causing
this bug but well I've sort of figured
it out so if I click here and I go it
works so in again if we're in the normal
desktop version everything's fine for
over in Firefox guess what everything's
fine
it just works fine if I enter responsive
mode in Firefox everything is fine the
problem is once again the mobile version
of Chrome which causes that weird thing
to happen so it transitions back and
then jumps up now one thing I noticed in
Firefox is even if I'm in the responsive
mode here when I click on say portfolio
it just jumps there I don't see much
going on
whereas in Chrome you can really see
this slide the site sliding back in and
then it jumps and if I turn off my
transition from my container all you'll
see that when I click on portfolio it
works so it has something to do with the
transition interestingly enough but I'm
not quite sure why that transition would
be causing issue now the transition was
also causing or it will position:fixed
with sort of causing their issue now the
thing I guess I'm wondering is what the
best solution is because I definitely
need it to slide when I'm pushing that
and when I'm pushing the X I want it to
slide but if I'm clicking on one of
those I don't want it to slide so do I
keep this or now I'm you know this is
where everything gets a little bit
weirder and do I need to come in and the
worst is I tested this on another site
and I was just playing around and I
don't have any of these issues so I
don't know if it's something I did in
this site
specifically it's causing it if any of
you have any insight I would greatly
appreciate it because this is literally
driving me crazy
so what I'm going to do is so I'm
wondering if I should do my container
all is equal to document ready to do a
whole document I'm just going to think
yeah document query selector and it was
my container all and then what I could
do actually we could turn this back on
let's turn that back on I think this
would be easier so it's on and what I'll
do is when we click with this I want to
remove the style I'm a little worried
that I'm going to break everything with
this but let's try it out
so when we click I'm gonna do my
container all I want to look at the
style I want to do my trance form now I
went to my transition let me just look
here is that just a whoops transition
yeah I'm just doing a transition so my
transition is gonna equal to 0
milliseconds right I just want to take
my transition off let's see if that
works I'm not sure if that'll work yeah
that worked now the problem is that the
style is still on there so now when I
click on this and now that the like now
that transition is left the transition
is no longer there so I think now what I
also need to do here is do a container
all style transition so if I'm clicking
on my nav toggle so actually yeah we'll
get rid of this doot-doot-doot we can
just delete this we don't need it
anymore
this is gonna come from rjs instead so
here we would have my transition is
equal to what did I have it as to try
transform 250 milliseconds ease in yep
so if I click on this it's gonna have it
should be getting the transition and if
I'm clicking on this there should be no
transition and it just jumps there and
it works yes now let's clean up this
JavaScript a little bit because we can
clean this up a bit and we can also do
two things here we can do two more
variables just to help clean things up
so I'm gonna do a Const container let's
just do cons all style so then we can
just take this so we don't have to
repeat ourselves so much is equal to
that so that means I can just use this
here instead and you know it's yeah
there we go just a little bit shorter
and then I can also get rid of all this
document.body classlist business by
saying const body class list is equal to
my document body class list so instead
of having to write all that out each
time I can just say body class list and
we can replace that here and replace
that right there just to make things a
little bit shorter
it's sort of an unnecessary step just
making sure everything's still working
which it is awesome
I'm gonna actually put container kind
Taner
I think it makes a little bit more
readable so my container style will turn
the transition style and transition good
so I feel like this
I shouldn't need to have this it seems
you're working everywhere but I do need
to have it and I'm glad we got that
fixed up so my links are now working I
think I've gotten rid of any weird
strange bugs that were happening and if
there are some strange bugs that you
know of please let me know if you know
why any of those bugs were happening
please let me know because maybe my
Google wasn't up to par today but I just
couldn't figure out what the heck was
going on so thanks so much for watching
as usual I hope you like this video
and finally in the next video we will be
getting into doing the modal's so the
first one will be designing the modal's
and then after that we get to get into
some pretty intense JavaScript actually
to get it all working the way I want it
to work so it should be a lot of fun I
look forward to seeing you in that video
and until then don't forget to make your
horn in the Internet just a little bit
more awesome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
