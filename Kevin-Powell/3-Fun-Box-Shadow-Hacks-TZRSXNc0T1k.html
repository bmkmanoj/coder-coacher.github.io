box-shadow property we've seen how to
use them in your designs effectively and
now we're gonna see three unconventional
ways you can use them in your website
today hacks you might even say that
we'll just make you be able to write
less markup and have really cool designs
so let's go check those out so what
we're gonna be looking at in this video
the first one is being able to add
multiple borders or something which is
really cool I can be handy depending on
your design there's also this here where
we have it like peeled corners instead
of having it just like a flat shadow
down at the bottom which I think looks
pretty good and the last thing is if
ever you're doing modal's you can see on
this model here I have the background is
getting grayed out and we can do that
without actually having to use any
markup so let's go and check that out we
have nothing else I just have my little
box right here so let's see how we can
create a fake border to start with so
here on my box I'm gonna add in a box
shadow
let's make only one D and shadow let's
make this a little bigger just to make
it easier to see what we're doing so box
shadow so to create a fake border we
just need a whole bunch of zeros in
there and then a spread and you can see
right away that it's working so that's
pretty handy you might have remembered
from really early on if I just did like
20 pixels 20 pixels something like that
with an offset you're gonna get the same
type of thing right we're getting the
shadow so we saw it in the very first
video I was doing so it's coming with
the black shadow like that so if I come
in and do so instead of doing it like
that I want to keep that same one so I
have to do the zero for my blur because
if I ignore that number nothing's really
gonna work and then I'm gonna do 20
pixels and then I can put the color or
we can just leave it as black like that
if we want to let's go with red for now
just so we have a color on there
so right away it's creating a fake
border and that's really really handy
and if I want to create more fake
borders as we've seen we can have
multiple shadows if we want just by
comma separating them so I can come in
and now let's do 40 pixels and we'll go
with pink I'm just gonna come here and
actually push return just to make it a
bit easier so we're not side-scrolling a
little bit so I have my pink and that's
come in and let's
another one here is zero zero zero sixty
pixels and let's go with a green or
something like that just to have
multiple on there now one thing you'll
notice is each one is twenty pixels
thick is this first one is twenty pixels
this one is underneath that so it
actually needed to be forty pixels
because it's starting at the same place
as the last one so if you do want to
have multiple shadows like this you do
have to play around with it a little bit
just to get it to work properly another
thing that's really important to
consider when you're doing this is if
you do have some extra content it's
possible that that content gets covered
by your shadows let's just make this
last green one really big so we can see
here that it's I'm exaggerating here
just because we had a big space in the
content you can see that it's covering
up the content that I had and that can
be a problem and the reason this happens
is because with shadows they're not part
of the Box model they're not getting
added into the total size of my document
they don't go with the flow of the
document which is really handy that's
really good because if not it we would
just never use the Box shadow but it
just means to be careful with that one
solution so you don't have to worry
about it as much it's just to make them
all in set shadows in set and in set so
if I do that it works now if you do that
the only thing is you'd probably want to
increase your padding a little bit just
to make sure that you can you know you
still have enough space on the inside
but at least when you do that you know
that it won't cover the things you know
it won't cover up other things that are
on the outer content
so just by makes it a little easier just
use a bit of padding and it will fix any
issues on the inside so yeah I think
that's a nice one to be able to do just
to add multiple borders if ever you need
it and another cool thing you can do
with this it's exactly the same idea I'm
going to put them back on the outside
but what we can do is if I go with
negative spreads on this so say I did
negative 20 negative 40 and negative 60
so they're all hiding underneath but now
I come on to this one here which is the
or not that one sorry I come on to these
which are my
sets I could do something like forty
pixels sixty pixels actually that should
be say 80 and 120 pixels and we can sort
of get this cool type of effect going on
and you could add a whole bunch more
here and just have them sticking out the
sides the top or doing different things
like that
so that is another option to get this
sort of interesting stepped effect so
what it's pretty much doing is it's
negative twenty pixels so it's going
here by 20 but it also means it's coming
in and in by 20 pixels and then I'm
moving it down 40 so it sticks out by 20
because it's 40 minus 20 and then here
the same idea it's moving 40 in 40 up so
that I'm pulling it all the way down so
it's actually sticking out 40 so I only
see 20 and then I do the same thing with
the green one there so you're pretty
much doubling the values each time but
that could be a fun little effect same
type of idea again if this one was
really big it would cover the content
after so just be aware of that and be
careful with that moving on to the modal
background fill this is the really easy
and simple one to be able to do this is
really really really basic I am using a
little bit of JavaScript to do this if
you're curious and you want to see that
JavaScript or to see how I've done any
of this I forgot to mention it earlier
but this is all done with code pen so
the link to this is in the description
below you can go check it out it will be
the finished version of whatever I
finish working on right here that you
can take a look at and play around with
a little bit because I'm not going to
get into the functionality of all that I
just want to be looking at the box
shadows for now so here on my modal
that's popping opened that modal is just
created right here I just have a div
class of modal and I looked down I was
hiding all the styles for that but what
I could do is on my modal have a box
shadow now if I just did say I don't
know 0 0 20 pixels 0 type of thing
already my modal is like standing out
over everything else
if you remember back from the last video
where I looked at how to make them look
good you wouldn't want necessarily one
that's this dark but at least it gives
you the
since that it's sitting on top of the
content but a lot of sites like to
darken out with the content they're
adding an extra markup just to darken it
sort of sucks in my opinion I like just
having my moto like that so one thing
you can do is I'm actually gonna put my
blur to zero now if you remember when I
was doing my these shadows I mentioned
that there the page and other content
ignores the shadow it pretends it's not
there it's just a visual element but
it's not actually like content on the
page so you can sort of take advantage
of that by coming on the spread and just
making it ridiculously big so now it's
covering everything my my spread is
actually way bigger than what I'm seeing
100 vertical width means starting here
it's going a full-screen length in every
direction so it's insanely big you could
get away with a much smaller number but
by making it that big I'm not getting
any scrolling because of it because it's
being ignored by everything else it's
not actually so it's not a Content
element so it's not causing any issues
and if I wanted to tone that down I just
have to come with an RGBA don't know
what TG ba is of zero zero is zero and
then I don't know point five and then we
have a transparent black background on
my modal when it's open so it sort of
will make sure the the focus is on
what's in here and then it goes away you
can make that fade off and do all those
other things as well yeah that's a nice
one that I I think is really useful and
it's nice that it means you don't have
to add in some decorative markup and
things that you wouldn't actually be
using so I think that is a nice handy
one now onto the peeled corners for the
peeled corners I'm going to delete this
and for the code the final version of
code pen that I end up sharing the link
below I'll make sure to turn them back
on and I'll probably pretty them up a
little bit at the same time but let's
just get rid of that because it's gonna
hide what I'm doing and let's look at
how I can do these peeled corners now
for this we do need to bring in pseudo
elements this is less of a box shadow
hack itself and it's more of just a cool
way that we can use box shadows and
without extra markup once again so I'm
going to be starting out by
putting these pseudo elements on top of
my box so we can actually see what's
going on and when I'm done I'll move
them over to the back we're gonna need
both a before and a box after for this
one just to be able to do everything we
need so if you know about suit elements
you know you always need the content
property a position app so loot will
help and I'm already had my
position:relative here because I want to
make sure that this position:absolute is
in relation to the position of my box
and not my body if you're not
comfortable with positioning I do have
some videos on that and I do also have
videos that cover the pseudo elements in
quite a bit of detail as well links to
those will be down in the description
below if you're curious um so top I
can't see them right now actually it's
just leave it like that and now let's
come on to style these separately so box
before I'm gonna do a couple of things
here I'm gonna give it a background of
light blue so we can see it and let's
come up here I want both of them to
share the same top so if I do let's just
do a top:0 bottom:0 to start with just
so we can see what we're working with
left:0 right:0 so it's covering up my
whole my whole thing which I don't want
I only need something that's gonna be
down close to the bottom so I'm going to
switch my top over to ninety percent so
it means it's gonna push down ninety
percent of the way from the top so the
top of this is ninety percent of its
total height away from the top which is
a perfect so it's just a little bar here
and that's sort of what I'm after
actually the other thing I think I'm
gonna do on this is I'm gonna move it a
little bit off of the sides and a little
bit off of the bottom so let's I'm gonna
start with point I don't know I start
with about five pixels but I might have
to play around with this number a little
bit on the left I'm gonna go with that
same five pixel number and on the right
I'm gonna go with it quite a bit bigger
let's just do like forty pixels forty
five pixels basically I don't want it
too close to this
because I want this to only be doing the
shadow here and then my after it's copy
and paste that to make my after
pseudo-element on this will make it pink
so it's a different color and I'm just
gonna switch these around so this one
become 45 and this one become five and
now let's add a shadow to those so I'll
come back the shadow will be the same on
both of them so we're gonna go back to
here where I have my selector for both
my before and my after and let's add in
a box shadow let's go with zero zero I
don't know 15 pixels we don't need a
spread so we'll just put the color and
we'll make it a black I'm gonna start
with point five and we'll sort of tweak
it from there so you can see both of
these have a shadow on them now but
obviously it's not doing what we want it
to do at all so we're the real magic
this comes in is you can do a transform
rotate now the rotation in this case is
gonna be pretty small I'm gonna start
with four degrees and we'll tweak it
from there and I actually want that one
to be a negative four
because I want this side to be closer
and my spacing on everything is off
actually let's go with three fours too
much and I'll have to move them up a
little bit too so this one will get the
same thing but the transform will be
three degrees so you can see that
they're how they're working like that so
what this is going to do is create the
peeled effect on this side this other
one is going to create the peeled effect
on that side now the problem is you
really need to make sure these are
hiding a hundred percent completely
behind the white thing so my bottom here
is gonna have to be a much bigger number
um there we go so now that they're
hiding completely behind that it's
already going to be working now it looks
weird because we have the big X that is
on top of that like that so what I'm
also gonna do on here is just give them
a z-index of negative one to push them
into the back so now I can't see them
the only thing I see is their shadows so
that's exactly what I want I only want
to see their shadows but I can't see
enough of their shadows I can barely
barely see theirs
it's giving me sort of the effect that I
want but I want to make that a little
bit more emphasized so to do that um you
could try playing around with a lot of
things but the easiest thing to do we
have horizontal offset and vertical
offset I'm just gonna add a little bit
to my vertical offset here to pull it
down and right away look at that it
already looks pretty good I think it's a
little bit dark so you can play around
the numbers a little bit to lighten it
up and you start getting them so playing
with the vertical offset your blur you
can make your blur a bit bigger you can
make your blur a little bit smaller and
play around the numbers a little bit
this is one where you're probably using
magic numbers of it which is numbers
that work only in these specific use
cases and it's sort of perfect for your
design but maybe are you're just
especially on the positioning of
everything to get them where you want
you could also come in on the box itself
and add a really subtle shadow back
shadow was zero five pixels so I want to
move it down a little bit you can see it
there the black is the right color so
let's just give it a blur of I need it
to be a lighter black anyway but box
shadow I'm gonna give it a blur of a
pretty big blur actually and rgba 0 0
zero point I'm gonna start with point
five so we can see what's going on and
I'm gonna give it a negative 15 or so
spread because I don't want it to be on
those ones a sorry yeah I should it's
make it bigger and then I use my
vertical offset just to pull it down so
we can start seeing it just showing up a
little little bit here but I'd want it
to be a really subtle subtle subtle
shadow you need that no I'm just saying
if you do want a little bit more on that
you'd want to come in with that we're
using a negative spread so you're not
getting the shadow all around like that
a pretty big blur and then an offset
just to get it sticking out just a
little bit along the bottom just be
aware it will make these slightly darker
when you do that as well maybe I could
even make that a little later
but there you go a nice cool little
effect we can get like that for some
peeled corners one thing that's really
important with this actually that I
forgot to mention when you're doing your
vertical offset here make sure you don't
make it too big because when you start
making that number too big you might
start getting something looking really
weird and strange so just it is a little
bit finicky you got to sort of just find
the right number and play around with it
a little bit then bigger it is the more
peeled off the look but once you go too
far it just starts looking really
strange that's it for this one but
before you go if you enjoyed this video
and you liked playing around at the box
shadows and you'd like to seeing what I
was doing with them here I strongly
suggest checking out my video and using
position:absolute in the wild if you
haven't already seen it of course in
that one I take a look at how we can use
box shadows to create a nice little
sliced type of look where it looks like
the you know one box is going into
another box type of thing it's
interesting if you haven't seen it and
you liked this video I think it would be
your cup of tea so you can check that
one out too
and that wraps up my series on the box
shadow property I hope you like this
series if you have any other hacks or
just unconventional ways of using box
shadows please leave a comment down
below and let us know about it of course
if you're reading this and you want to
see if anybody else has any suggestions
go and check out those comments down
below and I just want to give a big
shout-out to my patrons for helping
support this channel and making videos
like this possible and of course until
next time don't forget to make your
economy internet just a little bit more
