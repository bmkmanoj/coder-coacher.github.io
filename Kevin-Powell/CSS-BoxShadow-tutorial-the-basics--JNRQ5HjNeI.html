channel we learn how to make the web and
I make it look good while we're at it
and this week we're gonna be celebrating
me getting a green screen by learning
how to make some box shadows the Box
shadow is a super cool property that can
do a lot of nice subtle effects that can
just really make your designs stand out
and be a little bit nicer or you can
also use some sort of hockey stuff with
them as well to do stuff you wouldn't
otherwise be able to do instead of
covering all of this in one big long
video though I'm gonna break it up into
three different videos in the first
video we're gonna be looking at how the
box shadow property actually works
the you know the values that we can give
it and different stuff we can do with it
to make sure you really understand
what's going on in video number two
we're gonna be taking a look at how to
actually make box shadows look good to
avoid things like we see behind me right
now and to look at examples and ways to
make box shadows just not ugly because
box shadows well they're cool or maybe
one of the easiest ways to make your
design just look like crap if you don't
use them properly in the third video
we're looking at three hacks that we can
use with the box shadow property and
they're just different ways that are
gonna make stuff look awesome
and avoid extra markup and stuff like
that but that's a little while away
we're starting off today just on
learning the basics so let's jump right
into that box shadow isn't a complicated
property but there are lots of parts to
it so I'm gonna dive into all the values
we can place here discussing how they
were and some important details on each
one and then we'll look at how we can
apply multiple shadows and box shadow is
a bit of a weird property because it
accepts between two and six values we're
gonna start with two and we'll work our
way up from there so here I have a box
then is here I have some other styles
going on to set this up but they don't
matter too much for that this video but
this is uncle pen so you can always go
and check out the link to that it's in
the description below if you want to see
the finished version of this and all my
other code that is hiding up the top um
so we're gonna add a box shadow so the
property is like that just a hyphenated
box shadow and as I mentioned we have to
give it at least two values so the first
two have to mean numbers I'm going to do
20 pixels and 20 pixels
and look at that I already have a really
nice and sort of cool stylized to shadow
it actually looks pretty good right now
now these values can be m's they can be
REMS they can be pretty much any number
value you want the only thing you can't
do is percentages its percentages they
won't work just so you know so let's
just go back to the 20 pixels and 20
pixels because I thought that looked
pretty nice um now what these are is
this first number is the horizontal
offset and the second number is the
vertical offset so I'm just going to
switch this one over to zero I'm going
to see it's only moving down now so it's
moved down 20 pixels but the left and
right is at zero and I make this 100
pixels that's gonna shoot off more to
the right and then 50 pixels and it's 50
pixels to the right and we can do the
same thing with this 200 and it will
move down 200 pixels from where it
originally was and if you want to move
things up or to the left you just have
to make these negative values and then
you can have them up and to the left so
yeah that's how that works let's shift
this back to 20 and 20 and that's the
first so again this is the horizontal
offset and the second one here is the
vertical offset the third property here
is another number something used 20 once
again now that's looking a lot more like
a shadow as you can probably guess this
value is the blur this is the blur
radius or the size of the blur when it's
set to 20 pixels like this what it means
is it will go from solid color so right
you're wherever it was a solid color and
saying take 20 pixels from being solid
black to where the blur ends and it's
gonna be a gradual decline in opacity as
you go along now you can make the blur
as big as you want and it's gonna make
it softer and softer and softer at one
point it would get too big and it's you
know you're not really getting the
effect you're probably after um the one
thing unlike the vertical and horizontal
offsets we cannot make the blur a
negative value it just won't work it
does not accept negative values here you
can have a zero that's the default
that's what we had before
and any positive number will work and
just like before if I want to do this in
ms or REMS I can easily do that as well
now the fourth property I can add in
here let's just put that back to 20 I'm
going to do another 20 here and so I'm
on my fourth property now this is an
often misunderstood one and what it is
is it's the spread what it pretty much
means is take 20 pixels and then start
the blur so how far are we going before
we start to create a blur to help
understand what's actually going on here
I'm gonna take this off and let's do a 0
so 0 0 so I have no horizontal and no
vertical offset I'm gonna put a glare of
20 pixels so you can see that I have my
blur coming on there and I'm gonna add a
spread of 20 pixels it's pretty much
making my blur start further out so it's
pushing everything away a little bit and
then it's starting the blur so it's
pushing it 20 pixels in all directions I
can make that 200 I think we'll get much
bigger so it's gonna go to 200 pixels
and then I get my 20 pixels of blur now
one thing unlike this property which
cannot take a negative this one can take
a negative and you can see now my blur
is there but it's really really subtle
because it's been pulled underneath my
box a little bit more and the negative
value on the spread here can be very
important and very useful for some once
you start getting into some more
advanced stuff sometimes you will be
using negative spreads from time to time
finally we can add a color but there are
a few things to know about color before
we play with it first off if you haven't
put a color you'll notice right now mine
is black it's possible yours isn't
because the default is not black it's
actually matching the color property I
bet you didn't know that if I come on
here and I do color red my shadow will
actually change to red so it's always
inheriting that except well not exactly
as useful as this could be don't rely on
it for some reason Safari defaults the
color of a shadow to transparent so here
is really quickly becoming the new ie
everyone so why they're different I
don't know but just know that if you
you want a red shadow what you might
want to use is the nice little current
color property on here which does what
that's sort of what the default is in
here but it's going to make sure that
its default in all browsers so just to
show you if I change this over to blue
now it will change the blue current
color grabs that you can use this
anywhere it's not only for box shadows
you can use that you know I could use it
for my board or - just to show you what
it's doing order five pixels solid
current color and actually we should
take off this we can see what's
happening and now my border is on there
and it's the current color and if I
change this to green so it change it
uses the color of what I'm doing here
but we're not here to look at current
color we're here to learn about box
shadows so instead of current color I
can just write in the color and one here
so I get red and now I get a nice or not
very nice red shadow and of course what
you can also do on this is use our GBA
values or hsla and so I can come on to a
zero zero zero point five and that will
just give me a bit more of a subtle drop
shadow because it has some transparency
in there and if we bring this off no
more spread it's a little bit nicer now
the very last thing that we can use
another value that we can do in this one
actually has to go all the way at the
beginning here
it's called inset and I'll do that and
you'll see what it is right away it
moves the shadow to the inside of the
box instead of the outside of the box
one thing that's important to know about
an inset shadow it will always be on top
of the background color but under the
content so the inset shadow always goes
on behind any text or images you might
have but it will always cover your
background because if not you wouldn't
really see it and that can be a nicely
used you can see here it makes it look
like this is sort of cut there's a hole
in it and it's this is showing behind my
original background so the inset you
don't see it used very often it can be
used in really nice fun and creative
ways to get some nice effects now one
thing that's important is that as we
so at the start the only required
properties are the vertical and
horizontal offset after that you can
skip the blur and spread and just put a
color so I could write this let's just
erase what we have here and make a new
box shadow so I can do a box shadow of
20 pixels 20 pixels red and it's going
to work but what I can't do is I can't
skip the blur and put in a spread
because they're all number values I can
skip the inset because the inset just
doesn't default to anything but if I add
the inset to the beginning I'm just
skipping it if not but yeah we can skip
the blur and the the offset if I want so
I can do vertical horizontal blur skip
the offset which will stick to zero as a
default and then put my color now one
thing that's fun to do is to apply
multiple box shadows so let's change
this over to black for the moment and
one thing you can't do though is I
cannot come here and do a box shadow and
you say 30 pixels 30 pixels red because
the red one is going to win the way the
Cascade works this property is going to
get taken off and this one is going to
get used instead so instead of trying to
do it this way I'm going to delete that
we're gonna I'm just going to expand
this out for the time being and we just
have to come and separate them so now I
can do 30 pixels 30 pixels 30 pixels red
and now as you can see I have a black
and a red shadow and you can add as many
in here as you want and to make it a
little bit easier for yourself in
general you can put each one on a new
line so after the comma you can just do
it like that even better comma and add
in more so let's play around with this a
little bit and come up with something a
bit more interesting say we do 100
pixels and 100 pixels 100 pixels red
then we can go 100 pixels negative 100
pixels and I'm going to illustrate
something important here with this
example as well we'll do negative 100
negative 100 100 green and negative 100
100 100 per Pole so what I wanted to
illustrate with this is a we can have
multiple box shadows the second one is
how they order and overlap each other
the first one here um the first one that
I put is the one that's on top of all
the other ones so I have my big red one
and then my blue one then I have my
green ones my green one is actually
being hidden a little bit by this blue
one and then I have my purple last one
over here that's getting hidden under
everything else so it's just important
to know and maybe if I make my blurs a
bit bigger on this it will illustrate it
even more but just the red one is always
gonna be on top of everything else then
the blue one and then the green one and
then the purple one all the way down
over there at the end and there you have
the box shadow property so I hope that
helps further your understanding of what
the Box shadow property is how it works
and the different values you can give it
and sort of the way you might want to go
about using it a little bit if you like
