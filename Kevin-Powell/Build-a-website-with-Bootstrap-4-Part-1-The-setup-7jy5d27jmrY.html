up bootstrap force you can use it in
your next project so stick around my
name is Kevin and here at my channel we
learn how to make the web and how to
make it look at what we're at it this
has to be one of the most requested no
not one of the it is the most requested
subject I've had which is making a
website with bootstrap and we are going
to be using the bootstrap for alpha so
there are a few things with this that
will probably be changing in the near
future but the overall workflow I think
should be staying pretty much the same
which that's a really awesome tool and
it's important that we use it properly
in the setup is the thing that we need
to get right to be able to use it
properly in abusing sass in this video
and in this series and only importing
the things that we need to really be
using in our project and just how to you
know there's a whole bunch of different
ways we can actually get bootstrap on to
our thing it's not just necessarily the
download button so we'll be exploring
how to use NPM and a bit of our to get
that set up in this video so to get
started with our bootstrap project what
we need to do is actually download
bootstrap and there's like a million
ways to do this so I'm going to show you
a couple of different ones and give you
my opinion on them and they're just my
opinions when you go to download and I
am on the version 4 so just if I go to
their normal site get bootstrap comm
they are an alpha still the beta is
coming but you can see there's this link
at the top oh yeah bootstrap 4 is coming
so if you go it says v4 slash alpha get
bootstrap comm and the beta is I think
somewhat close to release so this might
be a little bit different when you get
there there's a bunch of fixes coming to
the beta so if I click here on download
bootstrap it gives us all of the
different options we can use to download
it so the first one is the one you
should not do don't download this one
it's a giant file for nothing there's no
real reason to get their CSS and
JavaScript if you're just going to be
using this and you want to overwrite it
with your own CSS you might as well link
to the CDN at least that way of other
people you know if someone's gone to
your site and they've been to another
person's site and they both use a CDN it
could be catched in their system and it
will speed things up a little bit so I
don't really see the point in doing that
unless you only want to use something
like the grid because if you download
this you can get access
their grid only and if all you're going
to be using is the grid then that's fine
obviously you can also just down click
here and download all the source files
so there's nothing wrong with doing that
that's going to give you their their
sass and everything is it mentions it
needs a SAS compiler you'll also need an
autoprefixer and some set up and stuff
they're set up in the system they use
uses grunt so it's all set up to use
grunt you just have to make sure nodes
installed you get install grunt and then
when you in do an install it's going to
run and do a whole bunch of stuff
automatically the only thing with this
is if you don't have Jekyll set up on
your computer you will run into some
issues with it so you need Jekyll and a
set up Jekyll and a PC is a pain in the
butt
I've done it on mine but it's you know
it's not impossible it just takes a
little bit of extra time and grunt when
it's compiling your CSS is pretty slow
it felt like forever every time I was
using grunt to compile it so I don't use
this I'm going to be using pre pros like
I have into all my other videos while
I'm doing this but that you know if you
want to go that route and use their
setup there's nothing wrong with that
that's their setup you know you're going
to be getting if they're doing it that
way there's some good stuff to it or you
can use a whole bunch of different
package managers there's NPM ruby gems
composer Bower and nougat all of these
are using the command line and I want to
show you guys how to use the command
line I'm not the most comfortable person
in the command line but I do see the
value in it and there's a few things
that I do know how to get my way around
so I thought it'd be fun to look at them
the first thing that's really important
for these is to go and download node J s
so you just go to node J Oz or just do a
search in Google for node J s and click
on this one and download it now when you
do that it's just a nice simple
installer so it's just going to give you
a little installer like that that you
can you click on it where do you want to
install it click Next it's a nice little
walk through and what that does is it
instance Toad's it installs and nodejs
as well as npm which is the node package
manager and that's going to be required
for Bower which we're going to use the
other thing that's required for Bower is
get so
where is it it's somewhere in here there
we go Bauer requires node NPM so we're
covering both those bases when you
download this and it requires get to
make sure git is installed on your
computer just go to desktop github comm
and download their desktop application
download for Windows I'm on the windows
you can download it on your Mac that's
going to install everything you need on
your computer as well same thing just
tell it where you want to install it
click Next and you're fine and with that
done you can go and install Bower and
that's super easy to do and you might be
going why can I do it why am i doing all
these steps when I can just come here
and click download source it's a good
question
the advantage with this is if you can
get comfortable with using the command
line is every time you want to start a
new bootstrap project you won't have to
go to the Strep website and then go to
there and then click download source and
then find your file in the download
folder and unzip it and then drag it
over to the other folder it does take a
little bit of setup the first time but
once you get used to it you'll be able
to work a little bit faster and it's an
entry into the world with the command
line if you're not used to it where a
lot of the things I'm using pre-pro
sport you can do Auto prefixing
automatically you can them they have
some flex box fixes that they're running
through in their package as well if
you're using other cool things you can
do that you can have the auto refresh
there's a whole ton of really cool stuff
that you can have to set up and through
that so to do that I'm going to move my
screen a little bit here I don't usually
show my search bar but down here in my
search bar I'm going to look for git
shell this is really similar to the
command prompt so you might be used to
the command prompt and if you're on a
Mac just open up terminal it's you'll be
fine you might also have heard of
PowerShell power so maybe maybe not
the git shell pretty much is PowerShell
but we'd get running in it from what I
understand so I'm going to open up the
git shell and move this back to where I
want to record and as you can see it
looks just like any old it just looks
like a command prompt or whatever you
you know don't know if you're used to
seeing this stuff if I used to use a DOS
computer so I'm kind of used to it
so I'm currently in my github Documents
folder and that doesn't really matter
right off the bat let's go check out
Bower and it says to install it you just
have to type this now anytime you're
looking at anything for these things
whether you're on a Mac or PC just
ignore the dollar sign here the dollar
sign is just letting you know it's
talking about a command prompt you're
only worried about this stuff here so
let's jump in and I'll explain a little
bit we're doing so we're doing NPN I'm
p.m. which is node package manager and
we got that when we installed node.js so
we're telling node package manager that
we want to install Bower and then we're
doing it /g and what this is whoops
global that's the same as writing slash
global we want to install it on our
entire system we're not taking one
folder I don't want to install Bower in
this folder I want to install it
globally on my system and it's easier if
you just type slash G so it saves some
strokes and so I want to do a global
install of Bower and I'll hit return and
I wait while it does this and it doesn't
take very long to do so we're at ever
reason mine humming for a little while
so if it takes a while just let it go
the first time I did installed it it
went really well for this video I
uninstalled it and then reinstalled it
when for for demo purposes and I just
hung there for quite a while I was about
to cancel out but then it just clicked
through so if it's taking a bit of time
give it that time now the next thing I
want to do is I want to get into the
folder that I want to be working in so
if you don't know anything about this if
you do CD you can change directory so I
can change directory and go where I need
to be getting to but sometimes it's a
pain in the butt when you're not you
know if you're doing small changes sure
but when you want to get into something
bigger it can be a little bit harder but
there's actually two ways you can go
about it I can do a CD and I can go and
find my folder so my folder is on my
desktop right here just move it down so
we can see it I can open up that folder
and I can right-click and choose copy
address and so I can do CD you do all
that and then paste that in there and
it's going to work fine but that's kind
of long you know what that took me a
while to do so another thing that I can
do and I think this is really cool and
you can do this on Macs as well I
believe
is do your CD and then just drag the
folder right there I don't even think
you have to drag it there just drag it
into here it's going to put that put
enter and you can see now I'm on my
desktop and I'm in the band and now that
I'm there I can go ahead and install
bootstrap so if I click over to here we
can go and look and it's really easy to
do the only reason I had to come here is
if you're using version 3 or once
version 4 is live you'll just be able to
do a bower install and put in bootstrap
if I did that now would stall version 3
but because I want to be using version 4
I do need to put in the version that I
want to be using in all of that until
version 4 goes live I'm going to hit
enter and this is going to take a while
it's not too long but it's going and
it's finding all of the different things
that it needs and there you go it's done
it so it didn't even take very long so
you can see once you set this up so that
you know it takes a while to have all of
this set up but once it is set up all
you need to do is open up your
powershell or your git shell or whatever
you going to be using type the letter CD
drag your folder in there so you know
you're in the right place and then you
just have to do a bower install boot
strap hit return and bootstraps
installed so it doesn't involve you
having it going click through and do a
whole bunch of weird stuff to try and
get where you're going
downloading files on zipping stuff it's
super easy and fast and all of that so
it's definitely worth getting used to
using the command line I'd really think
it's worth and just to show you what
that gave us is I already had these
images I already got all my images ready
but here in the bower components if I
jump into there you can see there's the
bootstrap so all of my bootstrap stuff
is in here there are some things in here
I'm not going to be using just because
it's using its setup for the grunt
system and all of that it is giving me
into the grunt file right there but it
is giving me the files I need in there
it's also giving me jQuery and tether
which is something that's required for
bootstrap now it's one of the things
they've added to bootstrap for for a
couple of their JavaScript functionality
things so
gives us everything we need to be able
to use it pretty much now to get that to
work as I mentioned I do use pre pros
this is really similar if you're using a
program like code kit and if you're on
Mac you're probably using code kit pre
proces both Mac and PC it's not very
expensive there's also whoops yes allow
access please there's also other
programs out there that are free pre pro
s-- does cost money so does code kit
they're not too expensive
I think Kewalo maybe is the one that's
free I don't have any experience with it
though so I don't know about setting it
up exactly so what I'm going to do is I
want to add that project into pre pros
here so I can just click and drag that
or I could have just pushed this plus
button and found it you'll notice that
the bower components isn't being watched
by pre pros so if I go to my settings
here and I go to file watcher that's one
of the thing if I brought it in with
node I would have the same thing so you
can see here all the things that are
being they're not being watched for
updates and all of that and that means
if I was going to actually work inside
of this pre proce wouldn't compile any
of the code that I'm working on because
it's ignoring this folder so obviously I
don't want it to be doing that and I
think I just closed group rows backs in
there and I want to keep that open
because I'm going to be using it what I
want to actually do here is I want to
copy some of the things that are in this
folder into my own area where I will be
working on them but I don't want to take
everything because most of this has
already been done the only things I want
are this custom s CSS file and one more
file which is all the way down here
which is my bootstrap s CSS so I'm going
to take them and then we'll go and look
at what those actually are so I'm just
going to select both command C go all
the way down all the way back to my root
make a new file I'm going to call it s
CSS now you see some people in here will
just put the bootstrap stuff or they'll
make one other thing I treat this like a
normal project so what I'm
do with this as I'm going to do a vendor
and my bootstrap will be inside of there
I guess I could just call it bootstrap
as well then its vendor and let's go
take a look at what these actually are
so I have to open those up and add them
so let's just right click on here and
you open the whole project with Adam so
we can take a look at what's going on in
there you know Adam sometimes you can
make a while to open up do to do oh I
didn't open it so let's go take a look
vendor custom and bootstrap so the
bootstrap is their big import file it's
importing all of the things that are
going on into one file that will get
compiled into a CSS file and if I go and
look at the custom this is where they're
setting it up to override any variables
that you want to override if you want to
override your colors or you want to
override anything at all the we're going
to be taking a look at their variables
in the next video it's an insane file
it's really cool and really powerful so
instead of working off of their file we
want to work off of our own file so
that's what I'm going to be setting up
to do in this video so you can see here
variables because there's the custom
being imported right there the thing is
I didn't take everything I would of the
original one right most you know all
these things that is trying to import
other than custom are all the way over
here so what I want to do is I actually
want to come down here and place my
cursor on all of these so I'm just
pushing control on my keyboard right now
if you're on a Mac you can push command
on your keyboard and just hold it down
and just keep clicking away to select
them all and we're almost there almost
there there's a lot of them but this
saves us so much time because we can
just type something once so what I'm
going to do I don't really need to
scroll back up but I'm currently in this
file so I need to go so I'm in my vendor
I need to go into my s CSS so back one
step then I need to go back one two
because I want to go back into the root
then I want to go into my Bower whoops
underscore components and then I want to
go into boot strap and then I want to go
into SC SS and before you click on
anything go all the way to the very
front here and comment it out so this is
what's going to make bootstrap work for
me in my project I don't need to bring
all of that stuff in now a lot of the
stuff I will be my variables I
definitely want to use my mix-ins I'll
definitely use custom I'll definitely be
using accept custom I didn't need to
change custom staying right there
normalized I will definitely use print I
will definitely use just you know
they've added this reboot which is their
personalized version of the normalized
so they're taking normalized and sort of
putting some of their own opinions into
it and starting with the next version
that will be released or whenever the
beta comes out this will be the only one
you won't actually see a normalized file
anymore they're putting everything into
one file instead of having it two things
working off of each other type I want
images I want code I don't need the grid
I definitely need tables I'm not going
to use forms I'm not going to use
buttons I will and the cool thing with
this is if ever you decide to add some
stuff in later you can always come back
through here and add it so I don't need
any button groups maybe later on my
project would get bigger I'd need a
button group all I have to do is take
that out and all of a sudden I can use
my button group nav and a nav bar I will
be using cards I will this is replaced
wells and one other thing bad Jumbotron
alert progress media list group
responsive and bed-clothes and I don't
think I'm gonna use in either JavaScript
and utilities I will be using so what
this is doing is it's making a much
smaller CSS file when all of this
finally gets compiled it's going to take
all of this but I'm not taking
everything I'm only taking the things
that I want to be using so that's one of
the nice ways of using bootstrap
properly or
is only using the parts of it that you
actually need and not having this big
bloated CSS file for nothing
now before I save this just because of
the way pre prose works it's going to
compile it right away what I want to do
is make a new file save this and I'm
going to call this file main dot s CSS
so I just want to make sure I'm okay I
was in the right spot actually main dot
s CSS and I'm going to hit save
and bring king boot strap will be the
first thing I do so I'm going to do it
at import and we're going to import a
vendor slash boot strap and I'm going to
hit save hopefully that compiles
properly let's it save here I think I
ran into a problem I did because that is
exporting this which I don't want so I'm
going to delete that now let's go look
at pre pros to see what the problem is I
might have made a mistake it looks okay
let's try this one more time actually
that worked okay I needed to save my
bootstrap this file before I save that
one just because I had made all these
changes just to show you the error log
actually the first time I tried to do it
it was trying to just import variables
it couldn't find that so I got an error
I saved this so it wasn't looking for
just variables it was looking for it in
the right place it made an extra file
which sort of sucked I had to delete
that file but then now I could work
properly and everything should compile
properly and we're good to go
so that's how we set things up properly
in the next video we're going to be
looking at setting up all our variables
we're going to explore a little bit of
the variables file in the bootstrap that
they give us and how using the custom
file in the SPSS we can modify
everything
it just once we start doing the mark-up
with that done a lot of it is going to
fall into place because bootstrap does
so much for us so it's going to go
pretty quick after that I think so thank
you so much for watching hit that like
button if you enjoyed this video if you
have any comments any questions just
leave them on down below and until next
time trying to make your corner of the
internet just a little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
