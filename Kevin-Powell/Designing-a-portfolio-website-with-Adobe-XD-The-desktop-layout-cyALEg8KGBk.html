we're gonna be doing our the big
displays now right so this is what we've
done so far we have our mobile layout
all nice and done let's now go so I'm
just a on the keyboard and we want to do
it for a web what size should i do
should I just do 1920 so it's the
biggest possible screen and we fill in
the blanks yeah why not because that's
the most fun one to design and pretty
much this is gonna have to be a lot
taller see me some copying and pasting
and some different styles now one thing
with here I don't think my character
styles is sort of like come together
I can't even reorder them or anything it
would be nice if I could say like these
are the group of them together but I
can't do that
that's okay though um so I'm gonna have
let's just take this to begin with and
I'm gonna drag it over and it's still
gonna be nice and fullscreen right let's
grab YouTube while we're at it and let's
grab YouTube what we're at it just so
they're all there command one oh man and
with the really big screen size and with
how I set up my recording on this I
can't fit it all in that's kind of
annoying but that's okay let's zoom out
a little bit I just have to remember
that I'm zoomed out so this should just
be centered group center center but much
bigger come on
so we're just gonna like boost this
whole thing wait wait big this is gonna
get gigantic I'll probably use viewport
units maybe even for the size of this
like this is at 200 now that's huge
second me gigantic that's pretty big
you get there into this full screen like
why I'm in your face let's shrink you
down and maybe in this case this could
be smaller
stay there these will have to move up in
that space yeah we'll just go with that
I need my little whoops you will just
come all the way up here I probably
should have made a logo
do you go with this but it will welcome
to my portfolio now this one this is
where whoops let's just grab all of you
and this is one right don't think I
shift I don't want to grow exponentially
or something like that and they're not
gonna be squares cuz this cousin ate way
too much room right so like it's gonna
they're gonna sort of stretch it into
rectangles like that I think instead and
this is where my fonts will change this
font size I'm actually happy with how
that looks
so it probably stayed the same it's 49
this one 49 I would actually no that
one's no when I made it bigger I made
everything bigger but this font size
didn't get bigger that's still 14 hmm
okay well I'm not gonna do 49 but I'll
jump you up to 50 why not
so it looks pretty decent actually and
this I want to bring it up a bit do
something like 18 over whoops 18 over
what it's 18 too big 18 over 28 maybe
this skitty gonna be like something more
like that and then just bringing this
whole thing more centered in that space
just something like that again it's the
same principles before I just have like
these nice big images we can actually
see the images as we get on to the
bigger screen size which is cool
I want this text to be easy enough to
read the title stands out the hierarchy
is really clear and all of that then
this one now this is where I wish I had
guides so I need to use my grid how come
I don't see a grid oh it was just too
zoomed out I guess and I just have to
sort of decide you can definitely in
here make guides but I'm not doing yeah
I just making guides like that's your
drawing them out you have to lock them
and stuff it's not something that I'm
about to do that's painful for no reason
so this picture should have made a black
and white but anyway that picture will
definitely be there I think how could I
just
I just eyeball what I want to do
actually it's not gonna be an official
guide let's just make a box width of
this box will be do I just do 1170
because everyone is that let's do 1170
and let's Center you on the screen order
I can turn off or no let's just leave
the border on fill is off and the border
will be like I'm magenta so it sort of
is like a guide in the end and that's
just it's gonna be like my my total
viewport width so because I'm not
counting these boxes I was originally
gonna do something like that and it's
like nope not gonna happen
so here the layout is definitely in a
change so this I brought it up to 18
here this should be a character style
oppan not a symbol my character style
and then you can use the same one but
the color will be gray and then that
means your another character style okay
so here this will probably be more lined
up you know what I'm actually wondering
should I make this darker in this
lighter maybe let's turn off my grid
because it's really distracting me right
now let's just go up and select it this
way there we go okay so this picture
will be bigger so I can just I'm gonna
keep it proportion the same though
because I definitely want to be the same
picture that I'm bringing in then title
here will definitely be bigger I'm
getting into some nice big font sizes
here let's say you're up here ish and
like roughly the middle of the picture
then this will come down over here this
can be bigger make you like 5050 works
cuz that's the same font size as that so
that's gonna come out to like here and
this is where I love the grid because
the grid lets me design like I'm print
what if I did this and this was maybe
like that more I mean I know I made this
darker and I still don't find it dark
enough now that I'm looking at it this
could be a little bit
can i edit these oh I can good edit I
don't want it oh here we go
just be like 30 maybe 32 yeah that looks
a little nicer that means this one also
edit 32 just so it's hello 32 what's up
- there we go a little bit further
should that go like let's move you down
a little bit and something like that
this is really like reading circuiting
they're like cool print layouts that
look really nice this could even be
bigger that would fun let's just bump
you up to like 100 see me too big no no
just to get a little bit of the middle
ground you know like stuff like this
with overlaying this is stopping here
like this you could always do this
before but it was sort of a pain in the
butt now with some gridlines and stuff I
think it'll be easy peasy awesome so I
think that looks good I just don't know
if I should draw it like that's a long
lionfish oh that's not too bad it's
gonna say it's too long but I'm not sure
if it's too long I think that'll work I
think that looks pretty nice cool so
that's I'm just gonna delete this after
but we'll just use this as my big as a
guide moving forward and this is one
thing they can't believe that wasn't
like in the original Apple
implementation it was the bringing of
guides but c'est la vie it wasn't there
okay so I think this isn't gonna be
terribly complicated what I want to do
for this one oh how come my Merriweather
here looks the same wrong color huh
that's interesting it changed all the
colors but it didn't change the color in
there but that's fine this will get
another character style because I want
to use it a lot
I might even anyway it doesn't matter I
had that one at 49 I should have made
that one 50 it saves things this points
in here and not pixels that's weird
anyway it doesn't matter my work that
can just be centered on the screen so
that stays the same this will be a nice
big background
let's just make that bigger for now and
oh this is my grit I can just move that
this is actually it's we're gonna go
full screen on this and I'm gonna bring
you over next to it I think this will
look cool and just go no quite what I
was expecting to happen there but undo
let's just unlock this then ungroup grid
because now I think yeah yeah that's
what I wanted we can group this back
together just in case you know if ever
we need more for something that works
except let's move you down and move this
down because I think that'll look better
I don't even need my guides on there cuz
it's just going fullscreen do I really
need to redo the overlay on that one not
really cuz it's gonna look exactly the
same I might even be able to fit a
description in there I'm wondering if I
could fit a description in there I
probably can't fit a description in
there now let's not even try who knows
we'll see what's this on the screen I'm
really saying except to work with five
images if you had seven I don't know
what you do I guess you'd have more
featured pictures you just play around
with having more featured to make them
bigger would be the solution if you want
to make sure you haven't even an even
spacing of stuff cuz the way you know
well it's when I do this hopefully I
remember that I want this to be not have
to be 5 you could put more pictures in
but more pictures means it has to come
underneath like this is gonna be a
pretty set up grid to be 4 columns
4 columns to rows but say you could add
like a third row with a bunch of
pictures and they just fall into place
there's no issue and to do that we're
setting up this whole grid with just
Auto columns Auto rows that would make
the most sense to make this the most
manageable possible I want this dog just
automatically work
I think that would make the most sense
and we might as well just take
everything over now I don't think I'm
gonna bother this is gonna stay the same
I'm just gonna keep a Gigantor just
overlay not always the biggest fan of
that but it's starting to win me over I
used to think it was lazy developers who
just made
big like or takes over your whole
desktop computer and I'm like do I
really need that you're wasting screen
space blah blah blah it's just become
such a part of how people are used to
working it doesn't bother me as much
anymore so I'm gonna be a lazy developer
myself and we're gonna do that and keep
it the same and that will go like that
back and stretch all the way down and I
shouldn't have left this on top but not
that it's hard to deselect stuff you
know command L this to lock it okay
so the contact form I think we can make
more interesting I won't keep that
exactly the same what should I do with
my contact form I think well this will
have to be you these you will come to
this but your color will go back to this
the spacing we're gonna rearrange it a
little bit oops you can group that
together you know sort of like just them
honestly if I just like take all of you
and hit Center oh no I want it like
group and center like something like
that it's so simple and so nice this is
really my style but we're not gonna do
it it's tits I want to make an
interesting coding video so we're gonna
have to move stuff around and I might
even put like a grid to make my form
here we'll see about that but yeah let's
make this like I'm not gonna reinvent
the wheel we're just gonna ungroup this
grid these will come up to here again
it's gonna stay pretty nice and simple
but we can you know we could do
something like this we have a bigger
screen space that's not reinventing the
wheel at all but something like that
might work it's I'm really tempted to
make this with late without the labels
and putting stuff inside but you should
use labels really even if it doesn't
look as sexy just for accessibility
purposes and all of that fun stuff let's
group that and Center it
I think that looks fine
with you maybe I'm being lazy in not
coming up with a cooler design but I
really do think that looks okay it's a
lot of padding on the top though yeah
there we go and now we can grab my
footer and just plunk you there
oh that grids going crazy let's just
take the background for another take all
of you group center ungroup again a
group is command G or control G on group
is command shift G or control shift G so
these should both be no they should all
be centered on the screen hey well I
don't hate I like how it does that but I
wish I could tell it what I'm aligning
things to Center that's still there the
size of that won't change there we go
perfectly centered find me unsocial
let's do that's the size everything will
be I never made my social icons sorry
about that I really did want you and
there we go
that is done
this is immuno of my design videos this
is clear leading me the shortest one
we're not done yet though we still have
this one here to do so let's make a new
web 1920 it's gonna be a bit longer I'm
just gonna take everything here and
option drag it over and I think this one
will be fun to take a look at so this
one let's this is gonna be like a nice
big big big big big picture which would
be cool I don't know if we'll go full
fold maybe we'll do like 50% project
name we're gonna do it you but you're
gonna be white and let's just grab both
of those looks kind of cool like that
actually I think I'm gonna have this
like bleed off the side I'm using a lot
of print terms these days for this I've
gone back to teaching in the classroom
so like bleed just means you're going to
like right up to the edge of the page
right instead of something like that
that's not bleeding this is
leading goes back to some print stuff
I'm not gonna get into the
technicalities of it you I didn't make a
new style for that but I should have
bless whoops guess you were gonna be the
same style I'm really wondering if I
can't put like I want some this looks
nice and all but what if it was just
like project name Center text on one
line and then it could even be exactly
like that like or even here maybe we
could do this this but you're white and
then that goes here we could do
something like that right now does that
mean I should come back and change that
no it doesn't means I'll have some work
on positioning stuff I don't know really
how I'm gonna make the I might be making
my life hard on this maybe I'll be just
like that we'll see oh my goodness I'm
really changing it I don't know the
colors even changing and stuff so maybe
I should keep this actually I can't
really read that that well anyway so
maybe I should keep that that color and
keep this white and have this also be
white if I do this though I definitely I
definitely want to put a line between
them I don't know why but I would
definitely want to do that that would be
a white line at like 50% and I can't
really see it so maybe like 75 I just
wanted to be less a bit more subtle than
the text I just feel like that would
work better maybe what we could do is do
something whoops I wanted your center
center that was a mistake
let's just let's Center all of these
this way group them together select that
and then Center Center and then select
select this and Center Center the whole
thing
what if I even made the subtitle like
80% again just so it's and Stan said it
a little bit less maybe we could do that
that could be interesting does that look
like that's not terrible yeah you go the
picture would even this could be a bit
smaller say we did to that now I'm just
swearing because it's so different from
this so what if I took this my design
should have been planned out a little
better I think so I wouldn't be
redesigning everything so it's my bad on
that sorry guys but I planned out
everything except this page which is why
my other stuff went a little bit faster
so what did I say this was at like 80
and this also was at about 80% so we
could definitely just pull something off
like that and I think I had something
like this originally but then I didn't I
had different colors or something and I
didn't really like what I had so maybe
we'll do something like that
and of course means all of this can move
up a bit cool I sort of like that good
good good and then this just means this
is super simple that's even copy can I
copy and paste that in here no because
this is locked right unlock it
copy paste and then just grab all of you
and without this move you up I'm a bit
worried that the lines are gonna be too
long on this so my text is probably not
gonna stretch this whole width because I
think that's not gonna look good but
let's grab all of these and you get this
style on you how come this one didn't
know that's group still on group you get
that style too
and this is we'll treat that in a second
this is annoying so this can get a
command L to lock it
okay so the first paragraph that's fine
this would if I have a full bleed it's
not gonna stop there it's gonna go like
you have a nice another picture it's not
gonna be too much though like here I
think it's okay it's okay there it
should be okay here I guess it's because
they're both so narrow but I definitely
or maybe this
I won't actually have it full bleed
maybe this would go like to like
something like that and then this is in
a smaller area just so many lines aren't
too long something like that so I'm just
whoops I'm just limiting like this to a
smaller area because long lines are
terrible you don't want your line the
line length to be too long so say I do
that and then where I want to make it
more interesting is with these the
second picture these other pictures
could be like have a text wrap and I
don't think I can do text wraps but like
say it's this link is killing me group
you know I could have text that goes
around instead of I don't know like I
don't have this much text in my mobile
design but we could do something like
that and then we could even have this
that's gonna be down here and then of
course that would come into here and
then this could come underneath and my
text got really long like I don't think
if anyone's making a case study that's
long like this like holy-moly but just
just to show that we have all these
options and like all of this exists so
we can do it so if when you are doing it
if you want a picture pulled right you
can pull it right if you want a picture
pull the left you can pull it left and
this is where floats actually might
still be useful that floats they're not
completely dead but they're getting
there and then this would just whoops
ungroup that
bring that all the way down and just
bring my little arrow back something
like that I think would look fine
and again I don't know if Alden or if I
do it with that much text I need to do
it with that much text over here too
just a lot of text for mobile I don't
know if I'd want to well it's not that
bad for a case study I wonder if I
should use like a lead text but I'll
leave it like this for now I think we're
done oops
let's move 0 I want to see everything so
this is my mobile we already looked at
that so now we have my homepage design
as well and when we click what it looks
like I'm not gonna do this just because
it's gonna be so similar to that I think
it's gonna look pretty good I hope it
looks really good I hope you like the
design and the layout and all of that
leave some feedback down below to let me
know what you think and of course if you
like these types of videos if you like
seeing me do design stuff please let me
know and yeah that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
