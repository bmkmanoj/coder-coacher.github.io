simplest way to add animation to our
website and in this video we're gonna
see how to use it
welcome my name is Kevin and if you're
new here my channel is all about
learning how to make the web I'm gonna
make it look good while you're at it
animation on the web is a good way to
catch attention and if done properly
increase user experience the most basic
way to animate something is with a
transition the mdns is the best
transitions enable you to define the
transition between two states of an
element basically when the state of an
element changes through things like
hover focus or something else we can
change its CSS property transitions make
the change well transition from one
state to another
instead of instantly changing like this
square does now when I hover on top of
it now there's a handful of transition
properties so let's go and look what
they are and how they work so here in
this code pen I just have this box that
changes color on hover so I have box
here I have the hover here and well we
can see it changing color now this the
first property I'm going to start with
here is the transition duration property
so on here I can write transition -
duration and I can write in a number and
what's important to know here is this
can either take a millisecond or seconds
so I could write 500 m/s for
milliseconds or I could get the exact
same thing by taking 0.5 s for 0.5
seconds and it would give me the exact
same result the one thing to know with
this though is in general I'm gonna
suggest use milliseconds because while
CSS can accept seconds or milliseconds
JavaScript only accepts milliseconds so
at one point even if you're not using
JavaScript currently you're probably
gonna get into that eventually and it
just handy to be using milliseconds sort
of as a standard through everything that
you're doing so I'm just gonna switch
this over to 500 milliseconds and now I
can see that it actually transitions
over instead of instantly happening and
if I bring this up to 1000 which would
be one second the same thing but slower
and if I switch that over at 100 the
exact same thing but really fast also
just on this whole seconds or
milliseconds thing in general you want
your animations to happen
pretty fast if I do one second you can
see that's actually a pretty long
animation most of the time you're gonna
be at like the 250 to 500 range maybe
and 500 is even kind of long so one of
the another reason other than the little
JavaScript thing is just you're
generally dealing with small numbers
anyway so you might as well just go in
with the whole milliseconds now
obviously this can change if you're
doing complex animations where things
are moving around and some other more
advanced stuff but for simple animations
just short durations are always going to
be key be one of the things I see a lot
of the time is people doing animations
that are just too long or transitions I
should say that are just too long for
what they want to do they should happen
relatively fast at the next one we look
at is the transition property oops
property so this is what am i
transitioning so in this case it's
background background and if I do that
nothing will change because I'm still
just transitioning my background just to
show that this can actually change
things if I switch this over to width so
say I want to transition my width over
this duration now my background is no
longer transitioning my background is
instantly changing because the only
thing that I'm telling my CSS that I
want to transition is my width so let's
bring the background back on there just
so it's working but let's add a second
transition here transform rotate 45
degrees so now when I hover on top my
square is switching over and for this
we're gonna make my duration a little
bit longer 1000 milliseconds so you can
see that the color my background color
here is taking that whole 1 second to
change colors but the rotation is
happening instantly so on the transition
property here there are a couple of
things that are important to know one of
them is if I don't include it at all
it's going to transition everything so
you can see now that I didn't include
that it's doing both of them at the same
time
I can also do the same thing by writing
all so if I write all there we go now
it's loaded in and now it's
transitioning all of my properties so
this is sort of the easy nice fast way
to do it but I will encourage you not to
do this because transitions are CPU
intensive there are some that the GPU
can rely on and I'm going to talk about
that a little bit later your graphics
processor can do acceleration on a
couple of them but there's not very many
and I'm going to talk about those a
little bit later on but just to say that
most of the time it is the CPU that's
doing it and this can cause some really
janky animations there's it's really
easy to run into janky animations if
you're using all because it's gonna
start trying to animate everything and
that really slows things down especially
it might be working great on your super
high-end computer but think of a budget
cellphone we're all of a sudden you're
doing a whole bunch of stuff and it's
causing some issues so in this situation
and my background and my transform that
are both changing so what I can say is
the properties that I want to change
background and if I just write
background we know that it's only in a
change of that but I think comma
separate and write transform and there
we go it's loaded in so by doing this
it's only going to pay attention to
these two properties it's not looking at
the width the height and well just the
width and the height but it's it's
making it a little bit easier on the CPU
because it's not trying to look at
everything it's only looking at the
certain things that I'm targeting so if
you are going to do a transition that
does involve multiple properties I would
encourage you I know it's longer to
write but for performance reasons I
really will encourage you to comma
separate all the different properties
that you are transforming now this next
one is a really fun one and this is the
timing function so it's a bit of a weird
name so let's just type it in transition
timing function so it's a long func I
have to spell it right first function
it's a long one to write out and this is
a bit of a weird one especially if
you're not familiar with some of the
things I do believe the default is ease
I think if I do that it's just going to
be what we were already on now for this
I'm
a separate pen and both of these code
pens will be in here but we can see here
I have a few different animations going
on now all of these animations are
taking the exact same amount of time to
do the difference between them is the
top one is called linear we have an ease
in and ease out and an ease in and out
so just look at the one at the top when
I hover over here and you're gonna see
it stays at a constant speed the whole
time so it just goes and then when it
gets the end it just stops the next one
down here ease in means it starts really
slow so you can see it's it's slower
than all the other ones especially here
you can see it's really slow and then it
speeds up throughout so it's easing into
the animation it's going from slow and
then fast and it catches up to
everything else right at the end and
ease out is the opposite ease out is
gonna go from being very fast to slowing
down at the end so it's the fastest one
and then it slows right down and it was
really fast and then it slows right down
and then an easy note is a combination
of both it's gonna start slow speed up
and then slow back down at the end so
and then all of them all end up at the
same place at the end it really depends
what you want to be doing with your
animation and which one you will
probably be using linear you just won't
be using linear is generally it's not a
natural type of animation that you might
use so to do any of them you know just
ease in ease out but there's actually a
few more than just these ones there are
some other options and if you want a
faster way to work than just sort of
like guessing it which one you really
want to do the dev tools are a fantastic
way to visualize what's going on and
offer us more options to use so what we
can do here is I'm gonna right click and
choose inspect element if you're in
Chrome that would just be an inspector
man Firefox right now and here on my
transition I get this little icon here
Chrome it's a simple it's a little box
instead of a circle but you'll get a
similar thing next to where it says ease
in I'm gonna click on that
and look at this I get this really cool
thing here where there's three different
types of options here I have an ease in
and ease out and an ease in out and in
chrome you get the same thing but
instead of it being it's not as visual
as this but you'll get one like this and
has a little arrow on the right and a
little arrow on the left and you can
just click and cycle through all of
these options so if I'm adding ease in
it's showing me all the different
options I have for ease in so on ease in
and this little line at the bottom is
visualizing it for me it's showing me an
animation going back and forth the
chrome one is a little bit better
I will admit but you can still see the
way that speeds up you know you can see
the animation going on there I go to
quadratic it's really fast the beginning
is really slow and then it was really
fast
then keeps going now this one you'll
notice the line actually goes down and
then up so it's gonna go backwards so
you see here it's jumping back and then
going forwards I don't want to get too
much into how these the curves are
working but it's pretty much if we go to
linear it's a straight line so at this
is one of the lines is the time passing
this one will be the time passing and
then I think one of them is time passing
and one is the movement of it so here it
is just a constant rate whereas if I
look at the backwards one it's actually
moving backwards a little bit as time
passes
so time is actually time would be going
this way and movement is going this way
so it's gonna go backwards a little bit
as time passes and then all of a sudden
shoot up to the end
now that's an ease in if I go to eat out
you'll see all the curves go the other
way so ease in the curves are this way
ease out the curves are the other way
because on these ones it's starting fast
and then going slow it's slowing down
here at the end and then the easing out
give you these s curves or it's going
fast slow sorry where it's going slow
fast slow so pretty much the more
horizontal the line is the slower it is
and the more vertical the line is the
faster it is so on any of these as I'm
clicking on them you'll see here it's
giving me something called a cubic
Bezier
and I can just take this cubic Bezier
copy it and I can actually just paste
that right into my code right here boom
and now it's gonna get that curve for
its animation now another thing that's
really cool with this is incrementing
Firefox are both the same you can take
these and click on the little handles
and bring in your own animation whatever
you want to do so I do this this is
gonna be this crazy thing where it's
like shooting off farther you can see
it's bouncing back and forth so I can
take this whole thing copy that paste it
right here and now it should rotate
backwards and then go forwards it's me
whoa it's a bit of a janky animation
just excited too much of it but you get
the idea where you can see it sort of
bouncing one way and then the other so
you can come in try and develop your own
animation and use you know use your own
timing function in here really nice and
handy to come up with something exactly
what you want for your animation or for
your timing function I should say and
this one probably a little gentler it's
still kind of janky
well not janky but that's not too bad
actually I sort of like that one so
we're gonna stick with that for now now
the last one we get to is the delay so
transition
delay and transition delay is how long
does it take for the transition to
actually happen so I'm going to put in
let's put in like two seconds which is
really long I'm gonna put it on top and
we wait two full seconds and then the
animation happens so how long until this
transition starts happening now in
general to the transition delay you're
not gonna use it like that so much just
because two seconds like that's kind of
ridiculous right like no one's gonna be
waiting around two seconds for something
like that to happen because that doesn't
make too much sense now one thing you
can do though is instead of writing out
this way there is the transition
property which is sort of like margin so
you know margin we have margin which is
the same as writing margin
right etc etc etc so the transition
property is the same the transition
property takes all of these and one
thing that's important is the order you
do put them in because well sort of so
let's just say here I'm gonna comment
all this out we'll do background and
we're gonna do 500 milliseconds and
we're gonna say ease in so it's going to
turn but you can see my background is
still animating that's just you know
we'll make it really long just so we can
see it's rotating but I have I made it
so long now actually 505 thousands way
too long we'll do 1000 there we go so we
can actually see the whole thing happen
and it still takes a really long time to
do right so this is why in general a
thousand like holy-moly a second is a
lot longer than you then you realize it
is so here we can see the animation is
happening though but it's only doing the
background so if I wanted to do this I
could comma separate oh and I said the
order is important here if I took this
and I put it at the beginning that will
make it shorter 250 milliseconds the the
thing it's important is where the delay
comes in because here say I do one
second you can see that there we go so
it's actually it is working it's just if
you do two numbers the second one is the
delay so even here if I write like one
second space to 50 you can see that it's
actually it's one second is now my
duration and there's a really short
delay of 250 milliseconds on it whereas
if I make this a lot longer
you can see that now we're waiting we're
waiting we're waiting we're waiting
waiting oh look it just transitioned
that took a lot longer than I expected
you but you get the idea
we're waiting we're waiting we're
waiting there we go and then when I come
off so it's doing this one as how long
the transmission takes and then this one
the second number is always going to be
the delay now if you want to do multiple
ones so I want a one-second background
ease-in and then I'll do kama 500ms
transform ease out and then I can put a
delay on this of say one second nope it
didn't work there there we go so there's
a delay on that so first it's doing the
there's no delay on this so there's no
delay on my background so my background
is not delayed and then once this is
done because this is taking a full
second to do so I'm transitioning my
background once my background is
finished transitioning because I'm
putting a delay of one second on this
then that's happening so it's
transitioning color then rotating and
then switching back and going back with
the other way now one word on a
performance so I said I was going to
talk about this if you can limit your
animations to transforms and opacity so
I'm currently transforming or I'm
currently transitioning my background
but in general you'd want to avoid that
now I transition backgrounds four button
hovers and stuff like that all the time
but four transforms and opacity the
browser uses our graphics card for these
animations so it helps them run smoothly
for others if there's no GPU
acceleration and quickly run into janky
animation especially if you're using the
transition all it's fun to animate
things like box shadows and borders and
a whole bunch of stuff all at the same
time but be aware that the browser's
repainting things when it's doing this
and it has a hit on performance so I
hope this has been a nice little
introduction to just how we can handle
our transitions and some other things
