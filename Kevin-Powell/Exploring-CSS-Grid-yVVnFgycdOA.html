alright guys I'm here just trying to
figure out for this lets us go to there
I forgot the shortcuts so yeah hi guys I
hope you're doing well thanks for tuning
in to the live stream I'm pretty excited
about this we're going to be taking a
look at the CSS grid also please let me
know if there's any audio problems or
video problems I have the chat open so
I'll be keeping an eye on that as I
record Oh No yeah you're gonna hear me
in a second okay so what yeah just let
me the the odd the video will probably
not be too hot with this because my
webcams not the best but once we go to
my screen just let me know if you can't
see the code or anything like that so
yeah we're looking at the CSS grid but
before I do that just thank you so much
for those who are here that's pretty
awesome I can't see how many are here
right now let's see I think there's like
Adu which is pretty Oh 12 I don't know
eight people right now which is really
good so thank you so much for showing up
and we're at over a thousand subscribers
I had originally wanted to do this as
like a thousand subscriber thank you
type of video we're at more than that so
I'm a little bit late life got in the
way a little bit but we're here so
thanks again to everybody awesome it
looks like everything is good cool thank
you for letting me know um so yeah we're
gonna be looking at the CSS grid so let
me just pull up what we're actually
gonna be looking at here we go
that's better um and let me just to make
sure that this is an example of one of
the things I want to build now I have
never used the CSS grid I did one code
pen like two months ago when it was
still experimental really basic was more
basic than this layout just to try it
I've been wanting to play with it a lot
I haven't had a lot of time but I also
wanted to save it for this video so I've
really been looking forward to this hi
guys I see there's a whole bunch of you
here now so cytravel a story as a cure
ray I see you're there Edie Sheldon
thank you all for showing up mark Bryan
really appreciate it that you guys are
here well it's live it's cool it's fun
having a live audience so I want to
start just doing a basic layout like
that and if that we get through that in
time I'm going to try and make this I'm
hoping to be able to do both
this design is something that I stumbled
across let's see if I can find it here
on dribble and I saw sis and I thought
it looked really nice so I just won and
I thought it would work well with the
grid with these offsets here we just
have to do annoying thing with margins
and stuff so I thought the grid would be
a nice thing to do so this is what we're
going to be looking at well not this one
this is the one I was inspired by and
this was by and Nathan Riley so really
getting the design inspiration from him
but as I said this is what we'll be
trying to create or oddly trying to
create hopefully but we're starting with
the basic layout because I need to
figure out what I'm doing I literally
have no idea how to use this I was
reading some documentation to get ready
and I have been doing quite a bit of
reading but I haven't practiced yet so
it might be a bit of a disaster but I
hope it goes well so we'll get rid of
that I'll move this over so I can see
the chat yeah do I know View Jas I've
played with this is Ray asking I have
but I haven't done very much of it I
wouldn't be comfortable right now anyway
making a video hi Angelique Nanuet New
York cool hi and yeah I can definitely
feel I'm a little bit nervous the whole
livestream thing it's different having a
live audience if I screw up now I can't
edit it out it's weird
get rid of that now so a few the things
I'm gonna be using I'm actually going to
be using Firefox developer edition and
there's a good reason for that
so let's actually open that up with the
developer edition so far they're the
only ones to implement this I do believe
others will be but when you do an
inspect element you can see here display
grid and there's this let's make this a
bit bigger there's this little icon here
and if I do that you can actually see
the grid show up on the screen so that's
really cool and I think will be really
really
nd I've heard that other browsers are
going to be implementing it normally I'm
using Chrome but I will be using this
here with my the Firefox developer
edition for this video on doing my
layout other things I'm using and all
these links are in the description below
I'm going to be using the CSS tricks a
complete guide to the grid I think this
will help me when I started learning
flexbox their complete guide was really
really helpful so I'll be looking at
that one thing I did want to mention
though is they do mention the sub grid
in here so I'm hoping it's not the only
thing that's out of date but I know that
the sub grid is something that is
planned for but doesn't exist yet so
here's just on the Mozilla site the sub
grid it's not implemented in any
browsers yet so can't use the sub grid I
just pulled this up to show browser
support is here it's not bad
obviously with older versions of Safari
and Android it's not there and of course
Internet Explorer and edge have some use
cases but the grid is here it's fully
implemented pretty much which is pretty
awesome
and I want to start building some
layouts with it from now on I plan on
having a more thorough video maybe in a
month ish from now once I have a better
idea of what I'm doing I'm also going to
be looking at this site probably it's
called grid by example.com they have
some nice examples and stuff so if ever
I get stuck I can always come in and
check out some of this stuff on here I
think it might be useful and with all
that done I can get started so I've
created a file here already because I
didn't want to spend too much time on
this where I'm importing some fonts and
everything everything here is set up to
be going with my Photoshop file sorry
I'm just getting distracted by the video
on the side well we're up to 14 people
thanks guys for showing up once again
really exciting to have people what in
life so this is what I'm going to do
first but the I've set it all up to use
these fonts and my colors and all of
that are set up already so we don't have
to putz around with that we're just
working on the grid
so yeah this is just some basic styles
and everything that I've done in here
for my typography I've just had this my
basic CSS file that will be my basic
stuff and then my layout where I'll
actually build my layout and then right
now I have nothing in my HTML file so I
can start working on that and I'm
actually going to bring Photoshop back
up whoops there we go
I just want to tuck this away so I can
sort of keep it referenced what I'm
trying to build yes this should be
mobile the grid is fully mobile it's
from what I understand it's something
that should be fully mobile it also
works really well flexbox
so hope I don't think I'll need flex at
all in this but it should be something
that works as I said I haven't used it
but I've been looking into it so I know
some of them the units we can use you
can use percentages and M's and all of
that for your width but they also have
the fr unit which is a new unit which
will be pretty cool I think um so let's
get started I'm gonna start just with a
container to hold this layout in
actually I made my grid here I tried to
break this into grids and then rows so
one two three rows and then twelve
column grid because the twelve column
grid is sort of the normal but I think
we're gonna have to change our mindset a
little bit on how the column grid
systems work with using it maybe I'm
wrong but here I like my two empty ones
don't make much sense I should just have
this as one big empty one on each side
then even then that can just be this
should just be like a container and then
my grids inside the container anyway
we'll see let's let's try this out and
see what happens actually know what I'm
going to do just so I can practice this
a little more is I'm going to have all
of this inside a container so this will
go I'll make a container that's like
this and then just something so we can
have like inside my grid something
that's bigger than the rest of the
content since this is just for practice
purposes
so we'll do a dot container so my div
class container and if you guys have any
suggestions or any things that you'd
like me to try while I'm doing this
please tell me in the chat I would be
very very glad to help out or just you
know answer questions and all of that
along the way so in my container already
I don't know exactly what I need to do I
need three rows one two
I'm just trying to think the best way to
do this and I'm actually going to go
back to the CSS tricks I'm going to just
look at this because here they have
their three columns now you can see
they're using percentages pixels and you
can also use auto and then I really knew
to me so I do have to think about this
more it's not natural I did used to
build websites using tables so I'm sort
of having to fall back to that mentality
but that was probably in the late 90s
when I was a hobby of mine
so I'm way you know this is just
something right now that I'm trying to
wrap my mind around um you can choose to
explain note the bright yeah you can
name things too uh which is interesting
um I don't think I'm going to name them
for now but I'm I just don't know what
the value of naming them is okay so
let's see I have a I need that open
actually I do need there we go
just shove this here on the side even
lower move this up a little bit I just
okay so my container and now I'm going
to go to my layout so my container I
need to figure this out okay so we need
a grid template template columns um so
yeah what I was thinking is I need one
and then 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 1 2 hmm
this is oh this would be a 1 and a 1 I
guess I'm having trouble breaking this
up properly in my head
Wow I didn't think this would be so hard
maybe I should have planned this a
little bit more
should I just do the 12 ah there's a way
of doing this where I can repeat I think
I'm going to do the repeating thing but
I forget how it works does it in here
the repeat repeat this is what I want
okay let this might be what I want this
might be what I want repeat repeat so I
want I'm going to do 12 columns and I
maybe from there we'll try simplifying
it so if I have 12 columns and so I
wanted a repeat I'm guessing it's 12 1fr
and I'll look at the fr in a second one
fr is that it why is there a 5% here at
the end which 20 20 20 and then 2/5 I
just want yeah that's all I want so I'm
going to save that so I'm making a 12
column grid now I think this will make
the most sense we'll find out in a
second and I'm also going to just give
this a width of 960 pixels just to make
my life easy and a margin of 0 Auto and
a background of red because I want to
see it and I want to give it a height of
like 500 pixels I'm going to delete this
in a second I just want to see if this
is working save might there it is so I'm
going to do my inspect element and oh I
forgot something important before I say
that I have to say it's display grid
that would help it's compiling but
where's my let's move this up display
grid and my grids nothing hmm okay let's
also give it some rows grid template
rows I'm gonna do like a hundred pixels
across the top and then if not 50% when
Fr
when fr the supposed to be
comma-separated yeah thanks Edie I
didn't yeah yeah sorry I just saw your
comment now and I was missing that but
thank you and RAM thank you I'm glad
that you like my designs I appreciate it
okay so I still don't see a grid showing
up and there maybe it's the color no I
don't think it's the color I just think
I'm not doing this properly this might
be a complete disaster of a video guys
let's go back up to here no okay
25 percent 100 pixels Auto so this maybe
it's not understanding the Fr
but I'm sure fr works well let's just do
a I don't know 10 percent now it's gonna
be too big 5 percent I just want to see
if this helps at all or even just do 10
pixels 10 pixels 10 pixels whoops
back over to here it sees it's updating
but it's not Oh see I have a mistake
here but it's understand ro it's
probably so Spiros right oh ok awesome
it's working good so I can see my grid
is working so let's just switch this
back to one fr I want to see if there we
go when fr is working awesome
ah I've achieved something awesome uh
thanks Sheldon it's not a problem it's a
disaster yeah if you want to see the
grid you need to go to the dev yeah I
did that already it just I had something
that wasn't working I don't know what it
was and then this can be one fr so if
you don't know what an fr is it's a cool
unit it's there fractional unit one fr
one fr ah there we go
so I have a grid now guys sweet
so we're getting there so I'm just going
to put a space here so we can sort of
separate the two things so what this is
doing I know the 1fr is just using the
amount of space that's available it's a
fractional unit I don't know if it's
that you read around there's like the
something length I think it stands for
fraction so I have 12 so they're all
going to be equal let's just say I made
this one 2 and then a 1 so this is twice
as big as this one
and if I made that 3 would be 3 times as
big and it's using whatever the leftover
space is so I have a height of 500
pixels and this is 100 so I have 400
left over so it's just using that space
that I have left and if it's 1 and 1
they'll be equal and you can play around
with it a little bit like that so cool
I'm happy about that
so let's go back to my index and let's
go back to photoshop for a second so I
want to have one thing that goes all the
way across the top so I'm going to just
call this one my header and we'll just
put a header I'm not going to be going
crazy here I just want something really
simple then I'm gonna have these two
here so this will just be like all of my
main content and a side whoops
dot sidebar okay I think now the
disaster is over I think I have
everything under control main content
yeah we're learning together good
I hope I'm guessing Eddie you have
experience with the grid does anyone
else here ever played with it yet
I'm curious let me know if you have or
haven't played with it yet sidebar and
then here we'll have so I'm just going
to split space this out so we can sort
of okay and then here I'm just going to
have like a 50% we'll call it left and
right for some really non-semantic names
but or overly semantics maybe left side
and right side so the cool thing with
this with the grid from what I've seen
of it or read about it anyway
let's save that so here I have my header
and I can just tell it to take up what I
want it to take up then I have you know
I can I have my grid and I can just say
be here on the grid this is where you
live on the grid so I don't need to
worry about these empty spaces I can
just position it in the exact spot that
I need it to be so yeah let's see and so
this I think is all the markup I need
just to build something like that and we
could always put a footer on there or
something too so what I want to do now
and they actually another thing that I'm
going to do I do want some space between
all of these cool so it only a couple
people are answering but I'm hopefully
you know if you haven't played with it
yet I would suggest you trying if you
have the time to play with it because it
will I think is going to be really handy
but it's it looks like it might be I
keep going to the wrong window there
sorry I don't need this either I'm so
used to going to Chrome and I don't want
to be going to Chrome I think it's going
to be pretty handy so right now it's not
working at all we can see just all my
text there interestingly it's sort of
floating each one is just falling into
one of those grids by default which is
kind of cool well I did want Chrome for
a second though because I want this I
should just open this up in Firefox
actually I just put this in a tab so I
just don't have to worry about Chrome
anymore what I want to do is put some
gap on there I think it's good call grid
gap something like that let's see if I
can find gap I think can't you do them
all in one though just like grid gap
yeah you can okay cool so let's bring
this back up so just to show you what I
mean now here let's add a grid gap grid
gap of like 10 pixels and I should there
we go I get the 10 pixel space between
everything yeah and because I haven't
assigned any of those dibs anything I
should change that font color just
weensy the text
it looks like they're just automatically
falling in each into one of my little
grid items there so we're going to start
with my header okay so my header I want
it to go all the way across and take up
one row I don't remember how to do that
so let's go and look um we can also
justify our content there's some sort of
flex boxy type of stuff in there so grid
column and grid row is what I want so
I'm going to do a grid column and a grid
row now as I said I've read a bit about
this and just looking quickly I'm pretty
sure it's where you're starting and over
- I thought that's how far it's going
where you start and how far you go I
always thought it was where you start
and where you're ending hmm I thought
grid columns start grid column end
that's what I thought so you do the
start line and the end line so my column
is going from 1 to 12 do I just put a
space or do I have to do it over I think
it's like 1 over 12 1 over 12 and my
grid row I might not have to put it
because it's just like a 1 over 1 right
or is it 1 over 2 I always see first
line 2 line 3 mmm
I'm going to make a mistake here let's
go just look here you can also say like
span to start and I'm going to screw
this up I shouldn't be using oh I sort
of got it once so you can see this is
going from here let's give my header a
background background of pink so you can
see there it's going yeah it's starting
it here and then it's ending at the 12th
line I think right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 so one so if I have to put this at 13
then that's kind of awkward when you
have 12 columns you have to do 13 but
it's where are you stopping I'm stopped
thing there and again we could be doing
this like grid columns start your
starting at one and then grid column end
where are you ending but I find I think
learning the shorthand is going to be
easier in the long run so I'll leave
like that
then let's go on to my main content so
my main con content should be a grid
column so I don't want it to start at
one I wanted to start at one two three
and I want it to go so it's starting
here and it's going one how many am I
going over one two three four five so
I'm going five over so if it's starting
and it's one two three four five six
seven eight
does that make sense three to eight so
it's not like a three over eight it's
from three to eight and we'll give that
a background a background of yellow
awesome that worked cool that's so neat
and I'm just going to do one more thing
on my container margin top of like 300
pixels well 100 then okay there we go
that looks better um you're a bit clumsy
you Davich when it comes to CSS so you
ever played with this kind of grid yeah
I I don't think Oh see I screw I'm going
to refresh something looks weird I'm
sticking off the side here why are
things sticking off the side okay we'll
figure that out in a minute
I'm just going to get it set up first if
you are not used to the grid Oh what if
I did this at - that's me super awkward
no it's not okay
it's because of the grid gap it's the
grid gap is causing a bit of an issue
there hmm if I turn off my inspector
thing you wouldn't even notice maybe
it's just the inspector I'll figure it
out
yeah if you're not used to CSS I don't
know if I jump right into
building custom grids like this but it's
definitely worth it's going to be where
things go from now I think it's going to
become event weight right now it's two
cutting edges the browser supports not
there for it to be super big can I just
do a grid span grid how do you do the
span span - so grid column column span
three I think that worked and background
is orange so that's a little just using
the span in this case might be easier
than saying like start here and end here
and even maybe in this case a grid
column start is three three and then can
I just do a span five no that doesn't
work so I can do a grid oh yeah that
makes sense a great column start of
three and then a grid column and use end
start end gap column Auto column I just
do it here can I do it span five up but
that's over writing this because this is
the shorthand so I'd have to do but I
can't do this then how did they do it
I'm sure they had one worth of span in
there oh three yeah forgot okay that's a
little bit easier you start here and
then this is how much space you're
taking up I sort of like that better I
find that easier so if I did a one over
span twelve yeah that's the same thing
okay that makes more sense so start at
one span to twelve what if I did three
okay so it ends up being the same so
spend four I just want to see here one
two three four okay and if you just
happen to go too big it won't Oh No it
screws everything up okay
and start one what if I just did spend
12 okay so if it's starting at the
beginning you don't have to give it a
span or the thing you just have to say
how much you want to spend
I sort of like this span when it's
easier to count for me um yeah so okay
cool that's looking pretty good
we just have the last one to do which is
really easy I'm just wondering if I need
okay so those I'm going to leave like
that they automatically fell on to the
second one because they didn't have a
room up here but these ones I want to
force down so I think when I do my left
I'm going up to a grid row start
I'm guessing it's three yeah that worked
and it brought it down to here um do I
I'm wondering this weird problem being
caused I'm just curious to save I don't
think this is going to change anything
but I just want to see huh that actually
made the right side come over to there
which is weird
okay so left so I have to say this well
I can do left and right that's probably
a bit better right
they're both starting there and then can
I do
no I can't hmm I was hoping so I can do
left grid row actually I can keep it all
on the same stuff then right I don't
know oh yeah I can do a grid grid column
span for I'll give them both the
background of purple so we can see them
and then I can just do my left as the
grid row start or is this going to screw
everything up
of two that's going to screw everything
up yeah I thought so because I'm over
writing stuff
oh that's ro I wanted to call him yeah
that's what I thought would happen okay
so I can't do it like that ah grid ro
what why did I do start three oh that's
my row column huh span four is there
away I can because the problem here is
if I did a grid say I did like you're
starting at three they're going to
overlap each other my right side of my
left side are on top of each other
because they're both doing that they're
both using the same stuff here um and I
don't want it to use the same so okay
I'm just going to get rid of that and
I'm going to have to do it left is grid
column three span four and my right is
just a grid column span four there we go
so that works cool okay that's all right
and then just for fun fun let's just go
up to here and say this is two so it
should become twice as big cool now the
one thing I think I didn't do very
efficiently here is I have like the two
empty ones and the two empty ones and if
if anybody if you know what I did wrong
here or if it's just it could just be
the developer tools that are showing it
a little weird oh no I
okay it seems okay I think it's just the
developer tools that are showing it is a
little bit off maybe because of my grid
gaps I'm not sure but it seems when I
turn that off and I look here that it's
all fitting in the space properly so
that's cool so I can do the repeat
twelve but I really think I could have
that as like a one those two is like
single ones just because there I always
have them as like empty space in my
layout
so I feel like I'm not being and I also
have some side-scrolling for some reason
this is my body just need margin:0 why
is it side-scrolling I'm not going to
stress about it too much that's weird
960 margin:0 auto it shouldn't be
side-scrolling body do I have anything
weird on my body no margin:0 huh
that's interesting I'm not sure what's
happening there oh well I'm not going to
stress about it again so that took me
like half an hour that's not too bad
just to get the basics down so that was
fun okay so I'm gonna open up my
Photoshop design for what I want to
actually do now because that didn't take
me too long at all
so I'm thinking what I'm going to do
here I'm actually going to draw some
boxes to make my life easier I'm going
to just have this is like a big
background area I'm not even going to
worry about that I'm going to make my
grid in here so this is going to be my
grid area
did I I thought I might have done this
already but I'm not sure let's go look
at my layers did I break this up I was
thinking about doing it I don't think I
did
no okay so what I want to do I want one
block here and let's just whoops I don't
want to do that I just want to lower the
opacity okay
so I have that there I'm going to have
one here that's smaller so that's going
to be something like that one here a big
one here because I can get away with
that now I might be looking at this
completely the wrong way
let's make whoops this would be 20% I
can bring that same thing there same
thing here make that darker so something
like that and then I need one two three
columns so that's one two three four
five six rows and three columns that I'm
going to need yeah does that make sense
okay so that's we're going to try and do
and I'm just going to delete this first
all of this crap that I did because this
was just playing around to see what I
could do so let's save that that's all
gone we can this is all fine and my
index I want to get rid of this save so
we're going to start from scratch okay
so you have that background image we
won't worry about it yet
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
come in and um I'm going to come in and
what I'm going to do we're going to do
I'll call it container again actually so
then in my container I'm going to have
my header area thing up here which will
be my team so I think I'll just do that
as my h1 our team then I'm gonna have my
team member I just do this team member
and then team member and then I'll just
do member one that makes sense
team member and member one and just do
at times three on that no it won't
because I have stuff to put in here um
so member actually yeah we'll just do
this team member and then member one and
eleven two and three inside each one of
those I have an image plus an h2 plus an
h3 plus a paragraph uh image slash what
did I call them I made this a long time
ago I was planning on oh no I didn't I
renamed them in here renamed member zero
one that was silly of me not to have the
proper names this one's a rename member
zero two also pngs I should have saved
these as JPEGs but that's okay member
zero three oh no that's okay their
pictures are switched I don't mind
okay
close and close so image member zero one
dot PNG whoops dot PNG the text here is
John John Orson lead designer and some
lorem ipsum there we go so let's save
that see if it's working
yes it is cool good well that's not what
I wanted is it is that what that looks
like oh yeah it just should have been
all caps okay okay
I think it's working okay then and now
I'll copy this copy paste paste the
chat's awfully quiet I see there's
people in there you guys are allowed to
try to way say hi comment on what I'm
doing anything at all don't be shy
please
so my h2 is Sally Jones who is a
developer and Vicky Smith who is the
photographer photographer okay
and now the fun will start if I get
through this faster that I won't get
through this faster and I thought this
is going to take me a little bit I think
um can I see the art team up there okay
it's there I just need to put a drop
shadow on that so one two three four
five six I'm thinking let's just style
it a little bit to start with um let's
go back to my h1 actually h1 box a text
shadow I don't know five pixels five
pixels 15 pixels black just for now ten
and ten
and blocks way to dark rgba 0 0 0.25
that's all right there we go okay so our
team my body you can get the background
image I guess background:url our team B
G dot PNG background size of cover okay
cool good
oh no something's not working oh I
forgot my semicolon there we go
good good good so that is first image is
number one
Oh member whoops Thank You Harry Harry
how are we here
sorry if I'm saying your non name wrong
Harry here I what did I put them whoa
effort okay rename thank you for that
OOP that you can work rename
there we go save oh there we go better
okay cool so back to my I'll do this one
in the layout just because it's stuff I
haven't done yet and um here you don't
want to disturb me don't worry about it
that's what I'm with these long with the
live ones I plan on going a little bit
longer I don't mind getting a little
sidetracked and stuff if ever it happens
don't be shy I'd like to see you guys
chatting away Sheldon where do I get the
inspiration in this case I did get it
from I put the link here I don't
remember where I kept it and we're
staying with Firefox so I actually got
it from somebody else
this one itself I saw where is it there
we go
I saw this and liked it so I wanted to
do something similar so that's where I
got that a lot of the time I actually
have a Pinterest account where I'll take
just it whenever I'm bored and I have a
few seconds I go in there and just pin
random web design stuff I like and I've
come from a print background so when I
was doing a lot of print work that I
just collected lots of cool stuff and
then you try not to copy it but to use
ideas you see elsewhere in your own
application because it's always going to
be different when you're doing it for
your own thing than someone else now
when I try and do my designs a lot of
the time what I'll do is I look at as
much stuff as I can I get some cool
ideas but then I put them all the way on
the side for like a day and then I start
designing so all these ideas are sitting
in my head I'm thinking about them a
little bit um but they're not like you
know I'm not messing exactly what people
have done because all those ideas have
had some time to like float around in my
head and I sketch things out for
especially for layouts I do a lot of
sketching for my layouts to get me where
you're starting because the first thing
you think of usually isn't the best so
each one of my team members let's go
with the team member needs to have a
border of like I don't know five pixels
solid
eight they need to have a background
that is I don't know what my colors were
where's my colors primary maybe I made
this a long time ago yeah it is primary
good okay do I need anything else the
sizes are all going to get oh that's
going to be a problem for my images may
be sizing my images properly and
responsively might there's something I
can use but I forget what it is it's
something I just write about that looked
awfully exciting anyway but that's okay
let's just go back to my Photoshop for
one second the white border needs to be
bigger let's do like twelve so that
looks good
the text I'm just going to go back to my
basics for a second because I forgot on
my h2 to do a text transform upper case
cool that looks okay and and all of this
can be text-align:center this should be
italic that's my h2 why is it not italic
there's mh3 that's mage three font style
there we go okay I'm pretty happy with
that Sheldon your design and layout are
amazing especially the rock band yeah
I'm really happy with the rock band one
actually that's one I find making
layouts without real content is hard so
I did that's one R I did a lot just
looking around and trying to get ideas
but I'm you know I come from a design
background so that obviously helps at
one point I do want to do some more
series on design especially maybe some
typography stuff and more some small
details things that can make websites
look a lot nicer but I'm not really sure
what to do for those yet so if you have
any ideas let me know or if your if
anyone
else in the chat is interested about
design stuff please let me know because
I enjoy design that's what I do I I
teach I teach more design than web
online is more web and in I'm also a
teacher so in the classroom it's more
design stuff okay so I think those are
okay my spacing is a little bit off I
can fix all that up later but I want to
focus on my layout now so did I put that
I did do it in a container okay so my
container is going to be a display grid
now I said it seen me three columns so
if it's three columns that would be
column no a grid columns oh template
columns there we go
I've repeat three 1fr ah good that
worked so I'm having three columns when
fr they're all equal spacing that's
awesome then I'm gonna have my grid gap
is it just grid gap I think my gap
everywhere is going to be the same let's
just go look really fast again in
Photoshop it's a little bit bigger here
than here but I don't know we'll just go
with like a 1m for now that looks okay
cool I should have probably not just put
an image up here just looking at my
spacing I maybe should have split that
into two things so I can put some
padding on those yes we'd love that
okay so I guess some design stuff you
guys might like to see so I'll try and
figure out some things I could do on
design once I wrap up I have a few other
little things I want to cover once I
finish my bootstrap series and then
after that maybe I'll do a little series
or a run-through on some design stuff
that could be fun
while we're talking about it would you
like to see the design a in Photoshop or
design tips and tricks in the code like
when building the website because I
could easily do either one I want to
start playing with Adobe XD as well but
I haven't got around to really getting
into it and on the windows I don't think
it's up to par with where the Mac one is
yet and either way they're not up to par
we're sketch is yet either so now I need
my column my rows right so my grid
template rows this is where it's more
complicated because I think how I want
to do this
I'm just not sure about like how to
decide how big to make each one other
than just measuring it but if I give it
an actual pixel value that's kind of
awkward I'm going to try just doing a
repeat one two three four five six Auto
for now because I'm not quite sure how
the auto works so we're going to find
out yeah so yeah we're going to see how
that works I'm going to give this a
glass of title in the code in the code I
want code tricks Photoshop then from
Photoshop to the code to see how I do it
I also would love to see a vintage style
cool so yeah I I think I'll focus more
on the code but explaining my design
along the way maybe or anyway we'll see
maybe I might do I design it in
Photoshop in one video and then coat it
a little bit like I did in one of my
other series I think didn't I do that in
one series if I haven't I'll do that
maybe one video of the design followed
by several videos of the coding so if
people aren't interested in the
Photoshop they can just skip that video
um so that's cool so I'm going to do my
title
Harry in the code maybe you could show
the some tips and tricks in Photoshop
yeah so I think mostly in the code with
like a little bit of Photoshop stuff
thrown in would be handy so my title
should be a grid actually can I skip the
title one I'm just curious your team
member all of these should be starting
on the second row so if I did a grid row
start of one two so my title still needs
a grid row grid column span to does it
not fit in two columns let's turn my
grid on now that I have one 1 2 that
should grid column 1 span - it was
working I didn't save after I added the
class to my title except this isn't
going to work this isn't going to work
because I don't want them all starting
at the same spot Sheldon code and
explain the design okay I could
definitely i'll definitely i'll try and
make some videos where i'm looking more
at the design i think i'm going to do a
typography one at the very least where
i'm exploring some typography ideas
because there's some fun stuff we can do
in the code using some pseudo elements
and stuff I've been sort of planning a
series on that for a long time it didn't
really know how to work it in I keep
getting a side scroller if any I don't
have a width end and that might just
because my image size yeah okay that's
just my images are too big ish maybe hmm
something weirds going on with that I'm
gonna have to figure this out
okay anyway my lay would sort of coming
together but I don't want all these
starting at 2:00 so I'm going to get rid
of that and we have to do that's why I
have three team members so dot team
member I was number one remember zero
one two and three yeah and more votes
for in the code design tips and tricks
in the code from dummy are there so yeah
I'll I'll focus on doing it in the code
then so he is there he is starting
where's he starting he's starting on the
third one so that's a grid row start
whoops I don't need a period there grid
row start of three member zero one oops
I I'm not consistent with all this stuff
save so he's starting on the third one
you're starting on the second one is
this going to screw everything up
remember to remember to I copied and
pasted and remember three that's okay
and you're starting on actually you
might be starting their own oh yeah two
and then four grid rows start of four
now everything's screwed up because
they're starting in the wrong spots
maybe I completely screwed this up and I
don't and by the way is that a plug-in
for atom that completes your tags yes
that's Emmet I always forget how to get
to the settings settings and packages
and that's going to take forever to load
so we'll get back to that in a second
but it's called Emmet where I you write
just dot whatever push tab oh it
completes the tags yeah for my tags
yeah that's for Emmett oops okay so now
with my column starts I think this will
fix it I really hope it does so a grid
column
okay so member one is going from one
grade column start of one can I just do
that
she number two is starting at number two
good and oh I screwed up my numbers here
uh maybe let's see uh yeah and okay this
is going to work this is going to work
and grid column start is number three
okay good so they're spaced out but now
I just need and now we're gonna do my
ends so we'll start with the second one
grid column and wow this is anyway let's
see
so my second one I know the pictures are
backwards the second one is going one
two three so not column this should be
grid row and yeah
omit let's go look settings where is it
Emmett there it is so you can just do a
quick search for that and look up them
if you if you get into Emmett I don't
use it to its full potential at all I
definitely suggest looking up the
documentation on Emmett because it's
super powerful grid row end is so it's
starting it two three four five so it's
going down to number five ah yes okay
good
it looks really stretched out but I
think once we fix the rest of them it
will not be so stretched out so grid row
end for this guy my autos aren't going
to work though
the spacing here is not going to be what
I wanted it to be but well I don't think
anyway a grid row end is going to be so
we're going he's starting it one two
three two three four
or five six so your grid row end should
be number six so the offset is there and
then this one should be a grid row end
of seven then right does that make sense
oh my Otto did work Oh
except that's too big should that what
it sort of worked but not quite but I
think it's so here I have let's just go
look at my photoshop again I think it's
what I want I'm just not controlling it
properly because I have it set to auto
for the heights where's my photoshop
there we go
so there should be a gap of one there
which there is a gap of one to hear
which there is the problem is I want
these two to actually be equal and these
to be equal maybe what I need to do okay
so let's go find my rows
so my rows I'm going to do Auto for the
top one fr one fr because I want this
and this to be equal and auto for the
middle one fr one fr and I don't this
might be me not knowing how fr-s and
everything work clearly not ah
we're getting closer they're all the
same size now you can see like the
spacing and everything looks much better
but this one fr things not working mate
because with auto and not controlling my
height what if I just did like three fr
I'm just curious that's sort of more
what I want that was just like a random
guess in the dark that that this one you
can sort of see it it's hard to see a
the colors but this is one block here
and it's hard to see that it's taller
you know it's three times bigger than
the other ones but that's just me taking
a like sort of a guess in the dark and
I'm not sure if I like the idea that I'm
just taking a guess in the dark and how
can when I made it for it didn't change
like what if I make that 10 shouldn't
everything hmm
that's actually okay let's make that
like a little bit more like a that's
interesting it's working I'm pretty
happy let's just turn off my grid and
make my browser bigger of course I have
to limit the total size here because
it's getting way too wide and I have to
figure out why I have this giant side
scroll so that might be actually from
the team right no I thought maybe that
was doing it wise make it is my
container just really big not even my
body is not really big mmm could you
explain what the f R stands for I didn't
pay attention no problem the fr is I
think it's called a fraction and it's
pretty much it's taking up the available
space so if you have something that's
just one fr like say I had right now
let's turn my grid back on and let's
just make this like 300 pixels for now
it's gonna scrub my layout probably or
500 then hmm I see why okay
what if I did 100 because that will
probably make everything bigger okay
good so I could even make this one when
fr probably so right now one fr when fr
when fr one these are all equal so
they're all you can see I just make this
is you one fr for everything so the
height of all of them right now because
I'm on my rows each one of these blocks
has the same height to it if I take one
of them so I'll just take my first ones
it's going to easy to see and I switch
that over to a 2 it's going to be twice
as big as all my other ones and it's
always using the available space overall
so if you had it in a limited amount of
space it's using the available space and
then if one of these like let's just say
it's two this one's like 500 pixels this
one becomes 500 pixels so this one row
is 500 pixels tall and then these again
they're just using up the available
space and they're an equal amount of
unit will overflow not fix it yeah I can
probably turn over play with my overflow
um I don't want to play with my folks
because I want to understand let's just
go back a little bit I think I liked it
a little like that um I just don't like
that I'm guessing here but let's make
that one maybe a three so I can make
them all bigger yeah yeah overflowed
probably fix it let's just do one thing
in my container let's just give this a
width of I don't know 80% of my screen
of margin of zero Auto let's see what
that does
so I obviously have something that I did
wrong what the heck did I do wrong
because if my body my container oh it's
over why is it overflowing at the side
okay so you can see my containers there
and then my titles okay but you can see
here okay that's my container
highlighted
there's my container highlighted and I'm
pointing to my screen you probably can't
see it's my my stuff inside is
overflowing out of it my images are not
responsive I'll just go back to my
basics because I should have done this
in here we'll just do it here image with
max width 100% height:auto I still have
side scrolling but I got what I wanted
um except our team my font size is too
big
basics here's a cool thing that I
learned I want to make a video about
this I did the video 9 ramp so my font
size is in RAM you can set font size and
I have a video about this say I did five
vertical width that's gonna be too small
like 10 which can be cool but when you
have vertical width is a unit your font
can get really massive on big screens
and on small screens get really really
tiny and you might not want it to get
that affected as your
moving stuff around so you can actually
do say I do a calc and then I do five R
M plus 3 vertical width let's make that
six maybe so it's starting at 6 and then
I'm adding or subtracting a little bit
of vertical width to it so as my screen
adjusts it it still grows and shrinks so
the text is sort of responsive to my
screen but it's less responsive than it
was and I read that on CSS tricks and
I'm really happy I did but let's just
make about a 4 then I wanted it really
big but I also don't want it to break at
small screen sizes because you can see
here it's taking up exactly those two
columns so it's going to snap oh no
that's perfect because of my vertical
width thing it started getting smaller
again and it worked but I'm still
getting this nasty side scrolling going
on why is this one bigger than my other
ones now I'm running into all sorts of
problems my background I don't think my
it's just a background image let's turn
it off just for fun body no it's it's
still there I didn't think that would do
it
I'll find that out in a second I'm used
to debugging weird stuff like this so so
the two things that are bugging me this
one's currently bigger than those two so
let's go look at why each one should be
3 f R 1 F R ok so now I do need to I do
need to dive into my code here ah team
member 1 3 is it because know what that
would that shouldn't do it if I look at
the grid can I like
I can see the column gaps I was hoping I
could break this apart a little more my
rows are working okay are they sort of
it's just these names over two lines
let's just see
I'm just curious actually is it going to
let me do this I just want to see in
chrome what happens I don't have any
side scrolling it's maybe Firefox that's
causing this he's still oh it's because
his bloody name is bigger that damn name
is too big so it's causing some issue
and it makes sense that here I'm just
running out of room they're not getting
any smaller because their names are a
certain size so now it's getting some
issues I could fix that with some media
queries
I don't even yeah I can make play with
it for media queries so they stack at
one point instead I'm not going to do
that yeah Sheldon it does look hectic
and annoying I sort of agree with you
right now I'm not I'm not doing a good
job of selling it at the moment I won't
lie but I do think part of my problem
here actually is see there it's gone
with the inspect element open for some
reason when I put the grid on no and
it's not doing it now weird okay so I
don't even know what caused it I do
agree that the grid does look hectic and
annoying I'm not sure this is either the
best example that I chose to to do with
it but I do think one it's one of those
things that's probably a little bit more
complicated but once you wrap your mind
and get used to using it and I think
part of it I know for me flexbox
which I use as much as I can is already
kind of I'm still referring back to
cheat sheets and stuff when I'm using it
just to make sure I'm using the right
properties everywhere so it's one of
those things where I think is we wrap
our mind around this it's going to make
a lot more sense again I don't know if
this was the best use of it I just
thought it'd be easy with like the one
space no space
to space thing it intrigued me a little
bit for doing big layouts that are less
fragmented that don't have is
complicated of as a grid it'd probably
be a little bit better so like that
first example we have something that
stretches all three then you have your
main content area that's something like
this and then you could have some
sidebar little things or something like
that I think might be a better
application for it but even now like
watching this as you can see I have been
struggling a little bit obviously but
it's not as bad as I thought it would be
actually just because there there is a
lot to it and I haven't even been going
through everything in here there there
is you know there's justifying content
and aligning content within and stuff
like that that you can do which is cool
to which you this I think would work a
lot like how flexbox does even align
itself is very flexbox II um yeah and
just aligning stuff inside the grid I
think that a stretching content aligning
stuff I think that it's one of those
things that might be a bit annoying at
the beginning but as we I'm not going to
go through all that but as we get used
to it I think it's going to be useful
but I agree right now my example I
should bring this back up um I might not
be doing the best at the best example
but now that I've actually got this I'm
going to happy with it I've had some
issues with Firefox when I had the dev
tools enabled on a different site yeah
it's really weird maybe it's because
it's the sort of the developer version
so there's possibly some bugs but I
can't read it on my screen the URL for
which Brian I've in the description
below is the URLs for the ones I'm using
anything I'm using for this one that's
on now it's not actually live this is
just local hosts whatever it's hosted
locally on my computer
but I will upload this with github or
something like that just so you guys
could take a look at it and play around
with it for sure on your own once this
is done I'm also going to re-upload the
whole stream and higher-quality
hopefully because I know it seems to be
well some people are in 720 but if
you're not at 720p it might be kind of
blurry so yeah the the description for
everything any of the links for stuff is
in the description below so you should
be able to get what you need in there
hopefully um yeah the CSS tricks one
there's to a grid by example and CSS
tricks I think they're both in the CSS
tricks one is the this one and which is
awesome and then the the grid by example
is this here except that's not that was
just looking at an example but they do
have actual examples that you can sort
of explore and you can see here this is
where is talking about where like you
can do some more interesting stuff and I
think with combined with flexbox and
also there's the possibility of
overlapping stuff which is really cool I
don't know if there's an example here
but it's going to become really easy to
overlap content which is going to be
kind of neat um I might break everything
and trying to do this but if I want
these two to overlap my columns let's
say I did four columns are actually
let's just do I'm not going to do one fr
15 pixels one fr one fr so it's going to
break everything which is okay but I
just need to change a few numbers number
two is ending at a grid row
spend two does that make sense
clearly not why not oh because it's
start whoops
so grid column end would be for you go
so you can see I can overlap content
really really easily which is in this
case isn't the best example of something
column start is say I do a four grid
column and six five and here maybe my
one has a grid column end of two three
there we go so the you can see like
England if I put a drop shadow box
shadow one zero zero 10 pixels black
just for demo purposes and I turn off
the display grid here you know it's
probably not the prettiest example but
it becomes really easy to overlap
content like this which could be really
you can get some cool effects like that
or I saw example where was like yet the
four things next to each other and then
this like diamond thing that was
overlapping them in the middle that was
really neat Alex I'm using O'Brien I'm
glad you got the links there and Alex
I'm using pre pros which is right here
so it's compiling my CSS Auto refreshing
and it also does a bunch of other stuff
so there's the live preview you can sync
browsers with it and it can do your sass
and any other things you can also minify
your CSS and uglify your je s and it
handles markdown and a bunch of other
stuff so it's a just easier than using
the command line for everything so I
like it I'll add the description below
maybe here pre-pro scott io that's what
i'm using if you're on a it's on Mac and
peace
the code kit is what most people seem to
use on Macs though so if you're on a Mac
as far as I know it does pretty much the
same thing as pre pros so yeah for I
guess also maybe you can see now that my
grid is set up it actually becomes
pretty interesting to come through and
make modifications to it so say let's
just add another 15 pixel you know I
breaks everything but then I just have
to change a little bit uh so she's
ending at maybe a 5 now if it makes
sense and then she's starting at 4 and
ending at 6 and it's just you can create
like these overlaps and stuff like that
so I agree I was definitely struggling a
little bit at the beginning but once now
the you know I haven't played with this
for very long and already I find it's an
it's more intuitive I think than it
looked and if I had I definitely have to
play with this more it's not something
I'm super comfortable with yet in the
least but I think the more I play with
it and the more comfortable I get with
it it could definitely be a really
powerful design tool because you can
just make this really quick fast layout
for the how you want to lay things out
and then things will just fall into
place I wouldn't use this for everything
I'm using this for the main layout and
then inside of that I'm doing things as
I always did with flexbox and even like
our team I could probably do a grid row
end too and then align self it's not
flex though they see I knew a line self
I recognized it from flexbox
justify self no I want the aligned self
that's kind of annoying that it's the
same property oh but that's not good is
it gonna work let's find out and
is this going to work oops where's my
grid a grid row n 2 so my title should
it's not the grid Row 3 what happened
why is it shooting over there 1 okay and
then if I make that a 2 what happens but
why if I make that a 3 does that happen
because I'm looking at rows I shouldn't
be playing with my columns a grid column
1 oh there we go ok that's what I was
after
uh does that index work with this I
don't know
ah cool ok so it because I wasn't
telling it where it was starting it
seemed to be causing some issues so
start at 1 span across 3 which I need
because I have a little one down the
middle there and let's just turn off my
grid now again see I need to play around
with this I don't really like how that's
looking exactly but again you could
easily overlap stuff much better I think
than position:absolute and you could
always make something in here
position:relative and then the elements
inside of that position:absolute it just
lets you break out of the normal sort of
stuff we were stuck in so I think it's
yeah I think this is I think we're going
to be able to get some really awesome
designs now I was always sort of
especially coming from a print
background I always felt a little bit
limited at certain times so what we
could do or I knew you could do it but
you didn't want to do it because it
would just be hell I think this is going
to open up some really cool design print
ideas that we'll be able to use in the
long run especially again
experiment with it for now browser
support isn't well it's everywhere but
only in its cutting edge so I actually
ahead can I use open before how good is
the super yeah it's global says seventy
percent that's not too bad guys and it's
on prefixed which is awesome the fact
that nobody needs a prefix for it you
know apart from of course these guys who
need partial support with the prefix but
with all the real browsers it doesn't
need any prefixes and stuff um yeah
these they support it Internet Explorer
on edge but apparently it's an older
version of the spec so probably some of
them the words are a little bit
different and stuff oh it seemed like
there were bugs with overflow but they
were all with a Firefox had some too so
maybe that's sort of what's going on it
says it's not in the current version but
you never know um and yeah I think I'm
going to wrap it up there I wasn't sure
how long this would take but I seem to
have gotten through everything I wanted
to I could fix up my design a little bit
I guess but um this was really just to
play around with this a little bit so um
yeah I'm kind of happy with it I have
this let's close this down again and
refresh just to see yeah there's no
overflow it's the small small small
sizes I need to build some media queries
into at one point just because you know
but this is where it's getting
ridiculous anyway and you can build a
media query where it's completely
changing its behavior you could just
turn off the grid even I'm guessing you
know and they just all of a sudden stack
or you could change your template
columns and your template rows with all
the real browsers your C um so I think
I'm just trying to think if there's
anything else I can play around with on
this other too-tall now I it's okay
though we just added some rows in so
this I guess would become a 6 a 4 and a
5 now nope never mind
I just have to play around with some
stuff I screwed something up along the
way
but if you are going to play with it i
really suggest for now using the Firefox
developer one developer edition just
because it's the only browser right now
that lets you turn on the this little
grid thing which is awesome it really
does help you see what's going on and
understand why your layouts not really
working if ever it's not working so I
would suggest doing that oh it's because
I made the second no actually I don't
know why my alignment all went off I
must have been when I was playing around
with something and opera min-hee I agree
Opera Mini is actually something that
you do have to take into account and I'm
actually going to talk about not Opera
Mini necessarily but I found out a cool
way of dealing with some stuff that if
when things aren't supported its it
tweet a teaser for an upcoming toast
features did you feature queries which
is the app supports it's sort of like a
media query but it's whether or not
features are supported of course the
features thing isn't there this ad
supports isn't always supported but I
will be looking at this a little bit
it's kind of annoying Opera Mini because
they don't support a ton of stuff and
for most of us we don't worry about it
because I don't you know a lot of people
don't use it but from what I understand
it's actually kind of popular which
makes sense because it you know for
people that are on slow connections
it's probably just can I use tell me
like just general support saying 20.8%
worldwide you know three percent it's
more than I know it's around the same as
Internet Explorer and edge so it's not
nobody but it has minimal support on
stuff in general
and you bid this also prevents
JavaScript which is true too so just you
know anyway I Opera Mini is always a
pain in the butt for me I'd rather you
know and it depends what you need to
support and who you want to support with
your stuff but for the grid I probably
wouldn't make a site with grid or if I
did I have a fallback using at least
flex box because flex box support is
pretty pretty good right now ninety
almost 98 percent um pretty much
everything supports flex box so you can
get away with doing a flexbox layout and
having the grid and the flex box
fallback if you really want to and
that's it guys thank you so much for
coming there's still 15 of you here
which is pretty awesome so I really
appreciate you all coming in and
sticking around it's been about an hour
and a half now so I need some water and
something to yeah
wet my throat a little bit that was a
lot of fun though if you want to see
more of these live ones just let me know
I gladly gladly make more live ones I
don't always have a ton of time for it I
do have a full-time job and a family and
I have to make my other videos so I I
wanted to do a live video every month I
don't know if that's going to happen but
I will definitely keep making live
videos um yeah and thank you all so much
for coming I truly do appreciate it and
if again always in the comments below or
I'm still here right now so in the chat
if you want to give any suggestions for
future videos by all means I'm always
open to hear you guys want to say just
through this we got into some design
stuff coming up so yeah I don't really
know how to sign off of a live chat I
just keep dragging this out longer and
longer so I guess I'm just going to have
to end it you Davich I hope I'm saying
your name right here I'm glad you
enjoyed it and you've been enjoying all
my videos one live it every week I wish
I could do that maybe if you know we got
this turned into much bigger and I was
doing some other stuff for a living but
my wife would kill me if I tried doing
one of these every week
[Laughter]
yep so thanks once again again if
hopefully the quality was okay for you
guys but if the quality wasn't perfect I
will be reuploading this or if you just
do want to watch it it will be up later
and hopefully in good quality and yeah
the bootstrap series will be continuing
in what they are we today Monday I'm
gonna have to edit that video soon I've
already I've already recorded it so yeah
I'll have to be editing that video
tonight or tomorrow the mirror you're
welcome thanks again to everybody for
being here you guys Rock I really
appreciate it
and all the support you've been just
giving me in general it's been really
really awesome the channel is doing much
better than I ever really would have
anticipated so I really really
appreciate it
it went fast I know it went really fast
actually I'm surprised that was an hour
and a half can you do a website in the
future with green sock scroll magic
scroll magic I know I don't know what
green sock is but I'll look into it good
luck with your javascript homework yeah
JavaScript Java homework the first
language I tried to learn actually was
Java back I think it was like maybe I
don't remember I remember being young I
saved up some money I went to the
computer store I bought this massive
book on Java I feel like it was in
elementary school but man what was I
doing like grade six maybe but that
doesn't I must have been working on
websites already and for some reason I
decided I wanted to learn Java I got I
couldn't get through the first
HelloWorld exercise thing like it just
wouldn't work it wasn't don't know what
I did wrong
I spent like a week trying to get
HelloWorld to print on the screen and I
couldn't do it and I gave up and didn't
touch programming for a long time after
that I wish I'd picked a different
language or figured it out what I did
wrong cuz yeah that was embarrassing
that was really bad yeah again thank you
all for being here and all the support
you've given me and now I'm off for real
ciao guys I'm off for real if I can
figure out how to end the stream that is
there we go
ciao bye thanks one last time oops yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
