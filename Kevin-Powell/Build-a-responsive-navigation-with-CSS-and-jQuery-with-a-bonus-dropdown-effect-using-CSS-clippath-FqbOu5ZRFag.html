video I'm really glad that you're here
in this video we are going to be
creating a responsive navigation it's
going to go from a little hamburger menu
that drops down and then we go to a
full-size screen it's going to turn back
into a normal navigation you get on a
desktop computer and to do this we're
going to be using a little bit of jQuery
and to get the whole drop down effect
we're going to come in with a really
cool animation and we're going to use a
clipping path to do that so yeah that's
what we're gonna be doing before I get
started just thanks a lot for coming
here I'm super super excited I've hit 50

things that I will be getting to
eventually if you haven't subscribed yet
please do hit the subscribe button
I bring you new videos every single
Wednesday on how to make the web and how
to make it look better while we're at it
and enough of that you wanna you're
obviously here to learn how to do it so
let's jump right into it and start
coding away so on the screen now you can
see what I'm starting with I've done a
little bit of work just to get rid of
some of the really boring stuff on the
basic set up so if we jump into my HTML
first I have a header set up inside my
header I have a container just to hold
my content so if we look just down here
my containers really really basic I have
my logo there which is just generic Oh
logo nothing fancy space for it there
and then I have my nav now we could do
this two different ways we could do it
with one navigation for the mobile view
and a second navigation when we go into
the desktop view you'll see that used a
lot
I'm going to do it with just one
navigation instead of turning one off
another one on I like doing it all with
one it keeps my HTML a little bit more
clean which I personally prefer but
there's nothing wrong with doing it the
other way find a way that you like the
best in this one we're just sticking
with a single navigation so I've already
set that the basics of that up right
there giving it a little class of site
nav and I've set up a div class menu
toggle here with a div class of
hamburger it's not doing anything yet
because I haven't done any CSS for it
but that's going to come in that's going
to be our little toggle that we're going
to use at smaller screen sizes now if we
jump into my CSS honestly all I've done
is import my google fonts I have my
body's really basic stuff there the
container that we looked at
I've just been setting up colors a
little bit of padding on my header just
to give me that space on the top and I
have positioned it relative because
we're going to have some absolute
positioning coming up so that will help
us out
I put a clear fix on there just to stop
any issues because this currently is
floating left and that is currently
floating right that we can see there
there's my logo logo and then my site
nav right now all I'm doing is floating
it to the right so now what we want to
do is we want to get this to look like a
mobile menu I'm going to start with the
mobile menu I'm going to get the mobile
menu working properly and then I'm going
to put in my media query and make it
look different on the desktop view once
I have it looking good at both views I
have everything working the way I want
it to I'm going to come back and do the
clipping path right at the end but it's
definitely worth sticking around for
it's a really cool way to get a nice
little unique animation in there instead
of the same thing you see everywhere so
I'm actually going take this float right
off that's we don't need to be flowing
right we actually want this to be a
position of absolute let's move this up
so we can focus on it a little more
because it's all going to be on the CSS
now and this as you can see is on code
pen so I'm going to be put the link is
in the description if you want to come
in here and play around with it yourself
fork it off do whatever you want with it
it's there to be played around with so
I'm going to change this from a float
write and I had done that just to sort
of split them up but I want to switch
this over to a pull
so Luke and obviously that's going to
change whoops I hit a real sort of
screws things up a little bit to begin
with but that's okay just we can see it
let's give it a background I'm just
going to put a black background for a
moment so I can see it and help with my
positioning and obviously I have a few
things here that definitely need to be
done I'm going to do my site and have UL
o it is the UL site now I can do this
all on here and I'm actually and put it
right at the top then margin of zero
padding of zero list style of men no it
isn't a that's silly of me
this should actually go on you up my
site map is my nav it's not my ul ul and
just paste all that in there there we go
that's better I need my site and have Li
and let's just give do I need to do
anything right now I'm not going to do
anything on there just yet but we will
be doing some stuff on there and my site
and have a let's just make it so we can
see it color white text Declaration of
none okay so that's a decent start
there's definitely some changes I will
be making to this I don't want it to
look at all like this when I'm done but
this just makes it easier for me to move
around a little bit so jumping back up
to my site nav I have my
position:absolute now what I want is I
actually do want it on the right side
and I want it to come down and up
eventually on this side sort of like
it's coming from underneath this bar
here so we're going to do a top of 100%
so because it's relative to my generic
old logo if I did a top of 0% it would
put it right at the top they'd share the
same top so a top of 100% we'll start it
right at the very bottom of that whole
thing so I know that it's lining up
perfectly there and then we can just
give it a right of zero
and I'm just gonna be percent so it's
all the same but you know this was just
a zero like that it would work just as
well so that looks okay what else do I
want to do drew drew drew let's just
change the background color on there I
do have a color picked out I have it
written down here it's going to be four
six four six five five just to make it
look a little nicer and that's about it
okay so now on to the UL that's about it
that actually that's all we're going to
need on there I do think but we need to
fix our list items a little bit so let's
first
Papapa should I do it on I don't know if
I should put the padding on my list
items or on my links and I think I'm
going to put them on my links instead we
want them to be you know we're pushing
this with our finger we need it to be a
big fat area that we can push on with
our finger so on my links themselves
again I have another color here that
I've written down so we might as well do
the colors properly EBE bd3
it's almost white it's the same color I
used here just for consistency's sake
it's a little bit of an off-white there
already
no I want to put some padding on them so
to be able to get that to work properly
I will have to do a display:block first
and then I can add my padding and let's
try a two m6m for now I'm going to stick
with that one thing I didn't mention
that I completely forgot about I also
want to be using font awesome little
icons in here I'm gonna put a little
icon on the side that leaves a nice
amount of room for those icons to fit in
so I'm going to leave it like that for
now they're a little bit big but we'll
see once I put those icons in what I
want to do last thing I'm gonna do is a
text transform of uppercase there we go
yeah so they Cal ittle bit big right now
but I can live with it I also want to
separate these a little bit actually now
I want to put a line in
bring them so let's come up into our Li
and just give that a border on the
bottom I have one pixel solid and again
I have a color picked out already five
seven five seven six six and that gives
me that little border there just a
little subtle subtle border to separate
them and right away I find personally
when you have a lot of space like that
between them without the border on there
I find the space is here look really
really big and then these two spaces
look smaller so it sort of makes the
whole thing look off-balance a little
bit here and here is smaller spacing
than everywhere as soon as you put a
border in there just now everything as
equal spacing everywhere much more
visually pleasing but really really
important that that border is subtle it
shouldn't be something that grabs the
eye at all it should just be this visual
separation so I'm trying to keep that as
subtle as I can but still visible and I
think that's all I need
I think that's start with going to be
pretty good let's just give these a
little hover effect I think it's gonna
be nice if there is a hover on there
even though it's mostly going to be for
mobile where hover won't come in just
move that so you can see it better site
nav a a hover and I'll also put the site
nav a focus on there since this is more
for mobile and what do we want to do we
want to change the background so let's
give it the background color is going to
be a nice yellow which will be e 4 B 3 6
3 and there we go
and of course when I do that now I can't
really see the font very well so I will
change the actual color as well to the
same dark color we already have there
our 4 6 4 6 5 5 so that's the background
color that I originally had on my
computer it's showing up as super thin
it's not you know I probably want to
make it a little bit bigger actually
should we do that right now I'm going to
do that I'm going to bring this up to
400 and it also means my Google font
here needs to be updated
because I only have this we hundred in
there that makes it a little bit easier
to see because when it's going like that
the home looks fine when I hover over it
gets a little thinner for some reason
which is weird because I wouldn't expect
that actually but it looks a little bit
thinner so I just thought it was too
thin you could barely see it so if
you're on a Mac those letters would
probably look a little thicker just
because or even in other browsers you
know different browsers and different
operating systems render fonts
differently so do be aware of that and
that looks pretty good but I'm noticing
on this one when I hover you can see
right at the bottom there there's that
blue line showing up and that's the
border I have a border bottom on
everything and that border bottom is
still there and it looks terrible that's
really bothering me so we're going to
turn that off and do a site whoops site
nutsoid soat site nav li last child so
we'll select the last li and say wow I'm
not typing good today border bottom of
none I think none works right yeah there
we go super super really happy with that
okay let's keep on going I forgot to put
my semicolon here I know it's not
essential but I like having them
everywhere so now we need that to
disappear and reappear and to do that I
actually need something to click on so
here's one of the first things that's
going to be really fun to do is to make
our little thing there so let's just
take a look again I have my menu toggle
div and inside there I have the
hamburger so the menu toggle will be the
actual thing that I'm clicking on and
the hamburger will just be the visual
hamburger menu itself you'll see a lot
of different ways of doing this
I'm doing it with one empty div there's
plenty of ways of doing it you can
actually find some icons to use that
would work fine I want to do a little
animation with it with one div and some
pseudo elements so that should be some
fun let's try and get that to work out
so the first thing we need to do is
create our menu toggle so
menu toggle and the first thing I'm
going to do is give it a background so
we can see it a background of black and
eventually this will be transparent but
for now I'm going to make it black
let's do padding of 1m so we can see it
okay better position:absolute again so I
can position it in the right spot and
now we can see it's a little square the
top should be okay let's just do a top
I'm not going to move let's move it on
the right now one am I guess hmm so this
and this are the same but it's sort of
glued to the bottom I want to just move
it up a little bit so my I change this a
little bit top of 0.5 and 0.5 mm 0.75
that looks better it's still a little
off but we'll see what happens once I
turn off the background on there I'm
just looking for equal spacing on all
three sides here just because it's going
to look a little bit nicer I have a
feeling once I bring my hamburger menu
in it's going to be a little bit off
anyway so I'm not going to spend too
much time trying to perfect that and
it's something that will be clickable so
I want to change my cursor to pointer so
when I hover on there it actually looks
like it's something I can click on which
is obviously you know doesn't look like
it people might not click it that little
visual representation is good again this
is mostly for mobile view but I'm just
in case going to include that on there
and now we need to make our hamburger so
that's cool let's just start with doing
the basic which will be one line
hamburger so for my hamburger there's a
few things I'm going to have to do
let's give it a background again so I
can see it background we'll stick with
that off-white that I have eb e BD 3 i
think is what it will be so that's okay
i'm going to give it a height of
let's say three pixels yeah you can see
when I add that height I'm going to on
do that's going to get smaller I'm going
to redo
gets bigger so I'm happy I didn't spend
too much time trying to perfect the
positioning of that my backgrounds okay
do I need to give it oh I have a
background I have a height width of Oh
100% I want it to be this big oh that's
not gonna work this is all padding
there's not actually any width to that
element at all to him that's okay but
it's probably too big a one point five
point seven five I think that looks so
right so I'm making the first line in my
hamburger menu and I'm also going to
give it a border radius border radius 3e
pixels just to round those corners off
on there instead so it's not square I
like having my hamburger menus with just
a little thing like that cool and now we
need to bring in the other two so I'm
just going to do that with pseudo
elements and I'm actually they need to
all be exactly the same as this so I'm
not going to go crazy I'm just going to
you know I'm not going to do everything
over again have hamburger before and
hamburger after and the only thing I'm
going to need to change to actually make
this work is I will have to do because
there's pseudo elements they need to
have we have to declare what the content
is which is nothing and we have to just
declare the display type of block and
now you can see that there's two lines
sort of stacked on top of each other
there's actually three there the first
one is on top of the original and then
the other one is coming down below that
so now we have to position them properly
and there could be different ways of
doing the positioning here I'm just
going to use a bit of transform on it
so hamburger before we'll start with
that one
transform translate why I want to move
up and down so on the y-axis and how
much do I want to move it I want to move
it up I want to move it up so up is
negative up negative three pixels oops I
don't want that semicolon there oh that
wasn't enough I just moved it up so it
wasn't directly on top so let's do
another three so a total of six there we
go so that one looks good and now let's
just copy that whole thing hamburger
after but on this one
I want to move it down by three pixels
yeah so one of them is going up by
negative six the other one's coming down
by three
the spacing looks equal the spacing
looks equal and there perfect what if I
do a seven on it just for fun and I
guess I'd be a four on that one mmm I
think I like this better
it was a little tighter and of course
now I don't need that black background
on you here anymore I don't want to
actually see that I just want my
hamburger itself so let's take off that
black background and I need to
reposition it completely there's way too
much space on the top and on the right
and do I need that padding on there I
take that padding off completely yeah oh
no then I have to click literally on one
of those I'm going to leave the padding
on there I'm just and it gives my room
to click on it's a little bit bigger so
you've got a fat finger it does give you
the extra space my top 0.75 how does
that look
that doesn't look terrible that space in
that space look more or less the same
I'm happy with that I'm going to leave
it like that for now so now I want to
make it so when I click on that this can
appear and disappear so that's not too
hard to do but we will have to use a
little bit of jQuery for that we cannot
do that with CSS because we're going to
have to be playing with some classes I'm
going to be toggling in class on and off
that's going to make this up here and
disappear I'm going to do it the first
way using jQuery and the jQuery UI and
I'm going to do it again after remember
instead of using the jQuery UI I'm going
to come in and do the clipping path
instead just because this first way is a
little bit more standard and then the
second way is a little bonus that will
give you at the end of the video so in
here we're going to do a couple things
so I want to select my menu toggle which
is the this whole area here and when we
click on the menu toggle we want
something to happen so if we want
something to happen we've to do a func
Boop function and our function we're
going to have a couple of things happen
right we want to select then site nav
whoops I forgot my
there we go I'm going to select the site
nav I want to add a class on there so
I'm going to do a toggle clasp let's
just make this a bit bigger so you can
see what I'm doing all on one line
toggle clasp what should we call it we
should call it site nav open and what
else do we need to do we're going to
start with that we're gonna have a
little bit we're going to need a little
bit more but we're going to start with
that so I'm going to select my when I
click on my menu toggle we are going to
take our site nav and we're going to add
or remove the class site nav open so
when I click on this whoa it just
toggled the class on there and screwed
everything up oh maybe I should just
have this as nav
oh whoops I made a mistake here I have
that twice toggle clasp there we go I
think we can leave this as sitemap to
site nav whoops okay yeah sorry about
that
that extra parenthesis on there was
screwing things up and I hadn't even
noticed it go so right now nothing's
happening because we don't have a
sitemap open so I'm actually going to
bring this all the way back up to right
here site nav and site nav open so my
site nav open will be very simple it
this will be a height of auto and we're
going to bring in on the actual site nav
here a height of zero pixels and a
overflow because if we don't have the
overflow hidden we will see everything
true why is it not working
ah there we go on enough so and just to
show you if I take off this overflow
here yeah it's all there
so the overflow hidden is really
important so I'm saying that my site nav
is normally zero pixels tall so it has a
height of zero pixels we can't see it
when I click on my menu toggle we're
adding the class site nav open and what
site nav oppan is is it's changing the
height from zero pixels to height of
auto and that's matching the height of
my menu here so the it's jumping back
and forth in now what to actually make
this is a little bit of an animation
instead of it just being on and off you
can use the jQuery UI and just to show
you I am linking to both of them I'm
linking to jQuery here and the jQuery UI
obviously adds a little bit of extra
code but that's okay it does give us a
school thing where I can actually put a
time or a duration on that animation to
happen so instead of it just on or off
it can toggle on and on with a little
500 millisecond animation which makes it
look a lot nicer so that looks pretty
good
so let's on and off and now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to add I want
this to animate so when I click on it
it's going to turn into an X and then
goes back to my regular hamburger menu
to do that it's not too complicated
actually I'm going to do that with this
open though so I can see what's going on
and I'm going to add a second thing on
here so we're also going to select this
so we're selecting the menu toggle and
when it's clicked the menu toggle will
toggle
another class and it's going to toggle
the class of just a menu toggle toggle
open do just that make sense
I'm just going to say open it's going to
make it a little bit easier for me to
write because we're gonna have to play
around with those hamburger menu things
so let's just give myself a little bit
more room okay so what I'm going to do
is say that when I have my open and
we'll just do it for the whole hamburger
first
not my open my open am burger so when my
hamburger is inside of something with
the class of open we are going to have
it do a little transform right yes we're
going to do a transform rotate of 45
degrees ah keep doing this on 45 degrees
and when I click on that the whole thing
should just turn to the side there we go
blink and it's just turning to the side
like that so again when I'm clicking on
my menu toggle it's adding or removing
so I'm adding or removing the class of
open to my menu toggle so my hamburger
is inside of there so if the hamburger
is inside of open it will turn and if
it's not inside of open it will turn
back so that's the first step and now
what I want to do is I want to say that
my
a open hamburger before is going to
change to an opacity of zero because I
only need two lines to get this to work
I don't want three because I'm making an
X and we'll take the other one
open hamburger after and we'll do a
transform rotate negative 45 degrees
oh not now you go 45 negative 90 there
we go
because there is a distance between them
it doesn't make it perfect X so we do
have to move it a little bit here and to
do that actually I need to do that with
a second transform I need to sort of
position it a little bit better and I
can't do that here by coming in and
doing it I can't say transform and do a
different thing here so just to show you
what I want to be doing is another
translate translate why I don't know how
much I need let's just say negative five
pixels for now and it's moved it but
it's replaced this so as we know with
our CSS it's always the last thing that
wins and in this case this is winning
over that but luckily with transforms
you can just do everything with one and
I just need to be separated with a space
so I can say translate Y negative five
pixels and rotate it and you can see
that that's working and I've just really
overshot it negative two negative three
negative three right negative three is
bang-on I believe and I'm rotating it by
90 degrees and it gives me a nice little
X so it goes from there to there and
we'll just come back all the way to here
and give this a transition all these in
out and we'll stick with the same 500
milliseconds that I'm using for this
animation so there we go
I think that looks pretty nice
sweet so the next thing we do is just
add in those icons I was talking about
that I completely forgot about so for
that I actually have to come back up
into my HTML a little bit and I want to
make this look a little bit nicer so
we're going to use font awesome to do
this so if you know how font awesome
works it's pretty cool if you don't know
how to font awesome works well you'll
find out and it's really easy they
always put it on the eye tag just
because it's not used for anything
anymore
so I have an eye tag close eye it's
always just an empty eye tag and it's
the class that controls it so FAS for
font awesome and this one's nice and
easy FA home we should be looking at
what we're doing and that should give me
a little Home icon sweet and the next
thing I'm going to do is I will do a
site nav icon this is a custom class
that I'm just creating myself and I'm
going to use that for positioning and
changing the color of it because I don't
like that I don't want to come in and
change just all the font awesome stuff
in general because I you know I want to
have a little bit more control over it
if I change all of my font awesome stuff
and I'm using icons other where other
places in my site it's going to cause
issue of course I could say that
anything that's a font awesome inside my
site map but who knows maybe I'd want
some that aren't so this will be what
I'm going to do it gives me a bit more
control I like giving a class to
anything that I need to modify and we'll
throw one of those on there
but we're just going to change each of
the icons so this one I will use a info
this one I will use it's kind of
annoying that you can't see these
updating as I do it this one
whoops pencil when it updates it
disappears ah okay we'll just do them
all and I'll show them to you the dollar
sign is USD for pricing and envelope I
guess makes the most sense for that so
there we go there are my icons but they
look like garbage right now so there's
definitely a little bit of styling that
I need to do on these now so let's
I'm going to do it right after my links
here I'll shrink this back up and what I
want to say is my site nav icons first
off I want to I want to give them a
width and right now they're just inline
elements so first I need to give them
inline block which visually won't change
anything but that's going to let me put
a width on them I don't know what what
they need
okay I'll skip the width for now and
we'll come back to the width I want them
maybe bigger I guess we can do that
first I'm font size that should make
them quite a bit bigger good I need to
push them off I don't want them stuck to
the text like that I want to put a
little bit of space so a margin on the
right side to em well way too much 1m
that's a lot better right now this is
lining up straight down the side here
and then I get this weird jagged line
all the way there and this is why I was
thinking I was going to bring in a width
so what I'm going to do now is give it a
background of pink just to show you what
the whole purpose of giving it width is
because what what's happening now is I
get this weird jagged line I don't want
I want this to be a straight line down
coming down there so on my background of
pink and let's just give this a width
I'm guessing at 1m just to see if that
works that seems to work the house is
pretty much a square that one yeah I
think though maybe I could do it a
little bit bigger 1.1 just in case I
ever had a bigger icon but that seems
the envelopes a pretty big one and
that's working well and again that just
makes it so they're all the same width
and they line up nicely now it this gets
the nice line cuz the space in between
them is consistent and I will also do a
text align to the right and obviously we
can turn off my pink background now so
this line you know these are all aligned
on the right those are all aligned on
the left and they just stand out way too
much so the same way I liked having my
border underneath to be really really
subtle I want to do the same thing with
these icons I want them to be more
subtle because they're just way too much
in your face right now so to do that I'm
going to change their color and since
it's a font it is with just the regular
color property and a nice little trick
and I think I got this off CSS tricks
and I should have thought of it way
before I read that but and I could have
used this for the border bottom too
actually but that's okay let's say 0.25
whoops not 0.25 point there we go I'm so
you can see it sort of blends in by
making it white and then just giving it
a low opacity it's going to pick up that
blue color from the background but it's
still keeping enough of them the
original color so it just gives it this
nice little subtle effect and the nice
thing is because my hover effect is so
strong such a complete change of color
it's not all of a sudden this weird blue
house on top of a yellow background it's
now a light yellow house umm I don't
find it standing out enough I'm going to
make that 40 percent maybe yeah I think
I like that better so now I get that
nice I think that looks pretty good
except because I brought that house in
that's spacing here is Gigantor now
that's way too big so that would be on
my actual site now my padding my links
the padding is on the links
the spacing on the top and bottom I like
so the two two to six and the problem is
the six on this side is massive so let's
just give that a two and let's just
write you again on the other side say
pop here that's really not too bad
hmm something seems a little off to be
honest that's me hmm I'm just not sure
here I find it looks lopsided right now
I'd almost like this you know if I put
that like able to feel like it should be
really big to try and make it look
centered or we bring it down to maybe
like a 1.5 just thinking for the space
to be somewhat equal on the two sides
obviously here it's a bit bigger maybe
this six is too big let's make that a
four yeah that looks a lot nicer cool so
that's looking pretty nice I have my
nice little effect there where I get my
ex back into my hamburger menu the drop
is working good it's looking really nice
so two things left to do the first thing
I'm going to do is just make this so
it's only looking like that at the small
sizes because I actually hate seeing
hamburger menus on desktop sites that
are designed for desktop I understand
the whole thing of its nice minimal
thing and people know to click on this
to get to the menu but when you're on a
desktop computer screen real estate is
not as important you have lots of room
to play with you have space to put in a
normal navigation you shouldn't have to
make someone click twice to get to
something user experience you're a UX
design user experience UX UX all this
stuff and you're making me click to
click and that drives me nuts I should
be able to do it in one click on a
mobile device though it makes a lot of
sense with the hamburger menu or
something that hides the menu away
because screen real-estate is super
important you can't fit a full
navigation in there it pretty much needs
to be a vertical list like this and this
takes up all the room on your screen so
in that case all for it don't mind at
all because it's just sort of a
necessary solution but on a desktop
computer whenever I see a hamburger menu
like this on a full desktop when I'm on
my computer I just find the person got a
little lazy that they didn't come up
with a different design so if you just
want to leave it like this go ahead and
leave it but just you know give in my
opinion on that one so on the large
screen we have to obviously bring in a
media query to make that work so let's
come all the way down to here and throw
in the add media and I'm just going to
put in a really really arbitrary 800
pixels for now min-width let's make it a
bit smaller 700 pixels I guess just
super arbitrary right now I I would
normally have that focus more on the
design when my design breaks I'm just
coming up with a number out of my butt
for demo purposes so do we want to do
there's a few things we want that menu
toggle to disappear obviously we don't
want to see the hamburger menu so we'll
start with that menu toggle whoops
whoops display:none because that can go
away cool and now we obviously need to
see our site nav so a site nav height we
will need to switch back to auto there
we go so we can see it cool background I
don't want to background do I need I
need to change the position let's change
the position for its position back to
relative cool and I want to take my
background off of it
background:transparent cool is there
anything else I need to change on their
float to the right
and and and and I think that's all I
need
let's stay there for now I need to
change my list items obviously so let's
say my site nav Li display:inline-block
to put them in a line padding is way too
big zero yeah pull this put some a
little bit of margin to separate them
margin no there was no padding that
didn't change anything did it margin of
zero is there a margin right now margin
of zero there's no margin either okay
hmm I guess it's all in the links but I
do want a border of none cool
then I need my site nav A's site nav a
okay padding was a padding a margin
padding zero that looks better I want to
get rid of those icons site now they
look terrible
icon display:none I like them a lot at
the small screen size I don't like them
at the big one and margin left of two M
maybe three go three cool do I need
anything else I just need to fix my
hover color I think now that looks
pretty good
I just don't want that background
showing up so nav whoops site nav
a:hover site nav a focus keep putting
capital peas there instead of my curly
braces and I'm not sure why I know
they're close to each other but don't
usually have that problem anyway
background again of transparent
SuperDuper there we go that looks
alright not super big fan of that color
but that's okay so there we go there we
go so it's
switching back and forth between the two
of them just like we wanted to good and
then that is showing up and now what I
was talking about before I'm going to
switch all that out for a cool clipping
path already so to get this to work I'm
going to make a few small changes to
what I've already done and I'll be 100%
honest with you I'm not a super
experienced with clipping paths but I've
been playing around with them a little
bit and I think they're super cool and
you can do such fun things with them
that I just couldn't resist and it's
actually something I don't remember
where I saw it and I feel really bad it
was someone who'd seen something from
dribble that had tried to recreate it
and they I don't even know if they use
the clipping path I didn't look at their
code I just saw the sort of I think it
was on reddit anyway I saw this he sort
of gave me the idea for this and I
really wanted to try it out and I think
it's going to be pretty awesome so what
I need to change is my height so my
height this open we're still going to
use the open we're going to take the
height auto off there and the height of
zero off there so we still need these
two classes but we don't need that we're
going to use clipping pad this instead
so on here what I'm going to do and I
don't know if we need the
overflow:hidden even I think we can take
that off because the clipping path
sort of takes care of that for us so a
clipping path is done with just clip
path like that and there's lots of
different ways of doing it for this one
I want to use a circle so just to show
you a bit of how it works let's just say
50 well there you go circle is working
and I can say the size of the circle
that I want so I have a circle of 50
pixels and if I don't include anything
it's just going to make if I do that it
will just include you know default
circle right there which I looks like
it's matching the total width of my
original thing and I don't need the
overflow:hidden like you can see because
it's being clipped I'm hiding everything
that's not inside that circle and what I
can add to that is at top right now I
think I need to have a size for that so
let's say 50 pixels the real so it's
putting a circle at the top right
starting at the top right and in this
case I want zero I want it to be nothing
I want to see absolutely nothing and
when I add in my open is when my
clipping path will change so clip path
is again a circle but in this time
instead of being zero pixels I think we
can just do one hundred percent at top
right and I want to keep the top right
there because I want to make sure that
it's growing and shrinking from the same
place
Oh interesting I thought a hundred
percent went big enough probably because
it's from top which what if I take that
off just for fun this is 100 percent the
circle should be the the same size as my
thing now it's just going to click in
and out so we need to add our transition
transition all ease in out five hundred
milliseconds it should who grow in and
out and it's this cool little circle
animation now the only thing that's it's
really really subtle but the center of
this I can sort of see the circle moving
out it's really small though I I think
that looks fine let's just slow it down
a bit though I'm gonna make it look like
mm I'm not sure if what I'm seeing it's
not too bad actually just there's
something about that it's giving this
weird tear droppy shape that I don't
really want um I just want to see if I
do at top right I want to make sure that
it's staying in the top right all the
time and does that change see there I
don't know if you see the difference
when I do it this way it's a slight you
can see the circle the middle of the
circle seems to be staying over here
it's this like circle that's growing out
from there
and if I take out the at top right when
I do that it has a different shape to it
the center of the circle is also
transitioning well the animation is
happening so it gives it a bit of a
different shape and I don't really like
the shape that it gives it some going to
keep the at top right and I guess we're
just going to have to make this bigger
110 mm 125 which made a lot bigger eyes
missing the whole contact 150 there we
go
it's not going to hurt anything if the
clipping path is like massively bigger
even if I was doing like five hundred
percent I'm pretty sure it wouldn't
cause any issues I don't have any
content underneath this to say that I'm
wrong but I'm pretty sure that it's it
shouldn't cause any issue at all
yeah I just like the shape of that a
little bit better and obviously that's
way too slow so we'll bring it back to a
more reasonable time frame maybe that's
too fast yeah that looks pretty good to
me now you can play around with it a
little bit but I think that's really
really cool I really like that and with
that you don't actually need them you
know where the animation itself is
coming from the transition here so you
don't need the jQuery UI anymore you can
get away with just jQuery on it and
ditch I don't need that in there anymore
so even close there we go
it's working like a charm I don't know I
just like that because it gives us a bit
something different it's a little bit
more unique it looks a little bit nicer
if you are doing that just be careful I
do have autoprefixer on here with the
clipping path I would assume that you
need to and I use an autoprefixer all
the time yeah you're going to need some
prefixes on some of this stuff to
actually make sure it works in all your
browsers so just watch out for that um
so yeah that's it for this video guys I
hope you liked it and oh no I didn't
think of that
ah if this is open then it works but if
it's closed
oh no okay that's okay we just have to
make sure a good thing I caught that
right at the end there is what to say
that's the end of the video but Bob menu
site nav display blog hopefully fixes
this no because it's being clipped how
did I not think of that um I need to
reset the clipping path clip path
initiative would that work that would
work
cool okay good thing I noticed that so
definitely make sure that's on because
then again most people probably aren't
changing their screen sizes randomly but
just in case someone opens your site big
and then shrinks it down because they're
you know having two windows open at the
same time in your whole navigation would
disappear that would be pretty terrible
so clip path initial you can probably
even do it none on there I'd never even
tried that it also seems to work I'm
split initial which is probably none so
it's just resetting the clipping path
just to make sure it's still working
that's good if it's open I still have
that if it's closed there we go okay so
we're all good now except I just
realized that background colors
transitioning which is kind of nasty
okay we need to fix that sorry guys I'm
running into a whole bunch of things I
keep trying to sign off on this video
and I just can't end it yet
this transition shouldn't be
transitioning everything's it's
transitioning the background color it
should be transitioning the clip path
only there we go
that background color is not
transitioning back and forth that's
still working hmm I thought I saw
something weird I was just the color
change okay
I do believe that's it I finally think
it is done so I really hope you enjoyed

have any questions about what I've done

- awesome or if you've never used a
clipping path and you're running into
some troubles just let me know and I'll
be glad to help out and if you've made
