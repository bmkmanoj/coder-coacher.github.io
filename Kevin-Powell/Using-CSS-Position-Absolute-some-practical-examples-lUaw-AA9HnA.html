basics of position relative and position
absolute in the comments a number of
people said it'd be useful to know not
only how it works but when to use
position absolute so that's what this
video is about now I'm not gonna be
covering everything but just a few of
the possible use cases of position
absolute the things I use it for the
most or pseudo elements so I'm doing a
few of them here as decorative elements
just to you know show how we can move
different things around and some cool
tricks to get things to go exactly where
you want them to be and other times I do
it where I just want to really position
something specifically to create
overlapping content and all of that and
I think we can cover all of that with
this card now I'm going over the top a
bit here I'm adding some extra stuff
that I wouldn't normally do just a
really bang home the point and to make
it more fun and get some cool little
other tips and tricks along the way you
know and some you know cool box shadow
stuff and all of that cuz well why not
so before I get starting this I am doing
this in code pens but you can check out
that code pen down below the link for it
is in the description you can play
around with the code a little bit and
all of that and if you're brand new here
my name is Kevin and I bring videos like
this every single week so please
consider subscribing now let's jump
right into it what I'm gonna do now is
I'm just bringing a simple card here so
a div class card so inside of here I'm
gonna want my image and I'm gonna give
this one a card image like that and the
source of it so the class is card
underscore underscore image and I'm
using the BEM naming conventions for
this I just find it makes a lot of sense
what I'm going to do here so my source
is just gonna be a muse on splash dot it
which is just a placeholder service and
let's go with I don't know I don't know
why 705 because 705 is a nice number and
that is a nice picture when you do this
whatever numbers you put it just
randomly generates a picture so you
don't like the picture you just change
the numbers and you know change about
one pixel even and you'll get a
different picture so that can be handy
to know that's we don't really need this
that's just me or we don't need this so
big right now so we can see we have my
image
and the other thing I'm gonna want in
here is a card body so this is gonna be
the main text area so this is the body's
gonna hold my text and I'm gonna want
two things let's give it a card title
and a card text and if you're don't know
what I'm doing here this is called Emmet
um it's built into code pen it's also
built into things like vs code and you
can add it as a package to things like
atom and sublime text so basically it's
a ch3 dot so class of card title plus a
card text that should probably be a
paragraph before I keep going to a
paragraph with a class of card text I
push tab at the end here and it turns
all of that into some nice little markup
right there so I'm not gonna be too
original with this this is a card and I
have a little bit of lorem ipsum just
saved off-screen so I'll drop that lorem
ipsum in there and we start getting our
text which is just showing up down at
the bottom here and as far as the markup
that's all we need so it's my card I
have an image at the top and then I have
a div that has my title and my text
inside of it there so we can get rid of
all that yeah I'm interesting that make
that all go away so there's a few
different things we're gonna want to do
right off the start um so let's bring in
our card now let's just give this a whit
right off the bat of like I don't know
40% just of my window because we don't
want to be the full size I need my image
to be smaller obviously I'm on my card
I'm gonna give this a position
position:relative and I'll come back to
this in a second since it is a focus on
position:absolute let's fix up my image
now so my it was card image so on my
card image I want to do a
position:absolute and I want to give it
a width of 100% and a height of 100
percent now one advantage of using
position:absolute is the heights are
actually going to work properly whereas
if you're not using position:absolute if
you don't have a position
on it the height sort of might not do
what you're expecting it to so this will
be a height of a hundred percent of its
parent now if I took off this position
you'll see that my image is actually
really big it's getting a height that is
100 percent of my screen of the browser
window here so this is getting a hundred
percent height of that because the
position:absolute is looking for the
nearest parent element that has a
position on it so it's looking for here
this doesn't have a position on it so
then it's going up to the body and it's
defaulting at the body so it's matching
the height of my body and it's the same
with the top left right and all of that
it's always going to fall back to
whatever the closest parent container or
div is that has a just that it's gonna
fall back to the closest parent that has
a position on it so position relative
and that's even if the parent had a
position:absolute or anything else I
didn't make that mistake where I only
mentioned relative in my last video and
as a few of you hopefully pointed out
it's not only position relative this
will work even if this was position
absolute um this is still going to be
relative to this because this has a
position on it but I'm gonna leave it
like that
alrighty so one cool thing that we can
do on this as well is we can give this
an object fit of cover and this is sort
of like doing a background background
size cover so without that it's actually
stretching my image to fit in that space
so it's squishing it all the way down
right now so my object fit cover will
just make it exactly like a background
position cover it would do it's based on
this width and height so because it's
gonna set a width and a height on my
image which is matching the size of my
card right now and then it's going to
cover it in that space so it's looking
at its own width here which is an
important thing to remember with it the
other thing is I do want this behind
everything else I'm gonna give it a Zed
index of negative one just to push it
backwards it's hard to see but my text
is now on top of it so the negative one
is working with the position you can't
use as ENDEX without position and this
is just pushing it
words behind everything else let's come
on with my card body next and we'll
scroll down a bit well I'm all over the
place card body and let's give this a
background of I don't know RGBA I want
black so and this right or no we'll try
point five and we want a color of white
so we can actually see my text on there
um I'm gonna leave this for a second and
we'll come back card title and card text
can have a margin of zero thank you very
much good good good um so my card body
should have some padding on it so let's
do padding of I'm gonna do two Ram
usually I would use an M on this we're
going to come back to why I'm using R M
shortly to enough will stick uh maybe
we'll try three that's not too bad okay
I sort of like that so there's my card I
think it's looking pretty good I do need
to fix up my font sizes and everything
let's hurry up on our way through that
so my card title font size let's try
three and see what happens that looks
pretty good I'm gonna give it a line
height I've run one just cuz if it does
break onto two lines if I don't have
that it'd probably be really big yeah
that doesn't look so nice so I just want
to tighten that up a little bit um
actually I'm gonna give it a margin
bottom actually on here of like 0.5 in
that's not too bad so here I'm using MS
and so it's gonna be relative to the
size of the font so it's roughly half
the height of the font is the space
underneath okay I'm gonna leave that
like that for now we're gonna come back
to this and do some positioning on the
title as well but now I want my text
what do I need to do to my text
I don't need to do anything right now
we'll come back to that once we've
designed a little bit more I think
because it's looking okay so let's come
all the way back up to here we have my
card I'm gonna do my before and my card
after so on both of these and pseudo
elements I eat often often often amusing
position:absolute on them so I'm gonna
do a content on there if you don't know
a lot about pseudo elements I do have a
little series on those that look at how
they work so you can check that out
there should be a card on the screen now
so I'm gonna do a position:absolute on
these as well and let's give them a
border one pixel solid white now we
can't see them yet because they don't
actually have any size I'm just I want
them all these are just things they're
gonna share and I'm doing
position:absolute on them because I want
to position them inside of my card and I
know my card has a position:relative on
it so this is gonna let me just position
it where I want in there so let's take
advantage of the fact that we can do
that so we'll start with my before
pretty much I want this to come on this
side up and down so I'm gonna give it a
top whoops let's give it a top of 1m a
bottom of 1m and a right oh and this
should be REMS this is why I was using
the REM before actually and a right of
let's do one room and then we go we get
this nice sort of straight down line
right there so it's one pixel thick
because it's set on a border its top is
one rep so it's top is this one Ram here
which is about 16 pixels same on the
bottom and same on the side here so we
have the equal spacing all the way
around now the reason I went with bream
on my padding is because it's gonna let
me control exactly where I want this a
little bit easier just by using REMS
here as well you could be using pixels
on all of this if you're more
comfortable with that but I am very used
to using M's and REMS so minister to
stick with it on this one so I knew that
and
to fix these up because these will not
be positioned where I want them but
after so this one we want it to go a
list way so to do something like that
I'm going to do a bottom of one rim and
then the left of one Ram and a right of
one rim and there we go it sort of
frames off the card a little bit and I
sort of like that now I think what I'm
going to do is on my card text here do a
text align right instead of left so it
sort of squares up with that and that
doesn't look too bad now we can do some
different things with this for sure so
I'm going to come back up to where these
are I sort of like how that's looking
right now though I might leave it like
that I was originally gonna have them
sort of crossing a little bit but if you
wanted to do that it would just mean so
my top is one rim my bottom is one rim
so say my bottom extended a little bit
let's do like a point five so it's gonna
extend down a little more and then this
one my right side so the right side I
could do a point five on that too I'm
just going to extend that way and then
it sort of gives this list little X type
thing now I don't really like that so
I'm going to move these I'm gonna move
that up a little bit bottom then I can
stay at one the right can stay at one
and I want to move top bottom right one
point five there we go I think that
looks a little bit nicer if they're
crossing but I'm not actually gonna have
them cross I changed my mind on that now
so let's go back I think I'm just gonna
leave it like that and once I put in a
bit more here we can always revisit and
see if we actually want to change that
all right that's a with pseudo elements
like that's a really basic easy way to
use the positioning to get things where
you want them to go now another way you
can do it is
I'm gonna do this in a bit of a fun way
I think I'm gonna add in some
positioning on my actual title here and
we're gonna be using some absolute
positioning and some pseudo elements on
this one as well so let's go and find my
title so there's my title so what I want
is my card
title before and once again content will
be something like that
and I'm gonna want to do some
position:absolute on this to get it to
go exactly where I want it to and now if
I'm doing a position:absolute on this it
means I probably want the parent element
to be a position:relative so let's just
give this a background background of
yellow and I'm just going to give this
again a height of 100 percent just to
highlight with of 100% just to show why
I'm doing it like this so because this
is position:absolute and this is
positioned relative this is being
positioned relative to the title so
that's where my text was this is the div
the card title right here if I took this
off now it's getting the width and the
height of the card itself and if I
needed to I could do like a top:0 left:0
and I can actually have it overlay
directly on top of all the stuff I've
already done so maybe you want to do
something like that maybe you don't want
this you don't want to be relative to
that you actually want it to be relative
to the whole things you need to fill up
a background or something like that and
in that case that's fine that might be
exactly what you want but in this case
that's not what I want so I'm going to
add in my position relative right there
so it's just going like do that now one
funny thing here is if I come on this
and I do is add index of negative one
like it did before because I wanted
things to get pushed in the background
it's on top of the other negative one
thing but it's actually behind that
background so I'm losing my bright color
which stinks that's not what I want so
I'm not gonna put my Zed index on here
what I'm gonna do is actually come on my
card title itself
and we do a z-index on here just one so
what this is doing is it's pulling the
whole card title upwards because I have
a position:relative it's taking the
whole thing and it's pulling that sort
of on to its own layer it's pulling it
away and putting it onto its own layer
and then I can use my Zed index of
negative 1 on this and it layers it the
way I needed to it's a little bit weird
a hundred percent but pretty much
everything was sort of sitting on its
own thing and then the title was getting
pushed backwards one a little bit and it
was going behind things so now what I'm
doing is my card titles getting pulled
up and by giving it the
position:relative and a Zed index and
then it's pretty much because I'm giving
the parent the Zed index that this is
working out and we can't read my text so
let's give this a color black yeah so we
can actually read it because that would
help now we can actually start
positioning this where we need it to be
um if I want this to stick out the side
here what we can do is I know that my
padding on the side here is three R M
right and this is again one of the
reasons I set things in R M is just
because it makes it a lot easier when
I'm want to position everything in here
so because I know this is three R M on
my left here if I actually did this as a
start with negative three RAM and it
should line up perfectly so it's pulling
it back that distance that was my
padding so now it's lining up exactly
where I want and if I want it to hang
off the side here I could just make this
a bigger number say negative five and
then it's gonna stick out the the side a
little bit my top let's make the top a
little bit bigger 0.1 m I'm using M now
so it's relative to the font size and
actually I should be a negative not a
positive so it actually moves up and
then a bottom
of negative 0.1 m oh I have a height on
this I'm going to take do I even need a
whiff yeah I mean I mean I'm gonna leave
my width for the moment and my bottom
looks like it should be a little bit
bigger just to balance it okay so I'm
pretty happy with that
now for the width as well I want it to
be a very specific size I wanted to keep
I wanted to go to originally where it
was I wanted to stop like I wanted to
stop here with the lining up with this
text here so how can I do that because I
pulled it negative 4 or negative 5 rim
this way how can I make sure that the
width is exactly that I'm gonna use the
calc function which is really really
awesome so CSS calc is really cool lets
you do calculations I'm going to 100%
and +5 REM and it's gonna line up
perfectly so it's doing the hundred
percent of the the width of my card
title which and then it's adding an
extra 5 REM to it so it's compensating
for this space here it's pulling it with
that way there so I'm adding the exactly
what I need which is really cool that I
can do something like that now the last
thing I want to do in here is actually
want to make it look like it's going if
there's like a slice and it's going
underneath my card here so to do that
I'm gonna use a box shadow box shadow
and um for this let's start just by
making a box shadow a 0 0 10 pixels 0
black let's just see what that so there
we go we got like a pretty standard
little drop shadow on it but I don't
want it to be on the outside like that
so I can just come to the front and
write an inset and it's gonna pull
itself to the inside like that so that's
really useful except to really make this
work properly I only want the shadow to
be on this side I don't want this to be
anywhere else so how can I do that well
it's not that bad what I'm going to do
is play around with a few of these
values so the first thing I want to do
is make sure that it's positioned sort
of where I want so what I'm gonna do is
do a negative
try 15 and see what happens so I'm
pretty much pulling my shadow to the
left my horizontal offset is just
getting pulled 15 pixels towards the
left so you can see there's a lot more
shadow here and this shadow is started
to disappear now the one problem with
this is I'm left with some shadow on the
top and some shadow on the bottom which
I don't want so that's where this comes
in and this is the one that a lot of
people forget about this is the spread
and so a spread means how far do I go
until I start my stuff start my thing so
if I did 10 pixels it's gonna go 10
pixels of solid black and then it's
gonna start doing a bit of a shadow now
that's the opposite of what I want so
you can sort of get an idea of what I
want I'm gonna do a negative here and it
does the opposite and I'm very purposely
making these numbers equal to each other
I want to make sure that there's nothing
here so my 10 pixels of blur is stopping
right before so the negative 10 pulls it
back 10 pixels and then it starts to
come in so the only thing that's left is
about 5 pixels of shadow right here and
that's it I'm going to change this color
a little bit just because I find it's a
little too dark so we're going to do an
RGBA and we'll go with black I don't
know we'll try 0.5 that looks a little
bit nicer so already it looks like it's
sort of going into the card it'd be
really cool if we could have it sticking
out on this side and I also need to
balance this off because it's not in the
middle of this space Apple will come
back to that after when we fine-tune
this um see I want the the rest of the
cards sticking out or the rest of the
card the rest of this yellow thing to
really complete the look to be sticking
it on that side so guess what we need
another suit element and more
positioning so card title after so what
can we do to this thing we can do
content because we have to
and we can do a position:absolute
because I want to be able to position it
exactly where I want and now me is the
same top and bottom that I use before I
could probably should combine these into
a single selector for some of these
things that are repeating just because
it would be better practice but I'm
gonna do it this way anyway okay how big
do we want width I don't know let's just
do two rim just because I don't know how
big to make it am background I'm gonna
make it pink now just so we can see
where it is and I'll change over to
yellow after that's right be a bit
bigger let's make that three okay we can
always fine tune that so I want it to be
exactly here and if I did something like
I like keeping all these together top
bottom and we'll go with the left if I
did a left zero it's just gonna go to
there so if I did even the left 100%
it's gonna go to right where that
finishes so it's pushing the left side a
hundred percent of the way over and it's
lining up with where the original thing
is finishing I need to move it over even
more than that well luckily I know
exactly how big this space is so just
like before I can do it calc 100% plus
three around because I know that I have
exactly three rim of padding so it's
pushing it over exactly three R M plus a
hundred percent so it's moving to here
plus three R M it goes exactly where I
wanted it to and now we can make that
back to yellow and that's pretty cool I
could also take this same box shadow
that I had on that and put it on here
now I don't want the exact same box
shadow because that looks weird so I
just need to change this from negative
15 to i positive 15 and it will jump to
the other side looks a little bit too
much on this one for some reason I'm
actually going to make this a little bit
smaller
just to make it a bit more subtle now
one thing is if this is gonna have a
shadow on it that means there is some
sort of light on this so I think the
whole card itself should also get a bit
of a shadow so let's just go find my
whole card so box shadow this one I'm
gonna go pretty simple I'm gonna do like
a zero zero because I don't want any
offset we'll do like a 25 pixel blur
like that our thing and then zero and
then our GBA and I want this to be
pretty subtle 0.25 maybe 0.35 so it's
not I want this to be a bigger blur
because it's farther back sort of like
this is closer to the light source than
however you know or these are closer to
each other and this might be a bit
farther off I just want to really subtle
shadow more or less that's just there a
little little little bit I guess ideally
this would also have a shadow on it but
that would cause a bit more problem so
we'll stick with it just like this so
I'm pretty happy with all of that I just
want to fix the positioning of these
lines because it's bugging me that this
space is bigger than that space so let's
go and do that so here is those ones so
top I'm gonna just actually change all
of these to 1.5 and it's gonna copy I
think if they're all changed 1.5 it's
gonna be exactly what I want there we go
awesome I'm pretty happy with that and
one nice thing with this is as soon as
the text gets there because this is
reaching the 100% part it's just gonna
fall like that and it works beautifully
on multiple lines doesn't matter what we
have it should always work until it
starts getting too narrow and the text
will cause some issues but overall it
should pretty much work at any screen
size and all of that so yeah if you're
using position:absolute properly you
shouldn't and run into any issues with
responsiveness or anything like that if
you're using it in ways that it's not
really meant to be used then you might
run into some issues though so you just
got to be careful but in general design
I'm using it for all the time or here
where I'm bringing my picture into the
background of something especially now
with that object fit you can do it now
just be careful with object fit browser
support you might want to check it out
first have no promises on that one
but yeah that's there there's the card I
hope you liked it and if you did like
