video we are going to be looking at a
few things I'm going to start finally
building my media queries and I'm going
to be making it work a lot nicer on
desktop I was planning on doing one long
video but it turned into a really long
video so I'm breaking it up into two
videos instead in this video the first
thing I'm going to do is start building
out my grid and I'm gonna do that with
the sales points section working on my
media queries on that and in my grid
then I'm gonna jump up to the hero area
and work on the hero area and with that
I'm using some vmon and I think oh maybe
man maybe some v-max in there as well to
get my spacing alright so that was
pretty fun so then I finished the whole
thing off by taking a look at the promo
section down a little bit lower down and
that's it for this video let's jump
right into it now
so I think what the easiest thing to do
is going to be to build out a bit of a
grid system to get this thing started
because here I have these three columns
here which aren't working as three
columns and then over here I have this
which is gonna have to be two columns
this is not currently on this is only
going to appear at larger screen sizes
so let's jump in and work on the grid
system a little bit and see if we can't
get it looking a little bit better
so let's pull that up there and let's
get the browser opened and I've been
doing this whole thing in responsive
mode and I can turn that off now I want
a full screen I'm gonna have to do some
work in my HTML I think also in this one
as I go along so if we remember I have
set up this grid here and I'm gonna have
to open up my grid file oops let's bring
this up to the top I can close my colors
and my footer and my call to action and
my type for now I might have to jump
back into those so my grid is pretty
much is doing a display flex and it's
making sure that things wrap around
which is stopping these from going next
to each other I haven't set that up with
anything so actually let's do that now
so actually let's do this one first and
then we'll jump back up to the top if I
look down here let's go find those not
my hero sales points I have column
column column so what I'm going to have
to do now is build in my media query
yeah so let's just jump in right there
I'm gonna say at media min-width 725
pixels 725 is super arbitrary I am
describing that number at random and
it's just because that's sort of where I
don't like what the site looks like
anymore as they've been going through
I've been paying attention and I just in
that 700 to 750 range I found things
started getting on ugly well I forgot to
put padding there so yeah I find these
are getting really long now they're
taking up too much space I'd prefer now
if those actually fell into columns so
around this range a lot of people like
building media queries around specific
devices the iPhone 2 ipad 2
I don't know you know the the laptop you
know the iMac to the the Mac or whatever
it is is very popular but there's so
many bloody devices out there not
everyone's on an iPhone just because you
are doesn't mean everyone else is and
building it around those big points to
me doesn't make much sense you should be
building around where your site is
breaking and not around one specific
device or set of devices in this case my
sites not really broken at any point
exactly it just starts looking ugly so
that's sort of broken in my opinion so
at seven twenty five is where I've
decided my site is breaking I'm not
gonna have some at 725 another set at
seven thirty and other set at seven
thirty five I'm going to stick with as
many as possible just with that one
number yeah so let's get in there so the
first thing we have to do is actually
make these column thirds so we'll say
column one third we'll just copy that on
all of them
copy column one third and column one
third and what's my column one third
going to do column one whoops one three
is going to get a flex basis of thirty
three point three three three three
percent I'm too small so that should now
there we go
it's breaking oh we're gonna have to fix
that my media queries to I'll get back
to that after the ugly thing is right
now they're really they kind of stick
together there's no space between them
so on my actual columns we build some
padding into these so what are we going
to do we are going to build let's say
padding:0 top and bottom 0.5 M right and
left actually we can make that a bit
bigger maybe I'm just thinking anyway
there we go that looks better we have a
little bit of space always between them
now and the only thing I'm going to add
to this is what do I want to do I want
to say that my
whoops and first of type first of type
yes my first of type has a padding left
of zero and I can just copy that whole
thing and the last of type has a padding
right of zero so anytime there's a
column the first column will not have
any padding on the left and the last
column will not have any padding on the
right those maybe should be built into
the media query though right
do not screw up alignment column yeah I
know if I look at this column yeah
that's gonna screw up the alignment a
little bit so these should actually be
built also into that media query and
this is versus does come in handy at
media min width of 725 pixels and I can
just tap those over and now they're part
of the media query so that looks
properly centered now but when I get to
this now the padding will all be set up
properly so super I need to do the same
thing for a my padding top I think
that's just in my promo section though
right where's my layout home promo no it
wasn't in home promo close you
where was it then it wasn't in home
promo what's giving me that space on top
oh my said I'm thinking home from
promote your app but I'm in my sales
points sales points yeah so in here I'm
going to do an ad media I'm in with 725
pixels
and first of type margin-top of zero
perfect dough and actually which is also
bringing oh no that's it
super that looks perfect dough I'm happy
with that good good good
so let's come up to here now just I
wanted to do that with those three just
to sort of get that going and get the
feel of everything let's jump up to here
now I'm going to go to my base my base
stats ass so I can turn on my large
screen so my large screen starts at
media min width of 750 pixels display a
block so it should turn back on great
except obviously that's not where I want
this to be I want this to be up and next
to there instead so let's do that
I'm gonna probably let's go look at how
this is done actually I have a column
and this will actually be a column
column one three which won't really
change much it's just gonna make my
image a bit smaller this one will be a
column two whoops
two thirds to two two to two thirds safe
so let's go check that out hero
bring you up to the top my hero so now
we're not my hero what am i I will have
to make some changes to this though so
we'll leave that open go back to grid I
have a column 2/3 flex basis of 66.6 66%
haha there we go
so that right away looks a lot better
and then it disappears and reappears but
I will definitely in my hero need to
make some adjustments now so if we open
up my Photoshop file
this is left-aligned text and you can
see my phone's overflowing at the bottom
a little bit so I'm gonna have to play
with my padding and all of that um
so add media I'm in width of 725 pixels
I am going to say what did I call that
one with the phone in it there's no I
have my hero image let's say that my
hero image has a marred I don't really
like negative margins I want to be a
little bit higher up so actually before
or actually I'm doing this wrong anyway
no it's okay um my hero let's get ready
here oh I'm intranet hero will have a
text-align:left I'm just going to do
this instead margin top of 3m whoops no
no no back back back Save silly silly
silly I want that on my a zero text I'm
just trying to think from a media query
because this is I don't want ya I'm
gonna say I'm gonna copy this copy I'm
gonna say my hero text margin top of 3m
that looks better and the reason I'm
doing it this way where I've hero text
then the media query is just the way
that SAS handles the indentation system
if I had just this here like that the
CSS that that would output would look
something like this where would
put zero zero text and then do the
margin-top on that and I don't want this
best suffice it e on here I don't want
this sort of defeats the whole purpose
of giving everything a class name you
it's this will probably always be in
here but just you know I don't want to
take any chances I don't like working
that way I think it creates hard to
maintain text and it's super easy to go
down a rabbit hole on that this makes it
a lot easier to maintain and if ever I
did need to just change something on my
regular hero text it would be super easy
to come in and do now by itself I need
to change the color of this for some
reason I just come in here and I can
change the color on it so I find this a
lot easier to maintain personally so
there we go
that's what I'm going to do padding
bottom of zero and I actually want to
let's close this because that's not what
it will look like I'm gonna change the
overall height of this I think I'm
thinking hey there's my hero text here
text margin top will be five viewport
min does that make sense or is it max
V Max that way as this gets bigger and
bigger and bigger see what's moving down
I want them bigger than that even though
let's say that's ten that way as the
screen gets bigger and smaller and
bigger and smaller it sort of adapts and
sort of stays centered it's not perfect
but it's not too bad
that actually looks a lot better Wow I
like that so it's saying it's it's
keeping everything balanced a little bit
more I really like these the using V min
and V Max for situations like this they
can be super useful so I'm happy I
finally figured out how I want to set
that up I just want to pull this up a
little bit
without necessarily giving it a specific
height um just tuck it in a tad but you
can easily run into issues with this
let's just say I want to do a height of
90 viewport max I'm in either way it's
gonna look weird right that's actually
okay that's okay that's okay that's okay
that's okay that's okay it looks gonna
boring actually right now way I'm gonna
force that to break as well I don't like
that it's on the next level it's driving
me nuts that's okay that's okay and my
phone's gonna it's okay actually I could
even make this a little bit smaller
probably let's go with 80 it should be
okay now the only time this could cause
an issue and will cause an issue
actually I'm sure because I'm wearing
them in yeah just like this when the
viewport gets tiny so I could give this
a min height of course min height but
what would my minimum height be my
minimum height should be
let's 800 pixels why is this left
aligned but I have no phone did I do
those at different break points 725 725
whoops
725 so that's okay that's okay it's has
a bit of scroll but that's okay is that
okay I'm gonna do that well it's really
you know adjust only when I get it much
bigger and I do that you can see it's
adjusting to the size of my screen but
at one point it stops getting smaller
because I don't want it stuff to overlap
and yet really awkward-looking
so I think that makes a lot of sense so
there we go that's done this is done
this one is we have a couple of column
halves there right so we're gonna jump
down to here let's just open up
Photoshop and take a quick look
yep so I have two halves that I need to
deal with there so that's nice and easy
we're gonna keep plugging away at this
range jump back over to my grid we're
gonna keep this up on the screen and I'm
gonna keep flying through this one third
one third column background primary so
this one is my let's get rid of that
space this one is my column one half
whoops
copy that and this image box which might
end up changing but that's also going to
be my column one half that can go here
column one half is a flex basis of 50%
awesome not awesome but what what oh no
my title box is flexing crud oh okay so
I think because I could fit you know son
this is flexing and it's going all crazy
this has the translate on it so it's
shifting down 50% of its height and
don't know quite why the Oh cuz it was
matching this one because everything's
flexing this is matching the height of
that one cuz they're next to each other
and that's just causing all sorts of
weird stuff to happen and I'm actually
wondering if I need that title box
inside my grid or
if I can move my grid over to here would
that make it work yes except now that's
way too big I may just do an inspector
on this I want to check I might have
broken what this was like at the smaller
size no that's still working properly at
the smaller sizes except my padding
bottom
I broke something along the way but oh I
didn't know that's in my media query
what's going on what happened to my
padding on that that's even was that
wasn't that in my B D G Prime a oh no my
columns padding is breaking at all
because this is in my base I could have
my grid come before my base where's my
grid then where's my base Oh cuz that's
my base styles and that's in my layout
hmm hmm I'm just wondering if I should
put an important to hate putting
important on anything whatsoever oh I
didn't think of that that's a problem
for my grid I'm actually gonna move
where my grid is then I know it's a
layout item but I want to be able to
overwrite the padding on it anywhere I
need to so I'm just gonna pop that up
there cuz that was gonna cause all sorts
of problems okay and that's more or less
working I just want to give that a max
width actually which title box right so
that would have been under typography my
title box should have a max width
of 90% and I know I already started
building in some media queries there at
media min-width of 750 25 pixels
I like spacing these out just a bit more
so there we go
max width I don't even think I want this
as a percentage max width of say 700
pixels much better I don't want that to
stretch all the way across the screen I
want that just to lock in place
SuperDuper that's a lot better this this
image is obviously having some issues
and I was a little bit worried about
that I sort of assumed that would happen
and I also have some problems with this
box and everything was that Center
aligned no and the left align on that I
want that to be left aligned and my
image isn't taking up the whole space
let's get rid of this there's some
padding and because it's an image it
gets that little space on the bottom the
space and the bottom is easy enough to
fix but the padding issue and the left
is not as easy to fix so I'm gonna make
this a background image I had a feeling
I might do that and I also need to fix
up some of the spacing okey-dokey
so what are we gonna do first let's fix
up the spacing on that blue one and move
this a little bit bigger and make this
smaller as we can so my blue box is
my base my BG primary see I want to
leave that alone I don't want to start
playing with that now I'm gonna get into
Jesus this is where things not a sale
point promo title box column BG primary
is all I put on that name okay let's go
over to my promo file where I have
nothing home promo which was empty what
I want to do I'm gonna do it like this
for now promo BG primary which I'm
usually avoiding at all cost I just
talked about avoiding that at all cost
but text-align:left padding:10px evan %
that looks better
padding top of 10m too much
5m 7.5 m right in the middle booyaka or
actually yeah I'm gonna have to have
more space on the top than the bottom
that's fine how did it look in Photoshop
yeah you have to have more space on the
top than on the bottom and bottom
spacing was a little bit bigger though
having let's just say padding-bottom 7.5
it you know what we'll do that
mmm yep we'll do that and you see this
is where the I had a feeling the picture
would cause all sorts of weird issues so
my picture I don't like having I don't
have any classes on that I don't like
having an empty div like this that
doesn't actually have any content in it
but I'm going to do it anyway
that was my image box background is URL
of URL of that I just for fun I did
phone in hand JPEG dot dot paste so
background size would be cover and
background position would be Center and
then now that's perfectly responsive and
it will always work just fine and that
was the solution I had a feeling I was
going to do but I wanted to see if I
could avoid it thank you so much for
watching this video that's it that's the
end of this one I hope you liked it in

the site so I'm gonna do they call to
action the footer and then at the very
end go all the way up and do the
navigation just because I completely
forgotten to do that from the beginning
so I hope you liked the video if you did
