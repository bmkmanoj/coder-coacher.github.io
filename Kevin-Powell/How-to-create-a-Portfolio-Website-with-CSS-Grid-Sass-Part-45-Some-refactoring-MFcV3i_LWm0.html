bonus it's a little correction video I
guess we could say so there will be
another video coming out tomorrow so you
can see this is actually on Tuesday this
one's coming up which is a little weird
if you're watching them live oh that is
now what I realized is I'm a maybe what
we could call a little bit of a mistake
with my extends here and I shouldn't
have done placeholders with extends they
do work and they are fine but there's a
couple of problems so what I'm going to
do is let's say I take this container
here and I actually put it in a media
query I'm gonna hit save on that and
actually let's just look at here and
you'll see that I got an error so a bla
you may not extend an outer selector
within a media media query it's pretty
much what it's saying this can also
happen I'm it's actually letting me do
it inside of my supports but it's quite
possibly you get an error on that too
and I don't want to run into this
problem so this video is all about
refract during our code a little bit to
make it a bit more maintainable so I'm
gonna take my placeholders file here and
actually this close that the other thing
actually just before I keep going is
because I'm using them as extends it is
pumping this out at the top here and
extends can also be really dangerous to
use I still think they're really cool
and I like them but I'm going to switch
these over so I'm gonna rename this file
so placeholders is going to become
mix-ins and what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to turn both of these into a mixin
not very hard to do I'm just gonna do at
mixing container and the only thing is
here I am going to make it so I can
optionally choose both a width and a max
width so with this what we can do is we
can say that I have a we're going to do
with
and my width is going to be by default
90% and we're also going to have a max
width whoops
sorry max width which will default to
the 50m that we're already using but
this lets me change it around so if I
have I don't need this semi colon there
so if I save that and let's go back to
above me and instead of saying at
container I'm gonna do include container
and let's just see
I just saved my file oh I didn't update
everything here um is it this all that I
want yep this is gonna get changed to
mix-ins
so just to make sure that it is actually
working so that just recompiled my CSS
so if I come and I look I can see that
my container still is working so there's
a few advantages of doing it this way
one of them is that I can control these
separately if I need to so if I want to
container I want it to work exactly the
same I just maybe want to change my max
width to something else I could do
container and then say on here my max
width is I don't know we'll do 20 I'm
just make it really small so we can see
a big difference so I'm gonna do that
I'm gonna save and now when I get bigger
that's stopping at 20 M Oh guys I need
to change these this should be I'm going
to do that I have to include it here too
with copy and this one will be my max
width so now that should actually be
working so let's double it double check
there we go now it's only 20 M that
works more sense and then as it gets
smaller
well it's smaller its maximum - 20 M so
if I come back to here and say I make
that 40 now it's going and if I don't
include it at all because I did put
you fault in there it's still going to
work it's just gonna stop at the 50 M
that I wanted it originally to stop at
okay and as I was mentioning when I ran
into that problem what we can also do
with this is I can include it in media
queries and other stuff so the same with
my clear fix let's come and change this
so this is going to be at mix in clear
fix I'm not sure if I need anything in
there so we're just gonna hit save on
that I just need to recompile my sass so
I'm just gonna save that one too and of
course here I'm getting an error that
I'm trying to use a clear fix line four
of about me so let's go find line four
of about me so this should be include
save that everything's compiling
properly now and again that clear fix is
just for my fallback my float fallback
that I was using but it should all be
working just fine now I don't think I
need to have anything else and again
this is just in case I only need to be
using this inside of a media query so
this is gonna let that work without any
issues so just a nice quick video I hope
it makes a lot of sense if you have any
questions about any of this just let me
know of course and we're gonna be back
on track tomorrow with a video but until
then don't forget to make your corner
the internet just a little bit more
