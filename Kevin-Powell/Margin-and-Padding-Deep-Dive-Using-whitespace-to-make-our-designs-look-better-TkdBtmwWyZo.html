of this series we're looking at a deep
dive into margins and padding's we've
looked at all the weird behaviors and
how they work and all of that and now I
want to look at how you can use them
effectively to make a better looking
design white spacer which is pretty much
empty space in the design world is one
of the most important concepts on making
a design go from looks okay it Wow look
at that really awesome design and a lot
of people don't leverage it the right
way I see a lot of especially developers
but even designers who don't really push
it enough and don't create a nice
balance between it so what this video is
we're gonna be building a little
ecommerce type card pop-up thing that
you might get for a check out and well
I'm gonna be building the whole thing
from scratch so we're gonna get into the
whole coding thing I'm gonna put more
emphasis on the margins and padding and
how I'm using them in the thinking
that's going on behind creating the
white space and why I want more space
here and less space there and along the
way which one am i using my using margin
or am I using padding so let's go see
how we can make our websites really
shine okay so here we are in code n like
usual I will be sharing this with you
guys and the link the description will
be down below so you can follow that or
go check that out once this is all done
so basically we're going to make a
pretty simple card here it's like an
e-commerce style card so let's go take a
look and we're going to do a div class
card I will close that off close div and
now I'm gonna be using the BEM style of
naming it's something I want to be
trying to do a little bit my naming
conventions I am and to happy with in it
I don't like necessarily the double
underscore if you're not familiar with
the BEM naming convention so I'll put a
link to that in the description below as
well where you can check it out a little
bit more so I have my div class card and
then we're going to have inside of there
and a div class of what are we gonna
call it it's gonna be for my image so I
guess it will be card
image so basically it's just anything
that's inside my card gets the double
underscore and it's just to say that
this is going to be part of this you
know it's it's something that belongs
inside of my card cool and I'm wondering
if I should call that image container
instead of image because this isn't the
image itself image container and then in
here we'll have my actual image so I'm
just going to do it the fast way there
and we're just going to use an unsplash
filler something image so I can do it
like this and just put on splash it I
don't know exactly how big we need so
I'm just gonna throw that in there for
now and we should see there we go that's
about the size I want whatever we don't
need a description at the moment okay so
we have an image that's gonna be at the
top of our cart and then we have the
content the actual regular content
so we'll do a div class equals and we'll
call this card content because it's the
content of the card and we'll close that
div off so inside of here we have a few
different things and we have an h2 and
I'm gonna name pretty much everything I
should actually name my image up there
too but this will be my title card title
and we'll just call it like a cool
product or something like that and close
h2 then we will have a few paragraphs so
our first paragraph is P class and the
first one will be our subtitle so it
wouldn't be just card subtitle and it I
don't know a cool product that you
should buy clothes pack nice and simple
then we need to do in a paragraph class
and we're gonna have a little
description of the product so card just
grip shim
for this I just have a little bit of
lorem ipsum saved off-screen so we can
have a few power well not a few
paragraphs but a few lines of text
because I think that would I don't feel
like writing a big long thing
so we'll paste that in great move this
down a little bit scroll that there we
go that looks a little better next mean
our price so once again we'll have a
paragraph for our price so to be you can
guess what this one's going to be price
and it's gonna be an expensive one let's
make it a nice big one three 99.99
closed paragraph and this should have an
equals right there and at the very end a
Buy Now link so we'll do a href is equal
to nothing and the class on this one can
be card button by now close a and I
think that's all we need and it looks
pretty good okay so another thing we're
going to do is I am gonna import
Merriweather in here just because it's a
nice little font it's a Merriweather
saws that I'm gonna use so I'm going to
import that it and we'll set that up on
my body so body we can say that the font
family will be Mary weather sauce is
just a Google font sauce saw a serif and
I'm just for since we're only doing this
I mean I kept adding at fifty pixels
just to create some space so my cards
not stuck to the edge of the screen but
normally I wouldn't have this on my body
okay so now we can really get started
now one thing I said I do like to do and
I recommend in the last video especially
if you you're not sure about with the
collapsing margins and all of that stuff
one thing that can be really useful is
just doing a general reset so we're
going to use that reset we're going to
say on here our padding is zero our
margin is zero and our box sizing is
border whoops
border-box so it always whenever you do
this will make your layout look less
good automatically because everything
gets stuck together so sometimes you do
this and you're like oh man now I have
so much more work to do but it can
create less work in the long run just
because you can you can really be
focused just on on setting things up
exactly how you want to cool so on the
card itself we'll start there and we'll
do I was gonna let's just give it a
width of like 600 pixels and so we can
actually see it I don't want to give it
a background color but we'll give it a
box shadow so there 0 0 15 pixels and I
want to be black so we'll do our GBA
because black itself is really dark zero
zero zero and we'll try 0.25 just to
fade it out there we go just a really
nice subtle drop shadow I find when even
if you go up to like 50 or 75 and the
shadow is really obvious it's not gonna
look so good it's yeah so I'm gonna drop
that down to like 25 nice and subtle
like he'd even probably drop down to 20
something really really subtle a drop
shadows in general the more subtle they
are the nicer they look good
and I'm just wondering if I should do
display flex I think yeah we're gonna
also on here do a display flex so it's
gonna get the two things to go next to
each other like that so that yeah that's
more or less what I want this one's a
little bigger than I want I want this
one to be smaller I have a feeling we
have to tweak a little bit of stuff in
here as we go just because of the way
I'm setting this up but I'm just gonna
come the way on splash it works it's
using filler images you have the width
and the height I'm just gonna make the
width a little smaller because I want it
to be yeah more like that sweet good I
didn't want it to be like this really
big image or anything like that I want
it to be something maybe a little bigger
than that could be good but well swill
fine-tune it a little bit near the end
so that's good good good now the problem
is and we're going to start by looking
at the text here and all the text is
crammed and obviously we have this big
empty space at the bottom so the
very first thing I want to do is I want
to move things off of the edges and the
biggest mistake I see people make is
they take their card content because
they know they need to move stuff off
and they do something like this
padding 50 pixels to create the space
and yeah okay they created some space
that's fine it's not terrible and even
actually I see a lot of people do it
like this 10 and it's like yeah you
moved it off the sides that's good it is
easier to read them when it was jammed
on there but it it's still not really
that nice if you're gonna add padding
for something that's this big and we
have all this room to work with had a
lot of padding so I'm looking at this
like I want to bring emphasis on this
now you're definitely reading this but
you have this big block and it's sort of
stuck near the top in general and it's
not it becomes more of an aesthetic
thing but it's one of the design things
you want is to use spacing or like
proximity so things that are close to
one another and far away from each other
to create a hierarchy in the text and
how people are going to go through it to
read all of the content so on the card
content here instead of doing something
really small like this I make it bigger
me you know bring the text down a little
bit so let's start with that so instead
of just doing something like 10 pixels
or even 50 pixels which is a huge
improvement that's cool and if you make
them you know if I did margin on here it
would look at the same I don't have a
color on my background so it's not the
end of the world the reason I'm using
padding instead of margin because I you
know I'm looking at like I'm pushing the
content into my box so margin is really
pushing things away so but if you made
the mistake and you're not sure and
you're working in your design it's
really not the end of the world or if I
did have a background color on this say
it was a background of yellow or
something like that for some reason and
I did my margin I go oh woops that's the
wrong one I can just switch it out for
the padding if you don't have a
background color on it it's really not
the end of the world but just remember
in general pushing content inwards is
going to be done with padding and
pushing things away from each other is
with margins so let's
keep my padding there but we're gonna
make it a lot bigger so I'm gonna go
with something in the range I like even
double this but if I do 100 pixels like
that this starts getting kind of small
like I don't have a lot of room to work
with now my contents getting really
crowded so I think I like having a lot
of space on the top but for the space
around it now I'd rather go with
something a little bit smaller so maybe
something in the range of like 40 pixels
so if we remember the first one is going
to be on the top and the bottom and the
second one is on the left and the right
so I have 40 pixels there and there one
thing I would encourage is trying to
keep that type of spacing and cool so
you could play with that maybe it's 50
maybe 35 but I want a nice healthy space
here because I want to separate my image
from this and by pushing it off the top
it just makes it a lot easier to like my
eye gets drawn to this a little more
than when it's glued up near the top
like that so now we can make we have to
make our stuff look a little better
right so we'll do card title and in this
case I want to make sure it looks
already like the bold weight but font
weight of 800 is the big heavy one it
already is that but we'll lighten it up
a little bit just to make it when you
use pure black it's a little too black
so we want to just make it a little bit
darker later I should say pure black I
try to avoid pure pure black dark Gray's
are usually a bit better and will go
with a font size of let's do like 35
pixels it looks okay now you'll see the
problem here that's already starting is
to be here or starting to merge like
they're touching so they're a little too
close together but I'm gonna come on my
subtitle card sub title and on here
let's set up a font size on this one two
font size it actually looks pretty good
let's say like 20 pixels um find weight
let's make this one nice and bold as
well I want to make this all CAPA
so maybe it should be smaller maybe like
15 pixels text transform upper case and
if ever you do this and this it's sort
of the same concept as margins and
padding's but it's a lot more of a
subtle little thing if ever you do
uppercase text like this I'm actually
gonna make this a little smaller it's go
late twelve if ever you do pure
uppercase text like that
fourteen maybe try some letter spacing
on there letter spacing I'm not gonna
put a lot of letter spacing on here but
I think a little bit of letter spacing
like one pixel might even just it makes
it a little bit easier to read all cap
bold text can be a little hard to read
so despite doing that little spacing
thing it can really help out and we
should also change the color and I want
a bright green so I'm just gonna try
lime green and hope it works there we go
so I think that looks okay but the
spacing of it is really bad now so
already hierarchy wise I can see this is
the title the subtitle text well the
price is sort of looks like text and I
definitely see the little Buy Now thing
so it's coming together but just to show
you what you can do so these I want to
separate just because they're touching
the only reason so I just want to pull
those part a little bit so let's give
this a margin bottom I don't even know
10 pixels might be too much it is too
much should I uppercase the title we'll
leave it lowercase but that's too big
let's do it like five pixels there we go
Pulliam together anyone who's watched my
other stuff knows I usually work with MS
and REMS but I don't want to have that
as a focal point for this I just want to
stick with my pixels just so I can
really focus and not have to worry about
explaining that as well so there we go I
want them nice and close together and I
want to separate them now from this
because this is one sort of piece of
information title/subtitle one piece of
information then we're gonna have this
as a piece of information another one in
another one so now after this one so I
go to my subtitle remember I like trying
to work with margin bottom as much as
possible when I'm creating separations
between things so on here we can go with
something pretty
big let's say like 50 pixels so it just
creates this nice big separation so now
I see this like this has become the
emphasis this is what I'm really really
looking at then my eye after I see this
can jump down to this area so I have a
really big space
nice big breathing room and the whole
point of this is to create a lot a nice
really big breathing room around here
if you're wondering but like margins and
padding's we're really gonna get into
more finer details when we get into our
button as well on why we're using one or
the other because that's kind of a
background color on it so that just
creates this nice big empty space here
then I have my text my text let's play
around at that a little bit since we're
here
so my card description I think I called
it right is it actually right
description I did I don't like that's
too long let's go with card just great
like that just because I'm lazy and
don't like typing as much and let's make
it a little smaller font size usually I
like big font sizes on stuff 16 is
usually the default so I'm going to look
like about 14 for something like this I
don't mind it being a bit smaller yeah
but most of the time I'm trying to go
for larger font sizes just because I
find it is kind of small if this was a
lot of text I don't know
I like larger font sizes one way to make
text a much easier to read and it still
goes with this whole concept of white
space is increase the space between your
lines which we can do with our line
height so the default is I figured what
it is 1.4 not even 1.3 I comment that
out at 1.2 then maybe is the default
it's in that range
it's even smaller than that which is
really really tight you know I like I
usually do one point six is my starting
point and then I'll modify from there if
this was a lot of text that's looking
pretty good but I'm going for something
really airy and spaced out this is
pushing it one point six is sort of my
default one point four to one point six
is usually nice for long bits of text
prefer something like this I think that
looks nice just because it's we're going
for something elegant which is usually a
little bit more
bassy and we don't have a lot of text to
read if you start spacing out the text
too much and it's are scanning like
double spaced it doesn't always look so
nice so that looks pretty good we should
change the color again I don't like pure
black so color and I'm gonna lighten
this up quite a bit probably too much
right there maybe a 777 or something
like that you want them even though
you're going for that elegant nice look
you don't want to make it too light
because you don't want to make sure
people can read it not everyone as as
good as eyes as you do and then we need
some space underneath that so let's give
that some space under so again margin
bottom how much we want I don't know I'm
just randomly guessing numbers maybe I
should space it out equally I did a 50
so let's just use a 50 again so we have
equal spacing I'm not sure but I'll
stick with that for now
now one problem we've run into is our
card is getting taller than our image
and we'll look at fixing that after
without adapting just the images height
so now we want to get into the actual
price so once again we can come on to
here and you a card price and so we want
to make it bigger so you know I'm
looking at this I see this I have a
description but I do want people like it
should be like boom by now I want people
to buy it and we want you know hopefully
this looks like a good deal it's
expensive but you know it's for
something good at that price so let's
make it bigger font size is another 35
pixels sure make it bold will keep the
color dark on this one well we shouldn't
I'm gonna match the title just so this
color and this color the same I think I
do want it bold so I'll do a font weight
on there of 800 there we go that looks a
little bit more I like that a bit I'm
gonna reduce this space actually I'm
like half maybe
mmm I'm just playing around a little bit
with it maybe it was okay at 50 what's
waiting to light my button done and come
back maybe okay so that's looking pretty
nice
that's all we really need so again
people see this we want to see like
what's the order they're going and we
sort of want them to be like they are
you know they clicked on it they're
getting more information we sort of want
them to buy it at this point so we're
putting a description that gives them a
little bit more information but here's
the price and buy it so so especially my
card
button I want this baby to stand out so
first thing I'm gonna do is give it a
background of lime lime green color I
don't know if white or black is gonna
work better probably black text
declaration of none good good good now
one thing that's interesting is if I
give this padding let's just yeah I'll
just do padding like 50 pixels for now
you're gonna get this weird thing where
it covers other things around it which
is not a normal behavior but it's
because I put this on or is it a link
and a link is an inline element so you
can add padding to inline elements
you'll see it but it doesn't move the
object like you'd expect it to it
doesn't actually add to the size of it
it's just like this visual thing that
causes problems and just to show you if
we do it with margin so margin top of
like a hundred pixels nothing happens
because it's an inline element it thinks
it's gonna be a link that's like in your
text here and imagine if you had a link
in here that had a margin on it that's
gonna cause all sorts of problems so
whenever you have a link that you want
to turn into a button one thing that's
really important is you do
display:inline-block and now it's gonna
behave like you want my margin top is
working I don't want it to actually have
this I want it to have some padding so
I'm putting padding on it because it has
a background color
anytime something has a background color
you have to give it padding
solid rule right there go now once again
don't do it like 10 pixels it's an it's
it's a good start but it's not enough
so it's getting there it looks a little
better already the reason you have to
give something with a background color
padding is because you need the text not
to touch the side of it the second text
is touching the side of things it looks
really bad and again I get people who
like doing this where it's like violets
that's a pretty sad button don't do it
and it's the same here don't do a five
pixel space make a substantial space
make it so the space is obvious so on my
price now I didn't add my margin but I
think I should so it's at a margin
bottom of I don't know 10 pixels maybe
it should be bigger than that I'll be
like 25 just to push that away and now
before because this wasn't in line block
the padding wasn't moving it but now if
I add padding top of like a hundred
pixels I'll take this one off that will
actually it will impact how the buttons
doing it won't overlap stuff anymore so
that's you know why we were doing the
inline block stuff now with the padding
on something like a button you want it
to be different on the top and bottom
and left and right
Casilla just do 50 pixels like this it
sort of works but it's a weird shape and
it's way too big so way too big is to
start with 225 so I sort of like the
spacing on the left and the right but
it's still this weird awkward shape now
it's way too tall it's you'd never
really find a button like this so if you
really want to make sure your button is
the you know you go and look at what
nice buttons look like but in general
the padding on the top and bottom is
gonna mean like half-fish of what it is
on the left and the right so instead of
breaking it all up I'm just gonna do
what we were looking at so say I went
with 25 on the right and the left I
could on here add in on the top and the
bottom could be like 10 pixels and you
start getting a bit nicer of a shape and
it's a little small so we'll do like 13
maybe and again it's a general rule of
thumb but like double on the sides then
when you have on the top and the bottom
and usually it starts looking pretty
decent so I'm actually pretty happy with
that we might as well add a little bit
of a
we're on that as well card but in hover
and we'll just change the background
background to green color to white I'm
not gonna do anything fancy and even
like that really but anyway it works for
now yeah okay so we obviously have this
big issue of this big space on the
bottom and the reason we got that space
is as we spaced out our content here
this card got longer and longer so this
big empty area on the bottom is coming
from the amount of padding that we put
on here so we remember we've created a
big padding there and a big padding here
so another thing I see people do is they
go ah got too big and do I really need
that padding on the bottom or they'll
start playing with their padding's and
stuff like that
so here that's top right left I can do
zero and put zero on the bottom and hey
let's know now it's all crowded down on
the bottom I'd say it's more important
for something like this to be nice an
area on the top than nice an area on the
bottom but it's still nice to have it
nice it here here on the bottom it
really helps you keep the focus of
everything I'm looking here I see the by
now jumping off the page it drags my eye
down and I come to this and there's a
super clear hierarchy of information
I've broken everything down into bits so
I use padding to create this nice big
space around I'm using margin after all
my text pieces just to break them apart
and then I'm using padding again to
create something like a button like this
that has a background on it so
background has padding spacing just
general spacing is with margins um now
we could fix this image thing in a few
different ways so what I could do is I
have my card I never did card image so
my card image we're going to do
something on that but I also want to
select the image inside my card I didn't
call it image I called it I added to it
image container right good image
and Tanner I think I should do something
like that but I want to actually get the
image so I'm gonna give the image of
class 2 class equals card I'll just say
image I know this isn't exact in BIM
been naming convention but a card I'll
just do image like this it's a little
strange that anyway it's fine
so my card image I want to give it a min
height of 100% now the problem with
doing that is now it's overlapping this
other content so all my empty space went
away because it's overflowing out the
side here but it means that no matter
what happens with my content the image
will fit I'm just gonna go on the
container now and I'm gonna say
overflow:hidden and now it's not it's
not hiding so the container can grow and
shrink the only problem is this has
gotten kind of small I this looks really
tiny and this is really big and you
might want a bigger image than that will
this work flex of 1 flex of 2 mm that is
bigger right yeah it made it a little
bigger so basically this is just saying
try and be about you know take up two
parts in take up one part it's not
exactly how that works but it it sort of
makes sure that we have it taking up a
decent amount of space and there we have
it guys we're all wrapped up there's
margins and padding's covered I think
