video in my series on my complete
workflow for building a website now I
want to start setting up my sass and
because it's not a regular project it's
a sass project I have some variables to
do so this video is just all about
setting up some of my basic variables
for my colors of my fonts and creating a
really really simple mix in that I'm
going to use for my fonts throughout
this project so the one thing I have
done that I'm skipping just cuz I don't
think it requires too much is I did
create a new vendor folder because I
forgot to do that originally and in
there I've put in normalized so if we go
and look it's just the regular
normalized file I've copied it from
normalized pasted it in here though I
did make some minor changes to it I
changed the font family from just saw
serif to Roboto because that's the font
I'm going to be using on this video or
in this series and I added the font
weight in there and I also modified the
default line height to 1.6 which is a
line height that I generally default to
because I think it's 1.15 and normalize
which for me is kind of tight so that's
the only changes I've done with that so
if I go there if I look at my main sass
file I've imported my normalize and I've
added my Google font import all the way
right at the very very top if you're not
familiar with sass what this is doing is
it's importing my normalized file there
into this and then it's exporting that
into my main dot CSS file here so you
can see when I go to my regular CSS file
I have the the normalize in there and
it's working and that's all that's in my
CSS file right now but we're gonna be
adding a lot to that today so the very
first thing I'm going to going to do is
create a new file here and I'm gonna
save it and it's going to be in my sass
folder it's going to be in abstract and
it's going to be underscore colors dot
si SS and I'm gonna hit save and right
away I'm going to jump over to my main
dot sass and in here I'm going to do
import abstracts slash colors and I
think I made a mistake somewhere
stur abstracts ab abs Oh
spilt let's rename that rename AB
Strax so that should mean I don't know
if I can't pull this over I'm getting a
little pop-up saying it can't compile my
sass right now whoops it didn't rename
it did it rename streck's so what that
is going to do and we'll actually well
I'll show you how that's working in one
second actually these are things that
aren't actual CSS this is all just sass
and if you are gonna write in CSS
instead of SAS s and s CSS is more
popular if you're really not sure what
the difference is please use the notes
below to find out a little bit more but
the nice thing with sass is you can do
variables these are a little bit
different I believe when you're using
regular as CSS so I'm gonna do my main
color RGB a and I've written all these
out just because I don't you know I have
them on my side here I don't want to
have to sort of jump back and forth to
Photoshop like I normally have so I
drawed it all these down on paper 168
comma one 100% so let's just to show you
what this variable is doing let's just
jump over to my normalized file just
really fast on the body we'll throw on a
background of main dude to do did I make
a mistake here
oh whoops this is all I'm going to
delete you because I've made a spelling
mistake originally I moved to trash I
was renaming that in the wrong spot I
have two folders here now colors and
colors I want to delete this one
and it might not work no it did work
okay so we're in the right place we're
not in the right place this is okay copy
don't save well that was a bit of a mess
all of that was just because I'd miss
named my folder there there we go
so because I'd miss named this folder
and I was working off of the wrong one I
didn't have my R and then I renamed the
wrong thing and I was renaming up here
in the CSS and it was all a bit of a
mess I'm really sorry about that so
basically what I've done now is I've
created a variable called main and
that's exporting to our GBA and those
numbers and that gets exported and right
now I've just said that my background
color is main and I'm going to leave
that there just so we can look at the
different colors that I bring in I'm
also gonna have a secondary color so my
secondary color I just stick to our GBA
I would have habit I guess
147 and 100% and to show you what that
color it looks like secondary and there
we go it loads in as my bright green
another one I always have is my accent
color which is RGB a 2-1 124 105 one so
we can look at that one as well
accident which is that bright pink color
I also like to have a white color white
just because I probably will need it
somewhere RGB eh I don't know why we
need the a 255 255 255 and now what I
like to do as well is I like to have my
text colors some text colors
and I will have my text base and I'll do
all of these in a second text inverse
text accent and my text secondary let's
just switch that over to Maine just so
it makes a bit more sense so my main
text my color my inverse text color my
accent color and my secondary text color
and the reason I like to set this up
like this and not just rely on these
colors is because maybe I want to keep
these colors but something along here
changes but for the moment these all
stay the same
secondary my main text color is my
secondary color my text inverse is white
my text accent is accent and my text
secondary is main in this case so these
are just in you know I'm switching those
around but my main text color happens to
be secondary so that won't change
anything I'm gonna jump in and normalize
and take this out cuz I don't want to
keep that in there it was just to give
as an example and show that it is
working and I believe that's it are for
my colors the next file that I'm going
to create and let's try not to screw
this one up we'll make a new one I'm
gonna save that in my SAS abstracts
spelled correctly and this one I call it
type dot SAS s and as usual I'll jump
over to my main and I will import import
abstracts slash type and in there I have
a few things that I'm gonna do for my
font the font that's fine I like font I
will have my font stack with Roboto
Sarah and right away before I forget I'm
actually going to come into my
normalized and switch that out
save oh and this one doesn't need the
semicolon at the end now the reason I'm
putting this here is this is my main one
but now if ever I decide to change my
font at one point and this is I guess is
my main feints font stack but it's the
only font that I'm using so if it ever
gets changed throughout somewhere in
this project I don't have to start
hunting through in other places I just
have to go know my abstracts folder
where it's done and I can do one change
here and I know wherever it happened to
be used will be switched out and this is
more useful I guess if you have more
fonts than just one but it's still a
good habit and something I'm used to
doing so my font weights I'm gonna have
a few font light whoops I'm again I'm
just gonna write these out and then
we'll assign them I always set my font
normal font bold and my font black just
to jump back over to my main just so you
know I have brought in those those are
the weights that I am using you might
have more you might have a font italic
in font other things that really depends
on your project so font light is 300
font normal is 400 font bold is 700 and
font black is 900 and again the nice
thing about this is it makes it super
easy for me to go in and change later
times if I need to change these say I
changed my font black from 900 to 700
for whatever reason I don't like that
super black thing I don't have to go
through my whole project this is the one
place that we can control all of it so
I'm gonna save that and now I'm going to
also put a mix in here some people are a
lot of people with their sass like that
mix-ins in an extra file but this is my
font mix in and I only use it for my
fonts it's specific to my type so I do
like to keep it in here for mix-ins with
si SS it's done with an equal sign I
forget how to do it with a CSS sorry if
you are using that
so my font this is the variable will be
the weight and what this means is my
font family anytime I want to set it up
I can just use my font family and font
stack and so it's always going to set my
font family to Roboto and saw serif
I know I've used normalize to set it up
but again this could be very useful if
you set you know I could have font
family comma weight font weight and then
my font family here could be I set this
up as font family and it could be a
variable and you could change it based
on whatever you want but in this case I
only worry about the weight so my font
weight will be weight so I'll show you
how I'm gonna use this really I'll show
you how I'm gonna use it right away
actually so one way I could use that
just to demonstrate a little bit of how
it works I'll do it just right here say
for my or even let's let's jump up to
normalize and actually use it properly
because I'm not doing it properly here
so I'm gonna delete that whole line
there what I need to do is do include
include font my font was fond normal put
my semicolon and I think that's gonna
work
so looking at this here it's using my
it's going to my mix in and it's looking
for font so it's finding font and it's
setting the property so it's setting my
font family to my fond stack and it's
setting my font weight to my font normal
so basically nothing's changed now just
for fun if I change the font normal here
to font bold everything should become
bold there we go and if I change my font
bold to font light everything should
become light there you go you see it
become light and I'll switch that back
to normal so I like having something
like this again now if I change my font
stack it would
automatically update if I change my font
normal to something else it will
automatically update I don't have to go
and find room using it if I did want to
modify this I could always come and
modify it a little bit to have it work a
bit differently you could have it
include more variables it's not
necessarily set up to only - I can put
in as many as I want here I can also
have my font size and other stuff added
in here yeah so that's it for setting
that up and that makes more sense for me
for that to be set like that so I'm
gonna close normalize I won't need that
anymore
so I have my fonts and colors all set up
and ready to go my mixin is ready to go
and that's it for my variables I think
that's all the ones we are going to need
it might be that I jump in here as time
goes on but I'm pretty happy with that
that's the general type of thing I do
for most of my projects and a lot of
this is what repeats itself my font
mix-ins are usually a little bit more
complicated but for this project
something simple like this is perfect
and yeah if you've never used sass
variables are super cool and they've
started bringing variables into regular
CSS but I find it's a bit anyway I
prefer how this works I also like be
able to have you know all my different
files that I'm importing into one main
file I find that makes a lot more sense
- if you have any questions about
variables or mix-ins or anything like
that please leave them down in the
comments below and I hope you like this
