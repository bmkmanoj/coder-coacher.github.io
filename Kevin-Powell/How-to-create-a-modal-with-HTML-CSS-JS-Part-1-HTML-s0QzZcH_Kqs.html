this series where we're going to be
making the modal's for our portfolio
section here so I'm doing this part a
little bit differently than what I've
been doing in the recent history of my
channel where what I'm going to be doing
is actually releasing all four parts of
these so you can see all four of them
today I tried to make them into smaller
videos to make them a little bit more
digestible even though the CSS one will
be kind of long still and what we're
gonna be looking at how to do is now
that we have these to make a modal that
when we click opens up the modal we get
a nice little portfolio thing there we
can close it off we can come and open
the next one and get the next one as
well now the thing is I didn't actually
have to use CSS grid to make these so
this is really more of just we're gonna
put it together style it so we have
these images here that go full-size then
I have some images that are pull left
and pull right and of course this part
right here we have a nice little close
buttons we can open up the portfolio
item on open and I also push escape on
my keyboard to close it out so yeah
that's what we're going to be doing over
the next four videos and yeah let's jump
right into it and see how I did this
alright so I'm just gonna scroll down to
where it should be showing up so I'm
gonna come and find my portfolio stuff
here you might have seen other sites
that do things a little bit differently
for this type of thing I'm not going to
be building my modal's somewhere else
I'm actually building my modal's inside
of my portfolio item I think it leads to
simpler JavaScript so what I'm going to
do is in here after my figcaption we're
gonna add a div I'm gonna do a div of
portfolio modal so this will be my modal
and I'm actually gonna put a little
comment here just to make life a little
easier to track of keep track of which
would be portfolio modal one okay so and
maybe space it out a little more and I'm
gonna do a whoops not what I wanted
close close modal
just because we're gonna have quite a
bit of markup in here and I want to make
sure that it is nicely organized so the
first thing that I'm going to put in
here I'm gonna sort of structured let's
actually open the design here um so
we're gonna have it looking something
like this one thing I am gonna change is
it won't have the fonts what we see here
are gonna translate over here so it's
actually gonna look pretty similar here
in here I don't know why I did that this
is just really bad on my part and the
fact that I didn't catch it when I did
it bothers me a lot so when we click
it's gonna we're gonna get a pop-up that
looks something like that so I'm gonna
have a header here it's gonna have a
background image on it and then this
text box with our text in it and then
down here it's relatively simple I'm
gonna show a neat trick we can do it out
full with images though the break
outside of containers so let's get
started on that so we have a big
background image we have this with our
text inside and actually I think I'm
going to leave that up on the screen
while I'm working and just bring it down
I'm only worrying about this top part
right now anyway so in my modal I'm
going to have I'm gonna do another div
that's gonna have my background image on
it so I'm going to do portfolio title
box maybe not the best name in the world
and in there we'll have a port h2
portfolio portfolio title and I'm
actually taking the same class name that
I used here and here because I want them
to look the same so I think that makes a
lot of sense there we go so this will
just be the same thing project name and
then I need a new line here and this
will be my paragraph this time I'm gonna
give it a different thing though we're
going to call this one portfolio sub
title and subtitle goes here and I'm
gonna save that now remember I'm not
looking to make it look like this so the
default on this might actually be okay
you can see that's actually showing up
right here right now so it's underneath
the the image which is what I'd sort of
expect once we get into the CSS that
will
get nicely fixed up so once we get
outside of I didn't even I have my title
box I forgot to do my header so I'm
going to port folio header so portfolio
header and that will close right here
whoops and I can write so I have my
header that has a title box and the
title and the subtitle so this is my
header with the image in it then this
here is my title box and then I'm h1 and
my subtitle right there so here just to
stay a bit more organized because I
mentioned they'll be a lot this is close
portfolio header and then we need to
have the content itself so we can just
do a div class equals portfolio content
because I think that makes sense and
close my content I have some text saved
off screen here so I'm just gonna grab
that because it's help go a little bit
faster paste that in so this is just a
long paragraph so we can put our image
in here so I'm just gonna do it like
this so my image is I'm just gonna use
the same one we've been using this whole
time image and portfolio 1 JPEG and an
image I'm gonna give this one a class
those want this one to be the full width
image so I will give it a class equals
I'll call it port folio full width and
I'm also gonna have a pull right and
pull left one so let's take this copy
let's just see how I did this I had one
paragraph one paragraph so we'll just I
think I might do whoops all right I'm
gonna do another paragraph let's just do
two of those then I'm going to take this
image again copy paste and take all of
that to make a really long one but it's
because I want to put a whole bunch of
stuff in here okay so that is pretty
much the content done I'm gonna have a
full width
I'm gonna have a portfolio pull left
because I would have an image that's
gonna pull the left and I have an image
pull right and just to show you what I'm
even talking about with those it's when
we go to the full screen version in this
we'll get there in a second zoom out
here you can see I'm gonna have well I
did pull right pull left I'm gonna I'm
gonna be bringing my images so I have a
full width one that's going to stretch
the whole size and then I'm going to
have these ones which are pulling to the
right
and pulling it to the left but when
we're on the mobile display they won't
pull they're just gonna take up the full
space because if not I think they'll get
a little bit too tiny so if I save that
now and that gives us this this big long
thing that looks like that and my images
didn't come in why not
did I make a mistake with my images
obviously I did oh I think this is 0-1
right save there we go my images are in
there now all right cool good so now
that that's done we can jump over to the
CSS which is in the next video I look
forward to seeing you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
