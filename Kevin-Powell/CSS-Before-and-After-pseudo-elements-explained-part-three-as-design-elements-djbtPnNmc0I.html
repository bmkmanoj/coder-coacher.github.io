continuing our look at CSS
pseudo-element specifically the before
and after pseudo element and different
cool things we can do with them so we've
already looked at just generally what
they are and how they work we've looked
at the content property and then we're
gonna be looking at them as design
element so we're gonna be seeing how I
created this red bar with no extra
markup and it sort of hides we can still
see our heading and it will follow our
screen around and then we're gonna be
looking at these two cards here we're
gonna be doing these hover effects like
this so it darkens around we get these
lines growing in and out and there's no
extra markup done it's all done with CSS
to get all this cool stuff happening so
welcome if you haven't seen the last two
videos I'd strongly recommend you check
them out especially the first one where
we really look at how the whole before
and after thing work cuz it's kind of
weird and not everyone really realizes
how they're working behind the scenes if
you're new here my name is Kevin and I
make videos like this every single week
and yeah these you know we're looking at
the pseudo elements here so before I
dive deep into this I just want to give
props to this code drops article so if I
come over here and this is where I got
the idea of using pseudo elements in fun
ways and there's just lots of awesome
hover effects they're doing here they
have two sets of stuff you can even go
to the original article to get a bit
more information and sort of an
explanation on how they did all this so
if you want some more stuff please check
these guys out alright so let's jump
right into it what I wanted just before
we get before we get into the code
itself one thing that I do want to look
at here is just I have put this
Universal selector to alter my box
sizing for border box just to make it
easier for me this means if I add
padding or a border to something it
doesn't add to the size of something
it's included in its width the content
itself so that just will stop weird
little glitches from happening now one
thing you might not have realized is if
you do the universal selector it won't
include the before and after elements
you actually have to universally select
those as well if you want to get the
border box working on those other than
that I will be using sass to write this
I'm not gonna be doing anything too
complicated or a CSS I should say and
just for some nesting on some things
because it's gonna make my life a little
bit easier if you don't know about sass
you should still be able to follow along
without any major issues so we're gonna
start up with the title area up here
which is just a fun little effect that
looks kind of cool and it's nice that
you don't need an extra markup or
anything to do it we don't need a div as
a background and then a second a
separate background you know like that
we can control them sort of separately
which is really really nice
so just quickly if we look at my markup
here I all I have up here is an h1 class
intro and there's nothing else there I
don't have any divs I don't have
anything else over there so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna find here I have
my div class intro on here all I've done
so far is a position:relative and I've
also put a display:inline-block just
because I want to connect sit easier for
the size of it I have a text align
Center on the whole document also so
what I want to do is I want to control
the before and the after on here so
because I'm using a CSS I can do that
like this and do and before and after
both of my before and after are going to
be sharing properties and if you're not
used to sass this would be the same
thing as coming down underneath and just
writing out intro before and writing my
code that way so if you want to follow
along don't nest yours inside there just
write it out like this so I have my
before in my after and a lot of the
things that we're gonna have on these
will be exactly the same so such as the
content property and because we're using
them as design elements and I think
content will be nothing I don't want any
content in there but but as we know now
through the other videos we've seen we
need to use this or else we don't have
anything to manipulate we're also going
to give them a height of 100 percent
display block because that's gonna make
our lives a little bit easier and let's
give them a just so I can see it or we
will see them in a second let's actually
separate I just want to put backgrounds
on these so we can actually see them
some way and before we'll give that one
a background of light blue and after
we'll give that one a background
of the final color will be my color red
here so we'll just do that now we don't
see anything yet I've given them a
height but I haven't done anything else
with them there's no there's no with to
them so here I'm just gonna switch I'm
gonna make a position:absolute because I
do want to be able to control exactly
where they're gonna be and for the
moment just so we can see if these are
working let's start on this one here and
give this one a width of 100% so that we
can actually see that my block is coming
in and actually we can probably give
this one a background to background oh
it has a background not a background I
mean a width width of 100% for the
moment and there we go so we can see I
have my two boxes now this isn't exactly
how I want them to be positioned
obviously so they're display:block but
because they're position:absolute there
and my width is 100% it's matching the
width of my I'm going to turn off the
before one so I can see my text so it's
actually matching the width of my text
and this is the reason I gave this
display:inline-block if I'd done
display:block on this that red bar would
stretch the whole size which is what I
want but if we get become really hard
for me to match the width of my text
with my before so we're gonna leave this
on display:inline-block but for my width
on this instead of 100% I'm just going
to put 100 vertical width and now I get
this annoying side scrolling problem but
this is going to be a hundred percent of
the screen size the only thing is I need
to move it into the right spot so
luckily that's not too hard to do I'm
gonna do a left on this of 50 50 percent
and that should line up the left side of
this box dead in the middle of the
screen because this is Center aligned my
here's generic heading is Center aligned
so by doing the left 50% it's putting
this right in the middle of my screen
and then what I can do is the very
useful transform translate X negative
50%
this is a nice trick to Center something
on my screen so you can see I have no
vertical scrolling now our horizontal
scrolling I should say and so what's
happening is this is moving it to the
right dead middle of the screen so the
left side of it is dead in the middle of
the screen and then this is moving it
50% of its own width negative the other
way so the first one is dealing with the
absolute positioning so it's looking
right here and then the second one is
looking at its own width and because
it's a hundred vertical width it's going
to move back exactly to where we want it
to be the only thing is I want it to be
underneath my text so I can also add a
top zero and there we go it is now in
place now obviously I can't read my text
and that's a bit of a problem so I'm
gonna turn my light blue back on for a
second just so we can see that it is
working but the only problem is my light
blue is behind my red text just because
this is before and this one is after so
what I'm gonna do is I could actually
one thing I could do is actually switch
these around to be the other way around
and that would solve that rum but I have
to use a Zed index on this anyway so as
that index on my light blue of will do a
negative one on that one actually and
will come over on this one and do a
z-index negative two and that's just
gonna place the red one behind the blue
one the reason I'm going with negative
here is if I put a zero on that it's at
the same set index of my intro and my
intro does have is that index on it now
of defaulting to zero just because it
has the position relative so what's
happening here is you know because this
is zero and it's in with this it just
ends up overlapping so I'm just gonna
give that a negative one so it sort of
orders I have my content then I'm a
negative when Zed index so it's being
pushed backwards and then I have my
negative two which is being pushed
behind that as well now with this
obviously I don't want this to be light
blue I actually want it to be white and
you can see it's starting to come
together I have this really annoying one
pixel line underneath I'm not actually
sure why that happens
is this and this the white and the red
should have the exact same height and I
think in Chrome this doesn't actually
happen but it just means that I'm gonna
actually remove my height from this one
and put it on here instead so this one
will have a height of 101 percent
whereas this one can stick with a height
of 100 percent just to make sure that
it's a little bit you know the white is
a little bit bigger and it's covering
that up you could also use top and
bottom on these to play around with it
instead of doing a height now the one
problem is it's way too close to those
so on my before here so I'm just going
to come on here and say a left of like
negative 20 pixels a right of negative
20 pixels and does this oh I'm gonna
take my width off on that one actually
and there we go um so I'm getting
negative 20s giving my my space here in
my space here now as I mentioned the
advantage with this is here is you know
if I put if I change the content inside
of this it's still gonna grow and shrink
with it which is really really handy it
does have one little flaw though I'll
let you know
if it breaks on to two lines the
background thing will disappear just
because of the way the inline block is
working and a couple of other things
basically what's happening is the it's
it's too large now because of the way it
works so you could always build a media
query in and play around a little bit
with this here because I think if I made
this like that you can see it's starting
to come back in it's just this white
thing is gotten too big so a simple
media query could always fix that in a
way it also depend on how things are
breaking and you know this could be set
up a little bit differently but it just
gives you an idea about what we can
achieve without any extra markup this is
just with an h1 we get this cool effect
that will grow and shrink with my text
and won't have me and have to do
anything under the more fun effect
though of my card title so right now on
these cards the only thing I have
happening is when I hover on top and off
the card title is appearing and
disappearing
and let's go look at the structure of my
card first so basically I have a div
class card it has an image in it so we
can see the two pictures here these are
my two pictures and then I have a div of
card text and my card text is just has
the title and the body so the title the
title there and the body here I'd
actually don't like this yellow picture
so let's change that to whoops that's
not gonna fit three 399 I think it just
look a little bit nicer yeah we'll go
with that one so I just have the card
title coming up on hover so if we come
and look down here and you can this pen
is available if you want to see how I
did these cards because I'm not gonna
look into it in too much detail once
again I'm going to be using a
position:relative on it and there's my
card image so it's just a max width of
100% to make sure it fits display:block
and oh this transition it's not we're
doing anything right now but it will be
shortly the card text has the opacity so
when I hover on top it's going from an
opacity of zero to an opacity of one so
we can see it and that's about it
there's nothing too fancy going on with
that the reason I have this opacity on
my card image here is because I wanted
to add one thing because when we hover
depending on the you see this one's
really hard to read the text and this
one's not too bad but we want to make it
a lot easier to read the text so card
image what we can do is actually change
the opacity to like a 0.7 let's say and
if we want that to transition we should
put it here too I like doing it without
the hover first just so I can see what
it's actually gonna look like and I'm
gonna lower that a lot actually point
four maybe I wanted to be pretty dark so
on my card itself I have a grey
background a dark grey background so
when my we're gonna do let's just do it
now hover no this should be one so my
opacity on the image is one but when I
hover on top the opacity drops down so
the gray
Zin which makes it easier for me to read
the text there we go it's working on
both of them so that's already a nice
little effect but I think though you
know the sliding things and all of that
will be really awesome so let's go and
do that so I'm gonna come on my card
here and what we want to do once again
I'm gonna set up both my before and my
after at the same time because a lot of
them are going to share the same
properties once again we're gonna have a
no content on them we're gonna give them
a position Posey
absolutely
and I want to see what I'm doing because
right now we can't see them at all so
let's just give them a background of
we'll do pink just so I can see what I'm
doing so I'm actually let's give it a
top of zero bottom zero left:0 right:0
and there we go we can see it and I
think what I'm gonna do is actually take
this pink background off of both of them
because the first one we're going to
play with is the before so we'll work on
the before first and then if we need to
put the background on the after one
after so right now it's covering the
whole thing and I don't actually want it
to be doing that I want to move it in a
little bit so I'm gonna switch this to
like 1.25 M and we'll just switch all of
those over so it's not actually going
all the way to the edges of my box it's
taking up it's going glitchy oh because
of the way this is it doesn't matter too
much don't worry with the glitches
though they'll be fixed once we're done
with this so we can see where it's
positioned on the card and now what I
want it to do is instead of having a
background obviously we don't want it to
have a background but I'm gonna leave
the background on to start with and then
I'm gonna switch it over to how we're
actually gonna get the effect out of it
just to leave a little bit of fun so on
my before here what I'm actually gonna
do is I'm gonna change its scale and to
do that it shouldn't be scaled to be
trans
form scale and we're gonna do if I do
zero whoops if I do a zero on it we just
don't see it at all now I want to do my
hover now to do the hover I'm gonna do
and hover before so just in case you're
not used to sass what this is is card
hover before so that's what I'm working
on now I'm working on when I hover on
top of my card so when I hover on top I
want to change what's happening with my
before so we're gonna change the scale
on this so let's do a transform scale
and transform that up to one and I'll
come back to here and do a transition
transform these out 250 he's out 250
milliseconds so now when I hover on top
you'll see that it's growing in and out
like that which is kind of cool it's a
fun effect on its own but it's not
really what I want to do what I want is
I want those lines to sort of grow in an
interesting way so a cool thing you can
do is scale that I only learned about
recently is I'm gonna do scale 0 comma 1
and on over here we're gonna do a 1
comma 1 so what this means is it's
starting at a scale the X is on a scale
of 0 but the Y is still at a hundred
percent and then when I hover both of
them go up to 100% so if we go and look
now it's growing from the middle because
my Y which is the up-and-down is always
at a hundred percent
it's only my X that's changing so we see
it doing this cool little effect like
that now that's pretty much what I'm
after the thing is we don't want a big
pink box to be growing in and out like
that we want some lines so I'm going to
turn off my pink background here and I'm
gonna give this some borders so on my
before we'll do a border left trying to
think no I want the border top not the
border left border top one picks
solid white and my border bottom one
pixel solid white so now when I do that
you can see it's those lines that are
growing instead so my lines are growing
in and out so that's really cool now we
want to do the exact same thing on my
after so we'll come down and we'll do my
I'm gonna do my after here just because
I like keeping all my hover stuff
together so and after so I'm actually
just gonna copy this whole thing copy
that paste it in but I'm gonna switch it
because now they're doing the exact same
thing but I wanted to grow up and down
some put this to one this one over to
zero and let's just copy this paste this
and I'm going to change this after so
now when I hover I made a mistake
somewhere here
oh my borders should be a border left
and a border right so now when I do it
you can see they're growing up and down
and the other ones are growing left and
right so I get that box it's forming you
could definitely just leave it there and
have a box like that I sort of wanted
the edges to cross a little bit instead
of like overlapping a little bit so I
think it's a little bit more fun here
just to say that the scale changes a bit
more so I'm going to do like a 1.05 on
this and a point zero five here so that
should you know so you can see now in
the corners there's like they overlap
each other you get that nice little
overlapping effect on the corners no I
just realized when when I was doing this
I didn't realized why it was happening
and I just thought of it now but if I'm
hovering on top of this you can see that
it's not really working the backgrounds
coming it's only when I'm on top of the
outside part and it's because I made a
bit of a mistake right at the beginning
so let's go ahead and fix that and I
think it's a good little learning
experience so here I put the hover
effect on the when I'm hovering on my
image itself so the problem in here is
on top of my image but here I'm on top
of my after before they're on top of my
image so it's not registering is
hovering on top of my image it's only
registering it as hovering on top of the
before or the after thing but out here
it's working and that's why the whole
time I was doing the demo you saw my
mouse that was out here and I knew I'd
had this working before so I was a
little bit confused by that and the
mistake that I made was it shouldn't be
when I'm hovering here what I should be
doing and I'm actually going to steal
this away a little bit we'll leave it
here is just I want it to be when I
hover on top of my card so card hover my
card image that's inside has the opacity
what was it it's something like that so
when I hover anywhere on top of my card
the card image opacity will lower and
then we get that nice little effect and
that's it that's how you make I really
you know this cool little heading bar I
like that more is a little hacky type of
thing and then there's just nice little
hover effect on this it's just some of
the possibilities that are out there but
it's really cool that we can have a card
with really simple markup and you still
get the background that can change and
these lines growing on it the text
appearing and disappearing go out and
explore what you can do with pseudo
elements and try different things
there's a million different things you
can do with them they're really awesome
design elements as you saw in this video
and in the previous ones really nice
ways to improve your designs and do
really fun things with them so I hope
you liked this video if you did like it
please hit the thumbs up and let me know
just a quick word if you're not used to
using sass and you're a little bit
intrigued by this I am working on a
course to teach you sass it's not ready
yet but there is a link to it in the
description below where you can find it
more information on it and you can go
and sign up to find out more about it
when it's getting closer to lunch and if
you do sign up for that when the course
does launch you'll also get a nice
little discount on the course for
whoever is on my list with that out of
the way thank you so much for watching
and whatever you do don't forget until
next time to make your corn on the
Internet just a little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
