series this is a little sad that we're
here but we're at the end and I just
want to cover making and really
basically out and here we have a very
basic layout this is what we're going to
be building together a nice big header
area a main content area with a sidebar
and a footer down at the bottom looks
simple but if you can do this you can
build this is the real foundational
skills of making really nice websites so
I'm really doing this one from scratch
so the first thing I need to do is make
a new folder on my desktop and I'm gonna
call this my first my first layout and
then I'm going to right click on there
and choose open with atom which is the
code editor that I've been using for
this whole series now I don't have much
of a layout but whenever I am doing
layouts I like having the visual here
while I'm working it just makes it a
little bit easier so I'm gonna keep this
on the side for the beginning part here
so I just hit a ctrl or command end make
a new file or of course you can use your
file new file and I'm right away going
to save that because I want to tell Adam
this is an HTML file and I'm inside my
first layout the home page which will be
the only page in this demo but will be
my index dot HTML and now I'm ready to
start writing something so the first
thing we always need to do is declare
the doctype doc type HTML and so we're
telling the browser that we have an HTML
file and then we have to open our HTML
tag and close our HTML tag to tell the
browser that won't this is where HTML is
next we need two other tags we need a
head closed head and I need my body
close body so I have my doctype then I
have my HTML tags inside of there I have
an open head closed head and I have my
body
closed body so if you remember from
earlier on our head is where we put the
extra information and the body is where
we put the content
we'll actually be seeing on the screen
so I'm first going to come into my head
here and we're gonna give this the meta
tag for our car set which is one of the
important ones and pretty much everyone
will always just be using utf-8 we're
gonna look at another meta tag that I
haven't looked at that's fun we're gonna
do meta name is author and content is
Kevin what this is it's letting people
know who the author of the site is so
well you just put your name is the
content so the name of this meta tag is
author so we're letting it know it's an
author tag and I'm putting the content
as Kevin so the author is Kevin which is
me and the next one is something we have
seen before closed title my first layout
great so I'm gonna save that and while
we're here we might as well open this up
in the browser so let's just move this
over so we can see what we're doing at
the same time and I like setting this up
so it takes up about half my window and
this on the other half and there we go I
have a blank layout but we can see that
the title is working so the next thing I
want to do we want to come into our body
and we want to start putting some
content in there so we might as well
jump down here and come and we're gonna
do three different parts to this or four
we're going to start with our header and
close header and while I'm doing this
I'm gonna pull this up so my header is
this big thing here and it's a tag we
haven't looked at it works a lot like a
div would it's exactly like you did
except it actually means something a div
is an abstract box in this case it's not
an abstract box it's the header of my
site it's where things like your logo
and your navigation go
so we have our header then we have this
area down here that has this area plus a
side bar over here so we're going to
start by doing a div class and close and
this is my container so my container
will hold everything right in the middle
of the screen and it's going to hold
these things in place so they're not
touching the sides and inside there I
have two things I have a section closed
section and I have an aside and close
aside so a section is sort of what the
name implies it's a section of my
website and the aside is like a sidebar
so a couple of new tags but again these
just like the header they work just like
a Dave it's a box that's just holding
there to hold some content but it's
letting the website know a little bit
more the website it's letting the
browser know a little bit more
information about what its purpose is
and then down at the bottom we will have
our footer close footer and that's about
it
as far as actually putting in the tags
now we just have to actually have some
content that we're going to put in here
so I'm going to start by getting rid of
this we just have our blank page there
so if I save this in refresh nothing
actually changes all of this is in place
but without any content in there we
don't see anything quite yet so in my
header let's come and just put the title
of my website h1 my first website close
h1 and that's refresh hey then there we
go awesome so now let's come down to our
section and I'm just going to use some
filler text in my section here well
let's start off with a heading so
another h1 close each one and then we'll
do a paragraph close paragraph and
another paragraph close paragraph just
so we have some stuff that's in there
this is the main content area of
this page and here it's a bit long let's
put two short paragraphs in there so
this is just some lorem ipsum text it
doesn't actually mean anything at all
and we save refresh and there we go I
have my two paragraphs and we'll jump
down over to here we have an aside so
I'll put an h2 inside my aside along
with and let's go with an ordered list
just for fun so open ordered list closed
ordered list and in there list item
closed list item and let's just do list
item one yeah it's just to fill this up
why we'd have a list item in a sidebar
you know maybe you're linking to some
websites you like this is my sidebar
awesome and at the very end down here
inside my footer I'll come down and just
put a nice simple paragraph close
paragraph and we'll grab a little bit of
filler text just to throw in there and
there we go there's my footer and as far
as the actual HTML placing the content
on the page that's it I'm gonna throw
the CSS side of things in a separate
video so that you should see that on the
screen right now you can click on that
and jump into the CSS so I look forward
to seeing you there if you have any
questions about this whole section and
header and a side and footer thing leave
it down in the comments below if you
liked the video hit the little thumbs up
and I'll see you in the next one where
we actually make this look like a real
website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
