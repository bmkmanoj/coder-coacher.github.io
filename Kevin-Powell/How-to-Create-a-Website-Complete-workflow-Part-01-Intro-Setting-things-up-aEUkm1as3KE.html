channel I hope you learn how to make the
web and how to make it look good while
you're at it with new videos every
single Wednesday in this video I'm
starting a new series that's going to
look at building out a responsive
website using things like sass flexbox
jQuery and my general workflow as well
on the screen now you can see a rough
layout of what I'm going to be building
but I'm not going to jump right into
things like I did with the last website
build in this time what I want to do is
I want to show you guys a little bit
more of my process and how I work when
I'm really building a website and if you
haven't already consider subscribing to
the channel so you don't miss out on any
of the other videos in this series and
if you like long series like this please
hit the like button to let me know and
you know so you want to see more content
like this in the future now one big
thing that I'm going to be doing
differently than what I've done in my
other videos is I'm going to be using
sass for this series sass is a CSS
preprocessor if you haven't heard of it
or don't really know how it works
well you'll still be able to follow
along but at the same time you'll see
how awesome sass is if you're really
never used or seen it or anything at all
before you have no idea what it is I
have put a few links in the description
below that could be of interest to you
now to use sass it needs to be compiled
it's not a language that the browsers
can read it has to be turned from sass
into CSS and we can set up everything we
need for this using the command line and
maybe one day we will look at that but
for now I'm going to be using an
application called pre prose pre prose
is a really nice piece of software and I
hope I'm pronouncing the name of it
right and what it does is it compiles
sass and well it also does more than
just compile sass though it also has an
auto prefix ER so you don't have to
worry about vendor prefixes which is
awesome and that's whether you're
writing sass or just regular CSS you can
turn on your auto prefixing it also has
a built-in auto refresh so as you're
working it you know you save it
automatically refreshes the browser you
don't have to do it yourself by hitting
refresh every time which is really nice
and there's other apps that do the same
thing as this it's not only pre post
there's code kit which is super popular
but I like pre post because it's
available on PC and a lot
we're only on the Mac and this it is
available on PC or Mac now you don't
have to use pre pros it's what I use but
it doesn't mean it's the only thing or
the best one but just that's what we
will be looking at in this video I'm
also going to be using github to keep
track of my project now the nice thing
about that is you guys are going to be
able to follow along if you want and if
you want to put in some pull requests
you know go for it if you don't know
what a pull request is don't worry about
it but just like with sass you could set
up everything with github with the
command line but I'm gonna be using
their software for this one just it's a
little bit more simple to follow along
with now along with all that I'm also
going to be explaining my file structure
as well as my naming convention as much
as possible as I work through the
project and on top of all of that one
thing I did forget is we're going to be
using flexbox quite a lot in this layout
I want this to be a responsive website
and while floats and clears can do the
job flexbox just makes life a lot easier
for some things and on top of that of
course we're going to be dabbling in
jQuery as well whenever it's needed now
with he'll head out of the way let's
actually jump in and start working on
the basic set up for this project so the
first thing I'm going to do is create a
repository on github so I've created a
new account here that I'll be using for
some of the projects I'll be doing for
my videos we'll call this one um
responsive start to finish description I
don't need to know public will be fine
I'm going to put in a git ignore but I'm
going to add to that in a second because
I don't have everything that I want in
there but I'm going to be using sass so
I do want it to ignore those and I'm
going to hit create repository so that's
going to start up things I have my get
ignore there and let's just go to get
ignore dot IO I think it is oops get big
Norio not get ignore so we're going to
be using Windows computer so if you're
on Windows or
back I mean using sass and I think
that's it
am I using anything else I think that's
it so I'm gonna hit create all that and
I'll just grab all of this copy that
and we'll come into my git ignore we
will edit it and this is just a basic
editor but we can go ahead and paste
that right in there and I can commit
those changes and I'm just doing this
directly to my master branch and if you
haven't used github before what this is
doing is there's certain files they get
added in if you're on a Mac there's some
file structuring things that are in
there and if you're on a PC you know a
lot of hidden files and different things
that help set up everything I could
probably no I think that's pretty good
and so the whole idea here is if there
are these little hidden files and
invisible files that you don't want
brought into here because they're just
extra fluff that you're not really
paying attention to and they're not
really part of your project then you can
have git ignore those all right so
awesome with that done now I'm going to
open up the github app and if you don't
have it you can download it over at
desktop github calm and you can get
their software right there and I'm going
to click this little plus icon and I'm
going to clone my responsive start to
finish on to my computer so because I've
already created it through their website
it exists there's a file in there my get
ignore file is in there I could just
create something on the local path
create a new one I could add something
but in this case I want to be cloning it
so I'm going to clone this one that I've
already made and we're just going to
clone it right on to my desktop I'll
click OK it should go pretty fast the
only thing we have in there is our git
ignore
no local changes let's just make sure no
changes which makes sense and if I open
it up there we go we can see just to
show you let's take a look on my desktop
it's added this folder and if I look in
there the get ignore is right there
and so far nothing has been changed so
that's normal we've brought that in and
that's it so this is set up properly
this is going to be watching for any
changes I make to my computer so
anything that I do now that's different
from what's on the website it's going to
keep track of
if you don't know github I do suggest
looking at it this tutorial is not
really looking at how to use github just
to show you the my process of you know I
will be using github so it gives you an
idea of how it works but it's not a true
tutorial on it if you are interested in
knowing more about github please leave a
comment down below and I'll be glad to
take a look at that once this series is
wrapped up ok so now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to open this up with
Adam and let's just move this over for a
second I do want to open up this folder
so I have a few things that I need to
make in there so inside of here we are
going to need my CSS folder like usual
we're going to need a JavaScript folder
and something that's a little bit
different from anything else I've done
so far if you haven't used to it is I'm
going to need a sass folder so sass is
where I'll write my sass and that will
eventually get compiled and turned into
CSS now this sass folder is where things
get a bit more interesting if you're not
familiar with sass it might be a little
confusing at first but once I start
building out the site you'll quickly
understand what I'm up to
more or less I'm going to be following
the architecture that's used by a guy
called Hugo guild del I hope I said his
name properly
goro del I'm assuming it's Gil dead
because he's French so Hugo Gil hotel
and where he sort of he has a website
called sass guidelines and I will
there's a link to that in the
description below that has got a very
nice way of organizing your files
I don't do it exactly
he does but more or less I that's the
the style that I do go with as I'm
working so what I'm going to do right
now is I'm going to open up my SAS
folder and in my SAS folder I'm going to
be creating a bunch of different folders
in here so the first one that I'm going
to be creating is called abstracts I'm
going to create another one called base
another one called components we're
going to have a layout folder and that
didn't work we're going to a layout
folder layout and I'm just trying to
think if there's anything else that
we're going to have sometimes there are
some other folders that are used in here
so you'd have things like if you're
using bootstrap you'd have a vendor's
area you can throw a bootstrap or
foundation or something like that in
there if you're making it a theme or
having different themes in there you can
have a folder for that what else well
I'm only doing the homepage but if
you're doing multiple pages in a
document you'd have a pages folder where
specific styles for different pages
would be found in those in that folder
there and yeah I think that's it and if
I need one as I work through this then
we can always add to what's in here and
with all of that done I'm going to open
up repros which is what I mentioned
before the nice little application is
going to watch this and make sure
everything's working properly you can
see here I currently have my coding
quickies in there and it's paused and
I'm going to add in a new project so
we're going to go to my quick access my
desktop and I'm going to choose that
folder select folder and it's empty
right now
sadface that's okay I'm so you can see
there's a little plus the plus play
button there and this one is paused one
thing it's important if you're not
working on a project please please
PLEASE pause it and it does use some
system resources while you're doing this
so I just strongly
you pause things if you're not watching
them but you do plan on coming back to
them if it's something you want to get
rid of you can just right click and
remove project once that project is
finished so I want to make sure that
this is set up properly so the first
thing I'm going to go and do is check
out my options and I want to look at my
project options compilers that's what
I'm actually looking for I wanted to
auto compile so my SAS options auto
compile I do want it to auto prefix my
CSS and I'm going to have it used lib
fast just because it's quite quick and I
believe that's all I need
also you can have it when you when it's
compiling it you can have it be
compressed compacted nested or expanded
I'm going to leave it as expanded which
makes it human readable just so if ever
I need to jump in there and look at it I
can you know see if there's any mistakes
or any problems coming up in there a
little bit easier so I'm going to leave
that there for now and I think that's
good
so I'm going to close that down and I
didn't save that more options project
options compilers auto prefix whoops
wrong one auto prefix CSS that's fine I
went and hit the save option so now what
I need to do just to make sure things
are working properly is I'm going to
make a new file and in my new file ooh I
should get this ignored too that's okay
I'll worry about that after what I want
to do is I want to just make sure that
this is actually working so let's uh
save in an index dot HTML there we go so
let's say this is index.html oops there
we go that's good
and I'm just going to write a nice
simple paragraph hello world I just want
to see if this is actually working so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
save that and I'm going to push this
little preview button and hit open live
preview
and that's going to open up my browser
and we can see a hello world there and
to see if this is actually working
oops I should've we're going to come in
here and a few things I'm going to do
I'm going to go in my sass folder I'm
going to make a new file I'm going to go
in here and save it as main si SS and I
will be using sass for this not s CSS
sass has two different syntaxes which
can be a little bit confusing SCSS looks
a lot more like CSS whereas SAS SAS s is
a little bit different which you'll
notice once I start writing some actual
sass so I'm going to hit save and for
now all I'm going to do is do a little
test on this so let's take this main dot
CSS and try something out
let's do body background is red and that
should have created a CSS file and it
did so what pre proces done is it's
taken my sass that I have here and it's
turned it into this so it's added in my
squiggly braces and my semicolon right
there so that's perfect so you can see
as I jump back and forth between the two
and just to make sure that pre post is
really working we have Auto refresh
going and all of that I'm going to jump
up here and just add my link SRC is
equal to not SRC it's a link it's an
href is equal to CSS / main CSS and rel
is equal to stylesheet that should turn
red there we go so the auto refresh is
working which is nice my sass is being
compiled so let's just try one more
thing just to show you again how this is
working I have my paragraph that's just
whoops I'm writing SAS not CSS paragraph
will be font size a 3m
and a color of white save and there we
go you can see it refreshed over there
it's all working it's working properly
there and I'm happy and I can also see
these things are all turning green here
and one nice thing what Adam is Adam is
built by the github people so it knows
that these files are being watched and
anything that's in green right now has
actually means those files have been
changed those are files that have been
changed since I cloned my repository so
I don't actually want any of that in my
main stylesheet um so that should make
that empty and I don't want this here
obviously that's not really the right
setup so just to finish this off a
couple of quick things to tie up is I'm
going to just come into my main dot sass
I'm not going to actually I don't have
anything to bring in here yet but I just
want to set this up so I'm going to do a
one and one is my config files and
helpers so this is my variables my
functions my mix-ins all of that will be
imported I'm going to have a section two
in here which is my vendor prefixes so
I'm going to use normalize in here vend
or not prefixes just vendor stuff you
know stuff that's already been created
I'm going to have my third thing that's
going to get loaded in is going to be my
base styles so again that's you know the
basic stuff the fonts the typography and
just the global settings anything like
that for is going to be my layout stuff
so layout what else we have after that
my components components so again that's
my buttons and anything that's you know
different little stuff like that buttons
my carousel my call to action all of
that
six will be my what else do I have I
think that's it actually I'm going to be
stopping components if I have anything
else it can get added in and what I'm
going to be doing now is that's it for
the moment and my files are ready to go
my basic thing is setup and what I've
done here is just I'm going to be
importing a whole bunch of files into
this main sass file that then is going
to get exported and/or compiled into a
CSS file and again if you're not used to
sass this might seem a little weird but
once I start doing the project I think
this is going to make a lot more sense
but this is the basic template that I
usually use and because this is the
basic template that I really use what
I'd strongly suggest that you do is that
you go ahead and if you've made
something like this or you find you're
creating a file structure that's a lot
like this and you're always doing the
same thing save it as your template file
so you don't have to create something
like this over and over and over again
every single time because this just took
me half an hour to do and that's such a
waste of time I could use this for every
single project I do now I'd probably
want to build out the basic structure of
my HTML file too and save that and it's
a template and bang we're all done so
for this video let's do one last thing
of taking all of this you can see that
there's been four changes and the way
this works is that's empty
that's a file empty this is my pre pro
switch I'm going to add to my ignore and
you can see here is my sass file
alright so super so what I want to do
now is I want to commit all of these to
the site I want to say that these are
all good these are live these are things
that I'm working with so all I'm going
to do is I want to give a little summary
so let's just call it created template
for site I'm not going to give a long
description just to added
main sass I don't need a description for
this it's pretty self-evident so just I
created the template for the site that
we will be using to build this out and
I'm going to commit all of this to the
master and now there's no more local
changes so I could take a look just to
show you guys what that's actually done
we can see right now that that I've
refreshed everything else is in there so
a minute ago we added the CSS my sass
index and again I should ignore that
I'll do that in the meantime and we can
see if I can even come into my sass file
and open it up and see it's all there
and so if you want you can clone this
get it on yours make some pull requests
on it if you're not sure how that all
works don't worry about it but you can
follow along hopefully you get a better
idea of how github works and how sass
works while you're watching me do this
now in the next video things are going
to be much more fun we're actually going
to start building the site as we're
going to be taking a look at just the
markup not one not as fun as the CSS but
the markup super important it's what
sets the structure for everything else
so we're going to be doing the markup
for the entire site all of the HTML in
the next video and after that we're
going to jump into doing the really cool
stuff of exploring sass and all the real
power that that does have if you've
