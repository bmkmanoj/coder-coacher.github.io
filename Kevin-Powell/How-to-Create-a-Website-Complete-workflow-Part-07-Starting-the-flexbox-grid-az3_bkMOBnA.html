I'm building a responsive website from A
to Z for my whole workflow everything in
there in this video we are going to be
fixing up this promote your app section
to look like that in this something that
looks like this in doing this we're also
going to have to set up the whole grid
system so things actually start working
properly I've started doing grid a
little bit but this is really where the
grid is going to take on its full-form
and it's not too complicated to do and
we're going to be doing all of that with
flexbox
so the first thing you'll have noticed
obviously is promote your app is here
and these are all sort of nudged up
against there and if we look in here the
reason for that is my grid is set to
display flex and because my grid is set
to display flex it just makes everything
sort of pile up next to each other now I
want these three columns to actually be
next to each other obviously and I've
made all of those columns so we have
column column column so that's great the
problem is over here with my h1 that
shouldn't be a column that should
actually be taking up the full space so
to fix this what I'm going to do is I'm
going to jump into my grid here where I
haven't really done anything yet except
for say that my grid is a display flex
now the thing that I want to do is at
the desktop screen size I do want that
to become a three grid system but on my
mobile display which is what we're
worrying about the most right now
if I have three columns they're going to
be awfully small they're gonna be really
really narrow so I actually want my
columns that the small screen size is
just a stack one on top of each other a
lot like what bootstrap does so the
simplest way to do that is to say that
my columns by default are a flex
zero zero 100% what that means is and
the Flex is shorthand for the Flex
shrink the Flex grow and the Flex basis
so zero zero is just making sure that
they're not shrinking or growing and the
100% is saying that they should be
taking up the full size their default
setup is a hundred percent of the screen
so I'm gonna hit save and you can see I
only have one icon now the only problem
is by putting that to 100% what's
actually happened is
staying next to each other the way
fluxbox works is their columns it
squeezes everything in next to each
other
but when you force the width on
something it will stay next to each
other and now all the tappet is I have a
300% width section which is obviously
not very good so to prevent things like
that from happening what I want to do is
I want to come back to my grid and I
just want to do a flex wrap and the
default is no wrap meaning things you
get side-scrolling sometimes and I want
to switch that over just a regular wrap
and now we'll notice that they stack one
on top of each other which is perfect
it's exactly what I wanted I wanted them
to stack on top of each other instead of
being next to one another because
they're taking up the full space just so
you can see if I give these a background
color background of pink you can see
they're taking up the the full width and
they're inside a container right now and
now the next thing I want to do is just
add the the text that I need underneath
those so I'm going to just jump into my
indexes I forgot to do this originally
so let's go find my Photoshop design
responsive design easy to set up and
great results let's see if I can
remember all that well it's easy it's
right there responsive design easy to
set up and great results and I can just
paste in my lower arm Epsom text that I
have right there paste paste and paste
so we'll save that and let's go see what
it looks like on the screen there we go
I have my text I want all of this to be
centered and actually I probably should
have done this originally on my drew my
base when it's on my small screen sizes
I just want all my text to be centered
text-align:center
I think that's just going to make our
life much much much easier now the one
part that's still busted sort of is this
promote your app and the reason for that
is my promote my app it's flexing as
well and that flexing is causing a bit
of an issue it's forcing these we have a
bit of work to do on this that's ok so
it's forcing when you flex something you
remove it's a block level element it's
sort of like if you position something
absolute it loses its width and all of
that and it shrinks down so my h1 there
let's just take a look really fast my h1
h1 whoops has a background of blue so
it's even though it's a block level
element because it's flexing it doesn't
have that full size that a block level
element normally would so my
text-align:center isn't working on that
but that's ok because when I get to my
larger screen sizes these are going to
turn back into regular columns and I
don't want that weird problem happening
with it wrapping around anymore so I'm
actually going to turn my h1 into a
column as well but it's going to be a
different type of column it's going to
have a class of column full so double L
and this is important i whoops column
column full so the reason I'm doing this
is I want it to be a column and you can
see right now it's working but when it
gets to the full screen size I don't
want it to be all of a sudden turning
into a regular column and going next to
these so I have my column full which is
always going to be a grid my column and
then I'm going to have a column column
full double L and my column full is just
going to be the same thing for now and
it's going to stay that way so the big
difference between my regular column and
my column full is my column full will
always be like this it's always going to
take up the full amount of space whereas
this column
different screen sizes will adjust and
work a little bit differently now one
thing I'd clearly need to do is create
some spacing on the top and the bottom
of this one so that luckily is nice and
easy to do I want to have equal spacing
throughout the entire site now let's go
just look at my HTML really fast sales
points is fine
there's my title whoops
title box those down there hmm I don't
actually a lot of sites I do I usually
have equal spacing on a lot of the
different things that I'm creating in
this case I'm not going to have that
equal spacing is each sections a little
bit different from the other one so
that's okay let's then do this is my
section class promo
so in let's make a new file and my SAS
layout um because I'm creating a single
page site I was I'm just going to save
it in my layout here I probably should
have done that with my hero to where it
would get its own folder um actually you
know what I'll do I'll just do a home
home promo dot SAS just it it's usually
a good idea to should I have a pages
folder I don't want to make a pages
folder in my SAS sometimes I have a
pages folder and each page would get its
own SAS file so I'm just instead of
doing that for this one I'm just going
to do it underscore home for all the
different sections on the home page
because I'm only building the home page
but technically this site would be built
out further so be one way just to name
the files in a convenient way so it's
easy to know what they're for my hero I
probably should have done the same so
home promo will go over
super and we'll go over to my main sass
@import layout home promo and we can now
get into their home promo
so I just want to put the spacing on the
top and the bottom it's on my phone it
would probably be something let's just
do it in iPhone 6 let's say some of this
so we can just go to 100% just to get an
idea okay the other spit actually the
spacing there's our nice okay so home
promo all I really need for this one is
a padding top are just your padding and
vertical height zero and I said vertical
height be view port height and that
clearly didn't work
it is promo right promo oh I'm not in
promo in sales points why am I looking
at promo on here okay well that's a
little embarrassing okay let's just do
the same thing actually I'll leave this
here we might need to change that but
I'm going to need that file later on
anyway and we'll call this one home
sales points this will get changed to
sales points and before I save that
we'll go back to my main and bring that
in there
copy paste home sales points save that
one save this one there we go some
spacing there the reason that I put V H
instead of say five Ram 10 Ram you know
it's going to correspond to if the
person flips it you can see it's getting
a little bit smaller so it's really
going to adjust itself accord
to the size of the screen if somebody is
on a iPad it will you know have a nice
big space there but if they rotate it it
shrinks down a little bit so it adjusts
according to their screen a bit which is
nice so if they're on a shorter screen
it won't fill the whole space with this
big empty space and I think that's kind
of neat
even here you can see you'll see a
scroll up right there you should be able
to see there it's getting smaller and
smaller and smaller and bigger and
bigger and bigger so I like doing that
okay so that's all good and dandy
I also need space between my sales
points I'm just trying to think so that
would be a sales point because each one
of I have my sales points is the entire
let's go take a look sales points is the
entire thing and then each one of those
is a separate sales point so each sales
point will have a margin bottom of 5m2
big WOW to em that looks better 2.5 mm
3.5 m I want a little bit of space there
and the only thing is I don't want this
bottom one to have a margin so I will
add sales point not last
yeah not last child will get a margin
bottom of zero and when I save that this
should move up just a tad of course
everything
last oh I did that wrong all of them got
it except my last one whoops I shouldn't
I don't I just do last child don't want
that there there we go did that wrong
before so if I take this off see how
there's a big space there that I'm
getting rid of right there because there
was this big extra margin on this one
that I don't want to be there which
would cause problems so the last child
doesn't get any of that margin on the
bottom there's too much sorry I kept
making it bigger and bigger and bigger
and now I think it's too much I bring
them a little bit tighter together that
looks nicer okay there we go
I'd like a little bit more space on that
one too actually on the top so that will
get a first child I'll have a margin top
of say 1.5 m and that should actually be
first of type because the first it's not
the first child and that's just to
create a bit more space here I found it
was too close I don't like that it was
you know nudging right up against it
um and more or less guys that's it I
think that looks pretty nice on mobile
devices that's looking pretty sweet so
for that video that's it it's a nice and
short one today which is great I hope
you liked it if you again if you have
any questions any comments please leave
a comment down below if you liked the
video hit the like if you haven't
already subscribed please subscribe to
the video because I have lots more of
these coming we still got a lot of work
to do in it and if you're wondering why
I haven't built it into the three
columns yet I am going to get there but
I'm going to do that all the way at the
end once I finish the whole site in this
view I'm going to go over and rework the
whole thing to work on large screens
again I hope you liked the video and
I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
