ton of confusion especially amongst
beginners when should you use which one
and why should you be using that one
this is the start of a three-part series
we're gonna explore this and get really
in depth on how padding and margin
really work even if you think you know
how margins and padding work I encourage
you to actually watch the whole thing
because I'm not just glossing over all
of this I mean I'm making a three part
series on margins of padding of all
things I'm looking at really how they
work including some weird and quirky
behaviors that you might not fully
expect or understand so hi there my name
is Kevin and here at my channel we learn
how to make the web and how to make it
look good while we're at it and really
that's the plan for this series we're
going to be starting with this video
really nice and simple what are margins
and padding like the real basics behind
them when you should choose one over the
other one and just the basic behaviors
that you might expect from them in the
next video we're gonna explore one of
the most annoying concepts that a lot of
people don't understand which is
collapsing margins along the way we're
also going to explore how we can change
the behavior of margins and padding's
through changing the box sizing property
and once we really understand how
everything is working and we're super
comfortable with it all we're gonna make
a third video where what we're doing is
actually building out a nice realistic
looking thing where I'm gonna be taking
a deep dive into my thought process
behind margins and padding's and that
video isn't so much on how they're
working it's how we can use them to make
things look good and understanding why
space is important or why empty space is
important and how we can leverage that
empty space to make a better looking
design so enough of an introduction that
was a long one I apologize for that
let's jump right into it now alright so
here we are in code pen so the link for
this will be shared below but you don't
really need it it's a really simple
thing for the moment I've commented out
a little bit so we can focus on one box
but I'll bring in some other boxes after
when we start exploring things a little
more basically I have a box here with
100 height 100 and I have a little
margin of 10 at the moment just creating
some empty space around it so basically
what margins doing is it's creating
empty space around my box so it's giving
me this space right here going around
and it's keeping it off the edge of my
screen
so if I had a margin of zero you can see
it actually be touching the side of it
so the margin property that was actually
a shorthand so that's why when I do a
margin of 10 it's pushing it across by
10 and down by 10 and it's actually
adding 10 to the bottom and to the right
all at the same time we can control all
of them separately so I can say
something like margin top of 100 pixels
and it just creates an empty space of
100 pixels on top of that box and
actually I should be putting this on my
box here so margin bottom of 100 pixels
that was a margin top wasn't it top of
100 pixels so it's gonna push that one
box down now what we could also do let's
turn this second box on all rights just
bring them all in I guess so you can see
that's pushing this down now so now if I
go on my box number one and I give that
a margin bottom of 10 100 pixels now
it's creating the empty space on the
bottom and one last one margin left 50
pixels and it will push it over 50
pixels I could add margin to the right
we just won't see it because there's
nothing on the right of my box right now
so margin is the fundamental way of
creating empty space around something it
pushes things away from or either it's
pushing away from stuff basically it's
pushing away from everything else so
it's creating this empty space that
nothing else can be inside of as I
mentioned this is a shorthand or this is
the long way of writing it the shorthand
is just a margin property by itself so I
could actually get this exact same thing
well we also margin right so let's just
add a margin right of also 50 pixels so
I could write all of that margin top
bottom left and right all inside of here
so I could say the margin top is 100
pixels then the margin right is gonna be
50 pixels the margin bottom is 100
pixels and the margin left is 50 pixels
so this is exactly what I had written
before now what this is doing is it goes
in the order of a clock so it's top
right bottom the left
so if I change this bottom one to 200
that space will get bigger or if I make
this one only 10 pixels the space on top
will get smaller so I can control them
all separately now you don't have to
write for properties in here you could
write only three so in this case I have
1050 250 so these ones are different but
my left and the right are the same if I
took off the last one it's going to use
this for both the left and the right so
I have a hundred on the top 50 on the
left and the right and then 200 pixels
on the bottom now if I get rid of the
200 here what's going to happen is is
it's gonna use this one for the top and
bottom and this one for the left and the
right so you can see when I it's bigger
and when I take that off it gets smaller
so now it's 100 100 and then 50 50 and
if I take this off then it's 100 on all
four sides so when it's just margin and
a number all the sides are getting the
same margin so margin is creating all of
this empty space around an object on the
outside of the content of that object
padding works very exactly much the same
the only difference is it's inside of my
box instead of on the outside of my box
so if I go padding 100 pixels on box
number two it's taking up the same
amount of space as this one because I
have empty space empty space empty space
empty space in this case the content is
the same as it was before but I'm adding
space inside of my box just to really
highlight what's actually happening here
that's a write some text inside of these
so we can see where it's going so here I
have one and it's just that's how you'd
expect it to here we can see number two
so two isn't stuck up here in the corner
because I'm adding empty space inside of
my box so let's just make this let's go
back to zero so it looks like this one
does here or all the other ones so I
have my two and then I'm gonna do
padding let's just do a padding top
of 100 pixels to make sure you really
get it so it's adding empty space inside
my box so it's adding a hundred pixels
of empty space then I get to my content
so if I do my padding left of 100 pixels
now it's adding that empty space inside
and then my content box can start so
there's my content inside of there so
that's why if we just did padding 100
pixels these two effectively are the
same size as one another this one is
just with at whitespace around it and
this one includes the background color
now it's really important to remember
that under normal circumstances like
this one padding adds to the total size
of my box my box has gotten bigger we
can change this behavior by changing the
box sizing property but we'll see that
in another video but for now it's when
we're playing with margins and padding's
they add to the total size of things so
you might have a nice calculated out
layout where you have three columns and
it's all looking good and you go
actually I want to make my width a bit
more padding on that and then now it
breaks your layout and that could be
because all of a sudden your elements
bigger than it used to be so just always
remember margin padding and border which
I'm not talking about in this video add
to the total size of things and I'm not
talking about border because people
usually understand border I find margin
and padding people mix them up now the
other thing that's important to remember
is if they don't have a background color
on them you won't notice a difference
because the big thing that makes the big
difference between the two is the
background color this includes
background color this doesn't if on my
box one here we took off the background
color it looks like that and if I change
this to padding it looks exactly the
same
literally nothing changed because
there's no background color so we can't
see a difference now that doesn't mean
that one is better or that doesn't mean
you shouldn't be choosing the right one
there's still a better choice to make
between the padding in the margin is
just when there's no background color at
all and nothing that would really
distinguish it it's a lot less important
and it also me sometimes makes it harder
to choose should I be choosing padding
or should I be choosing margin and
honestly luckily we're just writing
stuff and then stuff happens on the
screen
and so if you don't remember which one
to use
you try one new I want padding and then
oh no no that's not what I wanted I want
to push it away that must have been
margin hey there you go you fixed it so
it's nice and simple just to be able to
you know switch between one or the other
especially while you're learning them
because you know it's probably the best
way to do it and to really get in there
now one thing that's really fundamental
with margins and padding also is being
able to Center something horizontally on
the screen so let's go and do this with
box number 30 so to be able to Center
something on the screen you might have
already found it or used it but I want
to make sure you understand what's
happening is using auto margins so on my
box through here I'm gonna do a margin
but I'm not going to do it on all sides
I'm just going to a margin left of auto
and I don't know if you know what's
gonna happen or not
but take a guess at what's gonna happen
if you're not sure and it's probably not
what you expect is that what you would
thought would happen it just shoots
across the screen the margin left of
Auto means make the margin on the left
side as big as possible
and make it fill up the space so that
means it doesn't matter what the space
is the size can change and it's
automatically calculating this margin
it's figuring it out on its own to know
how big it should be so that margin is
just automatically calculated to fill up
the entire space I could do the same
thing with a margin right but we
wouldn't see anything because it's
already lined up on that side but we can
do is we can do a margin right and a
margin left of auto and that's going to
Center it bang in the middle because
it's automatically calculating this one
and this one to fill up as much space as
possible and that means they're gonna be
the same size all the time and it's just
going to be perfectly centered on the
screen now this is really a fundamental
concept of how to Center something but
we also there's one sort of drawback
let's get rid of all of these just leave
our box number for what some people
think they can then do is do a margin
top of zero
of auto and a margin-bottom
of auto and nothing happens what why not
honestly because CSS there's no other
explanation
it's how it's written in the spec it
says that if the margin top or bottom
are set to auto it will just be
calculated as zero that's literally what
the spec on this says so that's why it
doesn't actually move so that's why you
usually see something like a margin:0
auto to center something on the screen
just reset you know making and actually
now that I think about it this is how I
always write it but if the spec says
that margin top and bottom auto is zero
you could just write it like that you
don't really need the zero auto this is
just more explicit and saying that the
top and bottom are zero unless you play
with it a bit I guess but the left and
right will Center it up and down won't
now if you get into flexbox and grid
maybe you'll find some other information
on this things work a little differently
than you might expect but looking at the
very basic level like this vertically
centering is hard horizontally centering
super easy margin left and margin right
zero will Center it on the screen
because it automatically calculates them
to be as big as possible and that's just
one of the quirky behaviors of CSS is
yeah with margins I should say well of
CSS to CSS is full of quirky behaviors
and that's why I'm doing a series like
this because weird stuff like this we're
gonna see more quirky behaviors in the
next one and that's it for this video
