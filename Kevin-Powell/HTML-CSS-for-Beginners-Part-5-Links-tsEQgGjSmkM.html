series on HTML and CSS for beginners my
name is Kevin and this week we're
looking at creating links in our code so
let's hop to it links are what make the
web well
the web it just wouldn't have worked if
we couldn't link from one site to
another you know what would be the point
then the whole idea behind HTML you know
HT is hypertext and it's not normal text
it means we have hyperlinks and they
linked from one page to another or from
different parts of a page you know from
the top of a page we can link to lower
down in the same page like paragraphs
and headings links have a tag and
they're not the most intuitive tag cuz
then not really link tags they're anchor
tags when you think of anchor though it
makes a lot of sense it's an a tag just
like that a and close a no y anchor tags
well links used to work a little
differently and the whole idea was to
create anchor points throughout one
document this led us link to the
different parts on one page so you think
of a scientific paper back in the day
they'd make a page for it'd be a really
long article and you'd have a table of
contents and you could click on the
different section you wanted and it
would just bring you there
so we rank we're creating anchors
throughout the whole site and you could
quickly access all those different
places the anchor tag is stuck around
even though the usage of it is a little
bit different now and actually the
original way they used to work it's not
even supported anymore so let's say I've
put in my a tag here but on like all
these other tags that we've looked at so
far an a tag by itself won't really do
anything like here I have my P close P
so I'm telling it that this is a
paragraph or have my strong close strong
I'm telling it that that area is bold or
has emphasis on it for my italic text
but in a tag all in its own word we want
to link to so we have to learn a little
bit of new vocabulary for dealing with
links and that word is attribute we're
gonna see some other attributes as we go
on but for links the most important one
and the only one really need is the href
so this this links not going anywhere
it's not really showing on my
Paige but I have to give it an href so
I'm a new href is equal to and you can
see my code editors actually changed the
color of that let's just take this out
so we can see it all on one line
actually don't like that I'm just gonna
delete all of this actually let's start
my link there so it's right at the top
and easier for you to see and we don't
need all these other things in here
anymore so let's save my file so we have
my link right up here and my href is
where is it going to this stands for
hypertext reference so whenever I write
an attribute I'm sticking inside my
normal I'm inside the opening tag I'm
putting a space and then I'm writing it
and you can actually see most code
editors will do this will they'll try
and us you know help you out what are we
doing so the second I put a space it's
gonna go and look for all the different
attributes that I'm I could actually put
on this and I want my href following the
href is the equal sign so my hypertext
reference is equal to and then in
quotation marks I'm going to put where I
want this to go to so for this demo
let's make it HTTP WWWE
save that let's refresh over here and I
can see there we go I have a nice link
it's made it blue it's underlined it all
by default now you'll notice that I put
HTTP colon forward slash forward slash
here no one actually writes this when
they're going to a web site anymore you
know if you're old enough to remember
you might have actually have had to
written this in the browser and they're
really old days these days everything is
HTTP so we never even write it and most
browsers won't even show that we just
see this part of it but it's really
important that we include the HTTP colon
forward slash forward slash when we're
making a link to a web page that's
somewhere else so let's just see I'm
gonna click here and we'll see that I
load up and there's Google awesome so
I'm going to go back and let's just take
that HTTP out and show you what it does
I'm gonna save and I'm gonna refresh and
I'm gonna click on this and the files
not found
if you come up and look in the address
here it's looking for it on my desktop
in my first website folder that I
created and then it's looking for a file
called WWE Google comm inside of there
and obviously that doesn't exist without
the HTTP it thinks it should be looking
inside that site so I'm gonna undo bring
back my HTTP save that let's go back
refresh and try again and now we can see
it's actually working awesome and what
this is called is an absolute link the
path here is absolute it's the exact
address for Google com by including the
HTTP colon forward slash forward slash
we're telling the browser this is
exactly where it needs to go this is the
exact address it's the absolute path if
I want to link to another page on my
site though then we can use something
called a relative link or a relative
path so let's make a new file and I'm
gonna copy this so let's just go copy
make a new file paste all that in there
but all the way here at the top I'm
gonna change this to say page two you
also notice that everything is in gray
right now so if you remember back to the
second video in this series when I made
our first page and let's just change our
title here to actually it's not my first
webpage this is page two you'll remember
that when I did that one we had to save
our document and tell the browser it's
an HTML file right now my code editor
even though I have all this stuff up
here my code editor doesn't know this
should be an HTML file it's only going
to know that once I go and I sit do my
save and let's just call this one page
two dot HTML and hit save now my code
editor knows it's an HTML file so all
the color coding comes back in here also
most creditors are going to use a tab
system so you can see up here I have my
tabs I'm going to click back on my
indexed tab and let's add a new link
down right here and so a and let's just
make this
age - oops sorry about that page to
close a and then I'll come back into the
opening page ref is equal to and in this
case I don't need an absolute path I
don't have my HTTP I don't need to
include all that I'm inside of my folder
already so my index file is living in
one place let's go take a look
there we go my index file is here and I
just want to switch from here over into
this file so because they're living and
they're right next to each other all I
have to do is write the name of that
file page - dot HTML get that out of the
way I'm gonna save this refresh over
here and my link is there and if I click
on it I'm on page two and if I push back
I go back to page one this one zoomed in
let's reset so just like when I took out
the HTTP here with my Google link when I
clicked on that it was looking inside of
that original folder and it was just
going it was replacing this with wwq
cool calm which didn't make any sense
and didn't work so when I include this
it knows it's looking for a web page
somewhere else on the internet it's not
in my own files it's not in my root
folder it's off somewhere else if I
don't include the HTTP colon forward
slash forward slash like I haven't here
it just assumes that the file is inside
of this folder and it's gonna look for
it right there so again this is an
absolute link and this is a relative
link and my relative means it's relative
to this so I have my page two and boom
there's my page two and we can go right
into that we're gonna see a lot more
about relative and absolute paths also
in our next video where we're gonna be
looking at images because images we also
have to tell it where to find the
picture so that's it for links and as
you can now assume the next video we're
gonna look at is putting some pictures
in there and making things look a lot
more fun since we can actually include
some visuals so I hope you like this

time have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
