week's video I'm going to explore how to
design a website with Photoshop so stick
around okay so I'm really excited about
the video this week guys this is
something that I've been wanting to do
for a while if you have been following
along you probably noticed that most of
my videos have been about development
and the coding side of things and not so
much on the design side of things very
much so this is a big deal for me
because I am a designer and I teach
mostly design the program I teach you
computer graphics Photoshop Illustrator
InDesign a whole bunch of stuff and
there is some coding and stuff in there
but the main reason I started this
channel was I love coding I'll enjoy
coding I only really teach the
entry-level stuff and I wanted to be
able to give myself an excuse to push
the boundaries more and I thought what
better way than to make videos so it
really forces me to keep pushing and
keep learning and it's a lot of fun but
I'm still a designer at heart I worked
in the print industry for five years
before I did any web stuff whatsoever
design for me is something that is
really important and I started this
channel the slogan type thing I came up
with was let's learn how to build the
web and how to make it look good while
we're at it and I haven't been talking
enough about how to make it look at
while we're at it I think it's really
important that the web looks good
it should be functional function is
number one but if it doesn't look good
people aren't going to get to enjoy that
function because there go well it's ugly
in the leaf we don't want that to happen
so I want to introduce you to how I
design websites that my thought process
going into it whole thing was going to
be really long I sped the whole thing up
to 300% the actual speed and I narrated
on top of it I when I did my original
narration what I found was I wasn't
really explaining my thought process I
was just explaining what I was doing
what I want to get across with this
video is the thought process I'm putting
behind things why am i doing that why am
I putting space up there why am i
putting a button there why am i leaving
padding why am i overlapping things the
way I am whatever it is I am using
Photoshop in this I am on a PC as you
probably know if you've watched my other
videos so I sketch isn't available and I
no sketch is the big trendy thing
there is also Adobe XD and sadly the PC
version is still behind the Mac version
I've played around with it a bit I'm not
super comfortable with it I want to
learn it more but I keep getting
frustrated and then I see things you can
do but I can't do it maybe they've
updated it since I last tried it I'm not
sure but for now I'm still using
Photoshop so yeah before I even get into
Photoshop though and part I'm not really
going to get into too much detail with
it's one thing my students in class
don't like me much and that's the the
design process a little bit so you know
this type of stuff drying out your
thumbnails or your wireframes or
whatever you want to call them people
don't like doing that but it's important
so this here I'll just hold it up a
little closer as some ideas that I had
along the way just some things I was
doing I've did a bit of that and then I
sort of had some ideas and actually got
out my book I have a little book that
you look and can you get it the exposure
is really high in my camera there's a
little dot so it just makes it easier to
follow a grid I don't like using a ruler
stuff like that so this one is the site
that we're going to be doing so it's
going to be for a band like a music site
type of thing so I just sketched out
sort of the rough layout that I want to
be following here so there's the main
just typical header hero section here we
have this About section where it's going
to a nice picture and then here is going
to be some text and then these three are
the band members so I think that's me
cool they're sort of overlapping a
little bit we'll have a music section
here with the album's another button
wreaking I guess get to buy the music
this is upcoming shows right there and
then just a simple footer down at the
bottom and I did do a mobile version
here just to give myself an idea of how
I want it to sort of transition from
from one to the other because I'm not
actually going to design this in
Photoshop my photoshop's designs always
the most complicated one and if I had a
client that really wanted to see all
this shirt then we can do this but I'm
just designing this and then I know how
it's going to break once I start doing
it the other thing is I'm going to be
building this site after we design it in
bootstrap so yeah that should be a lot
of fun I've had
a lot of people requesting sites for
bootstrap but enough of that you don't
want to talk about this anymore you want
to see me designing because that's what
you came here for let's just jump into
it and look at how I do all of this in
Photoshop okay so here we are in
Photoshop in is as you can see I am
using a template for this I got the
template from hacker themes I'm going to
include the link in the description
below it has all the different sizes
extra small small no sorry small medium
large and extra large there is an extra
small now with bootstrap but anyway the
I'm only going to be using this big one
I'm turning off all the other layers
because I don't want to be designing on
those I only want to be designing on
this one here
I like having these types of templates
just where I have an overlay I can see
the columns really easily here just to
show you I have already picked up my
pictures that I'm going to be using and
I've already picked out a bit of a color
theme mostly focusing on the darks I
want this to be a dark website I'm doing
like a rock band it's you know music and
all of that so I was thinking the red
it's sort of an aggressive ish color
plus just those dark colors it makes me
think more of the the style that you
know it's the first things that sort of
came to my mind so here I'm just putting
in my navbar I was having some trouble
with the color oh and just really fast
I'm changing here the proof set up just
make sure if you have this set up the
same way I'm setting it up you want to
have the proof colors on if you choose a
color and it's the colors look faded
just make sure that your proof is on and
that your proof set up is to monitor RGB
the fonts I'm using are two different
fonts that I've picked from Typekit so I
picked this one just because it looked
sort of grungy and bandy and rock band
style so I like that one it's called van
Chi and the other one I'm using is mr.
Eve's it's just a really nice clean font
with the one kind of weird font that I'm
going with I wanted something really
clean something really easy to read that
would be for most of my text it kind of
a neutral font that just looks nice and
with the other one getting the the style
across more so right now all I'm doing
is playing one at the font sizes a
little bit just to try and make it look
good
I wasn't super happy with how it was
looking at the moment but I do come back
and revisit this shortly just because it
there's something going on I was trying
all caps making it bolder less bold it
wasn't quite working but I said you know
good enough for now I made my group
called it navigation put it underneath
you know organizing my layers nice and
properly I like changing the color of my
layers just to keep organized and now
I'm putting in my main background color
that I went I started with this really
dark one but I end up changing it a
little bit because I didn't like the
purplish purple purplish mists of it
once I started working with my imagery I
really wanted to go with this red and
blackish type of thing I find a lot of
the time when I do pick my colors it's
especially at the beginning I have the
ideas of the colors I want but they do
end up changing over time don't be
scared you know you come up with some
colors you like your colors you can go
through and change the map that there's
nothing wrong with that right now as you
can see up above I didn't like what my
navbar was looking like I changed it I
liked it a lot more once I switched
those colors to the new colors I found
now I'm trying to do is just set up my
hero image I believe I'm going to make
it black and white there we go because I
didn't want the colors coming through
and I just wanted a nice simple image
that I could use something that doesn't
stand out too much I'm going to fade it
away a little bit and the idea here is
just it gives you the feel it has the
band atmosphere it has the band feeling
to it it's going to be a nice visual but
the text on top of it is what's going to
stand out more so I was just trying to
fade this away a little bit make it more
of a background image something that
isn't as noticeable so and then I'm
going to plug my text on top and many
use or I'm going to organize my layers
and then I'm going to bring the text on
top when I'm dealing with my text a lot
of time I'm just going to copy a layer
over like I did there and then
reorganize I really wanted to use this
font as the one that stands out as I
mentioned before so it's going to be
whenever I use this except in the logo
area it's going to be big it's going to
be in your face a little bit just like
the music you know it's rock music it's
more aggressive it's in-your-face all of
that so I wanted that to
be coming across through the font and
through the the style of what that's
doing and I was looking for a music
lorem ipsum generator I got the I put
rock hips and it came up with the rock
so then anyway we ended up finding when
I got a Metallica so just some random
Metallica lyrics into lorem ipsum just
to give myself some text to play with
this text especially in the hero area
should be easy to read should you know
the person sees the image or the main
hero area here they see the the text
should grab their attention and then not
a lot of text just a little bit of text
they're going to read it right away
they're know if they're sticking around
or not and then a button like you
usually see that's just going to be
getting them to go a little bit further
down on the site the main thing here is
what's you know what's the person going
to do we've got them if we have their
attention they're going to skim through
that text and hopefully they're going to
click listen to our music that's I'm
assuming what they're here for
um so I'm just trying to organize my
layers once again every now and then we
take a little bit of a pause as I i
reorganize my layers it's important that
you try and organize your layers as much
as possible if you are whatever software
you're using really especially with
websites if you're designing a website
it's really easy for the layers to
quickly get order control with this now
I'm coming into that area where I wanted
the two columns like 50% each one of
them is going to be a big picture the
other one's going to be the text and as
I'm doing most of the time I want to get
big images I want things that really do
grab the attention I'm going to put the
title on top of this after two so this
big image should be grabbing your
attention it should be attracting you
into that and then it's going to say the
about so your eyes sort of is brought to
that area and then if you are interested
in it you're gonna your eyes will sort
of glance over to the text after I'm
really trying to lead my the persons I
wasn't happy with my first picture so I
switched it out for this one
but yeah I'm trying to lead the person's
eye so the eye is going to come down if
they're scrolling down from the top as
soon as they get here the their eyes
immediately going to go to the image
no matter what I try they're not going
to read the text right away but in then
if that gets their attention
they will then look over at the text um
so you do want to be thinking about
these things as you're designing things
what how are you getting them to look at
the next sections your website is there
something that is grabbing their
attention is there something that they
should be looking at what's going to
lead them from this section into the
next section to keep them scrolling you
know you want them to stay on the
website so and now I'm just sort of
taking the time to organize it properly
looking at the grid that I had um yeah
so just how are you leading them so
that's the idea with with this next part
that I'm going to do in a second - I'm
going to bring in my three artists so
we're going to see that in a second here
one site once again we're gonna is my
layers here so um yeah don't know much
to say at the moment here we go so as
I'm just going to build one of them I
think and then I end up just copying it
over so the idea here is I want these to
overlap just a little bit with them the
the About section because it is a
continuation of the About section really
so I have my About section and then it's
going to be the three band members and
you know there could be more but in this
case I'm doing three band members so
because they're overlapping a little bit
it is pulling the person from that About
section down into the next section or
that's what I would hope that would
happen anyway so there really see the
About section even if they don't end up
reading it even if they just got to that
picture then they see this overlapping
thing there's gonna be three pictures
there that might pull them down into the
next section I also want to put a bit of
emphasis here on my my text once again
so trying the colors the red I was going
to use the red and I was trying that
other font but it really didn't work so
I switched that back out and then I just
started playing around with it a little
bit looking at the font weights font
sizes things like that I was going to go
with the red
but I found that the red didn't stand
out enough and the white the lead singer
part even though it's smaller stood out
to me more because it's higher contrast
the white and the white and black is
higher contrast and the red and black
and be careful when you using red and
black it's actually a harder one to use
than I thought I'd changed it maybe I
left it red now that I'm looking at it I
will change that to white if I don't end
up changing that after I find I don't
like it too much right now looking at it
say these three pictures will help lead
me in I'm just trying to find a good
picture to be using for my drummer and
so now is just the fun part of just
trying to organize my layers properly
again and name my layers properly and
all of that and again I can't emphasize
that enough you want to be doing that as
much as possible I think now if I
remember yeah I'm going to play with the
oppa I knew that the white was standing
away too much so I just lowered I made
them a little bit of a light gray
instead just so they're not popping off
in the same way that they were popping
off before my artboard wasn't big enough
so I'm just dragging that down to make
give myself some more room to work with
and now we're going to get into this
next thing now what I want to do here
and again I'm thinking about how I can
lead the person into the next thing so
I'm going to have this music section
here which is going to be the album's
actually before I talk about that I
think I play with the font sizes now a
little bit or maybe I do that after
let's see I'm just trying to like once
again organize everything properly yeah
yeah now yeah so I'm looking at the font
size I mean it's way too big that our
music is just massive I found it much
too big oh I didn't do it yet I would
get there in a second I guess these
albums I don't actually do the albums
now I come back and I don't do them in
the design I didn't want to just start
randomly designing album covers well you
guys were watching this it was sort of a
waste of time this is more focused on
the design
not on album covers so I'm going to find
some images and throw them in their
design something really quick before we
actually start coding this out
so this was just a little placeholder
that's where the albums will be and yeah
I just wanted to see that that will be
six albums that are there um so let's
see what I do next just did this too and
I don't remember everything I did I
don't remember what I'm looking at I
guess I'm just organizing layers again
the way I work is terrible four layer
organization I'm bringing the button
down okay I'm really bad at well I'm not
bad I keep my layers organized but I
just find the way I work leads me to be
like reordering my layers constantly
before I group it and then it's set and
I'm happy with it and I don't touch it
again but just I things get mixed up a
lot and then I have to go through and
fix everything up it's a bit of a pain
in the butt but it's just the way I work
and this artboard was never big enough I
keep having to make it bigger all the
time so um let's see okay yeah oh now
what I wanted to do this image is going
to act as a parallax image I want to
bring a parallax image as a background
image here and again it's just something
to try and connect one section into the
next section a little bit so that about
section we have those three pictures
that you'll see then there's this
background image that's going to be a
little bit of out of focus it's going to
be parallax so it's going to scroll it
at a different rate but it's connecting
the person into the next section of the
site I'm all for like these big banded
sections it's really trendy right now
where you just have like a big like one
color background then you have the next
bar and it's another color there's
nothing wrong with that they work really
well but I really want to put a lot of
emphasis on this site on just like
things melding from one section into
another trying to make it a bit more
organic and save just like here's one
section here's another section here's
another section I wanted them to flow a
little bit more in one to the next so
this parallax II type background image
my idea there is again it just keeps the
person moving down the site it keeps
them looking at the site and hopefully
you know it keep
the whole idea here is that they just
they keep going to keep going so now
we're coming up upcoming shows or maybe
it's now I decided the font sizes were
too big it's possible yes it is so now
I'm just starting to play with the font
sizes I wanted to keep that one big font
size all the way at the top the same I
like that one but these other ones here
I wanted to make them a bit smaller I
just found it was way over the top so I
didn't make them a lot smaller I am
making them all the same I want them all
to be the same size because of how I'm
going to be doing it you know they're
they're all in equal heading whenever
they say make it in h2 or something like
that I want them all to be the same they
were just way too big
and obviously with media queries and
stuff they're going to have to get
smaller at other screen sizes too but
that's you know I'm not worrying about
that i'm just wearing about the big
screen size for now here's the upcoming
shows I'm doing so I'm going to do like
the I want to play with the since I'm
doing this with bootstrap and I'm pretty
sure I'm going to be doing with
bootstrap for I want to play with the
card system they have they have like
this image overlay type thing so that
was sort of why I'm designing this the
way I am where it's going to be an image
with all the information for the show on
top of it yeah so I think this would be
kind of fun to do it's a nice way again
law I like having images in it it images
catch the eye more than text generally
does even though you want the people
reading the text so it isn't really
important I seen I said I remember what
side it was on I was on a site today for
a big company I wish I could remember
what it was but it doesn't matter they
had a background image with text on it
and I couldn't read half of the text I
had to highlight it to read it if you
are going to be putting images in most
images don't work well as background
images
you got a darken or lighten image or
something here I'm just grabbing some
font awesome stuff to put in I know font
awesome isn't incorporated into
bootstrap for it was in part of three
they took it out for four but you can
still use it of course so I want to use
that just for these little icons here
and I think they'll look good and it's
just to set the date and all that but
again the imagery is what gets attention
but don't let the imagery rule your
sight
we can't rule a site it has to be the
text that's most important because the
text is what actually has the
information the imagery and the visuals
and the colors are what get people to
stick on the site and to keep going but
if you can't read what's actually on
there you're not going to actually stay
on the site it needs to be clear it
needs to be concise it needs to be
really obvious what's actually going on
so and if you can't read the text then
people are gone so the text is king all
the time and it's one thing that I find
people forget a lot they make these
really wicked designs and the text is
sort of ignored so the detail that you
put into the text and just hear my music
festivals in bold and then the slightly
smaller font size
and normal and it's not bold anymore for
the the Montreal location thing just
because I want you know the music
festival is you know what's the music
what's the concert and then where is the
concert it's just you're creating a bit
of a visual hierarchy which is really
important and it just breaks it up
people can see it's two different pieces
of information right away and the font
size between those is actually a little
different I think I did 24 and 21 or
something like that so it is important
to make these things to break up the
text you need to if it's two different
pieces of information either spread them
out a little bit change the font size a
little bit change the font weight a
little bit things like that to make it
clear that it's two different pieces of
information and that's really important
because people forget to do that all the
time
and it may it makes it harder to read
the site the tension to detail really
needs to be put into the text I can't
stress that enough and now we're getting
into the footer that's pretty much the
design done we got to the shows people
have scrolled all the way down maybe I
should have put the upcoming shows
higher well if they're interested in the
band they'd like their music then
they'll be looking at the shows that
makes sense right so here I'm just
putting a super simple footer I hate
designing footers especially for mock-up
or not mock-up but Generico sites like
this where I don't actually have content
and other pages and all of that and
stuff to put in the footer I'm just
putting a copyright thing here and I'm
going to put in the social links so
originally and I do icons for these but
I thought it would be nice it's just a
nice clean
way to finish off the site just by
having them as text links and I'm just
putting this grayed out little forward
slash between them as a separator
because it stood out way too much before
that so you know lowered it making it a
lot less contrast anyway that's it there
we go
that is everything I hope you like it
yeah and we're going to start coding
this up very soon next week that we're
going to be looking at how we can code
this oh wait yeah one last touch here I
did I wanted to I wasn't happy with my
colors so I came and revisited this hero
section so I was looking for a gradient
UI gradients I'll put the link to that
down below I love UI gradients so I just
wanted to come in here and throw a
gradient in to bring I have all these
really nice colors to the rest of the
site what I wanted up here which look
good at the beginning but now that all
those images have these cool colors in
it it wasn't looking so hot so I wanted
something that would just bring in a bit
more of an interesting look and visual
here so I'm just going crazy with the
blending modes this one I thought looked
cool the colors go really well in
contrast with the red and they are found
in other parts of the site too so you
know it's it's what do you call it
complementary colors pretty much the red
and the the colors I'm using there so I
thought it looked good I wasn't super
happy with it so I was playing with this
red a little bit to try and get it to
blend in a little better I think I just
end up fading things out a little bit
instead um is I believe what I end up
doing let's see in a second oh and I'd
lost that button I don't know what I did
with that button I think at one point I
thought I was copying it but I just
dragged it down somewhere else instead
so I had to make my button again and
yeah with that button there it sort of
balances everything out a little bit
better than what I had before and I was
really happy with it I think it looks
really nice I hope you think it looks
good too let me know what you think of
the design and all of that and yeah I'd
really like to know what you think of
this so please let me know down in the
comments below what you think of the
overall design and there
the design thank you so much for
watching I hope you guys liked it if you
did like it please hit the like button
below if you haven't subscribed consider
hitting that subscribe button because
then you can see how I end up coding
this up next week and new videos every
single Wednesday plus other stuff that
will get thrown in along the way too I
seem to be doing that more and more
these days again thank you for watching
and until next time take it easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
