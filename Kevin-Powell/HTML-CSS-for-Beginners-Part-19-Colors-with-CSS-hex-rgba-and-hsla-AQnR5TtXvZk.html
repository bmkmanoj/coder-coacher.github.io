at colors in CSS we have a few different
ones hex RGB a HSL and how we can do
some transparencies as well so in the
last video we set up this little thing
and I'm not gonna worry about the layout
so much if you're curious how I got all
these boxes like this go look at the
previous one where we are looking at
floats and clears but for today we're
gonna be looking at colors we have a
whole bunch of colors here so it works
out really well
now there's three are actually four
different types of ways of doing colors
so let's jump over here you would have
seen in the last video that I used color
names to put in my colors I find doing
demos using color names is really nice
and handy cuz you just put in a color
you don't have to sort of figure out
what it is and the color shows up so
pink red firebrick this is a little less
obvious but it's just a color I know now
you might be wondering where can I find
all these color values and or color
names I should say and like in so many
cases the w3schools does have a nice
resource for it just flick up this is
HTML color names CSS color names and
they'll give you the name and they'll
give you you know I'll show you an
example and you'll notice a few of them
or repetitive gray they've done it with
both types of spelling for example gray
again dark slate gray deep you know
dim gray they have lots and lots and you
can go and find your favorite in there I
don't really like using these for actual
design purposes though it's handy for
just doing things faster when you don't
want to have to think about what color
you want but when you don't need actual
precision because if I want to pink it's
not really the thing I want and well I
don't want hot pink I don't want pink
don't want light pink I have a very
specific color I need and I can't get to
that color when I'm using these color
names here so another way we can and
I've done this a lot in my demos is
using hexadecimal so ff0000 now
hexadecimal that should keep
exactly the same and it does hexadecimal
is a system effectively what it is is
you put the hash tag and then a red red
green green blue blue values so the
first two are corresponding to read the
second two are corresponding to green
the next two are corresponding to blue
for my RGB and it's a scale of 0 to F
and that's a little strange of a scale
so that's why I have letters and numbers
mixed in there so basically you go 0 up
to 9 and then the we can't really do a
10 because that's two digits so then we
jump to a and then from a we can go all
the way up to F and the way this is
working if I look here it's F F so f F
is the highest possible so I'm maxing
out my red and then I have no green and
no blue so I just get a pure red if I
were to come in here and do an F F on my
green I get yellow green plus red will
give me yellow obviously I just did that
and whoops not D D F F and I can get a
pink that way right there let's bring
that back to zero zero so if it's all
zeros I get black and if it's all FS it
save whoa save the wrong file save and
will be white so in general the lower if
you see a lots of numbers in here will
be very dark if you see lots of letters
in there it will be brighter and you can
take rough guesses at colors you're
gonna get but in general I'm gonna use a
color picker and you might remember I
used this color picker back in the day
back in the day in a previous video and
we just have to do a Google search for
color picker don't write anything else
and you will get this kind of annoying
that it won't go away there we go a nice
color picker and in here it will just
give me you know I picked the exact
color I want I take that hex code and
I'm good to go you don't have to
memorize how this works
it's really not that big of a deal
you'll also see that they give me an RGB
value so originally we could only use
hex and at one point they added in RGB
so let's just take this green here and
I'll put that as my first box whoops
copy paste and I'm gonna take this RGB
down here it's my second value so I'll
copy that and I'll paste it in there and
hit save and they're both exactly the
same color
so this 8f corresponds to 143 my DB here
corresponds to 219 and my 83 here
corresponds to the 131 and it ends up
being the exact same color so the RGB
scale is from 0 to 256 not 5655 sorry so
if I put this at 0 0 0 and I'll delete
that so don't get an error
I get black and if I have 255 255 255 I
get white and if I have full red 0 and 0
I will get red now where this becomes a
lot more interesting though is that I
can do in RGB eh
this stands for red green blue and alpha
alpha is pretty much transparency if
you're coming you know it's an alpha
mask and the Alpha value though is from
0 to 1 so I'm just going to put another
comma put another space and put in 0.5
so it's from 0 to 1 so if I put in point
5 its semi-transparent and let's
actually change my background okay so
what I've done is I've put in a
background and I've made these boxes
bigger because I want to illustrate a
little bit more on how this is actually
working so this box here is transparent
but we can't really see what's happening
because it's on a light grey background
so it doesn't it just looks like my box
is getting a little bit lighter these
two being nice and big it's gonna let me
examine more you know we'll actually be
able to see our hamster coming through
there so let's come down to this first
one right here this and I've made them
bigger just to make it even more obvious
and they'll replace this with my RGB so
RGB value always works I just put my R
and G and B and then I open and close
the parentheses and I put in my RGB
values so to 5500 should make it red and
then the a is my alpha so I put another
comma 0.5 should make it 50% opacity or
50% transparent and there we go we can
see my hamsters nose poking through
there if I make this a smaller number it
becomes more transparent and if I bring
it up it becomes less transparent so RGB
is pretty awesome we just have to you
know 255 I want a yellowish box I can go
there and use that remember just use
your color picker though I had to get
the color you want and then just add the
a to here to be able to add your
transparency if you forget the a and it
will just break the whole thing because
it doesn't understand this value so it's
really important that you add the a in
there when you're doing it so let's try
and do our little purple box there and
our GBA and purple I'm not even really
sure we probably need some green and
blue so 0 150 255 and as I start with a
1 so it's there
fine well blue is good enough and what I
want to show is what a lot of people
find at first when they're looking to
make things transparent is they don't
use RGB a they get their box looking
good and they do a quick Google search
and they find something called opacity
so opacity is just like my a value here
the Alpha value my opacity they work
exactly the same way in terms of how to
manipulate it so it's a zero to one
scale so a 1 means that it's exactly the
same and if I put this to zero it
becomes invisible
and so let's bring this up to a point to
5.25 save refresh and we see my box
there but you'll notice the text is also
transparent so it's taking my whole div
and it's making the whole div become
transparent as well and that's usually
not what we're after there are a few
situations where this is something we
want to do but in this case it isn't so
let's get rid of that and jump back to
this refresh so with this one down to
0.5 it will make my box more transparent
but my text is the same and to make that
even more obvious let's make it more
transparent so my box is becoming more
and more transparent when my text is
still there and still nice and easier to
read so that's fantastic it's what we
you know what you'll probably be after
most of the time and we have one last
one that I haven't explored yet so let's
replace this yellow one here with the
last one which is HSL and HSL works sort
of like RGB it has three values the only
thing that's different is it's it's kind
of weird if you're not used to HSL it
sends for hue saturation and lightness
so the hue value of 0 to 360 and think
of a color wheel of a wheel so you have
360 degrees and you're picking the
degree that you want so newing red a lot
we'll stick with red not 255 I'm just
RGB 360 happens to be red and I'm
guessing zero does too then input a
comma and we have to choose how
saturated we want that color so let's
start with a hundred percent saturation
we want it to be a really vibrant bright
red and the last thing I want is my
lightness and for lightness and I'll
start with 50% and we'll explore a
little bit how lightness works so that's
a the red we've been looking at the
whole time so again that's well not
again let's just jump over to our hue
and change this to 150 and we'll see
that it changes so the hue is where we
are on the color wheel and I sort of
like that color so we'll stay there this
is my saturation so how saturated am i
if you go to zero percent saturation and
you will go to gray and it doesn't
matter
you put here cuz you're you know
whatever you put there if you have 0%
saturation you don't have any color so
we'll go back to our green and we have
our full color but if I go that that 50%
I'm going towards gray the lower this
number the closer to Graham getting or
you know and we'll bring that back up to
100 for a second and then lightness
instead of adding gray to something so
we're taking the colors out of it is
we're adding white or black so 50% were
right in the middle if I make this 75%
let's say it's going to get lighter I'm
making it lighter a hundred percent
we'll bring it all the way to white and
if I make that zero percent it will
bring me all the way to black and 25
will just be a darker version so it's
not quite the same as going to gray
which is making it more neutral but it's
making it either lighter or darker maybe
it's just me and I'm used to hex and I'm
used to RGB but HLS is a little strange
for me so I don't really use it too much
you'll notice even the color picker
we've used they don't even give us an
HLS you won't see HLS used too often
though it is out there and you can't add
an 8 - HOH SL I think I was saying LS
before and it would work exactly the
same point 5 and it becomes starts
becoming transparent so let's color in
CSS how we can control our background
colors you can use all this for your
text colors as well which you know it
works and anywhere you would be putting
on a color this system works you have
any questions put them down in the
comments below and until the next video
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
