for CSS variables are kind of awkward
but we can fix that we can make it much
easier we're gonna be doing that in this
video it's a little bit more complicated
so if you've never used sass this might
be a little bit over your head but this
is just gonna make our lives so much
easier it's gonna automatically make
fallbacks for us it takes a little bit
of setup but once the setup is done and
it goes super well so yeah let's go and
see how I do that so to get started on
all of this I actually want to get rid
of this so I'm gonna leave my route sort
of but we're actually for now we're
gonna switch route here to VARs so these
are my variables and I'm gonna take off
these things here because I don't want
them and this is going to be a sass map
so actually this should be changed to a
regular parenthesis and these all have
to be comma separated instead of -
separated and my semicolon goes at the
end so a sass map looks like this it's
just a map of all of my different stuff
that's in here so pretty much I'm going
okay my variables I have a yellow
variable this is what my yellow variable
is I have a black one that has this
light blue so you know it's not that
complicated I think and the reason we
want to write it out like this is
because I want to be able to easily use
it in I want to be able to use my
fallbacks so I could do it and actually
have it like this but then it's not
gonna work as a fallback so we're gonna
leave it just like this for now oh and
here I have an error because I forgot to
put like that so there's my sass map you
can see it broke the whole thing now
which is normal so there's my sass map
sorry about that forgot that part of it
so the first thing we're going to do is
we're gonna recreate our route so route
that not it's not a variable route so
we're going to recreate our route and oh
right II so for my route this is we're
gonna use a function and basically what
I'm doing is and this is where it might
seem a little bit redundant but it's the
first
that we need to be able to get this to
work so and having my route set up like
this or I'm gonna use my function and
what it's going to do is it's gonna take
all of these and turn them into CSS
variables I remember I already had them
trust me on this okay so to be able to
do this if you've never used a sass
function I'm gonna be doing it each
function so if you know JavaScript at
all this is sort of like a for each so
for each variable whoops let's not do
variable let's say for each property and
value pair
so for each property and value which is
in VARs so it's gonna look inside of my
VARs here it's gonna grab the property
and the value these names I'm inventing
they could be anything you want you
could have this as var name and VAR
property if you want our VAR value or
whatever you want
there's no you know it's whatever makes
sense to you so I'm just saying for each
property and value inside of here I want
to do something so open up my braces and
I'm going to have it to create a
variable so this is I have to use
something called interpolation here so
what this is doing here is I want my two
lines so we know already if I'm making a
CSS variable I want like blue let's just
say something when my variable that I
need to automatically make all of these
so I could just write property here but
it's not going to work the way you'd
expect it to so what we wanted to do is
we're going for each property I want to
print out the name of the property so to
actually have it print out the name we
have to write it out like this so this
is interpolation in sass so it's taking
whatever is actually here and it's going
to print it and so it's gonna make
yellow it's gonna write out yellow so
it's going to do two hyphens then the
word yellow and then it's gonna put a
semicolon a space and then we want it to
grab this so for that I just have to do
another one so and I can write value and
you can see all of a sudden it comes
back to life
so what this is doing is let's go and
take a look
view compiled see
and it's pretty much put it back to what
we had exactly what we had before so at
this point you're going to this is silly
and it is a little bit more setup I
won't lie but it makes it so much easier
to build in fall backs so let's go back
here and go back to a few uncompelled
CSS so we have this nice little map and
then we're taking that map and turning
them into normal properties here are our
normal variables that we don't just like
we'd had set up before so now what I
want to do is I also want to come in and
create a mixin so I'm going to create a
mixin called a var and we're gonna have
two things in here we want to have a
property and in this case I'm going to
call it variable I guess a variable so
the idea here is I'm gonna write out a
property so I'm gonna write something
like height well not height let's say a
background color so I'm gonna write
background and then I'm gonna write the
variable that I want so I want my black
variable so to get this to work we need
to use a little bit of the interpolation
thing again so I'm gonna write it out
I'm gonna do one that's gonna be kind of
useless to start with but so we're gonna
do our prop drop for T and then we're
gonna write var and we're gonna write in
and then I want my variable to be here
so basically what this means is I write
in the property I want so say background
color and I write the variable I want so
let's say I write yellow and it's gonna
set it all up so let's just go and take
a look so I'm gonna just go in here and
make a body and let's say my I'm gonna
do an @include VAR so I'm gonna say my
background should be yellow so let's go
and see what this did we can view
compiled CSS and so it's taking
background and it's setting it to my var
yellow which would be my yellow right
there so so far so good except I don't
have a fallback yet I want to make sure
that I also have a fallback because by
itself this is kind of useless we could
just write it out like that from the
beginning and every
we've done is a complete waste of time
so before that what we're gonna do is
we're gonna do the same thing sort of so
we're going to keep our property but now
instead of spitting out the variable
like this what I want to do so the
reason this is working is because this
is spitting out an actual variable of
yellow so it's taking the name yellow
and if we look at the you compiled CSS
it's writing out the yellow like this so
it's just referencing what I have here
we can't do that for the fallback we
have to do things for the fallback a
little bit differently because say I put
pink here whoops not there sorry here if
I just write pink view compiled CSS it's
well we can't do it well let's just
remove that view compiled CSS and now
it's just looking for a variable pink
which doesn't even exist right so that's
a problem I mean you know what I'm doing
that all this with a background I should
do it with a color just we can actually
see it so the color Pink's not going to
work but let's just switch that over to
yellow and we can see it's actually
changing everything to yellow or we're
gonna do a light blue there so my body's
set to light blue so we can see that
it's actually working but what I want to
do is I want to create a fallback for
this so the fallback is a bit more
complicated but it starts the same so as
I was looking at we start with our
property but where it's different is
because here all I'm doing is taking
whatever I write here and adding two
hyphens in front of it so it's doing var
and it's just it's working I don't have
to worry about it too much for this one
I have to do it a little bit differently
we have to go into our map so I'm gonna
say map yet which lets me jump into my
map and this is why we created the map
the whole reason we created the map here
is so we can have a fallback to go to so
we're into our map yet so the map that I
want to get from is called VARs and what
I want to get is the variable variable
so it's gonna go and find light blue
from here so when I do my ad include
color light blue it's gonna go and grab
that light blue from here and it's going
to do two things with it it's gonna do
it the way we were doing it but it's
also going to set it up another way
which creates our fallback so you can
see it's doing the fallback version and
here it's using the variable version so
it puts both of them together so if I
were to refract err my code a little bit
so we can get rid of this because we
don't need that one
so here doo-doo-doo here my color is
light blue for the background so instead
of writing it like that I do it at
include VAR I want to have the color so
this is the property that I'm changing
and I'm changing it to light blue and
it's working and just to make sure that
it is working let's try doing yellow and
of course it's not working why not oh I
forgot my semicolon that would do it and
there we go we can see that it's working
and if I change that to be okay for my
black it should switch over to black so
it is working great so let's put that
back to light blue where else do we have
we have our background yellow here so
for that one I would do at @include VAR
and I change my background to yellow and
just to double-check that it's working
again let's change it to black it's
working so I'll change it back to yellow
to keep it looking good and now I can
come down and for my font weights it'll
work the same so @include VAR I want to
change my font weight and I believe that
was font-weight:normal awesome possum
and last but not least @include VAR font
weight font weight medium and there we
go and just for fun let's change that
over to bold and light normal and medium
so we can see that it's working
wonderfully and if I look at the view
compiled CSS I can see that I have my
fallbacks anywhere I've used it so I
have my color my fallback and then I
have my variable my fallback and then my
variable now you might be when this is a
lot of work it is it takes a little bit
of extra setup to actually get working
but in the end it's definitely worth it
I promise you and in the next video
where we start looking at how we can use
javascript to play around with stuff you
can really see how it takes you know
you're taking a big advantage of
something but again it's for me just
having everything grouped up here where
I can control the whole style of my site
just through one grouping of stuff
that's all the way at the top is just
amazing and the fact that I can use
variables and it doesn't and this you
know I'm sort of using sass here but I'm
sort of not using sass we're using sass
and a way to make it work to have our
fallbacks but I can still leverage the
power of the CSS variables which are you
know it's nice that it's as we see in
the next video we're gonna see that we
can explore it in other ways as well so
that was a fun one I hope you learned
something with this video you have any
questions about all this stuff if
something was new in there let me know
leave a comment down below and ask away
if you liked the video please hit the
thumbs up if you haven't yet subscribed
and you like this video consider
subscribing as its new videos like this
every single week and in the next video
we're of course exploring how JavaScript
can work with variables and it should be
a good amount of fun I think it's cool
I think the the JavaScript and variables
they're made for each other it's really
cool how we can easily and dynamically
change stuff on a page so looking
forward to seeing you then and until
then don't forget to make your corner of
the internet just a little bit more
