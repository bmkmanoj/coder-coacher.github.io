transition properties in this video
we're gonna see how we can put them to
work to make some really cool little
animations hi there and welcome my name
is Kevin here on my channel we learned
how to make the web and how to make it
look good while we're at it if you
missed the last video I suggest you go
and check it out where we look just at
the transition properties themselves and
how all of them work and in this video
we're gonna be looking at a more
realistic examples and yeah I think it's
me a really fun video so let's go jump
right into it so in this video we're
looking at how to use CSS transitions in
a real world type of environment to do
some interesting things we're gonna be
starting with this here where as you can
see there's no animation there if I
click on more information the
information just appears I have a heart
that gets smaller and bigger the color
just turns on and off and then I have a
less information button here and that
just does that and especially for this
more information less information thing
it's really jarring it's not good for
user experience because all of a sudden
things start happening and then going
away so we can improve the user
experience by adding animation to there
and even with this just the heart
growing and then the color changing it
just makes it a little bit smoother and
and nicer and so what we're gonna be
doing is making it like this where on
hover there's this nice little
transition effect I can move that up the
more information disappears less
information animates in if I click that
the more information comes in and you
can see those only happen after the fact
so though both of those animations have
a delay on them to help again with the
overall user experience so let's take a
jump in and see how we did all that okay
so the first thing I want to say for
this video is just we are starting with
a lot of markup done there is some
JavaScript done in this and obviously a
whole ton of CSS just to style it the
focus of this is really just using
transitions on a site like this if you
want to see it the code pen is shared
down in the description below so you can
go and see how I've done it but I don't
actually have a video showing how I
coded this card up I really just want to
focus on the animation and stuff like
that and when I'm looking at certain
things if it's important for the
transition I will look at how a little
bit more in depth on how the code was
written for that specific thing so the
first thing I'm gonna do is right now on
hover I have its
it's sort of re you know we're keeping
our card but the whole thing is
shrinking down in size and this is just
to sort of show that it is an
interactive card in some way so when the
user gets the mouse on top something
like that happens so here if I go and I
find my card I just to show you the mark
up a little bit he actually will help I
have a difficult card so this would work
even if you have multiple cards inside
of here I have my single card so what
I'm doing is and then here I have my
card header so what we see on the screen
right now is my card header and when I
click here the card header shrinking
away and it's showing us some body text
here so what what I'm doing is we're
when I hover on top of here the card
header is changing a little bit so if we
go and take a look we have my card
header here that has a whole bunch of
styles on it and I'm using absolute
positioning just to make life a little
easier to create some of these and on
hover I'm just switching the top bottom
right and left all from 0 to 25 so
that's giving me this little effect
right there so it's pushing them in by
25 pixels on all the sides now if you
watch the last video you'll know this
isn't the best practice in general we
don't want to be transitioning these we
want to try and only transition
transforms and opacity and most of the
transitions I'm doing this are using
those even though there's another one
that isn't there's ways around this
there's other things that you could do
to get a similar effect but you know
where we can't always as much as we want
to follow best practice at times you
might need to try some other things and
if you do want more information down in
the description below there's a link
talking a lot of detail about why you
want to stick with transforms and
opacity that one thing that's important
is not to put the transition here even
though this is where things are changing
because if I came and I put transition
here transition let's just do 500
milliseconds when I do that you'll see
it's going to transition when I hover on
top but not when my mouse leaves oh
there's the transition and then not
there because right now this transition
is only coming in for the hover so when
I hover there's a transition but when
I'm not hovering there's no transition
so just make sure you put your
transition over here now I can right
just transition like that and
we can see it's working and it's working
in both directions now this isn't really
great though and this is gonna have the
default timing function this is going to
have the default of also it's trying to
animate everything or transition
everything and we want to avoid doing
that because already I'm transitioning
some things I shouldn't be by having
this on all it's giving the CPU even
more work to do so we want to specify
that we want to only animate these four
things on out of all of this so here
where I have transition what I can do is
I can say top let's make it a bit
shorter 300 milliseconds and I'm gonna
do an ease okay I like ease out so now
if I come here and I hover over but the
top one there is doing a nice little
slide in and out now I want to do all
four of them so I can do that by comma
separating them if you have a lot of
things to do like I hear here I have 4
it would make a really long line of CSS
but I can just push return and write the
next one so left 300 milliseconds ease
out comma and then let's just copy and
paste this because it makes life easier
bottom right and now we have all four of
them going again so it's working on all
four once again but this time it's only
trying to do those and you could
technically give them different types of
timing functions or you could give them
different times even but it would look a
little strange I think in this case
great so let's keep going now here when
I click more information now you can see
that the bottom is already animating
because I've told it that we can
transition the bottom so we're
transitioning the bottom and when I'm
clicking on that what it's doing it's
actually pretty far down um here my
bottom is just switching to 50% so my
bottom is sliding up to the 50% mark and
then sliding back down so I don't need
to add anything else in there it's just
working on its own so that's good and
dandy and I'm going to do that it
reveals the information so the thing I
like about this is you're revealing the
information so you're showing where the
information was it's not an instant
change it's just coming up and sliding
up and showing
that there are things there and it also
then lets you know what's gonna happen
if you do less information you can sort
of guess that it's going to return to
the previous state
now this more information button when I
click on it just disappears when I click
on less information it just disappears
so that's not terrible it doesn't bother
me too much
but we can make that a little bit nicer
with some transitions on that as well so
if I go all the way back up here here I
have my more info and less info so this
is my more info and that is my less info
and the way I'm doing this is my more
info was just where it happens to be and
my less info I did a margin-left:auto on
it so that's just why it's all the way
on the right side and I've translated it
off so if I take this transform off
actually I let's just put this to zero
so we can see it where it is so there's
my less information right there now say
I did 50% on this it's pushing it 50%
that way a hundred percent and it pushes
it further off but it's not quite all
the way we can probably it away with
like 120 percent even just to get it I
would have view and there it goes we
can't see it anymore on my header I also
have an overflow of hidden so it's
that's why we can't see it it's not
sticking out the side there so what I
want is I want those to animate actually
I want let's go up I have both cards
here where most of the styling our cards
most of the the info buttons here is
where most of the styling is so what I'm
going to use this for is let's give them
both the same transition just so it's
consistent so transition of transform
how long I don't know we'll try 500
milliseconds and once again in ease out
um so that's gonna do the one thing of
it it's gonna change when I click you
can see that the less information when I
click here you can see it slide in when
I click that it slides out and here it's
gonna slide down and then slide back up
this one's less obvious just because
it's moving in the opposite direction of
the original animation so it just sort
of sort of disappears but you can't see
it sliding in and out what I like about
this is again it shows sort of catches
the users attention just to alert them
that this button is gone but more
importantly this is
creating a little bit of animation just
to make the user more aware that there
is a way to close this down now because
it's not in the same spot as before
there's no big X that's appearing so I
just want to make it obvious that that's
there the other thing we do want is the
the background color to change so here
I'm transforming this YZ out I'll do a
comma and we'll say background this
gonna be pretty fast
we'll say 250 milliseconds so now when I
hover on top there we go we can see it's
sort of just a smoother little and even
maybe you could just make this 200 I
don't want it to be super obvious I want
it to go pretty fast but just to smooth
things up a little bit and there we go
we can see that coming in cool good I
think that looks pretty good so then the
same thing should happen here now one
thing I'd like to do is when I click on
this the buttons are coming in and out
at the same time I don't really want
this to slide in as it's moving up I
want it to only slide in once the
animation or the transition is finished
and the same thing here once this is
finished dropping down I want that to
come in so that's why here here I have
two different spots I have my more info
and less info just because I want to do
something different with these two so my
more info this button down here I
actually want to put a transition delay
on that transition delay of let's say
500 milliseconds and we'll see what
happens
um except what you'll notice now that
transition delay is doing something I
don't want to happen when I go on top
it's taking half a second for the
background color to change which is
obviously not a good thing so here I'm
going to come a separate that comma or
my backgrounds the second one so comma
zero milliseconds and now that should
have no delay when I hover but when I
click see how there was a delay there so
it's going up and then it's sliding off
and then when I click this actually I
don't really want that to lay there
though okay I don't want I want more
info to go away at the beginning so what
I should probably do here
this one should probably actually be
let's remove you from here and put you
on this one so now if I click that it
disappears and then once the animation
is done the less information slides in
that makes a lot more sense so we can
see it goes like that and then this
slides in but that creates a problem
because now when I click on less
information it just sits there and then
disappears which is really weird luckily
we can get around that so this
transition delay actually I'm gonna take
away from here I only want that
transition delay to happen when my card
is open so when my card is open I want
there to be a delay but when I click
this it's removing the class of open
from my card here from the card header
so we can actually it's just I'll show
you what's actually going on so here I
have my card header and when I click
show information we're getting card open
and when I click less information you
can see it's just going back to the
regular card so card open and then the
regular card so what I want is I want
the delay to be on it when the card is
open but I don't want the delay they
were the rest of the time so let's go
find my card open a card open more info
less info so on here I can put my
transition delay so that means when I
click this and it adds the class there's
a delay but when I click this it's just
gonna go away right away so when I click
that and then it comes in and then the
other way around good okay so I'm happy
with how that looks more information
that's okay
less information actually you know hmm I
could put a little delay on that so I
want before I took the delay off but I
think we were better off with it so
let's put that transition delay back on
but this is the opposite case scenario I
want this to delay when it goes up but I
know I don't want delay when it goes up
I want to delay when it comes down see
how that looked nice I think if I do
that and now it comes up after so when
my card is closed I want to have a delay
when I don't have my open on there I
want to delay but when I have my open
I want no delay so I can just do
transition delay
of zero over here so whoops I'm just
gonna put em s just to make sure so
there's no delay it just dies this
slides in I click that once the card is
fullscreen the little more information
box comes in again and I really like
showing this example because it shows
that you can use delays in interesting
ways to help make your site a little bit
more cool and have some fun effects in
it without actually needing to get into
the real CSS animation properties just
using transitions you can still use
delays in interesting ways and in
practical ways that are fun and cool to
use so that looks pretty good and the
last thing I want to look at is on this
to play around my heart a little bit
because I don't really like how the
heart is working I'm gonna make that
heart a bit bigger and just let me get
easier for us to see right now so I did
use a size CSS variable here so if I
change that everything should get bigger
and there we go let's make it even
bigger now actually just for demo
purposes so this is you know you could
come in here and heart the post if you
wanted to and it will stay woops hearted
the whole time so to do that and
actually I should move it you can see
the bottom sticks out a little there I
should move it up margin bottom let's
move it up a tiny bit there we go um so
I like this effect I like this little
thing but we can obviously make that a
little better um so here on my heart
icon let's go find it heart icon you can
see that the background is pink and then
when the heart gets checked the heart
icon becomes red so and if you'd like to
know how I built this there's a video up
on my patreon now for patrons who where
I showed them actually how I built this
heart out so you could always go and
check that out there's a link to it in
the description below so what we can do
is for this I want to do a few things
the growing of it I want to make that a
little bit more fun and obviously I want
the color to transition so let's take a
look at my heart icon because
I think is that where the scale no my
heart icon is where the background
colors happening and the scale is
happening here let's just make that a
little bit bigger well do like a 1.2 I
just want to get a lot bigger for now
for just for demo purposes again I think
that's too much normally but that's okay
so we'll start with the background color
because that's the easier one and
background color so it's on my heart
icon so right here I'm just gonna have
heart icon I was in the right spot
whoops the checked background is red so
right here I just want to do a
transition background and we'll say like
2 150 milliseconds I want this to be
really fast I just want it to be enough
that there's a there is an animation
going on a really subtle one but I want
just something there so it's not as
harsh as the the instant changeover so
that's that's it just something really
quick and again one of the biggest
problems I see is people doing something
like 500 or longer on stuff like this
and it just makes this really smooth
animation it doesn't really feel like
you're checking it it's like oh it's
this long long thing so just by speeding
that up a little bit 100 125 150
it takes the harshness of the check
color change out but it makes it still
seem like it's almost instantaneous
which is good so that's cool and then I
just want to make this a little better
so I think we can do that by my heart
itself where my scale is so on my heart
blood a transition for transform I'm
gonna do this at like 300 milliseconds I
want to be pretty fast you can see it's
growing and then it turns on and off but
I think the growing thing we can make it
a little bit more fun right let's do an
inspect on there let's go and find my
transition that's my check box my heart
oh well it's just right in easier then
I don't want that this will let me the
fun fun of dev tools and stuff here you
can see that it's rotated
there's my ease so I just want to take
this ease and let's give it a bit more
of a something I want to get a little
bit bigger and then shrink back down so
you can see it's bigger and then normal
bigger and normal not too much I want to
be pretty subtle so once I've done that
down here I've made cubic Bezier I can
just copy that cubic Bezier and replace
the ease and let's close this out so we
don't have that rotation thing on there
you can see it little subtle subtle
subtle it's very subtle maybe I should
have made that a little bigger just for
1.5 on this may be a point 5 there we go
it's just this really subtle like it
gets bigger and then shrinks back just a
tiny bit a really subtle thing almost
like a single heart throb do you know
that type of thing to do really really
subtle but this nice little bouncing
animation and there's the CSS
transitions at work so I hope you liked
that if you have any questions about
what I did don't be shy leave a comment
