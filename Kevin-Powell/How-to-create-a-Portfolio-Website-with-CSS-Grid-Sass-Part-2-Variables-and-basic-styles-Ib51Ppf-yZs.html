we're going to be taking what we did
here we wrote all of our markup and
we're gonna start doing the fun stuff
which is actually styling the website
sadly right now we're not gonna do
anything too exciting the main focus of
the video is coming up with our
variables so I'm gonna be creating our
variable files and we're gonna just be
setting up most of our variables based
on our design and then I'll also go
through and do the base styles which is
mostly the body an h1 h2 paragraph
styles so things start coming together
and that means that after this we can
really plow through and make our design
come to life so let's jump right into
that and get going now one thing that's
important is I've stopped my gulp build
if your gulp build is running cuz you're
following through this series and you
are using the the gulp like I have setup
hit command or ctrl C to stop it I
realize there's a little bit of a bug in
it in the build that I put together
where is if I create a new file
it won't watch for changes in that new
file if this was already running so I'm
gonna already stopped that gulp build
and what I'm gonna do now is come into
my S CSS folder here and I'm gonna make
two new folders I'm gonna create modules
folder and that's what's gonna hold all
of my all my variables any mix-ins that
I decided to create pretty much anything
that doesn't get actually compiled into
CSS and I'm gonna come here and make
another new folder this folder is going
to be called partials and this is all
that woops that shouldn't be in my
modules that should just be in my s CSS
folder so s CSS I have my modules and
have my partials my partials folder is
going to be all of the different things
so I'm gonna have one for my welcome one
for this or maybe all of that actually
could be in one I'll have another file
that's going to be for this about me
type of thing another one that's going
to be for my portfolio my contact my
footer and of course them when I click
on this something that pops up and of
course my navigation is well will have
its own partial I don't want to do
anything too complicated in this project
them so that is going to be my basic set
up for this so in my modules I'm gonna
will go into there I'm just gonna have
three files I'm going to make
called underscore all dot s CSS this is
I've started working this way because I
had this really bad tendency of
forgetting to load things into my main I
know I still have to load them into my
all but for some reason I just find I
remember better I don't know why but
you'll see how I do this in a second so
I'm gonna have my all I'm gonna have
underscore type fog or feed s CSS and if
you haven't been using sass and you're
not really sure how all of this works by
having an underscore on it it means that
this shouldn't be compiled into its own
CSS file this is going to be imported so
we're telling it that this will be
imported don't make a file out of this
and we're gonna that's why the main
doesn't have an underscore on it and one
more underscore colors s CSS let's start
with our colors actually let's go back
to all for a second am i all will import
a typography and it will add import
colors we can save that so now what I
can do in my mane is I can just do an ad
import and I can say modules all so I'm
just importing all my modules and just
so we can make sure that this is
actually all working I'm gonna start my
gulp build back up now so it will be
taking to account the existing files I
have cool we can see I can close this
because I it always opens up a new one
so to see if it's actually working in my
colors here just do body the background
of red and we can see it worked so I'm
very happy about that and I'll save one
other thing that I'll just mention
quickly just in case you weren't
following along from before is I now
using vs code so if you've seen some of
my older videos I was using Adam I
started trying to play around with vs
code because I heard a lot of really
good things about it and I sort of
fallen in love with it so I think this
is my new editor I really really like it
one of the really nice things is having
the terminó built in and it's just a
command or control back tick to open
that up and you can see it actually I'm
in the node term
right now it also do the command prompt
and PowerShell and a whole bunch anyway
it's really cool how it works
and it also has get integration which is
really nice as well so for my colors
let's go back to XD here so I have all
my colors here so we're gonna have white
I'm just going to type in all the
different ones I have we're gonna have a
light gray a gray dark gray if you spell
gray with uni that's fine too
dark gray should I call that blue or
should I just call it just call that
accent I know I'm mixing up sort of
semantic names accent and then the
colors but whatever I don't wanna call
that do we call it dark accent I hate so
it will be dark blue I know you might
not be in love with those names so if
you like I have other names you'd prefer
to use go for it now in here I can just
do a copy some of it copy that copy
that's my dark gray copy that one copy
my gray accent and that's all my colors
that I'm using in this now what I need
to decide is what I need to decide is do
I give these more semantic names do I do
things like body font color because you
know I'm using that there no I'm not
gonna do that it's a smaller project and
I think this will be plenty fine so I'm
gonna stick with that for my typography
my typography this is a little bit more
I do one thing here it's I guess a
little bit opinionated but I do load in
my google font import into my typography
even though I said that in general my
modules don't actually have any CSS code
in them and this does get imported but
that is just I find it easier for me
that's the way I like to stay organized
so here in my Google
I've already got it in so I have
Merryweather and six caps and
Merryweather regular and black and here
are six caps I just there's only the one
so I'm gonna click over to my import
copy you and right at the top there I
can save that then I can set up my
Styles so I don't remember where I got
this from it's relatively recently but
I've started using it and I really like
it just to shorten things up so I'm
gonna have a font family and I'm
literally just gonna do font family s4
serif so if one family - serif and my
font family serif is Mary wit
Merryweather
comma look I'm not period comma saw
serif and then my font family saw serif
is six caps Sarah oh I did these
backwards serve yes should be just a
serve there we go safe so I could sort
of come in and if I wanted to have font
family heading and font family body I
could definitely do that this is my body
and then see I mean I sort of mix it up
because this is a heading and it's using
606 caps this is in h26 caps this is an
h1 and then I'm going into there that's
my age - that's an H - actually H - H -
H 1 so I could have like in font family
H 1 font family H - yeah I'm just gonna
stick with this bigger project sometimes
it can be more useful but I'm gonna
simplify my variables as much as
possible the other variables I need are
what else do I need I have my font
families I want to just set up now just
trying to think really fast what else do
I need I need to have my font weights of
course so I'm gonna have my font weight
and I'm gonna have a font-weight:normal
which is 400
and a font weight of bold which in this
case is 900 I'm not using any late fonts
but it would it would be one of those
easy enough things that you know I could
have a font weight light and then have
my 300 or whatever but I don't need that
in this one so one thing you might be
seeing people do is between here and on
them their colors for the colors
especially you might see something like
someone doing like a text primary and
then that would be my gray I think and
then and I've done stuff like this and I
still do work like this sometimes it
really depends so it's like text primary
text accent would be my accent color
text secondary and have like their
secondary color etc etc you could go
through and build all of those out so I
have all my text colors then I could do
the same with background colors and all
of that I'm starting to I understand the
reasoning behind this and I was all for
it but first I just it does
compartmentalize things a little bit so
if I change my accent color it doesn't
mean that everywhere is gonna change or
if I want my text accent - you know my
design changes so my text accent is now
actually just going to switch over to my
dark blue instead because it works
better for the design I don't have to
sort of screw everything up but I just
for a project of this size maybe it's
overkill I am so you'll see the same
thing in the typography of your font
like this and it's sort of like I
mentioned then you'd have your fine
fiber primary secondary and other stuff
and I just find for a project of this
size it might be a little bit of
overkill so cool that is done so I'm
gonna close I'm gonna leave those open
because I tend to need to reference them
sometimes because I forget and one thing
now we can start styling our body and
other stuff but I forgot to do something
and what that is is I'm gonna come here
and cancel this because I mode to make
new files so I'm gonna hit command or
control C and I'm here yes and we'll
just go back to there and amirite clear
just to get back so it looks like that
and for the moment I'm going to just get
rid of the terminal because I don't need
it
so what I'm gonna do is make a few new
files here the first thing I'm gonna do
is we need normalize we don't need
normalize but I'm gonna use normalize
I have done it in the past on a
normalized file and people have asked me
about it where I actually came into here
and I modified it and they're like well
you're supposed to modify it yeah you
don't have to it really depends how you
want to use it even more about is it
here and normalize blah blah blah
normalize vs. reset doesn't clutter as
modular yeah here you go it gives you it
gives you the potential to remove
sections if you know they'll never be
needed in your website so how to use it
you install it then there are two main
ways of using it so use normalized as
your starting point and then customize
the values to match your requirements or
include it untouched and build upon it
overriding
so obviously you can use it however you
want so you know just because you have
this giant normalized file doesn't mean
you actually have to use the whole thing
so we're actually gonna have to make a
new folder in here called vendor and in
my vendor I'm gonna create a new file
Oh normalize dot a CSS and I'll paste
that all in there so you know this is
really one of those things you come
through here and just get rid of
anything you know you're not using um I
also know I'm gonna be setting my own
heading size should I set it here I'm
not necessarily gonna do that I do know
that here like my figure they're
studying the margin I'm gonna be using
figures and I don't want it to actually
have a margin on it so it might even be
worth it for me to just set that to zero
because in my design I'm gonna these
these are gonna be using figures and
those margins I don't want them so why
would I have it resetting a margin and
then getting rid of my own margin you
know what I mean so let's just look
through here really fast
HR I'll leave but I don't think I'm
actually gonna use in my design pre I
know for a fact I'm not gonna be using
that so why don't I just get rid of it
and obviously I'm using
strong strong code I'm not gonna be
using that nah I'm gonna be using that
the small I'm not using currently but it
could be something that I'd end up using
these I know for a fact and we're just
gonna fly through this as fast as
possible I'm not gonna get rid of those
even though I don't have plans on using
it because video you know it's one of
those things that might at one point get
brought in buttons inputs all of that
obviously I want to keep
we'll just keep anything that's related
to forms because we're gonna have a form
interactive details menu did we get rid
of that canvas template it's not too bad
we're down at the bottom now so it's
just to say you can you can definitely
modify this to fit your thing and chain
make changes in here if you if you think
they're important to make and get rid of
stuff you're not using because what's
the point of having it if you're not
using it so what I'm gonna do now is go
over to my main and add import don't
forget your semicolons and these I
always do if you followed my other
series I've run into a lot of problems
for forgetting semicolons on my imports
so what is this ven-ven door slash norm
normalize save if you're not used to SAS
again I'm not including the underscore
on this and I'm not putting the dot SCSS
I don't need to do that it knows what I
want so I'm just writing it out like
that I mean also save that file then I'm
going to come into my partials and in
here we'll make a new file called all s
CSS and for now we'll make one new one
called
underscore base s CSS some people make
also a base folder that has this but my
base is sort of its own partial in the
way I like to work and the way I
visualize it in my head don't feel like
you have to organize this the way I'm
organizing it find a system that works
for you and organize years as CSS files
or your SAS files in a way that you
think makes a lot of sense because to me
that's clearly the best way to do stuff
you don't want to if you're new maybe
it's a good idea to follow what other
people are doing but always be wondering
about what's going to work best for you
and use use what works really well for
you so my base is there so at import
base save and I just want to make sure
we're not so then at import CI I like
that it shows me the color is way off at
import partials slash base save I'm not
base oh I guess I'm a vendor I don't
have it all but I think that's going to
be my only vendor anyway so it should be
fine
so I'm importing my base into my all des
CSS which is then being imported into my
main and with all that done I'm gonna
open this back up and start gulp again
or wait two seconds and there we go it's
in my other window but that's okay
so just resize this so you guys can see
it a little better so my base styles
well this is pretty much my body all the
styles that you normally put on your
body so the first thing let's see is my
color so my color is going to be gray
and I'm gonna save that and let's just
make sure it is working yet we can see
that the color changed there cool so my
base is like my color my basic
typography settings and some stuff like
that that will be setting up which would
be the base of with it's the rest of
what we're doing in this video and then
after that we'll actually get into
styling what we're seeing on the screen
and making it look a little bit nicer so
color gray yep font family my default
font fam on family should be my font
family serif we should have again I just
want to make sure it's working it is
cool so I have my font family serif
my line-height what's my line height um
I wish this could not be there 22 over
14 comes up to like one point five seven
so my line height would be just one
point six
some people like organizing things here
in alphabetical order which I just
happen to be doing by chance right now
but I just do it sort of as it comes off
of my head and I sometimes will
reorganize things say I have
position:absolute then I like having my
top left right bottom all grouped
together but I don't really I have a
rhyme or reason behind how I write this
stuff I find it easier just to write it
as I'm looking at it I'm probably gonna
forget a couple of things on here too
but my background you don't have to do
this but setting your background to a
color can prevent problems
apparently I've never actually seen the
problems but it's one extra line of CSS
it's not going to cause any big issues
for my body what else can I do I in my
line hi doo doo doo doo doo doo doo that
looks pretty good
okay so let's start styling a few of my
other things now close to the very close
I modified closed one thing I don't
remember how to do uh-huh there we go
that's what I wanted to do and close
normalize I can close typography for now
and close my colors base there we go
I remembered I did that just as an h1 oh
yeah cuz that's a span okay that's fine
my h1 the font family is the default one
so I'm not going to be more specific on
that because my h1 yep the color of my a
this will be color is whenever I'm using
variables sometimes I do that my color
is accent I don't need this right now
but if ever I need to refer to my HTML I
do like having it on the side so color
as accent line height we'll just put my
line height to 1/4 now which is probably
what it's going to need to be my font
size
so if it's fifty that would be 3.125 REM
have a calculator closeby for doing this
you can you can come up with like a
little mix in or function in SAS that
can convert you to write in the pixel
value and it just pumps it out for you
but just yeah I just have a calculator
next to me I find that it's easy enough
to do okay so that's good me that's
probably all we need my h2 yeah we might
as well do it here span and just you
know if you're not used to SAS you can
see this is embedded in here if you're
writing this on your own you'd probably
in you're just doing normal CSS you just
have h1 span like that and do your thing
but because I'm using SAS I can do this
instead so my span this will be color
will be accent and I'm thinking ahead
just my colors gonna have to be accent
because the color there is different
from the color here so color accent font
not font size font family is my fun
family saw serif and the font it's going
to also be a display block that's gonna
make it be on its own line and the font
fam not fat family font size I need a
letter spacing I have to go back to my
typography after font size what's my
font size going to be my font size is
pretty big on this one I think 88 plenty
enough that's just 5.5 RAM so it
actually comes out to a nice round
number letter spacing
we're actually let's open up my
typography again we're going to have
letter spacing
it's 200 yeah I'm just gonna write that
whole thing out I'm pretty sure it's 200
right it's 200 here I can't do that in
here
I kill to start with like 10 pixels and
we'll figure it out right I think it
needs to be a pixel value and so my here
my letters letter spacing will be letter
spacing I wonder if I could have done an
expand and extend on oh well whatever my
age - we can have that my font size 32
is an easy one
- rim you're always basing on 16 right
so that one's easy letter spacing and
most of the time the color will be a
dark grey and I'll also put the line
height - one on this one for now
cool so that takes care we have this one
done we have this just trying I think we
have that one done that one done this
one done and those are fine I don't need
to come up with a style for those let's
go look at what our actual site is
looking like right now did I put my span
I put the spend on the beginning and at
the end I'm going to change that
oops save that makes more sense so
that's okay I obviously need to play
with my font sizes on there I put the
wrong font family guys h2 I didn't put a
font family font family is the font
family
I might make a mixin font family saw
serif because every time I need this I
need to have okay we're making a mixin
I'm I'm not gonna I think it's making me
my only mixin so I'm just gonna do it in
my typography so at mixing it's gonna be
called saucer any time I'm using the saw
serif font this is important because the
way six caps is working I always needed
to have letter spacing I always needed
to have all caps so if I'm always having
to write those lines in it's really
annoying to have to do that so I'm gonna
have my this and then we're gonna have
some variables on it that we can
variable some some options here that
we're gonna put and we're gonna have it
output something so we're gonna have it
output letter spacing will be I'll just
call this letter spacing we're gonna
have a cat we're into a few things here
let's do a font size of font size letter
spacing font size letter spacing color
will be color
lutely why am i - eing it let's just do
it like this you'll see why I'm doing it
like this in a second
so a font size letter spacing color text
transform transform line height I guess
we'll put line hide down there line
height
we'll be like hi whoops mine Hey
okay and the reason that I'm doing it
like this with all these variables here
I don't want to have to write them each
time because as I mentioned they're
going to be pretty consistent but what
we're going to do is we're gonna put
them up here so I'm gonna say my font
size comma then we're gonna have letter
spacing letter spacing but it's gonna
have a default of 10 pixels so this is
an optional one if I don't put in
anything for that it's automatically
gonna become 10 and I don't know if it
tenth actually looks pretty good I'm
pretty happy with how that looks so I'm
gonna leave that like that actually this
probably should be relative to the font
size right so I should probably do it in
m/s 10 over 16.6
M let's see what that looks like that's
just a peer guess right there without
playing at the calculator my color will
be by default what will my color be by
default we'll just have it set to gray
by default but it could be overwritten
color is gray text whoops
colors gray text transform is going to
be upper case and line height whoops
line height by default will be one I'm
gonna find variable letter spacing where
did I use a variable of letter spacing
partials base that I delete it I had one
when I got rid of it yeah okay so let's
delete all this from my span delete all
this 5.5 I'll remember that delete all
that
add include serif and so what am i
including I'm including do I should
change I need to change my a so what am
i changing
I need my font size so my font size is
font size is 5.5 Ram if I save that
buying say yes it worked awesome if
accepted I put the wrong freaking font
again font size letters but I didn't put
the font font family in this case it's
always this gonna be a fun family saucer
there we go awesome it worked
point six is too big point five point
two point three yeah we'll go with that
for now cool good
so that will set the font size to five
point five and it's just bringing in all
my other stuff so it's automatically
setting all these other things that I've
put now I could overwrite any of them so
I could come in here and then say that
my letter spacing is actually 100 pixels
and then it's going to overwrite that
one but I don't have to override it the
only one I have to set for sure is my
font size actually in this case I do
need to overwrite my color my color is
accent cool good so then my h2 I can do
an @include
serif font size of two rim
and bang it's good except this is way
too late
that's my gray oh it should be dark gray
wow that's my gray why is it look so
much easier to read here colors I mix
them up
copy paste save now I can actually read
stuff cool good good good
so sorry but that little detour and
setting up this little mixin but I do
think it's a really useful mixin to have
just cuz mix-ins are awesome when we can
use them and my letter spacing looks
pretty good on that of course the one
last thing that I just completely forgot
about is my actual paragraphs because
they're not too far off and this is I
think just gonna be a font size of what
is it probably point 875 ram I'm pretty
sure that's fourteen my line height
should are to be set up from up here and
I'm not gonna do that here that should
actually be my font size on my body just
because I also want it to affect down
here too I want to make sure that it's
on my labels and my other stuff as well
and anything that might not be in a
paragraph so I'm not gonna put that on
my paragraph but what I will do
actually no we're not going to do that
on there we're gonna come up to here and
say h1 h2 I don't have any h3s right so
just P I'm gonna do a margin top of zero
and a margin bottom of one M just for
the moment I do that I'm pretty much all
my projects just because I find it helps
me be able to control everything a
little bit better I will have this
sometimes a bit more customized and
maybe this isn't exactly what I want at
the end but I think that's more or less
where
I want to be I might be forgetting a
couple of little things that I might be
missing out normally that's how it works
when I'm working on my projects so if I
am oh I will be catching it later on but
if I did miss anything make sure you
leave a comment down below to let me
know that I missed something so I can
include it or you can even put in a pull
request this is up on github so you can
follow along on github there is my
starting point folder as well as my work
progress folder the work progress folder
will probably be ahead of where my
YouTube videos are because I do film
these a little bit in advance sometimes
more sometimes a couple of days before
but you might find that you see more
work being done but you can make a fork
of it put in a pull request for either a
mistake I did if there's a typo
somewhere anything like that and ask to
merge it in and if it's something that I
think would be a good idea even if it's
just like an improvement you think would
be better just go for it and if I like
the suggestion I would definitely pull
it in if you have any questions any
comments make sure to leave them down
below in the comments please I try to
