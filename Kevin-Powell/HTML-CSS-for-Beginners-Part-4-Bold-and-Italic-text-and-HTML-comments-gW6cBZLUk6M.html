on HTML and CSS for beginners in this
video we're gonna see how to make our
text bold and italic as well as how we
can add comments to our code that the
browser's won't read so as you can see
on the screen I've already gone ahead
and added a bit of content here just to
add a few paragraphs of text so to make
bold text and italic text sadly it's not
like our paragraphs with a P and
headings or with H tags and they made it
a little bit different and it's because
we it's not necessarily about making
things bold or italic but it's about
putting more emphasis and more
importance on our text so what I'm going
to do is I want to make this first
sentence here so the first sentence
right here bold and to do that you want
to use something called a strong tag and
then I'm going to come all the way to
here and I have to close my strong tag
I'm gonna save this and we'll refresh
and there you can go you can see that
everything has become bold that was
inside my strong tag so just to do that
again we'll do it on the last sentence
in this paragraph strong and then I come
all the way over here close strong and
let's refresh and now you can see this
has also become strong or bold just to
show you what's important to close your
strong tag if ever you forgot to close
your strong tag everything becomes bold
it's not going to end at the end of this
paragraph it just keeps going until the
end of your document so make sure you
close your strong tags and that should
be a close forward slash there we go
so let's come down to our second
paragraph now and look at italic text so
just like the strong tag we're making
our text stronger we're making putting
you know it's bigger it's more important
italic text the whole idea behind it
alakazoo even put emphasis on our text
so what we use for that is an e/m tag
and that stands for emphasis so let's
just do this whole first sentence close
um save that and refresh and we can see
here that it's become italic let me just
zoom in a bit on the screen so we can
see our text has become italic there now
we're just learning HTML and CSS so
maybe you'd look at this later and go oh
man I forget what the
M stands for so let's look at doing what
we can HTML comment so I'm just going to
come up here in this empty space here
and I'm gonna put in a triangle bracket
exclamation mark - - and you can see
everything after that now is becoming
gray and this is an HTML comment - -
closed triangle bracket and what that's
doing is its closing my comment so it's
not like a regular thing we have to tell
it that it's a comment so it's not just
with my greater than and less than
symbols or my triangle brackets it's
using this is telling it that it's the
start of a comment and this is telling
it it's the end of a comment and if I
save my document and I refresh we won't
see any differences here the comments
are just notes to yourself or other
people who are reading your code so what
you could do is you could say in here
the M stands for emphasis this makes my
text italic and up here we could put in
another one strong makes my tech whoops
makes my text bold and there we go think
it's important we want to put a space
here in here it will still work if you
do that but it's possible you run and do
some issues depending on what symbols
you have at the end so always just do
your opening we do our exclamation mark
- - put in all over a comment
sorry put in a space put in your comment
space and then put in the two hyphens
and the triangle bracket there again I'm
gonna save my document and refresh and
again you can see that there's no change
there another thing you can do if you
want bold italic text is you can put in
M and I can come here and do a close M
save that and refresh and you can see
that it becomes bold italic now of
course I don't need all of my text to be
strong and bold I could take this M tag
here and maybe only make these last two
words so all of this is bold then this
is bold and italic and
then we close it all off so it's regular
bold then I have my bold italic and they
both close right there and then if I
needed to I could come down here and put
in yet another strong tag and I kept it
close strong and then over here I could
come and put another mm tag and I could
close em safe so there's my bold text
over here is my next italic text and so
on and so forth just as a quick side
note if you're looking online for some
tutorials and stuff you might see
something called a bee tag close bee and
let's do this next word here I and I'll
close my eye over here I'll save that
and you'll notice that it's actually
working so this word here is right there
it's bold and this here is my italic
text here bee and I are obviously much
faster to write and easier to do the
problem is they have no meaning behind
them it's a visual representation of
bold and italic but it doesn't actually
add importance to your text and this is
important these days one of the things
we have to worry about with Web Design
is accessibility there's going to be
people who are visiting your website
that can't see the screen very well they
might have something called a screen
reader that which reads the website to
them and this takes strong and em into
importance for putting more importance
and emphasis on our text whereas the B&amp;amp;I
tags don't add any importance to the
text it's a visual representation but it
doesn't do it doesn't actually add
meaning to our text just like an h1 it
actually adds meaning it's telling the
browser that this is a title it's not
just making it bigger it's it's giving
it real meaning the strong M tags give
things real meaning
that's add another little comment here
just as a reminder to yourself do not
use B and I they're not what we want to
be using so they're actually used for a
few other things now for little hacks
that you might find and you might see
those later on as you explore web
development a bit more but for the most
part we just pretend they don't exist
strong em that's the right way to go so
thanks so much for watching up until now
I really hope you like this video
if you have any comments any questions
leave them down below in the comment
section and next video we're going to be
looking at links we're actually in ads
and interactivity to our site by linking
to other pages and that should be a lot
of fun I look forward to seeing you
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
