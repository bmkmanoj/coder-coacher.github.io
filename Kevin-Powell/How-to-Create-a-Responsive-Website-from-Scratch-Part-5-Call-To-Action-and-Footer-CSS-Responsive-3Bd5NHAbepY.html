to make a responsive website from
scratch
so far we've built almost everything
we've gotten through there we've got
this about section here we've got our
portfolio section right here that's
looking pretty good that's what we did
in the last video and we've got our
footer down here and this is what we
want to be working on now I've got my
Photoshop open right here I'd forgotten
to do the HTML for this we're going to
throw that in right away and then we're
going to jump down and code the rest of
it and we'll be completely done once
we're all finished don't forget if you
do want to try this and follow along
with me I have provided the link down in
the description you can download all
these files and do the work yourself if
you want to give it a try so might as
well jump right into it but before I do
that that's the end of this series this
will be the last video in this series so
if you did like it please hit the like
button let me know that you enjoyed
watching these videos and leave a
comment let me know if you have any
questions about what I've done here and
if you have any future video ideas
please let me know I'd love to know what
you want to do and help you out with
those ideas so over here in our HTML
we'll come down and here's where I did
my footer and I completely forgot my
call to action so we're going to do a
section with section with a class of CT
a call to action and let's just pop open
Photoshop for a second here to check out
what I have in there now if you remember
back in the first video let's scroll up
here we had this here where the text is
super super similar to how the text is
treated here we just have a few
differences in color pretty much so I'm
going to do that the same way I did my
hero section all the way at the top and
here it is so let's just copy all that
copy scroll back down there we go paste
that in and obviously we have to come
and change the text that's in here so
like what you say here will be changed
to that and this line here copy that
text paste that in my span and our
button says hire us instead hire us so
let's save that and go and look at what
that looks like on our page I'm not sure
I like that really big space we have
there but let's see what we can do to
start with um so I'm going to scroll all
the way down before I do that actually
let's just grab this and we're going to
call this my CK my call to action so
first of all CTA has that crazy green
background color so we were using that
on our buttons I'm going to copy that
right there come down to my CTA
background color and paste that right in
that looks really nice we're going to
come and add some padding so padding
let's go with something like 3m and zero
that didn't add any oh no I never did my
clear fix because I never had to but all
of these things here are floating did I
never do a clear fix we got this far
down without having to worry about a
clear fix let's come all the way up to
my general stuff here and add one in
typography container so I'm going to do
this as a pretty simple one let's just
do I'll make a clear fix class but I'm
not actually going to use that I'm also
going to use that on my all my sections
should also use this and I could
probably put that on some other stuff
but I'm going to make the clear fix
class just in case I would need to use
it later on I don't think I'm going to
need one in this example but since the
beginning I've been working on this
assuming it would actually be a bigger
project that would have other pages so
that could be useful and in this case on
the section and actually in both of
these cases this should be and after and
after so we have after we need a content
there's no content but we need to put
that there so there is no content and it
exists then we need to do a display I'll
just do a display block and we need a
clear both and that should fix it except
section doesn't have a period there we
go and that's looking much better except
now I
some space what's that coming from let's
turn off the responsive mode for now
what's this coming from right there
inspect container portfolio has a margin
bottom
I gave it a margin of three M zero I
don't need a space on the bottom where's
my portfolio portfolio margin three M
zero zero so we have three on the top
zero on the left and right and zero on
the bottom that's looking pretty good
I'm actually happy with my spacing on
that and we just need to change one more
thing which is we need to be able to see
our button in my Photoshop design I put
my text in white but I have a feeling
the white may be a bit hard to see but
we're going to try it out let's see
color FFF I find that a little bit hard
to read so I think I'm actually going to
leave it black I think that looks a
little bit better and I need to change
the color of my button now the real
question of it and you can see there is
my button do I want to change the color
of my button only in the call to action
or should I have a black button and I
think in this case it would make more
sense to have a black button so right
now it's button accent I don't want it
to be accent I want it to be button dark
and now I have to come to my buttons so
now we can see it but it's just the
wrong color my buttons were pretty close
to the top there there we have a button
button accent copy all that paste and
this will be my button dark except my
color will be my two three two three two
three my border color oh no yes two
three two three two three that looks
better except now on hover I'm going to
change my background to two three two
three two two three and my color here to
my green let's see what that looks like
zero-zero ff6 ce o-- dark that would
help and there we go i think that looks
pretty good but I have some spacing
issues here that I don't do I did want
that big space I liked it there actually
because it's this nice big area here the
spacing is kind of off mmm inspect each
one title is that margin specific to my
title margin top margin bottom it was
specific I'd purposely spaced it like
that hmm ba ba ba so I think I'm going
to change this a little bit I'm going to
call this title call to action title
actually I should change that to title
call to action title call to action just
so it's you can tell that it's whoops
I'm zooming in there so the main reason
I'm doing this where it's title and then
title call to action is I want to use
all this styling but I want to overwrite
it a little bit and just by keeping its
title this is still a title but it's a
special title because it's in the my
call to action section and I'm looking
for my CSS and I can't find it because I
should be in my CSS file and now I want
to find my typography which will be a
little bit higher buttons paragraphs
title' title span and that means my span
here is still going to work because it's
still a title I don't have to redo
everything but title call to action
margin bottom 0.5 mm yeah that looks a
lot better I'm actually just going to be
margin 0.5 M this I want my space on the
top to have disappeared
margin-top should actually be zero let's
just do a zero zero 0.5 0 on the top 0
left and right point 5 on the bottom
just to create my space here and the
main reason I want to do that is here I
want to make sure that my space here and
my space here are the exactly the same
and the easiest way to do that is just
with my padding so I have no margin
after my button I have no margin on the
top I can control all that now with my
padding down in my call to action and I
want it a lot bigger let's double it
that looks nice and let's go look on a
smaller screen the like if that broke
over 2 lines but I'm pretty happy with
how that looks pretty much across the
board I don't think that needs any other
work I'm pretty I'm pretty happy with
that this could be maybe a little bit
smaller 5 cool and now nice and simple
not much CSS for that one I and will
come down and do our footer so footer in
my footer we need to put a background of
23 23 23 our color needs to be FFF that
looks much better now if we jump into
here I've made this UL class of unstyled
list and I did that because again if
this was on other pages if this might
not be the only place I want an unstyled
list I would need to am I prefer doing
that instead of just saying my footer
lists don't have don't have any style on
them or the no bullet points I'd rather
get rid of that on just having a class
for that so it makes it easier to reuse
if I have another list somewhere else it
becomes super super easy to come later
on and use it
so my unstyled list is margin of zero a
padding of zero and a list style type
none and that looks much better cool and
now I can actually jump back into my
footer and make this look a little bit
nicer so let's just go look again I've
set this up as a column three a column 1
a column 1 and a column 1 and I called
them that because I wanted to create a
bit of a grid system that again could be
used across other parts of my page so I
even before my navigation before my
buttons after my typography I'm going to
come in here and create a my buttons are
part of my typography so we'll even do
it before my buttons now before my
typography let's come in here and make a
column system to be a really simple one
I'm not going to flesh out the whole
thing the only ones I have on my column
one and I have a column three so the
first thing is that we want all things
that start with column to be floating to
the left so a nice easy way to do
something like that is to use this
selector so this is an attribute
selector I can you can choose attributes
like this and in this case it what we
want to class the reason that I'm doing
it inside of this and not just selecting
the class themselves is because I can
come and do this little hat thingy which
is shift 6 on my keyboard is equal to
and I'm going to put a call call - so
any class that starts with so this means
starts with column - we'll get a float
left and you can see everything's
disappeared because I also need my
footer to have the clear fix on it
luckily that's right here section after
and footer after well I don't want that
there footer after there we go so
they're all floating to the left
so anything that starts with call this
float to the left except we might as
well should we make the last child flip
to the right
maybe we'll see we'll get there we'll
come back to that now I do need to
select my column three and do something
with that and we do need to choose our
column one and do something different
with that and pretty much this is for
setting up the widths basically if we
look here we have a nice it's a three
four five and six so we're using a six
column in total that we're playing
around with on this system that I'm
developing so that means my column three
should have a width of fifty percent and
my column one should have a width of I
can't do math in my head right now I'm
sixteen point six six six sixteen point
six six six six percent that should give
us what we want I think so let's
minimize that let's hit a save and it
worked super and we could add a little
bit of padding in there just to make
sure things aren't scooching up against
the side and whatnot and I should
probably put all of that in a container
let's come back footer I forgot to do my
container cut I always forget to do
containers when I'm doing things on the
fly and just tab that over that should
place it inside a container there we go
so it's no longer touching the edges and
perfect okay so that's looking good I
have that the one thing I'm a little bit
worried about I don't want that to be
center-aligned did you drew I also want
to say that my footer the widths I think
are fine on that my footer should be a
text-align:left there we go and I
definitely want some padding just to
stop things here it looks okay cuz the
words are short enough but it's really
really close there so this is where we
can use a little bit of padding just to
create the spacing that we need all the
way back up to our column system call
all my columns will have a padding of
let's try point to 5m and I don't want
on the top 0.25 M 0.5 I don't want to be
too big and let's just do an inspect on
that that looks pretty good to me I'd be
happy with that except the first one
shouldn't have any padding on the left
and the last one shouldn't have any
padding on the right so you can copy
that and say first child padding left is
zero and that exact same thing but last
child padding right is zero and did that
work let's see that didn't work first
of type why didn't that work
ha ha ha ha first child um it wasn't
working because I'd had to here I was
dreaming like pseudo elements and not
pseudo classes so first child should
just have the single one there save and
that we can see there's no padding on
the left of that one and there's no
padding on the right of that so it just
keeps with our system properly and I'm
pretty happy with that we obviously need
some padding on our footer footer
padding we'll go with the same 5 m0 that
we had on our call to action there and
that's good now my only worry is
obviously at this screen size it's going
to break completely so I we do want this
to all stack
I think column ones I'm always going to
keep as column ones but column threes
wouldn't generally if something's in a
column one you'd think that you'd want
it to stay pretty narrow or that it
would be able to stay pretty
because can fit something in there yeah
I'm going to keep my column ones like
that but at media Oh which actually
means and this is actually gonna have to
be a 100 percent they're all going to be
100 percent let's just come down here
then and we're going to do we're going
to wrap all this in a media query
actually at media because I only want
this on the larger screen sizes so my
min width um let's just start with 40
REM and see where we go from there
that's not correct why is that taking it
so there that looks okay that looks okay
why are these still next to each other
though column 3 column 1 oh because
they're floating to the left ah yeah I'd
want um all of them starting with that
will also be a width of 100% by default
and I also need this I made a few
mistakes here a lot of this needs to go
inside of my media query I was working
from big to small when I should have
been working from small to big and this
will come into my media query and this
copy delete will all come into my media
query
so basically what I'm saying is I want
them all to be a width of 100% and just
treated normally I want the new normal
dibs pretty much which this does look a
little strange we're gonna have to space
that out a bit but we want it to just
look normal we want them all to be
treated normally but then once we hit
this breakpoint right there
it breaks into the columns and that 40mm
actually works really well in this case
because that's about as narrow as I'd
want that column yeah so what I'm going
to do to fix this a little bit is at
this screen size I'm going to say that
my columns also come with a margin top
of 1m except for the first child first
child margin top of zero and here we
want all of them to have a margin top of
zero margin top of zero so they all have
a margin top of zero at the big screen
size but at the small screen size they
get margins to separate them and this
one here doesn't so it doesn't sort of
screw up our spacing around the whole
thing now I really don't like how views
are like that I'm wondering if my column
one should just stay columns all the
time it looks a little bit strange that
it's breaking and going down like that I
must say let's just see what happens if
I do this
um column one width of thirty three
point three three three three three
three three three three four percent and
a float:left
that's not too bad and then it will snap
and go like that I'll live with that
instead I think that looks a lot nicer
and now that I'm actually happy with
that you know what that means guys it
means this series is completely done
we've got this nice looking website we
got our navigation logo we have this
nice big area here it comes down we have
this cool section here that I'm really
happy with how that turned out
especially with how it works on the
responsive side of things we have our
portfolio that's looking nice with the
little hover effect our call to action
right there and our nice little basic
photo here at the bottom it all works
really well it's fully responsive and
yeah we're done so as I said at the
