HTML and CSS for beginners my name is
Kevin and today we're looking at floats
and clears I'm not gonna lie to you it's
really weird but really important to
know if you want to make a layout you
need to get how this works all right
so in this video we're not really gonna
see how to build a layout I just want
you to understand how floats and clears
work I find it hard because I doesn't
really have a real world example to like
make a good metaphor with I've tried a
lot of times I've looked at what other
people explain it and there's there's no
good metaphor for it in the real world
so it's hard to anchor it with an idea
of how other things work I'm gonna start
with oh well let's just start looking at
my document it's a little strange
compared to before but it's really gonna
help us out with what we're doing
floating an image is always the first
thing you learn how to do so we're gonna
look at that first just to sort of get
an idea of what floats do so if you see
here I have an image and after my image
I have a paragraph and what I can do is
I could come into here and just say all
of my images and I wouldn't normally do
all of my images like this I would give
it a class but all of my images are
going to do something called float left
and we'll explore what other options we
have for float in a second but I just
want you to see what it does and my text
is wrapping around my picture now so
let's just undo that save undo undo undo
undo ha and save my text is there and
when we do our float left blow to left
my text wraps up around there so that's
kind of cool and it's definitely
something you'll probably want to do at
one point or another where you won't
want just one a picture you'll want your
text next to it like that what I'd
probably add with this is a little
margin on the left not the left the
right say 20 pixels just so my text
isn't actually touching my picture so
that's pretty cool now you have two real
options with floats you can float to the
left and when I floated left it didn't
actually move my picture but it let the
text come up next to my picture the
other option I have is to float to the
right
and that will put my picture all the way
on the right side doesn't matter on my
page so let's say I make the screen
bigger it's always just it's floating to
the left it's going all the way over to
the left side so my text can come and
wrap around it and it will sit on the
right instead of sitting on the left if
I were to do this I'd want to switch my
margin to the other side just to put the
space here and everything is hunky-dory
that's kind of cool
if you look at your floats the only
other option is none which is the
default and that sets it back to what it
was sadly there's no float center which
everybody always will asks me about
there's no float center option it's
either all the way to the left or all
the way to the right so let's just do
our float left again so we have that now
to explain a little bit of what's going
on I've set up these two boxes down here
and this box as you can see has a
transparent background on it so you can
see the background popping through just
a little bit and this is kind of
important so this is my red box that I
have here in my CSS and then my blue box
is the one underneath it normally I
wouldn't have a red box in blue box like
this but for demo purposes it's a great
example so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to come down in here and I'm gonna
tell my red box to float to the left and
what people usually assume is gonna
happen as my blue box will move up
around just like the text did so my text
went and wrapped around so it would make
sense if this blue box came up over here
let's save that hit refresh and well
that's not quite what happened my blue
box moves up underneath the red box and
then I have my text here that's sort of
wrapping around there now in that empty
space so what happens when I'm floating
is a picture it's actually floating up
in the air it's a cloud now it moves all
the way up into the sky it's moving up
higher and other things can go
underneath it but you'll notice my text
isn't going underneath here but what if
my paragraph let's just come to here and
give my paragraph a background color of
yellow
and you can see this just turned orange
because what's actually happening is
this paragraph which is a big block is
moving underneath here just like this
blue box has moved underneath it but the
text that's inside my paragraph which is
this big yellow box is wrapping around
and text won't go underneath floating
items this item has a margin of zero on
it and that you know figure the way the
margin on that's working is it's a
margin of zero so if this was a bigger
margin let's do a margin right of fifty
pixels and it's gonna push the text 50
pixels away even though the box that
it's inside is still underneath it and
if I did a margin of negative fifty
pixels then my text can actually go
underneath it so that margin of zero is
sort of creating like this space here
like it's right on it but it's stopping
text from going underneath there but my
box itself can go underneath remember I
said this is kind of strange now you
probably understand what I'm talking
about it's gonna get even stranger now
the sort of the the brother and sister
of this whole things we have two floats
it's brother and then we have the sister
that's the clear they always work
together floats and clears or two
properties that work with one another so
float brings things up in the air and
that's other things go underneath it
other than text and then the clear so
let's find my paragraph here and I can
come and say clear both oh that's just
yeah I'm gonna put both because clear
both is what you use pretty much all the
time
oops I forgot my semicolon at the end
there and there we go what they clear
both it does you'll notice now this
isn't going up on the slide here anymore
and this paragraph down here is not
going underneath it's starting right
after that item so if I have clouds
floating up in the sky and other things
we're going underneath them picture the
clear this is gonna really kill my cloud
analogy yeah what else can float not a
lot of things float that stick with the
cloud
anyway there's no real analogy for this
and that's why the whole thing falls
apart but what the clear does is this
sort of sets up this big wall here so
it's clearing the floating items so
instead of going underneath the floating
items it starts everything fresh again
so this paragraph here instead of going
next to that it's gonna come underneath
just like as if this wasn't floating and
here too it's it's pretty the clear
makes it go you know if anything above
it is floating it's just gonna pretend
it isn't floating and it's gonna start
underneath like it normally would but
where that gets interesting here it's
kind of useless but where it's
interesting is here where this one is
paying attention to the float but this
one isn't you're probably thoroughly
confused right now honestly I don't
blame you
let's get to a little bit more of a
realistic example and I'll keep these
two boxes but let's just take off there
let's do a couple things here I'm gonna
grab this paragraph cut I'm gonna put it
inside my red box and let's take you
this second paragraph here and let's
drop that into my blue box
oops I made a little mistake there I'm
gonna save that and the only other thing
I'm going to do I'm gonna give these
both the same width of 500 pixels and
I'm gonna take off their heights because
they don't need them anymore
oops save that and refresh and let's get
rid of that yellow background on our
paragraphs paragraph
background color yellow gone and let's
get really clear - we don't need that
and let's get rid of my float and
refresh okay so we're back to normal
blue box let's also make our text color
white and refresh so I have one box here
and one box here and what if I want
these two boxes to be next to one
another what I need to do is I'm going
to take my red box and I'm
left and then I'm gonna take my blue box
and do a float right I'm going to save
this and refresh and oh no my page isn't
big enough there we go
they have room they go next to each
other so this is floating to the left
this is floating to the right they can
go next to one another the problem is if
this gets smaller that drops down and
goes underneath because there's not
enough room so to really show you what's
happening with floats in clears I've
created this other page here where I
have ten boxes going down the screen and
what I'm going to look at is I'm gonna
start off just by floating this first
box now what's really important here is
all of them have the same width and
height so you can see they're all the
same size so if I come here and I just
take box one and it goes in order that's
something that a little bigger so I get
box one down into box nine down there
and so if I take box one and I float
this one to the left actually I'm gonna
start by floating it to the right so we
can see what happened so when I float
that to the right this and when i
refresh my page this pink box is gonna
shoot over to the right side and
everything else will move up that's sort
of what you'd expect at this point I'm
floating it so it can move over and
other things can come there instead of
being stacking one on top of each other
but if I float it to the left
oops what left so just like in that last
section we were looking at on the other
page the content below would go
underneath that if I change my pink here
let's just make it our GBA I'm gonna
make it a bit transparent just make it
black zero zero zero to five so we can
see that red box is underneath it change
it back to pink so my red box is
underneath but now if I take this box
too which is my red box and I float this
one float the left what do you think is
gonna happen let's hit refresh and find
out my red box moves up to here and we
also lost that dark red one firebrick
you
a darker red that darker red went
underneath this pink box we can't see it
anymore so if I float my firebrick float
left that one's gonna jump up to over
here now and the other ones move under
here so what's happening when we're
using our floats is it's changing how
the element is working before that these
are block level elements so they're
taking up all the space on my screen
here even though they're just sort of
stacking we said they're like Legos they
like clicking together and stacking one
on top of each other when I float it
completely changes how they work it's
allowing other elements to go under them
they're floating up in the air and my
column here can shimmy up underneath but
they start working together instead of
going underneath each other and all that
they've all floated up to the same level
and they can work together but now
instead of going one underneath it they
have space to go one next to each other
this is kind of weird so what I'm gonna
do is I'll take my floats off here so we
don't have to do them all one by one and
I'm just gonna say all my boxes have a
float left hit refresh and there we go I
get a nice big line like that and what's
really important here is if I change the
size of my browser you can see that when
I get to here what's happening is the
boxes are falling underneath so they're
staying in the same order but when they
run out of room they start stacking you
know they don't have room here they're
not going to stay there they're gonna
slip down to the next line and start
going across like that which is
important and that's why when I was
looking at this one when I ran out of
room that blue box would fall and come
down here instead so it didn't have
enough room it's floating right so it's
staying on the right side but these two
they're interacting with each other they
can't fit next to each other so they go
one on top of each other again so the
same thing is happening here
where they're falling down one after
each other
and another thing we can do is we can do
a float right so if I take a float right
and I save that let's hit a refresh so
all of them are going to float right
instead and they go in a reverse order
and this is really weird what's
happening is box one is the first one so
box one is floating up all the way to
the right and then box two is going up
to the right it can't go past box one
box one is already here so it doesn't
push box one out of the way it just
snuggles up next to it and then the
third one and the fourth one and they
all line up one after each other so you
have to be very careful with float right
it can if you have more than one thing
floating to the right it will reverse
the order of them so that's really
important to remember in general most
things I do float left and occasionally
we float the last element or something
to the right just to make sure that it's
lighting up properly but float left is
something we use a little bit more often
so what I'm going to do now is I'm going
to come on my yellow box here which i
think is box five yeah and I'm gonna put
a clear on this one so I'm going to say
clear:both I'm gonna save that and I'm
gonna come here and push refresh and you
can see that it's no longer going next
to this orange one it's coming and
falling onto its own line so box five is
really you know this clear is really
important it's the clear always forces a
new line it's saying ignore the things
that are floating above it and instead
come and start down here the reason I'm
putting clear both is the only options
we have are clear both clear left or
clear right if something is set to clear
right let's save that refresh it's like
nothing ever happened up here it's only
paying attention to things that are
floating to the right if nothing's
floating to the right it's as if this
clear is not there and if I did a float
left because everything up here is
floating to the left
it pays attention to all of them so this
is also important to know in general
clear:both is what you want to use like
99% of the time so pretty much every
time you is clear it will be a clear
both it makes it a little bit easier to
remember just use clear both you might
be a little unsure
right now and when you actually want to
be using clears and that's fine it's a
little abstract it's really strange
right now in just a few videos though
we're gonna get around to actually
making some layouts and when that
happens this is all going to make a lot
more sense just on how it works and why
we want to do it so keep all of this in
mind play around with it a little bit
see if you can't get a better
understanding of what's really going on
if you have any questions about it do
please leave them down in the comments
below I'll do my best to help out and if
you'd like the video please hit the like
