going to be exploring a much requested
topic from my subscribers which is what
is give and get and all of that and how
do I use it so my name is Kevin and I
bring you weekly tips tricks and
tutorials on web design and development
mostly development side so far and as I
mentioned this week is actually started
a series that's going to be taking a
look at git and github and this week's
video is going to be exploring just get
and what git is because it's not
actually the same thing as github github
helps us use git but before we get into
the whole github thing it's important
that you understand what git is and how
git works
and then in the next video or two we'll
get into the whole github thing before I
get into all of that though I just have
a couple of quick quick things that I
want to talk about the first one is
thank you to the 500 subscribers or
almost 500 subscribers by the time this
goes live we'll be really close to that
and that blows my mind because I really
feel like we were just at 100 subs when
I made a video for that and we're
already almost at 500 so thank you so
much and to follow that up you might
notice the lighting looks a little bit
better in here so I've gone and got a
lighting kit and I think it looks a lot
better
I saw the channel growing I had this
really ugly background with shadows on
it and before that it was even worse
than that I do want to be on camera a
little bit more often so I thought it
would be important to have some proper
lighting so it doesn't look like some
amateur hour while I'm doing these
videos so this is for you guys keep on
subscribing I really appreciate it and I
wanted to show my appreciation by trying
to up the video quality a little bit I
also think I figured out finally how to
get the sound the same and all my
details so that's good too but with that
out of the way let's jump right into it
and find out what the heck it is so kit
is a form of version control it lets us
branch project merge projects together
fork things off all sorts of weird words
that we will be getting into and what
they actually mean very soon but the
basics of it is it keeps track of all
the changes we've been making to files
it actually lets us roll back to any of
those previous changes if we need to and
the branches thing which we'll be
looking at miss
is incredible it's really it was a game
changer when git was released and it's
why it's so popular today the other
thing would get is it's really amazing
for working on large teams because it
makes sure that everybody can be working
on their own files at the same time
without having to worry about the
changes the other person's making they
worry about their own changes and then
they can bring their files back together
into one main repository after it's
really awesome for that so I have some
stuff ready let's jump into that so you
can understand a little bit more of what
I'm actually talking about
so get let's teams that people work on a
single project without having to worry
about what other people are doing and
this is huge now if you're just learning
HTML and CSS maybe you haven't started
working on a big project yet but let's
say you and me are working on a site
together you're in charge of updating
some of the pictures and I'm in charge
of updating the text so what we have on
the screen right now is the master
branch and what the master branch is is
pretty much the timeline this is the
start this is where we are the very
beginning of the project and as we make
changes they're going to appear along
here but the thing is when you want to
start making the changes you don't
necessarily want to put it on the live
version of the website you don't want it
on the active project is what if you
make a mistake along the way or what if
you make some changes and I make some
changes that are different and then it's
going to get all muddied up so what we
want to do is you're going to create
what we call a branch and this is you
making a copy of the website you're
copying the whole website over to your
own branch that's off here so the master
version of it is left on touch the
master is still exactly the same
the master hasn't been touched the live
version of the website is completely
fine you're coming up here you're making
your copy of the website and then you
make some changes to your websites
you're doing you know you're changing
those pictures and you're updating them
and doing whatever you have to do and
then you make some save so we keeps
track of it just like our master will
keep track of all the things going on
your branch will also keep track of all
the changes you make so here's some of
the changes you go updated all the
pictures on the home page save then you
make more changes so then you go and you
go to the about page and you save all
the changes there and you go okay this
is all my changes the about page save
you're done your job is done all the
list of things you wanted to do is done
so then
you're going to go and put in a pull
request we'll get to the pull request in
a second but one of the cool things with
get is while you're doing all of this
I'm making my own branch so I'm making
my own copy of the website I'm not
copying your version where your pictures
are going on I'm looking at the master
because the master is the version that's
currently live and it's the version
that's being worked on you know that's
the one that's the most important
because it's all been approved and it's
all good
so I have this going on now you put in a
pull request so you have these changes
they're ready to go you want those to go
on to the live version of the website
now with a pull request generally
speaking if you're working in a team
someone else will be approving your pull
request you won't be approving your own
pull request but if you're working on a
smaller project or you're working on
your own thing then you would have
control and you'd be able to approve
your own pull request when a pull
request is done it's actually going to
show you can compare the code of the
current version and of your version and
see you know just to quickly look and
make sure everything is ok and then it
will get pulled in to the master branch
now while that gets pulled into the
master branch so now this is pulled in
it's active all of your changes have
gone lives I'm still working on my own
changes and I can continue working on my
own changes I've updated the text on the
home page now I've updated the text on
the about page and now I want to put in
my own pull request
now the cool thing here is because I was
only working on the text when I put in
my pull request it's not even paying
attention to what you did with your
images because I didn't touch those
images it's only looking at where the
code is different so where the code is
different between my version and here is
all the text that's been done so it's
going to see all the changes I've made
it's going to compare those changes and
then it can be approved and pulled in if
I made changes to the pictures to that's
going to know it and it's going to go
there's a conflict here you change the
picture one way I change the same
picture but I put something different
it's going to go oh we have a problem
there's a conflict this conflict has to
be resolved before the pole can be made
so that is cool it keeps track of these
things and it makes sure these things
don't cause problems even if you change
file names it keeps track of file name
than everything so it knows if you
change a file name it's still the same
file with a different file name so it's
it's smart gets very intelligent but in
this case I only change the text you
only change the pictures we have no
conflicts the pull request is approved
and it jumps into the live site as well
so you change the pictures I change the
text and it's all good and this can even
you can even branch off of branches so
if you're working on a new big version
of your website maybe you have little
things going along you have a big
version to branch that's going and that
version too will have its own branches
jumping off of it here and there and all
over the place the other really cool
thing with this is say I pull this in
and then we go oh my goodness we just
made a huge mistake there's a big
problem with it it's on the live site it
got approved but there's you know I've
screwed a whole bunch of stuff up it
keeps track of everything we've done we
can roll back to this version there's no
problem with that at all
and in fact there should be a circle
here in a circle here because you can
even roll back to where that branch was
created so it's really smart it's
version control you can always roll back
if there's any problems you can have
multiple people working on things
without files having to worry about them
conflicting with each other it's a lot
like having different people making you
know file save as and I have my own
folder there and you copy your own
folder but it's keeping track of all the
changes we're making so when we go to
push those folders together we're not
running into a whole bunch of problems
it's working without any issue
whatsoever so git is really really cool
and that's pretty much how git works
but you're probably wondering where
github comes into all of that so what
we're going to do is in the next video
we're going to explore how github helps
us use git and makes it a little bit
more user friendly thank you so much for
watching the video I appreciate it I'm
happy you got all the way to the end so
if you have any questions or comments
about what I've been talking about
please leave them down below in the
comments I'll get back to you and I want
to just say that I'm going to be
starting also a Q&amp;amp;A type video soon
because I've started getting a couple of
questions in the comments that are a
bigger picture they're not how do I do
this in the code it's more of a general
concept or something like that so
starting this week or early next week I
will have my first Q&amp;amp;A video if you want
to
have a question answered in that by all
means if I'm getting it from you guys so
again if it's a bigger picture you can
leave it on this video or any other
videos I read every comment that you
guys post so I will see your comments
along the way and yeah thanks a lot if
you haven't already subscribed please do
consider subscribing as I said at the
beginning I bring you weekly videos like
this they're posted every single
Wednesday
