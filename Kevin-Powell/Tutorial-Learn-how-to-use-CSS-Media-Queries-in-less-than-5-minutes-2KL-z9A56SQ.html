channel we learned how to code the web
and how to make it look good while we're
at it today I'm going to give you a
rundown on how media queries work and
we're going to do it in less than five
minutes now this is part of a new series
that I'm starting up where I'm going to
be looking at different important
concepts and giving you guys a rundown
on how they work in under five minutes
a little coding quickies because you
know not everyone has time to watch
twenty five minute long video all the
time now if you like this idea like the
video so that I know that you'd like it
and if you have any topic ideas and
things you'd like to see me do in less
than five minutes leave them in the
comments below but let's stop wasting so
much time and let's get to this if
you're here you probably know that
website needs to be responsive to today
so instead of worrying but why let's
just jump right into the how now media
queries are used either to create new
CSS rules or more often to overwrite
existing CSS rules and in general you
already have some CSS like I do right
now on the screen and we want to modify
that at different screen sizes so with
this page that I have on the screen now
it's nice and simple just threw it
together and I think it looks pretty
good on mobile but as the screen gets
bigger there's a few changes that I want
to make so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to come all the way down to here
and media queries always start with an
at media and then they have a
parentheses and then they have the curly
braces just write this every single time
so you don't forget anything and then
you go back into it and fill it out so
inside the parentheses here is one of
the places where we can write a rule so
in here I'm gonna write min width of 600
pixels so currently my paragraphs have a
font size of 1 R M and I want that to be
bigger as my screen size increases so
let's do just that all we need to do is
write our new rule inside of the little
squiggly braces here so I'm inside of
those I'm going to put my paragraph and
I'm going to just write normal CSS so my
paragraph will now have a font size of
1.25 REM save that and there we go
so now I can see that it's smaller and
then when it gets bigger it gets bigger
so as soon as I cross that threshold it
gets bigger and of course I can keep
doing that so on top of that I can add
another @media do that put all my things
there and go back inside of there and
we're going to do a min width of 800
pixels and we will do a paragraph
font size of 1.5 Ram and in this case
let's also go in through a line height
in there of 1.5 so now we might get to
800 pixels we can see the font size
jumps and my line height is also
adjusting at the same time now remember
with CSS the last rule always win so
let's say I have two rules here to
define the background of my site right
now Purple's on top so my site says
white but if I copy that purple one or I
cut it and I move it down below here and
I save it goes to purple the white gets
overwritten and my purple wins so we
don't actually want a purple background
but the same applies to media queries
you want to always make sure your media
query comes after what you're trying to
overwrite so if this paragraph was all
the way down here my media queries are
going to do nothing because it's
changing it this screen size is changing
in that and then this one is changing it
everywhere and there's no point in
having any media queries so just make
sure you put your original selector
first then you do your media queries
after that or you might see that
nothing's actually happening now other
than min-width we also have max width so
if you're doing things is trendy where
you know the mobile first way like I've
been doing in this video well then we're
starting in the small screen size we're
getting bigger and bigger so we're
adding rules as we increase the size of
it we're going with min width like I was
just doing but if you've designed your
site for desktop computers and you're
working your way down in that case you'd
want to be using max width instead of
min width and it works exactly the same
way other things you can use other than
focusing on width well you can focus on
the orientation of the screen you know
portrait or landscape and you can even
you know say if you want your CSS to
work for a screen or if you want it to
be working for when someone's printing
off your page so I hope you liked this
video and if you want some more
