building our portfolio website using the
CSS grid and this time we're actually
working on the portfolio section so I
have on the screen right now my markup
for the portfolio section and what we
wanted to look like in the end right now
it doesn't look quite like this so the
idea here is that I have my big
portfolio section it's gonna have the
gray background on it then I have a div
of portfolio items so that's gonna hold
all of my portfolio items here I'm gonna
have a featured portfolio item and then
just a whole bunch of my regular
portfolio items report fully item there
so once featured and the other ones
aren't and the idea is you could put
featured on any of them and it will
always be the first one here at the top
it's also gonna be the bigger one so in
here I have my image and then I have a
figcaption
and in my figcaption I'm a h2 a
paragraph and a link to get more info on
it so that is when we hover we are gonna
get oh no I lost it where is it there it
is when I hover on top we're going to
get something that looks like that so
when I hover I get all of this
information popping up on top and when I
click on the more info it eventually
will have this popping up but we're not
going to be doing that in this video
cool so let's get started on all that
and get rid of that for now and start
working on what this should look like so
the very first thing I'm going to do is
come into my partials here and I'm gonna
make a new file called port folio SCSS
and I'm gonna go into my all here and
I'm gonna import it so I'm just copy
paste and import portfolio save that
close that down and now I can start
working I'm gonna hit command back tip
I'm back tick and I'm in the vs code
right now so that brings up my terminal
if you're using well you've probably
been following along so you should know
how to do this at this point if you
haven't seen any of the other videos I
do recommend you start this from the
beginning or at least watch the first
one where I write the mark-up and
explain everything that I am doing cool
so here we go just really quick I did
have a question about using
grid areas I will be doing grid areas
when I get down to the contact me
section but for this one we're not going
to need it so there is quite a bit of
styling that's just going to go into
this to get the names and all of that on
top of here and but let's let's start
from the very beginning we have my whole
portfolio so dot portfolio port folio
gotta spell it right alright so my
portfolio simplest thing we can do is
just do a nice little text-align:center
we can also give it a background color
my background I haven't it's been a
little while I've seen like two weeks
because I pre-recorded some my other one
so I don't remember my color names that
was just like gray cool light gray there
we go and it will need some padding so
padding let's say 10 M 0 that looks
pretty good
I like trying to stick with just margin
bottoms and not having a margin top on
this one so I'm gonna go back into my
about me and I have a margin top on that
but we're gonna add a margin bottom on
this one of maybe 10 M I have such a
small margin top so why do I I'm gonna
go back to my initial design here for a
second okay I'll make that a bit smaller
but okay I'm gonna make this like five
and five um just because yeah I think
that works a little bit better this is
correct whoops this is probably coming
from my margin on my title I'm guessing
just go look inspect on there and
hmm did I make a mistake here somewhere
guys ah that section that's about me
oh my padding's is too big silly silly
silly okay
portfolio padding we'll make that five
just about matches so this space in this
space are equal okay so that's my
portfolio next what do I need to do so
now I'm going to look at my individual
portfolio item so we're going to do dot
port folio item these are figures and
figures my default I have a margin and
padding but I did take that off in my
first or second video so I'm not gonna
have to worry about that but one thing
we're gonna do is let's give it a
position of position of relative right
relative and an overflow:hidden
just in case and then we can we can I'm
just trying to think and what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to build out just the
functionality of it right so that should
be enough for now I just want the whole
hover and I want this sort of looking a
little bit better we're gonna come back
into our portfolio item after though
once they start doing it more layout
wise so a portfolio item we have our fig
caption so this one will be a
position:absolute which is why I put a
position:relative on this one it's also
going to need a background color on
there so background is my accent color
and with this we should do top I'm just
going to a top bottom right
left just for the moment so we can see
it
my background shouldn't be accent though
it should be rgba accent at like
probably I don't know point six how does
that look
I'm getting an error oh whoops there we
go that looks a little point do I need
it that dark which are point five for
now we'll make sure we can read our text
once everything is styled and what
speaking of that we might as well change
the color of everything here to white I
think white I actually made a variable
yeah okay in this case the text align
text alignment should be on the left so
we'll do that to fix that there there
buh-buh-bah that's okay so next we want
to be able to position our text a little
bitter so I think the best way is gonna
do a display flex on this and then a
flex direction we can do make that I'm
gonna do column but just to show you why
let's just save that and now they go the
wrong way so by doing my Flex Direction
column then they stack and they go back
to the way we want them and the whole
point of this is so I can bring my stuff
down to the bottom so if I do it
justified content flex and it will
instead of being all stuck to the top
will all be stuck to the bottom cool
I did a color white but we'll have to
fix our title up anyway so that's a
little better let's go look again at my
layout just to make sure we're sort of
on the right page here um we want it to
look more like that so I'm gonna
actually I did a flex and that's okay we
can pull that up after I'm wondering
here I should I don't have a very good
consistency between these two I'm
actually this and this should be the
same font I should fix that and make my
subtitle a little different good to know
I'm surprised I let that go actually
it's really bothering me now that these
are different okay but that's gonna pop
up okay so we're on the right
so let's just build in like the hover
that we're gonna have and then no I'm
gonna leave this up because I want to be
able to see everything and then we'll
put the hover and after so I have my
portfolio title I think is my titles so
let's just say color is white and we'll
see yeah there we go so that changed to
white I think one thing everything's
stuck to the side here we're gonna add a
little bit of padding already it's make
that maybe too even there we go that
looks much better
okay so we're on the right track this
needs to be much bigger so the size of
that font size is gonna be a three point
six two five Ram there we go so that
looks a little bit better we can always
play with that font size too but that
looks okay and I want this to be at the
top so I should just be able to do a
flex nut flex re-align self flex start
except it didn't what oh no it's because
I'm using columns that's not gonna work
flex start like here if I do a flex and
on that it's gonna move to the right
side because this is the main axis now
and the aligned self works along the
main axis and as far as I know there's
no way to actually align itself on that
so I let's take this display flex this
justify content end off so it's all
going to go back to the top I'm gonna do
a margin bottom Auto yeah there we go
okay cool
good really cool thing with flexbox is
if you do a margin bottom Auto it just
means like fill up all the space and
push all the other stuff down I could do
the same thing if I selected this I
could have done a margin top Auto and it
would have just shoved it all down but
yeah one of the nice things and again
this is flexbox guys we're not even
doing grid stuff but they're still
really um you know don't discount the
grid don't discount flex box so I keep
saying it but it's important that you
don't I have these little spaces right
now between all of these that's kind of
bugging me
that would be my portfolio item image
and I just realized I didn't nest this I
could have nested it but you know I
could have done that and it should still
work and that I'm not sure why I didn't
do that before so that's my figcaption
and let's just bring this in and do my
image in here to display:block there we
go
just to get rid of that little space on
the bottom I've talked about that before
but that's because it treats inline
images our inline block and so they're
accounting for the little space
underneath so it just gets rid of that
okay dokie let's just go back and look
at my design again so this actually
looks more or less like I want and I
just need my text to stand out and this
should be a little let's make this like
75 I need to be able to read my text
easier so portfolio item a my links I
don't think I gave those I called them
portfolio link so I might as well use
that actually portfolio link and I don't
need to nest it then and but if I'm
doing portfolio title portfolio link
cool okay so my portfolio link is color
white so white is fine and then my font
weight will be font-weight:bold and I
need to make my font size bigger let's
just go and once again look I know my
font size is bigger on my links than it
is on this the font size I know it's off
screen for you guys that's 14 and this
one is 16 so my font size font size of
one rim makes it tiny I'm gonna make it
a little bigger than that one point one
more info cool good so that's looking
not too terrible let's go back to my
design for one second I have my little
arrow that I should add in there too
my underlying is also more pronounced so
let's do it
text declaration of none and then we can
do a border bottom of like two pixels
solid it was doing and then I guess this
just needs to be aligned self flex start
there we go
by default things on that reflects
children are stretched so is stretching
the whole size so that fixes that and
actually let's make this like three
pixels cool good good that's looking
nice okay and I want to get that little
icon in here so what for that little
icon what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
say and after so this is after my
portfolio links but inside the link so
it's just after the oh the only thing
with this is the underline will go with
it but that's not the end of the world
after we want content do a URL so it's
going to be back one step images and
what do they call my arrow arrow broad
SVG arrow dot SVG I'm a little bit
worried about the size of this when I
save do I not have a white arrow I
didn't save my weight arrow I'll have to
come back and fix that then then we can
say with of 1m hey
can't a o display:inline-block oh my
goodness where did it go inspect its
there there's a height pin a width width
one cool cool cool um
that's more or less what I thought would
happen um so I do want a little bit of
space there so we can do a margin left
of like 0.5 m and the only problem is I
wanted that to be a white arrow and not
a black arrow
okay sorry but I guess I just exported
my arrow again but I'm white there we go
awesome I also think it's a little bit
too big so I'm going to do like point
eight and point eight for the size
awesome that's pretty good
cool good so I'm happy with that more
info it's pretty obvious it's a link I
like my little arrow on it that I am
happy with good good good so that's all
looking good now I want to build in my
hover effect because I don't want this
to always be up right and I'm also gonna
build it in with a focus because I do
want to make sure if I'm on a mobile
device that it works but we're gonna
start with let's just make sure we can
do all this
so my portfolio here we go so my top is
actually going to be at 100% so it
disappears and then what we're gonna say
is right here and hover big caption so
when I hover on top of this the
figcaption will get a top of zero and
there we go it snaps on and off now it's
not perfect by any means because we want
it to transition so let's add a
transition it transition of top ease-in
out 250 milliseconds
and it sort of just grows up and down
like that so there we go I think that
looks pretty cool and one thing I also
like about it is it's sort of like you
can see that the content like it's all
smushed together and it sort of
stretches out as it's doing it which is
a nice little effect but now so that's
working there but if I'm on a cell phone
it's just I can't get it so I'm also
gonna take this whole thing
copy paste it in and add a focus so when
you click on it it pops up it's not as
obvious it's not as user friendly but at
least it works so again if I click on
one of these it will show up so it's
better than nothing which still makes it
so I can click on my more info link
there yeah I think it's user friendly
enough I hope you agree with me and just
let me know so it's kind of cool you
know you click on it get the description
and all of that and you're good to go
cool so now we finally get to start
doing the grid ok guys so I ran into a
bit of an issue with my recording the
first time around and I actually have to
record the second half of this video
again so I've reverted back to exactly
where we were but the one difference you
might notice is over here my images are
squares now instead of rectangles when I
had exported originally from Adobe XD
they came out as rectangles and I
thought I I thought they were would have
come out as squares because that's how I
had them in my design
and I didn't realize so during my
recording the original time I went and
cropped them down I just went into
Photoshop open them all up with the crop
tool ratio one to one and cropped them
into squares because that's how I wanted
them in my design otherwise everything
is just where we left it so I'm going to
keep going
so we're gonna start with doing our
sports and we want to do at supports
display grid and today is the 17th and
as Edge has gone and rolled out full
support for grid from what I understand
so that is good we have full support for
it now from most modern
are from all the modern browsers um so
first I'm going to select my portfolio
items and just do a display grid on this
which of course won't change anything
but I do want to come in and give myself
some columns so we'll do my grid
template columns and we'll do a repeat
because we want two columns so I'm gonna
repeat two and just to show you if I do
one at far we should get there we go we
got my two columns so now what I also
want to do is I want to say that my
portfolio item and I want to choose my
featured one now I could just put dot
featured here I don't have to say
portfolio item dot featured I just find
it makes it more obvious what's going on
with this so that's why I'm writing it
like that and grid column and I want it
to be a span too did I spell that wrong
or did I spell it wrong here featured oh
I spelled portfolio wrong put the F on
there and there we go it's spanning two
and it just gets a whole bunch bigger
and that's pretty much what I want
except the reason I need to add a little
bit more here is let's say I didn't want
that one to be featured maybe I want the
third item to be featured and when I
save that now I don't want it to be in
the middle I actually want that to be up
here at the top so I'm gonna come back
to here and what I'm gonna do is i'm
going to say grid column is 1 over spend
2 so it has to start in my first column
and this is just in case I took like the
second one and I'm gonna do a grid row
of 1 over span 2 meaning it has to start
at the top so I have to start on the
left and I have to start at the top and
now whatever when I take and put the
featured on so even if I take it here on
the 4th one the fourth one will jump to
the top or I can go and take this last
one and that last one will jump to the
top which is exactly what I want so
awesome I'm really happy that that is up
there and I'll stick with that picture
because it's a pretty picture of a tree
so yeah that's pretty much what I wanted
to do with that now one thing is right
now this is working I'm gonna make a few
changes here just because this is it
looks good but I'm worried it's smaller
screen sizes that we're gonna have some
issues so this one still looks okay but
you can see we're running into some
problems here the font size is too big I
have my description and if we looked at
the original design might I had actually
turned my description off I didn't have
a description so let's go find where
should I put that figcaption I think it
is called that portfolio description
yeah so portfolio title portfolio link
right in the middle here I'm gonna do a
portfolio description and I'm actually
gonna say display know so I'm gonna save
that and it turns it off so it's off
everywhere except I want it to still be
on this one so I'm gonna say dot
featured so on my featured one and with
the ampersand so this is whassat
sass so it's saying inside of featured
portfolio description so this would be
the same thing as if I wrote the
portfolio description like that right we
usually see the the ampersand at the
beginning of something because you're
using like and hover or something like
that but it just means take whatever
your nested inside and put it there so
we can do featured and like that and put
display block so I have a description on
this one but these ones don't have a
description so that's nice and cool I'm
also going to change the size of my font
here because this one I think it's too
big it's crowding out this and on this
one my might as well make it bigger cuz
I can so that's my portfolio title so
let's make this a little bit smaller
just try to do it five that looks a
little better that makes a lot more
sense on that one and then again we're
gonna do the same thing we just did so
we're gonna say our featured am percent
is font size and we'll go a bit bigger
than we had it before let's try four
even do bigger than that I think five
they're real
so we have a nice big font on that it
stays sort of in proportion to the size
of our block here and then that one
shrinks down and actually I'm really
happy with how those font sizes worked
out so there we go I think that actually
looks really good so now we want to
build in there backwards-compatibility
right so let's come all the way up all
the way up where was it
I think it was down a little bit I'm
just gonna select this for the moment
and commented out and save and I want to
make this work with flexbox now to work
with flexbox I think we're gonna run
into a few little issues but we're gonna
try our darndest so it's actually on my
portfolio item mmm
it's a portfolio item let's start we're
gonna start with our portfolio items so
actually I should do want to come up
portfolio this would make more sense
right here so my portfolio items I'll
have a display flex and it puts them all
next to each other and this looks just
downright terrible so we can't keep that
obviously another thing I'm going to do
on this is a flex wrap of wrap so it
puts it sort of back to how it was but a
thing if you run out of room go one on
top of each other instead of one next to
each other and they were just getting
really tiny so this just stops that from
happening
and now we can say that my pork full
portfolio item so this is each
individual one no I already have that
right here actually so we don't need to
write it again we can add in here a flex
of I want to flex grow of one a flex
shrink of one and I want to give it a
minimum size I'm gonna start with say 10
mm which is like 160 pixels kind of
small but it's not terrible so you can
see it's actually sort of whoops it's
sort of doing what I wanted to do my
featured project is twice as big but
that's just by chance actually it's just
cuz it's the last one
so what's happening is they're trying to
be 10 REM in size which is 100
three pixels so it goes if it can fit
that so we get one two but I'm allowing
for growing and shrinking so because I'm
allowing for growing and shrinking they
will grow and shrink so this one is
growing to fill that area so if I you
can see here as it runs out of room
they're gonna stack this way then oh I
have room to fit two of them next to
each other so they're gonna squeeze in
next to each other then you saw before
when I get to here now there's room for
three of them so they're gonna fit now
these two other ones will come down here
and hmm that's kind of annoying my font
sizes are gonna get all screwed up here
so I might have to standardize that a
little bit so let's just see as this
gets bigger because I think it's gonna
get terrible at one point yep I think
it's really bad they just all sort of go
next to each other which I don't want to
happen one solution would be to make
this bigger so then they can only and
then that's obviously causing an issue
actually I do want to fix it to that we
can fix that sort of by saying I'm just
looking for my image portfolio item
image with 100% whoops with 100% so the
images inside of a portfolio item have
to match the width of what they're
inside of now that makes it way too big
so what are we going to do we're going
to put it in my container so portfolio
items will extend extend container let's
just see what that does
and not extent that's include there we
go
so it will limit the maximum size except
that's too small so container and my max
width will be
say 60m that's still kind of small 75
that looks better so it shouldn't get
bigger than that
and that's not terrible the one problem
here is this is my featured one so I'm
getting the description and everything
and this one's not really working again
this is a graceful decline it's still
gonna be functional but it's just not
gonna be perfect
and this is far from perfect if any of
you have any suggestions on how to make
this better by all means please put in a
pull request work this off on github
make a pull request on something that
might look a little nicer but I'm gonna
leave it like this I'm happy with this
most people who have browsers these days
that are visiting a site like this will
have a grid so I'm not going to be too
worried and be spending too much time on
making it degrade to amazingly all that
that means
is this is actually gonna get pulled out
of here and it's gonna get included in
here portfolio item that was my
portfolio description no portfolio title
oh I want to do that for this one to do
yeah so my portfolio title and my
portfolio description so let's just put
that back on for a second portfolio
title this will be in the future
right so featured portfolio title gets
my font size of 5m whoops and I might as
well do this this since we're in SAS
there we go and my portfolio description
gets a display block so inside of those
only in the grid so if my grid is not
working my grid is not working there we
go no save o I'm supporting good whoops
turn all of it off turn all of it off
just save why is that still here did I
not delete that oh I didn't delete that
that's why
so it's save there we go there's no
descriptions my flexbox is working and
then if the person is using the grid
they get the better layout it's still
using flexbox whoops
why is it still using flexbox do I have
an error I'm getting an error that's why
line 90 that all goes together dad I'll
go together
open open close save no close here
whoops there we go save there we go now
my grid is working okay whoa I was a
little scared there awesome so this I
will be building a media query out but
just like all the other ones the media
query will come in time so it's not
going to look like this at the large
screen sizes one nice thing though as I
move that all around the place because
we're using flexbox one thing we can do
if you want so say you don't want them
stuck together like this we can also
come on here and do a grid gap say 1m
and get a little like sort of a gritty
thing going on like that where there's
some spaces between them and one thing
that's really really really going to be
cool is eventually this is going to be
just gap you see it's not working now
but this is the new specification
they're getting rid of grid gap they're
making a gap and this is also going to
work in flex box and I'm really excited
about that not having to put margins on
stuff is going to be really nice but for
now we can just do a grid gap but I'm
not gonna do that because I don't really
want it for this but it's definitely an
option and if you prefer that you can
use that in your design and I think
that's it um it's all working how I
wanted it to work I'm really happy with
that so I hope you are too I hope you
liked this video again we're gonna come
back and do the media queries on this
one at a later date so in the next video
we're be doing our contact form and for
that we're gonna be using some grid
areas which are my favorite thing with
the CSS grid so I look forward to that
video I hope you do too and until we get
