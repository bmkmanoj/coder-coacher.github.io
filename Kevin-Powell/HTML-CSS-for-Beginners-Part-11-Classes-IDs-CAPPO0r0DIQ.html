next video in HTML and CSS for beginners
if you haven't watched the other videos
I strongly recommend you go back and
check them out especially if you're just
starting out with web design and
development but of course you've already
watched them what am I saying
as you can see now we're adding some
classes to our divs and spans so let's
get to that so classes are a way that we
can differentiate divs and paragraphs
and pretty much any tag that we have a
lot of so right now I have two divs here
and if you remember back to the last
video I had made them both into pink
boxes so I just come here and selected
my divs and said that I wanted them both
to be pink so I did a background pink
and then I hit a refresh and I had two
big boxes but in real life that's not
something we do dibs are kind of useless
unless we give them a class they're not
really doing very much because you know
we don't want all of our divs to look
the same they're what we use to organize
our layouts so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take this first div here
and I'm gonna give it a class which is
another attribute that we haven't looked
at so think of a class like the name of
the div we're gonna name our div and
we're gonna call it John no I'm kidding
we want our class names to be
descriptive so let's just call this one
top section and let's call this div down
here at the bottom bottom section so I
have two dibs but they have their own
names now this one is my top section and
my bottom section so I'm gonna come up
to my Styles now and I want to select my
div that has a class of top section so
we know that selecting a HTML tag I just
have to write whatever is inside the
triangle brackets but now we're adding
classes to it so to select a class
instead of we have to we have to tell it
that it's a class and we do that with a
period that little dot in the world of
CSS means class so class of top
section and the rest of it works exactly
the same so the period means class I'm
selecting my class top section and let's
do background think and if I did that
properly I'm gonna save and when i
refresh only this first box should
become pink hey and look at that it
worked and now I can come here and I can
do bottom section and I can say the
background on this one is green and
there we go I'm really on my way to
making a really ugly website but you can
see now the power of classes let me
separate things and I'm gonna turn off
these background colors because they're
both pretty ugly and I'm gonna do a
refresh there I'll leave that there but
I'm going to come back and to show you
can do this for other things as well so
I've come here and I've selected both of
my paragraphs or all of my paragraphs in
this case I have two of them and I've
chosen this color but what if I want
this paragraph to be a little bit bigger
this one I like this size but this first
paragraph should be bigger than the
other one you can come and give this a
class of class of intro my introduction
text in this case is a bit longer so I
can come and say intro so I'm selecting
my class with the period of intro and
then I'm coming here and I'm going to do
a font size of 30 pixels I'm gonna save
that and hit refresh and now this is 30
pixels and this one here is the 21
pixels that we had from before you'll
notice that they both keep the same
color so what's happening now is it's
part of the Cascade all of my paragraphs
are getting missed so this is cascading
down it's selecting both of my
paragraphs but this intro is only
selecting something that has a class of
intro so I could actually come in here
and overwrite the color I could say my
color is yellow and it will overwrite it
because I'm being more specific here the
browser's reading through here so it
comes
I have a pee tag this needs to be my
dark blue color here oh wait I have an
intro and this should be yellow so that
wins out and then it comes down and he
goes P tag ok this should be blue and
that's it my P tag is staying there and
it's working like that now that yellow
color is kind of nasty so we'll get rid
of it and refresh so we can do the same
with spans and for the most part spans
are sort of like divs by themselves we
just do a span like this it's not really
the most useful thing in the world
because well you know you might have
different spans you want to do sometimes
you want to make something in different
colors sometimes you want to make the
font bigger sometimes you want to change
the font family who knows what you want
to do you want to give it a background
color so let's call this one span class
equals highlight and over later on in
that paragraph I'm going to do another
one span class is equal to let's call it
accent color and we have to close our
span I'm going to save this file come
back to my style sheet and let's go and
change those so my first one was a class
of highlight highlight highlight and I'm
gonna give this one a background of
yellow and my second one was accent
color and I'm gonna give this one eye
color of red so I'm gonna save both of
those come over here and refresh and you
can see here this first band has gotten
its background color of yellow and this
second span has gotten its text color of
red in general we use classes all over
the place classes are very very very
common another thing that you're going
to see that lets us be specific like
this as well is something called an ID
so we use IDs very similar to how we use
classes I have a P class of intro or
here in this case this might be a better
example I have this div and this div and
I have a top section and bottom section
since
giving it a class I could give these an
ID and an ID so an ID is very similar to
a class it works really pretty much the
same way with one big difference first
of all it's more specific but the more
important thing is you can only have one
ID per page that's the same so I can't
have a top section and then another top
section somewhere else there's other
differences and other uses for ID but
for now just know that an ID is a unique
identifier so it's sort of like you know
my name is Kevin and I am a youtuber my
class would be youtuber there's tons of
other youtubers out there we all make
youtube videos that's what we have in
common but my name is Kevin and well
maybe there's other Kevin's out there
but let's just pretend for the moment
I'm the only one that's my ID I'm that's
me it's Who I am
and I just happened to also make youtube
videos so an ID is unique I can only
have one top section and in general to
stop problems from coming up especially
when you're just starting off you don't
really need to go all should it be an ID
or should it be a class save yourself
some trouble and only use class and just
then I haven't even shown you you can
use the class over and over again so
let's do another span class equals
highlight and let's close the right here
close span and let's come here and do
another one span class C will do
highlight and let's close that span here
and one more span class is equal to an
accent color and close span save all of
that hit refresh and you can see that
they're all getting those properties so
I have these ones that are getting the
background color this one's getting the
text color I can use them over and over
again so let's say I want to change some
things with my top section at my bottom
section there right
jeez now so if you remember this is my
class period means class an ID is with a
hashtag instead or the pound symbol or
whatever we want to call it so now I can
do a background of pink on that one
and I can come down here and do a
background of green on this one save
them and I have my two different
sections with their two different colors
and those are with the IDs but what I'm
actually gonna recommend to you
especially for now there's times where
IDs can serve a purpose that will
disappear and that's change this back to
class and this back to class save to
bring it back I sort of recommend just
using classes classes are more common
and the advantage with the class is you
only use it once that's fine you just
used it once but if you need to use it
more than once well there's no problem
you can just use it over and over and
over again you don't have to think about
it too much you just you just go ahead
and do it so I really recommend just
state to classes IDs complicate matters
okay should this be an idea should it be
a class I'm not really sure
IDs do serve a purpose and you'll start
learning what that later on but really
at this point it's not something you got
to concern yourself with so that's the
introduction to classes and ID's with a
big emphasis on classes if you are not
sure about anything as usual and you
know say it every video and I'm gonna
keep saying it but leave a comment or a
question down below and I look forward
to seeing you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
