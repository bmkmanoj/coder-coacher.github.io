first video in this series on how to
make a responsive website from scratch
on the screen now you can see what we're
going to be building this is just my
Photoshop mock-up of it this video will
be focusing on just the markup and after
that we're going to work section by
section through it and actually styling
the whole thing if you'd like to follow
along there's a link down below click
that you can download all the assets and
follow along with everything that I'm
doing here so what are we waiting for it
let's get started so here on the screen
is more or less what we're aiming for in
this series and what I want to be
building you'll notice that I have the
same layout twice this is more of what
I'm going for on the mobile view or
smaller screen sizes and what we're
shooting for on the large screen size
I'm going to be going for a mobile first
so this is sort of the direction I'm
starting off with but when I'm writing
the HTML I do have to look at both of
them and take certain things into
consideration especially for this who we
are section and obviously if this one
really changes between the two so we're
gonna have to see how I'm going to pull
that one off
otherwise they're more or less the same
I haven't done a true mobile navigation
with the little hamburger menu it's a
pretty short one that I went with so of
having it just shoot in underneath there
to me made sense and for now let's jump
right into the writing our code so what
we're here for right so I've started off
with a little bit here and I'm going to
open up my browser because that will be
updating as we go I haven't done very
much but I have a few things here I've
put in my title I've linked to my CSS
and really important I have a meta tag
set up here for my viewport width so if
you've never done a responsive website
before this one is really important it
pretty much makes sure that your website
scales properly otherwise it could risk
being like the desktop version of your
site just zoomed way way out and that's
sort of defeats the whole purpose of
actually building your site properly I
also have my CSS file here but right now
there's actually nothing in there and
that's it so let's just jump right into
our body and actually I want to leave my
Photoshop over here I don't want to
leave
just get my mobile set up there and says
move that over a little bit super when
I'm doing my HTML I like having my
layout on the side here because it lets
me sort of follow what I'm doing and
I'll even zoom in on this while we're
working it's just going to make my life
a little bit easier I want to describe
what I'm seeing on the screen let's move
that over a bit more that's better so
we're going to start off with the top up
here obviously and just work our way
down and I just there we go I just
wanted that centered in that space so up
here just this little bit here is my
header so I'm going to put in a header
tag and inside my header I'm going to go
and put in my logo we're and put in an
image with a class of logo and the
source of this is my image folder and
logo dot PNG and right here we'll do
creative ink logo save that and we have
my class of logo on there after my logo
we need my navigation so I have a nav
inside of my nav we have unordered list
and inside of my unordered list we have
three list items list items times three
and each one of those has a link in it
there we go I'm going to leave all the
links blank we don't need them to go
anywhere right now so just an index.html
whoops what am i doing we're not going
anywhere
so that would be home about and contact
and that's it for my header there's
nothing else that actually goes in there
I'm going to be using the background
image here for this section that will
actually apply up there so this section
I'm going to get section let's call this
section my home hero area and in my home
hero we have an h1 now this I'm going to
do this entire sentence so let's just
copy the whole thing I'm going to do
this entire sentence as one h1 so making
things look great and then right here
I'm going to put in a line break just to
make my life easier but I'm going to
span tag
and come over here and close the span
tag the reason that I'm doing this like
this is well first of all this is one
sentence making things look great for
companies who make great stuff so some
people come in and they do this sort of
you know this is an h1 and that's the
reach too but it's one sentence I want
it to read like one sentence so it
doesn't make any sense if that's an h1
and h2 or even in h1 and a paragraph so
I'm going to use my h1 for the entire
thing and my span is just going to help
me style the second half of that a
little differently after that we have a
link so I have my a tag it's not going
to go anywhere but it's going to be see
our work and I obviously need a class on
this and I'm going to call it button and
I have two different types of buttons on
this I have this button that my green
button there and I have a black button
as well
so I'm going to use my button class just
to set up the padding and my borders
widths and my font sizes and all of that
and then I'm going to use my second
class and we'll call this one button
accent since green is my accent color
which will control the colors of that
and I'll have my other one as a button
dark or something like that so let's
save that just for fun and go and check
my index out and we should have
everything there's my logo my navigation
my h1 and that will eventually look like
a button so for this section it's a
little bit different
have I can't just look at this because
and I will have this big picture here
that's coming underneath I'm still not a
hundred percent confident and how I'm
actually going to do this but I like the
the style of it the main idea here is
that let's just make this a bit bigger
so we can see it and I want the you know
when we have this and this is going to
be a bit bigger but say that's you know
we have we see this sticking out at the
bottom maybe like that on our screen and
then you scroll down and you get this
nice picture so you get the information
but you also get this picture that sort
of gives you a bit of personality to the
site and save just this generic picture
that we you know you see on tons of
these sites so it's about who we are
it's sort of an about Us section it'd be
nice to actually have a little face
there to link through but on the mobile
view a big picture like that would just
get in the way and would be distracting
or use up weight you might not
distracting but it would use up way too
much space and I don't want to be using
all that space up mobile space is pretty
valuable so with that in consideration
let's do a section class of about let's
call it home about I'm only going to be
doing the homepage for this site I'm not
going to be building out any other pages
but my naming convention here is you
know we might have hero sections or big
banner sections at the top of other ones
so this is it by doing home hero it's
you know I'm indicating it's my home
page when I have my home about and it's
something that is unique and I might
have you know if I had an about page I'd
probably have about classes in other
places so I just want to make sure it's
my home about if that makes sense and
now this is where things might change
when I start doing the CSS but if I look
here I think what I'm going to do is
going to be part of my my home about I'm
gonna have a big div and inside that div
I'm going to have this text box that I'm
sort of going to offset a little bit and
I'm also I've set this up on a grid and
the
here is that my containers and all of
that that I'm going to be using will be
in this space and I actually want that
text to line up with the container so
it's offset but I'm still inside of my
grid in a way at least that's the plan
we'll see what actually happens once we
start coding this a little bit but my
plan for the time being is to do that
yeah so as I said I think what this is
going to be with the picture and then I
need another I'm going it a div in here
we'll call it a home about text box I
guess and inside of my home about text
box is where we'll put all of this text
so we'll have an h1 again and we'll have
a two paragraphs so P times - let's just
go and copy this text
and that one should be strong so we'll
throw my strong tag right on there close
strong let's save that I think that's
all I'm going to need but as I said we
might have to revisit this I'm not 100%
sure yet and let's actually I just this
is an h1 and this is an h1 and they're
kind of different so I think they're to
do do to do I'm going to give this one
its own class too because this one and
this one looked the same and actually
this one looks a lot like that one
so yeah this one's going to get its own
class and I know I could come in here
and say my home hero h1 so I could
select it separately anyway but I think
I'm going to be using the same style for
it up here and down here so and it you
know it's nice to separate your CSS as
much as possible so it's not reliant on
this your HTML structure too much so I'm
going to come and give this h1 at class
of dude I'm not going to call it I don't
want it to be related to the fact that
it's in the hero section I'm just going
to call this one title I don't know if
that's the best name in the world but
that's going to get the class of title
it's sort of the title of my page and
the title of my call to action I'm sure
I could come up with a better name but
that's what I'm going to call it and so
now let's come down to here some of our
work this one has its own little style
on there too mm-hmm but that's okay
we'll come back to that let's just come
and give myself some room some of our
work so I need right away a section for
this whole thing so we'll call it
section of portfolio
and now inside of my section of
portfolio I have another h1 close h1 and
after that it's where things I haven't
put in any hover effect or anything here
but I want to have when I hover on top
you know the name of the project shows
up and you know click here for more or
something like that so h1 so let's
import some of our work and this is
where I'm going to use figures and the
reason I like using well this will make
sense figure and actually I'm going to
use some HTML comments here because I'm
gonna have a lot I'm going to six of
them it's not too many but a portfolio
port full port folio item one it's just
going to be easier to keep track of
everything here I think so I have my
figure and then I have my image this I
have I have these all set up already
I've already saved my image portfolio
dot portfolio zero one dot jpg and just
call it portfolio port I can't spell
portfolio today portfolio item and I
then want my fig big caption whoops
caption and a figcaption lets me put in
some text and stuff and the whole reason
i want to put this in a figure if you
haven't seen the figure before it's
generally used for when you have an
image that has a caption underneath it
lets you keep the two pieces of
information related so you'd have your
picture and then i'll you know the
caption that goes underneath your
picture describing your picture and it
lets the everybody know that they're
they live together their part this
information is related to this text here
so inside your food captions you can
just write some text you don't need
paragraph tags and all of that but i
think
I'm going to put a paragraph tag in here
so I can have my paragraph and a button
underneath it so let's do that paragraph
let's just put project just script
project title closed paragraph and then
we'll come in with another button and
href will go anywhere class is equal to
button button accent and I'm going to do
button small so probably just I want
them to be smaller than my normal button
I should have made a visual reference
for it but we don't have one
um and I should put some classes on this
this give me figure is class of let's
just call it a port item like that and
then figcaption will be my class is
equal to port just group option so I'm a
portfolio item and then portfolio item
and this is my portfolio description
that makes sense to me um hopefully it
makes sense to you too so I'm just going
to two three four five six and this is
why I like having the comments here is
as I'm scrolling by this big wall oops
four five and six so as I'm scrolling by
this big wall here I can keep track of
where I am in the whole thing and let's
go and change my pictures to one is one
two is number two three four and where's
number five and number six and I just
want to make sure that was worked so
let's go check my browser and yeah
awesome all six of them are there some
of my work you can see there's the
project title so this is the caption for
this picture the caption for that
sure well why is that one oops I forgot
to I started making my button and I
never finished it see see project
details see project as use do project
key cos project details close a
important to close things properly
copy paste paste paste I'm probably
missing one or two pay space oh I made a
button and I never close my button smart
there we go so project title project
details that makes more sense and so
this will be the title of my project and
then I'll have a little button that you
can click on to get more information on
it and all that we're missing is our
footer now and the footer is nice and
simple I so let's go and look at what my
footer looks like um I have here I want
it to look like that and then it's just
going to collapse down so that's my
footer how am I going to do this well we
have a paragraph let's come and copy my
text and then I'm going to do these as
ordered lit unordered lists goes on
ordered list and I have one two three
four five list items Li times five I
guess normally these would be links well
this one wouldn't be this would be sort
of my title strong pose strong and copy
I get you know this I guess would be
sort of my avocation or something like
that see lots of sites that just have
lists of different stuff and I'm not
going to take the time to make different
lists since this is just a template
style site and now I can take this
unordered list
and copy paste paste
and now to actually get these to go so
the contents there but I mean I have to
make columns out of this whole thing and
as I mentioned I built this the big
version of it anyway on a six column
grid but I don't use the grid very much
I kept my button in there and then
obviously I have my main content area
that I sort of used this breaks out of
it because I wanted to be fullscreen and
then I'm using it down here though I'm
going to create an actual column system
that I'm only going to use here because
nothing else on this page would use it
the reason I'm going to build it for
here is again I'm only designing this
one page for this demo but I let's
pretend I'm be working on a bigger
project so the same reason I named
things home for my different sections in
my class names I want to make this so if
I know most other websites follow very
strict the home page is usually unique
the other pages are more formulaic let's
say so the column system would probably
work really well I have a column of six
so I'm going to do my own thing of
should I just do it on the paragraphs
itself
I don't need tubes here I don't need two
divs would make more sense though yes
divs definitely would make more sense
because if this was um say I needed two
paragraphs down here if I put my column
on class on my paragraph itself it would
mean I could only ever have one
paragraph here so for maintainability
let's come up here and do a div of a
column
now let's do a span three I'm going to
call it a span three I'm spanning three
so I have my span three close span three
time that over and then I will here do a
span one low class of span one not a tag
of span one there we go sort of screwed
everything up there class of span one
cut paste tab that over and we can just
copy this whole thing and replace these
ones I hope this makes sense but we'll
see so I have spanning three spanning
one spanning one spanning one so that
should make sense in the end it's going
to give me a little bit more work in my
CSS but again I think you know
realistically on a project it's
something that I would do I don't like
the name span three I'm gonna call it
column nowhere uses things called span
and if you're coming from something like
bootstrap or you're coming from
something like foundation or pretty much
any other grid system that I know of
they don't call them spans they call
them columns this is the print side of
me sort of coming through where I'm used
to spanning columns and the last thing I
think I should do here I want to and
bring in a class on my list so it's just
your class is equal to unstyled on style
on styled list and I want to do this as
a class again I don't want to have to
say that my lists inside my footer
because again we're looking at the fact
that this could be extended into a
bigger site and maybe you'd want on
styled lists in other places as well I
wouldn't have to want to repeat the CSS
for that whereas if I just do on styled
list anytime I need a non styled list I
can use that CSS so there that's saved
and that's it for this video I'm pretty
happy with how that went
I don't see any major problems coming up
once we start our CSS
so in the next video I will be starting
the CSS I will be approaching this as
with mobile first in mind so I will be
looking more at this side of things and
I think normally if I were to do this I
would do my whole site and then come
back up and make it work at bigger
screen sizes but because I'm doing this
as a series I think what I'll do is I'll
just break it down each section here
will get its own video well I screwed up
my text there at one point that's okay I
won't save this one I quit but yeah I
think I'm going to do each section is
going to get its own video these two
might get one because I think this will
go pretty fast and yeah I look forward
to seeing you in the next one where we
actually start making this look like a
real website so if you have any
questions about what I've done please
don't be shy leave a comment down below
hit the thumbs up if you liked the video
and I look forward to seeing you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
