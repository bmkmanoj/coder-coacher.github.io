we've hit 10,000 subs and I just want to
say thank you so much the community
that's building up around this channel
is absolutely amazing and to thank you
for hitting 10,000 subs I wanted to make
this little just Q&amp;amp;A type of things so
I've gone out there and asked on social
media for some questions and I'm gonna
answer those questions for you in this
video so these two are sort of similar
and why did you start your channel and
how long have you been teaching on
YouTube so I've been on YouTube for
about 15 months no it was about I think
October of 2016 when I started roughly
it's hard for me to know exactly I can't
I guess just go look through and find my
first video I think he was about mid
October when I started of that year it's
just like this channel is existed for a
lot longer and why did I start it that's
a more interesting question and it's
because I started teaching in the
classroom about three years ago I got
hired as a teacher at the school that I
actually went to as a student for design
and in computer graphics and what
happened was I got hired there as a
teacher because I was one of the few
people who actually had experience with
web while most of the courses that teach
there are a computer graphic related
Photoshop Illustrator InDesign stuff
like that there are a couple of
introductory web courses and they asked
me to teach those or for the most part
that's what I've been teaching and I
love it those are really fun classes
that teach but always teaching intro to
web after a while it gets you know
there's only so much intro to web I can
take um so both as a way to continue
pushing myself with web stuff and keep
up with current trends and just to have
fun with it as well as to continue being
creative that's why I like doing this to
be able to keep designing because I'm a
designer at heart so I started this as a
way to both keep up with code keep
pushing with code keep teachings I'm
really enjoying teaching and also just
as a creative outlet that I can be using
at the same time do you think a college
degree for web development is worth it
or necessary I don't like this question
and it scares me answering this question
it really does
and the reason it scares me is because
that's a hard question to answer and I
think a problem with a question like
this is people will give you the answer
that's the path of a followed so if
someone's self-taught well that's the
best way because that's the way they
know or if they did the whole computer
science degree then that's the best way
because that's the way they know of
course now there's the boot camps and
those other lots of options that you
could take um for me I've got a really
unique way of getting here I started
doing all of this just as a hobby back
in high school which was a long time ago
now it was in the 90s and I was just
every now and then I'd do some stuff in
Photoshop turning into a little website
we were slicing back then it wasn't very
good but I had fun with it and it was
this thing that would keep coming back
up for me and every now and then I'd get
interested in it again and start
dabbling around with it but as far as
education goes in reverse order of what
I've done well I'm actually in
university now part time for to be a
teacher since I teach full time in the
classroom I do part-time University
classes for that on top of that I do
have I studied for the design stuff as I
said where I'm working now that's where
I had gone to school and got a degree in
that before that I got a bachelor's
degree in urban planning of all things
and didn't use that at all before that I
got a degree in film and creative arts
it was like a creative arts program with
an emphasis on film um yeah and you know
at one point I was going to be going at
the sciences but that's taken a bit of
it that didn't happen obviously and the
whole coding thing is just self-taught
and yeah so you know I took a really
weird path to get here I never thought
I'd be a teacher and I know I'm a
teacher in the classroom and I'm
teaching on YouTube and I'm doing things
that I never actually formally studied
for and that's weird cuz I've been
studying forever so yeah that's that's
how I got here and that that's probably
not the best path you don't want to be
sneaking around I think a lot of people
do stuff like that or they take later
decisions later in life you know that
lead to them getting to wherever they
are but if you're young enough and lucky
enough to be making
decisions now what should you do isn't
up to me to decide it's up to you to
decide and to look at the different
options and the good in the bad while I
didn't use my university degree
necessarily for what I was supposed to I
still got a lot of life lessons while I
was in university met a lot of amazing
people
I don't regret those three years or four
years or however long I was there for it
was really enjoyable experience and a
part of my life that I look back on
fondly even though the actual classes I
didn't take any concrete things to apply
but that's a hard question and just ask
a lot of people look around and go to
industry people and that's what they
think - what are you looking for find
out what people are looking for with
what you think you want to be doing or
just ask as many people as you can and
look into it yourself spend a lot of
time looking into that before you make
that type of decision on what you should
be doing this education is really
important and you don't want to take the
wrong make the wrong decision and regret
it later trust me I've done a lot of
things so I know what that's about how
do I get better oh boy oh boy this is a
tough question I get this a lot from a
lot of people that's why there was no
name on that one it was just said a lot
of people I see things all the time and
there's no definitive answer I do think
there are a few good tips um start
simple just don't feel overwhelmed
especially with the web these days you
start looking into it you see view and
angular and react and j/s and npn and
babble and all these crazy words you
don't even know what they mean uh uh you
know it can be overwhelming and you can
feel like there's just so much to learn
and well there is so much to learn but
that's why I like it because there is a
lot to learn that's why it's one of the
things that really enjoy doing is
because I'm constantly learning while
I'm doing it
but don't be overwhelmed by that stick
with what you're currently learning and
learn it really well if you're on just
learning how HTML and CSS work if that's
where you're at work on your HTML and
CSS get really comfortable with it even
with the CSS yes this is a hard language
it's really easy to understand how it
works but actually make it work and make
the things you want that can be hard the
syntax is simple but making it do the
right stuff can be really hard learn CSS
really well then move on to something
like JavaScript or learn on something
else or if you've started to learn
JavaScript should you learn view well it
sort of leads into my next point of have
a goal what do you really want to be
doing you need view I looked into
learning view and react and I still want
to learn them but I haven't learned them
yet and it's because with what I'm doing
I have no need for them I'm not building
web apps and I think it'd be cool to
build one eventually I am for now on
building websites and I really don't
need those languages just I'm having a
good fundamental understanding of
JavaScript is where I'm am now I want to
make sure I know JavaScript inside and
out so I think it's really important of
a goal to know what direction you should
be going in so okay this is where I want
to be I need to learn this and then this
and then this and then this to get to
that point and it makes it a lot easier
I also share your work you have people a
little community anything you want to
share your work get feedback on your
work if you're stuck just talking to
people to get feedback on it is a really
nice way to do it I'm introverted I'm
not really good at that part of things
but it's you know the fastest way to get
better at things is getting feedback
from other people and bouncing ideas off
other people to look at the best way
maybe on doing something and stuff like
that so try and find out like a group of
people you can bounce ideas off of and
share your work even if it's just one
other person you can share some stuff
with and they can give you some feedback
on it can be really really useful also
the last thing you should do just always
be getting better is practice practice
practice practice practices keep making
stuff constantly if you watch an
hour-long video of mine or half hour on
video go and use what you watched on
something of your own and build like
three websites just go that's a really
cool concept I'm gonna use that one
concept on two or three sites or you
know I'm oh I'm gonna build three
modal's that really push how that user
I'm going to build for contact forms
that's how you're gonna learn and
remember these things writing HTML CSS
JavaScript super repetitive especially
HTML and CSS but all of it is just
putting in the keystrokes typing away
becomes muscle memory if you're not
practicing you're just watching the
videos it's not gonna sink in you might
remember the concepts but you're not
really going to know how to use them in
your work take what you're watching the
blog post you're reading the podcast who
to whatever it is take those ideas and
use them constantly push yourself to
integrate as much as you can into little
side projects building out little things
doesn't have to be full websites but the
more you build the better at this you're
going to be all it becomes muscle memory
the complicated things get easy you can
start integrating more stuff into your
work also start teaching and I'm not you
know even if you don't feel that you're
super comfortable with something
teaching it is the best way to really
make sure that you understand it and it
makes you understand things so much
better it's amazing how much I've
learned since becoming a teacher because
I have to make sure I really understand
it how can you teach something if you
don't really understand it you have to
explain it in ways that you wouldn't
have normally thought about so when
you're trying to think about it in ways
that you can teach it it just all of a
sudden some things that you sort of
understood start clicking and you're
like oh oh man that makes so much sense
now
and honestly start up a YouTube channel
like this one even if it's just on the
basic basic concepts just start making
videos I started doing this channel
nobody was watching literally nobody it
took forever to get to like 50
subscribers months nobody was watching
it amazed now we have 10,000 people but
it doesn't matter if nobody was watching
it because I was having fun making the
videos and I was still learning a lot
while doing it so go out and make your
own videos or write blog posts or
whatever it is that's easiest for you
and just you know it's teaching things
or just finding a kid down the street
that's interested in it and teach it to
them and it's amazing how much more you
can learn by teaching the things that
you're actively learning so that's it
for this one once again I just want to
say a massive massive thank you to all
of you guys you're amazing 10,000
subscribers absolutely blows my mind I
think it's incredible that there's that
many of you who have subscribed to this
channel so thank you so much and now for
the part that you stuck around all this
waiting for you to skipped everything to
get to this point
the giveaway CSS secrets it's a really
awesome book it it's a bit more of an
advanced level book but it really I
talked about focusing on things that
push you to the next level of really
making sure you understand
CSS is working so it does assume that
you already know how some core concepts
work and pretty much all it's assuming a
good understanding of the core of CSS
and then it's showing all these little
neat tips and tricks and things you can
do that make your coding better and
easier and just things you probably
wouldn't have thought of before really
fun book so if you want to have a chance
