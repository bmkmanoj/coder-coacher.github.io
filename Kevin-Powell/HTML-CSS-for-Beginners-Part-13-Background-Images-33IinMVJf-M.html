background images so let's jump to it
okay so I've changed things up a little
bit from the last video but more or less
were where we were I have a box there
with a paragraph in it and a pink
background well let's say I want to put
a picture behind there instead of having
that ugly pink background what a lot of
people will try and do and it sort of
makes sense we know how to put in images
as we do in img src for the image source
alt I'm gonna do my alt tag and close
that off my alt is a cute hamster I'm
going to use the same little hamsters
last time so that was in my images
folder and it was hamster dot jpg and
we'll save that and refresh and there's
my cute little hamster but I don't want
him here I want him as the background
for this whole div hmm how can I do that
well I can't put him in the HTML this is
the content of my page and this
paragraph is here and my image is after
it and that's just how it's going to
work so I'm actually going to delete him
from here save that refresh and you
should disappear and I have to go over
to my CSS so just like I can put a
background color of pink I can also put
in a background image so what I want to
do is we can get rid of all that and
come in with background image and if
you're using a code editor like atom and
it's Auto filling you see image at the
top and you might be inclined to grab
that one but we actually want to grab
URL which is the address of the image so
you could put in an absolute path here
and have it link off to an image
somewhere else in the Internet but I
would recommend you have it in your root
folder like my hamster is and what you
might do is do IMG because that's where
my hamster image is it's in my image
folder and write in hamster jpg the
problem is it doesn't work and the
reason it's not working is this is a
relative link but I'm inside my CSS
folder right now so I'm in here I'm in
this file and then it's looking for IMG
and it can't find it and so it just
doesn't load it there's no broken image
or anything like that when it's a
background image if it's not working it
just doesn't have a background so what
we need to do now is we need to go from
here back one step into this stage and
then into my image folder and to do that
we use two dots so two dots forward
slash this means go backwards then find
my image folder and then find hamster
dot JPEG inside my image folder let's
save that hit refresh and there he is
awesome sort of awesome you'll notice
there's a few weird things going on
first of all the image is repeating
itself here so I have my hamster and
then it's you know that pictures
starting itself over again
and I don't see all of my hamster what's
going on
well pretty much just like I had before
with the background of pink the box was
getting bigger and smaller according to
the content so what I'm changing my
background image it's the same as
changing the background color the
browser is not really paying attention
to the picture just like you know it
wasn't paying attention to the color
it's just filling the background with
that picture however big the boxes is
however big the box is so I mentioned in
the CSS box model video that if I want
more background I can add more padding
in this case let's do 200 top and bottom
but keep 100 pixels on the left and
right so if I save that while I start
seeing more of my hamster and well now I
have too much of my hamster again this
background is repeating all over the
place so I do have a few options here I
do have a background repeat option and
with the background repeat' we do get
some options I get no-repeat which sort
of does what it you'd expect to do it
stops it from repeating itself
we have repeat we have repeat X so it's
repeating only on the x axis so only
across this way or we have repeat Y
whoops that should be lowercase save and
now it's only repeating up and down
with some images the repeat-x and repeat
why are what you want and it will work
well because you want a repeating
pattern across the top there's lots of
good websites out there that have
background patterns that you can use
that are meant to be repeated and they
repeat themselves all over the place in
fact why don't we go get one of those
right now subtle patterns is a very nice
site I highly recommend it I'm gonna put
a link down in that description below if
you're looking for it and I'm going to
find something that works for my site
add this is sort of the same color why
don't we try that one out so I'm gonna
hit download it gives me a zip file I
want to take open up there it usually
gives us a PNG so I'm going to grab that
and just drag it off into my image
folder and so I have that file in there
so why don't we come up and put that out
on our body so instead of having a
background color or I can keep that and
I can do background image remember its
URL so I want to go backwards a step I
want to go into my image folder and I
think it was weather dot PNG I'll save
that and hit refresh and there we go it
works I can see those repeating pattern
and it's it's a pattern that's meant to
be repeated so I shouldn't get any
awkward lines like this it should just
be this nice background image that's
filling up the whole page now we've kept
my background color and my background
image by doing this is I saw before it
my background image doesn't load it just
pretends it wasn't there if I have a
background color it will fall back to
that background color and because these
are super similar to each other it's a
pretty nice fallback so there's no
problem in having a color and an image
and it might actually be a good thing
just in case the image doesn't load for
one reason or another but with this
hamster this whole repeating background
pattern thing isn't working and the
background repeat none isn't really
working either it's cutting off you know
it's it's just not looking so good
so we have a few other options so let's
come in with background and you'll also
notice we have a few things here one of
them is background size and for this
video it's the last one we're gonna look
at Auto is the default so it's one of
the options we have contain is another
one so let's try out contain and save it
contains a bit of a weird one it's going
to fill the whole space up so it's gonna
it will stretch your image in proportion
so it won't make your image flat or fat
or anything fat it's going to keep it in
proportion but it will and it's gonna
make sure I see the entire image so it's
I see my whole picture it's gonna make
the whole picture fit one time on there
but if there is any empty space it will
keep repeating it the other one that's
in there is cover and if I use cover I
will lose a little bit of my image and
on this one we don't actually notice it
right now I'm gonna change things up so
we do cover
personally I love for when you have
pictures like this that you want as a
background and the reason the cover
works so well is it's going to cover the
entire div or whatever you're putting a
background image on with your picture
and it's going to make sure that the
image is growing or shrinking
proportionally and it's not gonna repeat
itself because it's just gonna use that
one image without repeating to fill up
the whole space this can get a little
weird though let's just say I make my
padding top and bottom 800 pixels which
hopefully isn't a realistic scenario
hope that was left and right but that's
okay you'll see now I'm losing the
bottom of my picture and he's becoming a
little bit blurry my image wasn't this
big it's making the image much bigger
than it used to be so it is losing some
quality I'm also losing the bottom of my
picture a little bit and let's bring
this back down to 100 and make this one
800 and you'll also see now I'm really
losing my picture my hamsters all the
way off here so I'm losing quality and
I'm losing a lot of my picture so
remember it's just like having a
background color the browser doesn't
really care it just wants to make sure
that this picture is fitting in
side this space and I said background
slaves would be the last thing we'd look
at the last one we actually will look at
as background position we get some
different options here and the default
is top left so right now this is the top
left of my picture and it's making sure
that the top left actually aligns there
let's just change that over to Center
and hit refresh and now I actually see
my hamster and there he is and what it's
doing is it's putting the center of the
image in the center of the div so the
position background position is Center
and it's Center perfect middle of the
picture is in the perfect middle of the
div I could also say bottom and save and
now our let's try right to bottom
refresh and where did he go well he's
gone and now I actually see the right
side of my picture instead so we can
play with the background position whoops
background position a little bit and if
you're missing part of your picture and
you want to sort of realign it a little
bit so you can choose you know I need to
see the more of the top the bottom the
left the right or I just need a
perfectly Center of my picture in there
and yeah that's it
background position there background
position background images are fairly
easy to use sometimes run into some
weird things like the repeating pattern
that we just saw and again the
background size cover is a nice cure-all
for that if not you get a nice repeating
hamster over and over and over again and
always remember if you're using
background pictures padding gives you
more background and more padding you
have the more background you have it's
one of the problems I often see people
running in twos they want a nice
beautiful background image but it's they
don't have enough of it and they you
know I need more picture on the top I'll
add more padding on the top
I need more picture on the bottom I add
more padding on the bottom and remember
if you want text on top of an image it
has to be a background image that's it
for background images this actually went
on a little bit longer than I thought it
would but we covered a lot
in there hope you learned something from
it I look forward to seeing you in the
next video make sure you leave a comment
down below to say hi if nothing else and
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
