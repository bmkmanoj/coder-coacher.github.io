important when it comes to creating
websites so let's take a look at how we
should do it if you've been following
along you know that our websites need a
folder to live in and which we call the
root directory and this is where
everything is living right now so let's
open that up so I have my three files
there and there you know they're just
floating around a little bit we need to
organize our files better when we're
doing a website keeping our files really
well organized is very very important
and it's gonna make your lives much
easier especially as you carry on in his
adventure web design and things just get
more and more complicated so the first
thing I'm going to recommend is making a
folder for your images I usually just
call mine IMG you'll see a lot of people
doing that if you want to call it images
instead you can call it images and I'm
gonna put my hamster in there I have my
index here and my page two there are
just going to stay there in general my
HTML files are just gonna all live with
each other in the main part of my
directory here and this subdirectory of
my images another subdirectory that
pretty much all your pages are going to
have is a CSS so I'm gonna make a CSS
folder right there so I have my images
folder I have my new CSS folder and we
have nothing in the CSS folder yet but
starting in the next video we're gonna
start playing with CSS a little bit so
very soon that folder will start getting
used and another folder that you'll
probably start using at one point or
another
is a JavaScript folder so JavaScript or
what you'll see most of the time is just
a j/s we won't really be getting in any
javascript anytime soon but it's
possible you see that folder now there's
a reason that I'm keeping all these file
names nice and short for my folders here
I'm not writing out images I'm not
writing out JavaScript and it's because
I have to write links to all the things
I'm linking to and the shorter the link
the easier it's going to be so you know
I'm lazy I'm just keeping it as short as
possible for myself another thing you'll
notice is I'm sticking with lower case
on everything it's important we keep the
lower case a it's just going to make it
easier because we're standardizing
everything and that just makes our life
easier in general the other reason this
is important is
especially with our HTML files and our
file names such as hamster dot jpg we
don't want to put in weird things we
don't want to cause any problems and
it's possible that if you give your
files weird names that you run into
problems I mentioned that we have to
have an index.html for the home page and
it has to be a lower case index this is
important I've had people put an upper
case I when we're in class and it just
doesn't work so when it's on the
internet it's gonna work fine here but
as soon as you upload this to the
Internet
it's not gonna be your home page the
other thing is we want to avoid spaces
so there's a reason I didn't call this
page two with a space in the middle I
put it as one word if you really really
want to have spaces put a - instead
spaces create these really weird things
in your document so just to show you
actually let's put my space and let's
open up that file and let's go look here
and we can see page two and there's this
weird percentage 20 and that's the
symbol for the space you can even see
that popping up everywhere here and when
this is on a server it could cause some
problems so it's gonna work while it's
on my computer but I don't necessarily
want to trust that working properly when
I've uploaded it to the Internet and
even if it does people will look up here
for reference to where they are
sometimes and that's just really strange
you wouldn't want that as a link to your
website having a page - in there like
that so we avoid spaces we avoid
capitals we avoid numbers we avoid
anything that's just not regular text
keep filenames short because it makes
your life much easier and keep them
descriptive page twos not really the
best it worked for this because it was
just a an example file my home page will
always be indexed if I have an about
page it will be a boat dot HTML if I
have a contact page it's contact HTML I
have the picture of my hamster it's
hamster jpg I'm gonna have a CSS file to
me style dot CSS we keep it as simple
and basic as possible pretty much so you
don't want to overthink things that's it
for this video it's not very complicated
but it's important that we keep all of
our things in the right place oh
actually one more
thing that I forgot if I go back to my
index.html now you'll see that my
hamster is no longer working and because
my hamster is no longer working you can
see that it actually says an adorable
hamster in there because I used my alt
text properly so that's pretty cool as I
mentioned if an image doesn't load that
will happen and you'll also miss this
picture changed it's because of the
source I used it sort of an image
generation service but we won't get into
that what we will do is fixing this
right here just really fast since we're
here so I'm going to do an open with
Adam and we can come down here so
there's my first picture that's the one
at the top and here's my hamster and my
hamster doesn't live in this place
anymore
remember this is a relative link so the
way this used to be working was it was
in this index file and then it was
trying to find hamster dot jpg and
hamster dot jpg was right here so I was
looking what what around here is called
hamster jpg there it is and it was
working there's no more hamster jpg here
I have to tell it where to find this
file so my image is in my image folder
so I'm gonna add IMG forward slash so
now it's going okay I'm gonna look for
IMG oh there's something called IMG
let's go inside there and inside there
I'm going to look for hamster jpg and
now that's working so if I save my HTML
file I refresh over here now you can see
that my hamster is working properly so
that's it for this video if you have any
questions or any comments leave them
down below like the video if you liked
it I'm really looking forward to the
next video we're gonna start doing some
CSS the page is gonna start looking good
we're gonna add some colors and cool
stuff to it so I look forward to seeing
you there
