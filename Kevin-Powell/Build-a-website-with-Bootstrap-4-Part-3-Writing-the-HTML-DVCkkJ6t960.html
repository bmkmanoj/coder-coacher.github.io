bootstrap project hi guys and welcome my
name is Kevin and here at my channel we
learn how to make the web and how to
make it look good while we're at it
right now we're in part three of a
series we're looking at building a
website using bootstrap 4 so this video
is all about just writing markup we're
going to be doing all the HTML for our
page and because I've already set up the
variables in my previous video I think a
lot of its just going to start working
there'll be some tweaks some changes
some little things the details to work
on but a lot of it should be looking
pretty close to being done it should
just follow almost into place just we're
doing our markup so we want to make a
new HTML file so let's come in and make
our nice little index.html and I save
that the wrong spot bring that all the
way up here and just drop it in where it
should be so what we actually want to do
now is jump over to bootstraps website
and click on introduction and I want the
starter template and I'm going to copy
this whole thing and paste it in there
makes it much easier for me it's
bringing everything I need except the
problem is it's taking in their CSS from
the CDN and I don't want to be doing
that I want to be bringing my own CSS
file since I'm making changes so let's
go and delete everything in here and
change that over to CSS slash main CSS
so now I'm bringing in my own CSS file
perfect Doe now you could come and
change these if you want you'd want to
move them probably outside of the bower
components or you can leave them in
there even I'm going to leave them as is
here because this is all things you know
the jQuery it's linking to jQuery
directly the tether which is up on a CDN
and all of that and the advantage with
this is if people have already loaded
these in then they could be catched in
their system and it's going to help just
load a little bit faster whereas if it's
on your own system you might not you
know why not just take advantage of the
fact that it's on something that's
probably faster than your own server and
there's no real reason to have to load
it off your own site and so I'm going to
leave it just like that
the main thing for me is bringing in my
own CSS file and obviously we can get
rid of this hello world right here and
what I'm going to do now is collapse
this down and collapse this way down
because I want to be able to look at my
Photoshop design while I am doing my
markup so I know what exactly I want to
be doing so this video I'm really just
going to try and get all the mark-up in
so let's do all of it the little I don't
think anything will take too long but
we'll find out I guess um let's go and
try this out where are we
there we go no that's not what I want um
Adam there we are
okay so I need to do my navigation oh
man I'm actually going to jump over to
jQuery for this jQuery to bootstraps
website once again now if you haven't
played around with there the the Alpha
for at all the it's just so much better
the documentation is so much better
organized in my opinion it used to be
yeah I don't know I didn't like their
old documentation it was a pain to get
around so I find the new documentation
much easier to play around with and find
your way around so what I want is just
this there's one here that will look
good which one of these should I take
let's go with this one so I'm going to
copy that because that's the navbar that
I want and just drop that right into
whoops I keep going to the wrong spot
here let's just drop that right there
and it's sort of screwed up button
that's okay my indentation that should
be better okay so let's just look here a
little bit it's a navbar it's toggle a
navbar toggle toggleable ad medium
screen sizes it's the light one and it
has a faded background so I'm actually
going to save that and then let's go and
preview what this is actually looking
like so I'm going to click this little
thing in pre-pro so hit preview
and let's see what this looks like and I
don't need my downloads anymore so I
definitely have something now because I
changed my color variables I can't read
my text because it's coming in with that
dark color on there but it is up there
so we might have to fix a little bit of
stuff I'm wondering if I change this to
navbar in verse if it will fix the color
of my text actually yeah it does there
we go okay so I can actually read it now
I'm probably going it well I know I'm
gonna have to come in because let's just
shrink this down actually those are
going to sort of stay the same
just that needs to change to red after
so that's good let's actually zoom out
on that a little bit so I can move it
over better and let's open everything
back up again so we need that and we
need that and we need that hat okay good
so let's just bring that down a little
bit so that's not too bad let's change
this this isn't that's going to stay
home this is going to change to about
this is going to change to our music and
this one is going to change to upcoming
shows and I want to get rid of the
disabled I do not want that if I save
that should update and it is pre post
that's doing my life updating I always
get questions about that so there we go
so you can see it does take a little bit
of time it is a lot of stuff for it to
process for but it goes pretty fast oh
cool
so I'm happy with that I'm not going to
worry about the logo yet should I worry
about the logo let's just change the
text there because I think I'm going to
keep that as actual text the vend whoops
save good and now we can move on so
let's get down after our nav and
actually I think that's going to become
a nav bar fix too so just right here I'm
going to do a fixed top
which will fix it to the top of my
screen so when I'm scrolling it's going
to scroll with me so I think that will
work the other thing that I might want
to change actually see how this is
switching over to this at this screen
size medium now is actually the old
large everything got changed a little
bit so I'm actually gonna change this
over too small I hope I'm saying that
right medium
I think medium is the old art I know
it's changed from one direction another
I think that's just better I like that
more so there we go it's going to switch
over its small oh I also need to get
that on the right side so to get that on
to to get this onto the right side there
we want to come on to this div here that
collapse a navbar collapse one and the
new alignment things it's not it used to
be a specific one for the navbar now we
because it's all flexbox based just ePHI
content end which is a flexbox property
that they let you put on everything now
so that's going to shoot that over to
the right side cool so you can use that
for for aligning content on anything not
just your navbar this is used for
everything you can also do and this is
awesome you used to not be able to do it
just to my content center well plug it
right in the middle and let's get rid of
these I'm going to keep the bootstrap
site open just in case I need to refer
to the documentation at all so yeah I
don't want that to be centered though I
want that to the end there we go and
let's keep going let's keep going so
after there I want to come down and do
my section so I have a section what are
we going to call this section here oh
and inside there we're going to have a
container because we're using bootstrap
container I'm going to put my h1 right
there because the font size is pretty
big and then we're going to have a row
and my row is going to have a justify
content content center as well and I
think this is going to work and inside
there will do a paragraph of lead as
well as a BTN button primary ok so I'm
going to hit tab on this and the whole
thing is going to explode out this is
Emmet if you don't know Emmet and we'll
take a look at what I'm doing here
now that this has pumped out so I have
my hero section so that's this big
section here with a container in it so
this is going to hold everything in the
middle and actually on my hero we can
also do a text center just to make sure
the text is Center aligned so that's
something we can do with bootstrap I
never closed my h1 whoops close h1 I
didn't want this div to be inside my age
one so we are rock that should show up
in a second and that's interesting
what there's my button
I know I did my fix top so I'm wondering
if it's part of that let's just do a
style equals margin top of I don't know
100 pixels yeah okay it was just hiding
underneath that because my navbars fixed
top things can hide underneath it cool
so I'm also I'm gonna doing each one and
I'm actually going to do a class on that
class is equal to display I think it's -
one let's see if it gets bigger yeah so
they have these new display um classes
so that's just going to make the font
much bigger so I'm going to put that on
there and my lead here let's just copy
this text and that's fine I don't know
why I get an error with my text so often
when I know I have the font installed
but whatever I'm going to paste that in
here and I just realized I forgot
something so I put it in a row but then
I didn't use my row what I wanted to do
here is a div class equals column we'll
do small six will come after my
paragraph and close that off close div
good good good and whoops this cut we
can put that in there too
there we go okay so I'm going to save
that and let's go take a look at what we
just got from there the browsers here
so you can see it's all Center aligned
and it's just perfectly centered because
I have my justified content Center so I
don't if you have something that you
need centered you don't have to use
offsets anymore I used to have to use an
offset with the new one they've gotten
rid of that you can just you know I have
a column that's centered which is really
cool and at the small screen size it
should no longer be a column and you
know what I'm going to switch that maybe
the medium because that got kind of
small we can let it we can let it do its
my browsers having some trouble here
doom that's better I like that more okay
great
cool so call a medium six then I have my
lead paragraph I have my button which
obviously needs some text in it listen
to our music good good good if you're
wondering why the colors are different
here it's just view proof colors and now
the color should be fine if ever you're
playing with Photoshop just proof set up
monitor RGB and view proof colors on to
get the actual colors that you're going
to be getting so that's better okay that
section is done let's move on down to
the next one now this one's might end up
changing a little bit on how I do it um
but I'm going to I'm just trying to
think um this is pretty straightforward
right yeah that's okay let's just go in
move that up um I think I'm going to do
I think these are going to be inside of
this section and then I'm going to push
them down out that's what I'm going to
try for right now anyway so let's go and
give that a shot so that's going to be a
new section which is about so we're now
my about section I should do a section
so a section about now inside my section
about what do I need I need to have a
container fluid and the reason I'm doing
container fluid is I want it to be that
full thing there inside of there may
have a row so I'll just inside a my
container fluid will have a row inside
my row I'm going to have a column it's
too small
let's do small six times two so I have
two ones this one's my about and that
one here is where my text will be so
this one will actually get a about title
class on there too just so I can give it
that background image and we'll put the
h2 about close h2o I put that on its own
line so row column column and in this
column this is my row you should put
some comments in here to be able to
follow along a bit better I have a bunt
three paragraphs so let's copy you
should I copy all of it no I'm just
going to copy one at a time it's easier
copy you so I need P times three bang
bang and bang so I got my paragraphs
good and now after that container so I
still want to be in my About section I
think this is gonna be easier let's put
some comments here so I see what I'm
doing
this is closed container closed
container fluid and then this is closed
ro yeah and I'm going to get rid of some
of this extra spacing okay and this is
my um clothes
about section okay so after my container
fluid for these they don't go the full
width so for these things here I will be
doing those with a normal container so
dot container inside that I need a row
and inside of there I need to have a
column small four times three and inside
each one of those I do need a card the
cards I'm going to come back to you when
I actually end up doing this because the
cards have a bit of markup that we're
going to need to do that I don't want to
go too far with and that's it class so
dot card and I'm going to leave it like
that for now and I'm going to yeah when
we actually get to building these out
I'll revisit the mark-up here because
the cards are a little bit um there's a
little bit of stuff we have to put
inside the cards to make them work
properly I actually now let's do it now
I don't think it's not bad I don't
remember exactly but I think it's let's
see if I can remember image I should be
doing this for all of them um I need an
image so image class is equal to card is
it image image
I think it's card we're gonna have to go
see the documentation components cards
images card image top and then I need a
card block after that okay so we're
going to do a card image top SRC is
equal to and I think I might have to
look I forget what I called it about
probably oh no I gave it okay we'll just
do singer for now and we'll fix them all
up after singer dot jpg alt is equal to
our singer good so that's the image and
then we need to have a card block and
inside the card block we will have I'll
do it as an h3 that's going to be too
big for no but it's okay h3 plus I know
that's a class of card title plus a
paragraph which will have a class of
card text and I'm just going to go
through so my card title will be I'm
just going to the same one for all of
these for now just to speed things up
Johnny singer and actually right away we
can do a text primary on that and then
here we can just write a lead singer Oh
am i doing this is lead guitar and then
this guy is drums let's see if this is
actually working go back to my site
so I have my about I have my two columns
that's good and then I have my three so
some of this is okay some of it is not
what did I call my pictures then I
thought how did I not go into my image
folder whoops
IMG / that should fix those images so
this should be our singer our key
tourists so Johnny e tar this would be
guitar and then drum they call it drums
or drummer
hopefully it was drummer Johnny drums
drums save our drummer okay and I forgot
to do on my text um
these all have borders on them that I
don't want and we can turn those barters
off on my card I'm going to do a b0 I
think or is it border zero it's really
border 0 border
yeah border 0 will take off all of that
so I can just get that on all of my
cards the other thing I want to do
actually board 0 border 0 borders are oh
text inverse is that going to let me see
my text no we'll fix my text color after
I guess
okay so that looks good the borders are
gone
Johnny singer is in red so text primary
I definitely want to also put on you and
on you card title text primary I'll just
go down these are all Center text too so
on this container we can just do a text
Center to Center the text on all of
those all at the same time I want to
change the color of this text because
it's white because I told my site to
have white text but I don't think I have
a text inverse color do I let's just go
look quickly bootstrap main let's go
look at their variables bootstrap as CSS
oh I can't see it
variables colors um if I want to change
my text color I guess I should have
looked in the fonts I may be body body
color that's not going to help me though
um because the inverse color is a light
gray actually I want a dark background
on these why am I worrying about this
guys I'm trying to make my text easy to
see but I'm looking at the wrong thing
um bheegi bheegi how do I do this again
you know so I don't need to be in here I
can just go back to my index all of
these cards need to have a background
inverse B G inverse B G inverse where's
my card card card block card V G inverse
I hope I spelled that right in verse
copy it looks okay yeah there we go
cool I'm have to fix that color but for
now so we're going to put that here and
we're going to put that there
paste good good good we're getting there
guys we're getting there our music next
so we can come down to here so this one
is our music so section we'll just call
it music inside of the music we will
have we definitely need to have a
container I'm just trying to think
because this one actually has them when
I need the my parallax in between these
two let's throw it give just a parallax
dive in there for now
that will get populated after music so
this the hole the container is what has
the dark background anyway let's okay
dot container here we'll have my h2 my
h2 will also have a after that will be a
row inside my row will be actually my
role will be a column not a column a to
be a just T Phi content Center so I
don't have to worry about offsets and
then I will have column small four four
no three times three
Oh No yes yes and then should I do this
as two separate rows or should I just
have that as I could probably just do
double this up right and then each one
of these will have an image in it image
s image of two where my class first
class is equal to image fluid so it used
to be image responsive now it's image
fluid and the SRC will be equal to a
image / album oh I can't spell album 0 1
dot jpg hopefully that's the right file
name yeah there it is except oh yeah
okay so I should have done that in two
rows so I have my row I have 1 2 3
images I'm going to do a close div and
then I'm going to make a div class
equals row and I also want to justify
content center so actually I'm gonna
save this so you can see these are
centered on the screen and these aren't
we you still have to use offsets but
right now it's a 3 6 9 I wouldn't be
able to Center that normally so this is
really exciting this justify Content
Center which will allow me to Center
stuff even when there's like it's not
divisible by 12 and stuff so justify
Content Center and we also want to do a
I think it's just no gutters and a no
gutters yeah there we go
super so this will just be let's just go
quickly 1 2 3 4 5 6
save that there's my albums that's like
almost done except I don't have my title
whoops I forgot to write my title music
our
music but honestly there's not very much
more for me died there's our music right
there again I could do a should I Center
everything I might as well music text
Center I almost feel like I could have
put this on my body
but anyway so our music it's they're
cool what's next
I forgot my button so before that
finishes off we'll just do a paragraph
see something you like close paragraph
and then a a what am i doing a button
button primary href it has nowhere to go
and it's going to say visit the store
cool good upcoming shows this is going
to be done with a few more cards and
then my footer so we're almost there
guys we're almost there
section shows in there will be a
conteiner with my h2 and the sibling for
that will be a row my row will have a
column MD or small small for no three
times four we need four of them inside
each one of those is a card again right
so dot card and in this is where it's a
little bit different I'm using a
different type of card because I want
the one that has the background image
thingy so this card has a different name
and it's escaping me so we're going to
go check out the documentation doo doo
doo it's down here it's close to the
bottom other it is oh no it's inverted
text there it is the image overlay so
may or may not need card card inverse
doesn't need so I'll just leave that on
the screen while I do this so I need
inside of my card will be a
card whoops will be in image with a
class of card image which is fine and
next to that will be my card image
overlay and inside of the card image
overlay I can do my a title so I'm gonna
have an h3 the music festival plus a
paragraph plus a paragraph of date and
plus a paragraph of price plus an a
button button primary so I hope this is
right so let's just before I tab this
lets see section so I have my whole
section has a container has my h2
upcoming shows then I'll have my row
I'll have my column small - 3 and I'll
have 4 them 1 2 3 4 each one of those
will have a card inside of it which will
have an image which is there which will
have a card image overlay so that's
what's going to put the text on top of
the image of an h3 which is the music
festival title here then I'll have my
paragraph then I'll have a paragraph
with a class of date and then I'll have
a paragraph with a class of time and
then I'll have my button button primary
I think that's good so upcoming shows my
image here what did I call my images
show image 1 cool so that's nice and
easy to do so we'll do all of my images
at the same time then
show whoops image slash show image zero
one dot jpg and I'll just change the
numbers after good good good then I
should do my alt text to I show people
dancing and singing singing okay
my h3 for all of them is the same so
it's just the music festival actually
all my text is the same for all of them
Montreal QC Canada zero seven zero seven
twenty seven teen I'm going to use a
font awesome for those so I'll come back
when we get to that time and bringing
the font awesome stuff since I never got
around to bring the font awesome in
because I forgot about it
this is going to be small actually small
this text is a little bit tinier
starting at close small nineteen dollars
and the button says buy tickets
let's see you guys oh I have my gaps so
I need to fix that where's that row no
gutters
good and AH all my cards
okay card border:0 cardboard zero card
border zero all right border zero and
will change my images zero four zero
three zero two there we go
awesome that's so cool I have to do a
little bit of stuff on here obviously
for the styling a bit and then but I
think when I finish working on this the
the buttons will get pulled down
automatically or even we can then we'll
get pulled down automatically but we can
we can play with a little bit with some
bootstrap classes and stuff but let's
just try and get through the end of this
because all we have left is the footer
we are at the end ah
so oops too many spaces there footer
inside my footer I will have a container
container so that means I need a row and
inside my row of a column we'll call
this one a small I should just turn my
overlay on right one two three four five
six seven yeah seven
call them small seven-plus a column
small five we'll just do that for now
whoops I hate when I do that call them
small five there we go
so this one will just have that basic
text in there so let's just go and grab
that and and actually my anyway that
will eventually be a link and all of
these will also be links copy and those
of me a list I think those give me a
list right right the s so whoops wrong
one so let's if that's going to be a
list I'm going to be to do I'm not going
to put those the little divider things
in here we're going to use some CSS
magic to do that but for now I do
believe I can okay so we can do that ul
with in Li times four with an A Oh
facebook.com Twitter Instagram sound
cloud cool and now we just need to do
the same thing face book Twitter
Instagram and SoundCloud oh why did I
forget to do that UL class is equal to a
in line list
is it list in line that there we go
except it's not in line list in line
why is my list not going in the line as
I screw something up guys a UL class
list in line let's just copy this my
bullet points disappeared so it's a good
sign li clothes li li clothes li li
clothes a light when it did it okay okay
so let's just paste theirs in here I
don't get that guys what's going on
save what oh I need to do list in line
item ah son of a class is equal to list
in line item that's a little bit of
overkill isn't it guys
