completely changed how we make layouts
we don't have to do floats and clears
anymore which well simpler also cause so
many problems that flexbox just doesn't
cause so that's awesome and this is the
beginning of a three part series where
we're gonna be exploring flexbox hi
there if you're new here my name is
Kevin and I teach people how to make the
web and how to make it look good while
they're at it as I mentioned this is the
start of a three part series that I'm
going to be doing on flexbox as an
introduction to flexbox
it's something for people that have
started using it and aren't too sure
about it or just I've been confused by
it and I've avoided it completely in
this video I'm gonna be looking at the
Flex container so all the different
properties we can use on a Flex
container in the next video we're gonna
be looking at the Flex items themselves
which are the pieces that are inside of
a Flex container and on the last video
we're gonna build a really simple layout
using flexbox in a few different ways
like I said this is this video is all
about the Flex container so it's the
different ones and the Flex container is
the big thing that all the stuff is
inside just by doing different
properties on the Flex container itself
it completely changes how the whole
thing works and it can be kind of weird
and confusing so it's we're gonna look
through some examples we're gonna open
up a code pen thing and just play around
with it pretty much looking at what all
the different things do and I'll try and
explain as much as possible as I go so
let's just jump right into it alright so
what I've done now is I've set up a
document here in code pen so the link
for this will be down below all we have
is a container here with five different
items inside so it's just five different
divs
I've given them a class of item but
there's nothing much going on on these
yet my container itself just as a pink
background so we can see where my
container is I've given it a height of
50 V H and a width of 50 V H just to
make sure that it's a perfect square I
actually meant to make that V W so why
don't we change that over now the
padding on it will be just point five so
I just want to keep my items off the
side and I've centered it on the screen
here on my items themselves so each one
of these little items just has a light
blue background on it and a margin of
point zero five and the whole i0 point
five I should say and the whole point of
that is just to create these little
spaces in between them so we can
separate them a little bit
the first thing I'm going to do right
now is just set change this over a so
I'm going to change the display to flex
and as soon as I change the display to
flex we can see that everything
completely changes I'm gonna run through
we're gonna be going through this sort
of item by item of all the different
flex properties so the very first flex
property we're going to look at right
now is the Flex direction direction and
what this is done by default is set it
to row so a row is something that goes
all the way across right so we have my
one big row and then so because it said
is a row these have turned sort of into
columns inside of that row so again if I
take this you know we take both of these
off we can see it completely changes the
behavior of what's going on so by being
a row all of my items have to be in that
one row so they all line up one next to
each other they also stretch to take
this whole area up you don't always see
this if they don't have a background on
them so I like playing around with
background colors a little bit just so I
really know what's going on so I said
we're gonna look at this item by item so
the first thing we have here is our Flex
direction so my Flex direction by
default is row and we can actually
reverse this so I can do a row reverse
and it's gonna switch it all around this
is almost like doing or it's almost
exactly like doing a float right so you
can see that it actually does the Flex
item one my first one goes all the way
to the right side and then it goes in
reverse order and they're lined up all
the way on the side there so doing a row
reverse is literally pretty much like
doing a float right the other option we
have is to do a column and if I set the
column it's almost resetting it back to
how it was before where they're all
stacking one on top of each other so now
that it's a column they're all a column
we'll make things stack instead of go
next to one another so it depends on the
way you want it to behave personally I
like being able to make this change at
different media queries this works
really well for a navigation because in
a navigation you might have something
that's row to begin with you have your
navigation items one next to each other
and then a different screen size they'll
switch over to a column and they'll all
line up one on top of each other which
sort of makes more sense at the smaller
screen sizes and so for now I'm going to
switch this back over to row and
we'll look at the next thing we can do
and the next thing we can do is a flex
wrap so flex wrap by default is set to
no wrap meaning things don't wrap and
right now it doesn't really make much
sense because they only have five items
and they're not taking up all the space
so I'm actually going to take these five
items and let's paste this in there so I
have ten and you see now they're all
sort of squeezing into the available
space they're just they're making room
for one another and they've gotten a lot
smaller and let's add a whole bunch more
actually and you can see now they're
actually spilling out the side so
because they've gotten as small as they
can possibly get
so one thing with flex items is they
will adjust automatically to how big or
how small they should be based on the
content that's inside of them and
because now I have so many items they've
gotten as small as they can get and
they're flying out the side so let's add
a whole bunch more let's get rid of that
space and they're just spilling out the
side here by default things will spill
up the side and it's personally kind of
annoying that that's the default is
nowrap but we can easily switch this
over to a wrap and now they'll stack one
on top of each other instead you'll also
notice that let's just undo that for a
second with the no wrap they got as
small as they could so it was literally
shrinking down to the smallest possible
size it could to fit that text and then
when I switch it over to wrap it's
keeping the text on one line of code or
one line of visual line here so we'll
flex label and that's as small as it's
gonna get it runs out of room and it
will wrap that down below I'm gonna
delete a whole bunch of these let's go
back to the original that we had so
another way this does impact how things
are working is I'm gonna go over to my
items here and give these a width so if
I do a width of like 25% on it my wrap
it is making it wrap down so it's 2550
75 percent I have some padding on these
and I have some I don't have padding but
I have some margin on these so it
doesn't have enough room to fit there so
it's wrapping down below this is
something that's really strange though
if this is set to no wrap it actually
changes the the width of it it's not 25%
it's squeezing it in to fit which
personally I find a little weird and
what that means is it will you know you
can see that it's shrinking and growing
so it's ignoring this width more or less
it's going it's sort of like a max width
almost and just to show you if I make
this like a thousand pixels oops I don't
need to semicolon so but a thousand
pixels it doesn't change it's not all of
a sudden shooting out the side because
in pixels tall and this is a bit of an
unexpected behavior so just something to
watch out if something's not behaving
the way you'd expect it to just be aware
the default is no wrap we can switch
that over to wrap again it's this is
becomes almost like a max width on it so
it's not gonna spill out the side so if
I switch to this back over to 25% let's
say and this is 25% now and if my screen
got really small I guess then you can
see it's it's not even well yeah it
still it's a max width but it's it's
changing based on the size of the
overall container and all of that stuff
so it's a little bit unexpected the way
this flex wrap works and again the
default is no wrap the next thing we can
look at is something called flex flow
and flex flow is just a shorthand for
flex direction and flex wrap so a flex
direction ro flex wrap is no wrap I
could write flex Rho and in here I could
write Rho no wrap so this is literally
the same thing as keeping this like my
Flex Direction is Rho my wrap is no wrap
so if I switch this over to column it
should call them
it should over write actually oops I
didn't this is flex flow not flex row
hello there we go
so my column is over writing my row
that's here so flex flow is combining
the Flex direction and the Flex wrap
together into one as a shorthand
let me get rid of that one for now the
next really big ones that we can look at
our our justify content align items and
align content and these are often mixed
up and for a good reason I would say so
I'm gonna put these on their own line
I'm gonna do a justify content first
misspelled that though just defy content
and the default for this is flex start
so I'm going to leave that now so
nothing should change that is the
default value for
justify content we could switch flicks
start to flex end and that's gonna push
everything over to the the end of our
item now the way justify content works
is it's dealing with the main access so
I'm dealing with a row so rows go from
here over to this side so it's moving
the content on the main access so it's
moving it this way so if I flex start is
starting at the start of my row Flex end
is pushing everything over to the end I
can also Center that so let's do a
center so that's kind of cool it's
centering it this is a really nice thing
that we couldn't do with our old float
and clear system so flex our justify
content that lets us Center things we
also have a space between which we'll
keep the first item all the way on the
left our last item all the way on the
right and it just puts an equal amount
of space between all of them and the
last one which I really like is space
around which we'll put an equal amount
of space on each item so this space is
equal to halfway in between these two
which is equal to this which is equal to
this and so on and so forth so it's an
equal amount of space around each item
it's sort of like equal margins on the
left and the right of each item in this
case but remember the justified content
is working on the actual access the main
access so I said before that a row goes
this way a column goes up and down so if
I switch my Flex direction to column the
justify content is now working up and
down so my space around it's putting the
same space on top and on the bottom and
if I put a center on this it will Center
it vertically instead of horizontally
and if I make this a flex and it's gonna
push it all the way to the bottom so
it's a little bit weird that just of a
content works differently but it's
always focused on the main access and
that's the thing to remember I'm gonna
switch this back to row for a second
and let's put this back to flex start
just for the moment another one that we
have is our a line item so let's try our
line items we're almost at the end of
these actually a line items and the
default for this is stretch so nothing
should change because that's the default
for Maya line items I'm going to change
this over to a flex start
so it's the same wording that I'm
putting there but I'm looking at the
alignment of my items I want my items to
start at the top so they're shrinking
down to the minimum size they're not
stretching to fill up that whole space
anymore they're going all the way up to
here so that's the flex start you can
guess probably what Flex end is going to
do it's going to pull it all the way
down to the bottom now the difference is
justify content is working on the main
access so justify content is always the
main access and aligned items is working
on the cross access which means the
opposite access so because this is a row
my row my justify content is working
this way and my align items is working
up and down so Flex end is there now if
I switch this over to a column they
switch over so flex start means the top
and aligned items
flex end means the right side because
again it's the cross access and this is
where it can get kind of confusing when
do I use justify content and when do I
use a line items they all take pretty
much the same properties there's one
it's a little bit different but again
let's just do a little let's Center that
so then it gets centered in the middle
and one thing that's kind of convenient
is a center center will always just plug
something right in the middle if you're
not sure which one to use honestly as
you're getting used to this just try one
and if it was the wrong one use the
other one no it's not the perfect answer
but it should work pretty well overall
one thing that a line items has or one
thing it doesn't have is the space
between in space around and one thing it
does have is baseline and let's change
this back to a row for now okay so now
that they're there back to just being
there I'm gonna take I let's just do
this call this big and let's come over
here and say that big as a font size of
2m so it should be twice as big that
font so my line items let's just do a
flex start and they're all gonna be
lined up right on the top and this is
because of a little bit of extra margin
we have there so it's pushing it down a
bit so they're all pretty effectively
they're all lined up on the top and when
we use the align items base line it
means that the first line of text is all
lining up on the same
line there so you can see that on the
bottom of the first line of text on all
of them so if one of these the only time
you really notice a difference with this
align items base line is if there is
different font size involved if
everything is the same font size this
will look exactly the same
as a font as the Flex start but because
our font sizes are different the Flex
start does look a little bit different
you can imagine the baseline one works
really well if you had a main content
area and then a sidebar because you
wouldn't want this happening this is one
of those really annoying things that can
happen when something starting up higher
than other things so if your main
content area and your baseline mr.
Philbeck if your main content area and
your sidebar both have a line ID or
sitting in something within the line
items base line you know that they're
all everything's always gonna be
starting at the same point which just
looks a little cleaner so that is pretty
cool now another thing that can be
confusing is something called a line
content and that's because a line
content has a sort of a mid it has the
same properties as the justified content
they both have a content in them so I
guess that makes sense so we don't have
the baseline option and we do have the
space between in the space around now
aligned items sorry now aligned content
only works if you have multiple lines of
content right now it's not gonna do
anything and it also conflicts with the
aligned items so I'm actually undelete
aligned items now so we can see what
it's doing and when you only have one
set of things here let's just do an
aligned items Flex end and you can see
it's not actually doing anything whereas
if I have my aligned items Flex end they
would be just all lined up at the bottom
aligned context Flex end hasn't changed
anything it's it looks exactly like it
did it it's always looked so again it
only works when you have multiple things
along the cross axis and I cross access
in this case is up-and-down so let's put
a whole bunch of stuff in there and
let's change this over to wrap so we
actually get multiple lines of stuff
there we go so now my aligned content is
going to start working so I can do a
center on that now just to show you this
is my aligned content
I'm gonna comment that out let's put in
a line items center and you can see that
works a little bit differently so a line
item Center is centering each one in
that available space that it has so
let's put that back to stretch for a
second so it's pretty much aligning it
in the center of each one of these parts
here whereas the aligned content Center
will again overwrite what this is going
on so if I delete that it won't even
change anything and it's aligning all of
the content right in the middle we can
also do a space around or we can do a
space between so the aligned content
actually works a lot like the justified
content but you need to have multiple
lines of content once again I just can't
emphasize that enough where's the line
items is dealing it more at one at a
time it's really one of those things
right now it might be seeming kind of
confusing how do you know which one to
choose you try one or another the other
thing I would suggest is having a
flexbox playground type of thing to play
around with and I will put a link to one
of those below it is a lifesaver when
you're first playing around with this
stuff having one of them around
I still use one sometimes just because
the mix of all these properties can get
kind of confusing and that's what you
can do with your Flex containers so I
hope you liked that video um just so you
know you might have seen it in the last
couple videos but I thought I'll mention
it again I do have a patreon now so you
if you do want to support this channel
if you find that you're getting a lot of
value from it I'd really appreciate it
but don't feel any obligation to do so
on top of that just a big thank you for
watching this video if you have any
questions about it till that you're not
too sure about leave a question down
below in the comments but do remember
that the next video is going to be
dealing with the Flex items themselves
so maybe your question will get answered
along there if you haven't subscribed
yet to this channel consider subscribing
it's a new video every single Wednesday
just like this one and until next time
remember try and make your corne in the
Internet just a little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
