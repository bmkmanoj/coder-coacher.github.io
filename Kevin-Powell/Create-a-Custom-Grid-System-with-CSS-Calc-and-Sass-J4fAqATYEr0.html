you how you can use flexbox and
something called CSS calc which lets us
do math in CSS it's really cool we're
gonna use both of those to build it a
full grid system once we finish that up
I'm gonna show you something even more
incredible how we can do the exact same
thing using only four lines of code in
sass hi my name is Kevin and here at my
channel I bring you tips tricks and
tutorials based on web development and
design every single Wednesday now I just
finished wrapping up a big tutorial
series on how to build a responsive
website from scratch I looked at my
whole workflow and all of that and in
that series I did build out a grid
system for the website but it was a
really basic grid system it wasn't fully
involved I didn't need very much in that
one and I thought it was missing out
from that series it's something that can
be really useful to you guys because in
larger projects often you want a large
full-on grid system the little thing I
built last time just wouldn't hack it so
when if chitter-chatter let's jump right
to it
now as you can see on my screen now this
is in code pen so if you want to see
play with or copy the code you can use
the link down in the description below
to find it for the CSS version I'm gonna
be using calc this lets us do math in
our CSS which is awesome the other nice
thing about it is we can mix units so to
give you an idea of what I'm talking
about let's just look really quickly
here I've already done my markup so all
my HTML is there really really basic I
have a container I have a row and then I
just have a whole bunch of columns in
there in my CSS all I've done is put a
background color on here and changed my
box sizing to border box and that's it
very very simple I have a little comment
down here that we'll explore in a second
but let's start by looking at our
container I'm gonna start by giving this
a background of light blue just so we
can see the container and see a little
bit of what's going on with it so
normally what you'd see with a container
is something like width of 90% and then
maybe a max width of 50 Ram or something
like that
and of course a margin:0 auto to center
it now this is fine and there's nothing
wrong with that but I just want to give
you an idea of what Cal does and one
thing you can do with this
because it's 90% the margin on the side
is always changing which might be a good
thing depends on your site but it gets
smaller and smaller and smaller or
bigger and bigger and bigger and
obviously there it stops but what we can
do is instead of saying 90% I can use
the calc fing I've been talking about
this whole time so do a calculation in
CSS you just put in calc there and then
put parentheses and then all the math
goes inside of here and I'm actually
gonna say a hundred percent and I'm
gonna subtract ten REM so there you can
see it worked now what it's doing is
it's taking a hundred percent and it's
subtracting ten REM from the total width
so it's gonna subtract five REM from the
side and five REM from that side pretty
much and the cool thing with that is
it's always going to keep my margins the
same no matter what it isn't my screen
size now tens a little bit big but it's
fine just for demo purposes here and you
can see that no matter what's going on
this and this are staying exactly the
same so if that is something you're
after this is a really nice and easy way
to achieve that now on to what you're
really here for just really quick I've
put this this is for demo purposes only
I would never do this in my actual CSS
because it makes my columns just explode
if you haven't seen a selector like this
I'm just pretty much saying this is an
attribute selector so all divs that have
an attribute of the square brackets let
you choose attributes I have a class and
this means that starts with order that
is prepend by column - and since all my
columns start with a column or Co L -
anything that starts with Co L - will
get these properties and I pretty much
just put these on here so we can
visualize and see my columns I'm not
building out a full website I just want
to see I just want to show you guys how
we can build out this column system so
let's start with just doing a row
because our row is very important to do
I'm gonna do row and we're gonna do
display flex on there so it's flexing
and that should bang they all work and
really important is my flexwrap of you
know
of rap since they know rap but we need a
rap on it by default flex things will
spill out the sides we don't want that
to happen if it gets to the end we do
want it to fall down and now we can
start with my column system so I'm gonna
start with the column 12 because it's
the first one and this is the nice easy
one with our not with I wanted to do a
flex let's go with a zero zero 100% and
there we go it takes up a hundred
percent and just to show you if I take
this flex wrap off they're spilling out
the side which we don't want so that's
why I'm putting that flex wrap on there
now the column 11 is where it gets more
interesting so we'll do that one next
and we do a flex and flex the shorthand
this is a flex rink flex grow and flex
basis so flex basis is the size of it
the grow is how much it's going to grow
and then the shrink deals with how it
shrinks I just pretty much want to make
sure it's not shrinking or growing so
that's what the zero zeros for so we're
going to do a flex zero zero calc and my
calculation in this case is going to be
100% divided by 12 because I have a grid
system of 12 so that's taking up there
is my 12 and in this case I want it to
do 11 on 12 like I want this total here
to be whoops
I want the total width of this to be 11
on 12 of my grid system right so the
easy I've already got it down to 1 on 12
by doing this and then all I'm gonna do
is multiply it by 11 and there we go
it's taking up 11 out of 12 units on my
grid so now I can come in here and I can
do my column of 1 because that is the
next one that is here and on there we
can do the same thing flex up 0 0 calc
and be a hundred percent divided by 12
times 1 you probably guessed that one
and we can see it's working out really
well and let's come in here and do a
column 10
and that one will be a flex of zero zero
calc and I'm guessing you see where this
is going but I'll show you anyway 12
times 10 and that's now taking up ten
and one last one just so you make sure
you know what's going on I've flex of
zero zero calc 100% divided by 12 times
two and there we go what you can see
it's working I'm going to build the rest
of it out but I think you probably see
exactly how I'm doing this I just take
whatever number I see here and plug it
down there so I'm going to fast forward
this while I work through it
awesome so you can easily expand this
out using media queries and whatever
else you'd want to do with it and
obviously if you needed a different good
system you would just change this this
is how many columns or the how many grid
columns on your grid you want and then
that's pretty much it it's really nice
and easy but if you think that's cool
let's look at how we can do this with
only four lines of code using sass and
something called the for control
directive and when we do that we can
also set up some offsets using only two
extra lines of code so right here I have
set up the basics now if you've never
used sass it's really really awesome
it's a preprocessor it lets us do more
stuff than what you can do it in normal
CSS but it always has to output with CSS
you can see here it is set to sass
you'll see that there's no curly braces
and stuff like that you might also be
used to a CSS which is a lot like sass
if you're not sure link in the
description below to learn a little bit
more about all of that now where this is
really cool is I'm gonna use the for
control directive if you've ever done
for loops with JavaScript you'll
understand this right away and if you
haven't this is a little bit more
advanced sass it's not the basics of it
but if you've never used sass this will
probably want to you know give you the
urge to want to learn it because it's
really really cool so I've already set
up my road just like everything else up
until now has been set up the way we've
been doing so before I really set
everything up I'm going to say I'm gonna
create a variable so I'm gonna say
columns is the number 12 because I'm
gonna have 12 columns in my grid system
and now what I want to do is set up my 4
so at 4 and then I'm going to say a
dollar sign
so I'm creating a variable of I and
we're going to say from whoops 1 so from
1 through our variable of columns so
it's going to cycle through and it's
gonna run something so it's gonna start
at 1 it's going to do it and it's going
to do it again at 2 and then it's gonna
do it again at 3 all the way until it
gets to the number 12 now I could
technically put the number 12 here and
it would work fine but this one extra
line just gives me a lot more
versatility and I'll show you what I
mean by the
once we wrap up this whole thing so now
what I need to do is just jump down onto
my next line and I need to tell it what
we're really doing so I'm gonna say
column - so every time it runs through
this I wanted to create a class in my
CSS so it's always going to start with
this but then what I want to do is I'm
enough to do a pound sign or a hashtag
and then curly braces and inside the
curly braces
I can put my variable of I so what this
means is it's gonna run through all of
this and it's going to do it for number
one so the first time I is equal to one
so it's gonna make a column - one and
then it's gonna make a column - - and I
type in 3 and it's gonna do that all the
way up to 12 now for each one of those I
want it to set up my Flex box right on
my Flex grid so just like before 0 0 but
now what I want it to do is where it
gets a little bit more interesting so
I'm gonna say a hundred percent divided
by my columns times dollar sign I and
Omega does it worked
look at that I'm finished four lines of
code including setting up my variable
and it's done it just happened like
magic and you might be going what just
happened and it's pretty simple again if
you're not used to this it might be a
bit weird but let's go look at the
compiled CSS so this is what the
computer is actually seeing let's get
rid of that let's go down and you'll see
also that we do have the you can see
here we it's we've added on all our
prefixes and stuff but it's set up a
column one with a flex of zero zero and
then eight point three three three
percent column two is there column three
and it's just gone through all the way
and gone up to column twelve super cool
now what it one thing that is really
important is you notice I didn't use the
calc in here and the reason I didn't is
we can do calculations natively inside
of SAS and this is the same if you're
using a CSS and if I use the Cal thing
that we get from CSS it wouldn't let me
use the
variables and these variables are what
are making it all work so it's really
important that in this case we're not
using calc so one that the other really
cool thing with this is it's all built
up with the idea that it's super easy to
change now so if I wanted a grid of 16 I
put 16 and now it's working on the 16 so
this is a full grid of 16 and it's all
just working out like magic I could
change this over to a grid of 4 and it's
not gonna work perfectly because things
are gonna screw up but you get the idea
I just need to change what I see here
let's just change that back to 16 for a
second and look at the compiled CSS and
you can see the numbers here have all
changed accordingly and it's going to
have run through all the way to 16 now
just like magic
and if I change that to 100 it would run
through 100 columns and set it all up
properly for 100 columns so it does give
you a little bit more versatility you
can come through and change things a
little bit easier let's change that back
to 12 so my system is actually working
properly though and I did mention that
we can do offsets with just one extra
line or two extra lines I should say so
I'm gonna say a column offset of the
same thing I did before I and all I have
to do now is say that the margin left is
equal to 100% divided by exactly like we
did before columns times dollar sign I
and with that let's just come in here
and add after this 6 well add a new 6 in
here so that should pop up at the bottom
and let's add a column offset of 2 and
that should just bump over by 2 there we
go I could change that over to a 1 I
could change that over to a 6 the whole
thing just exists it's now over there if
you check the compiled CSS it would know
my whole system would be there the only
thing here is it will create an offset
of 12 which is useless but honestly it's
not
that big of a deal and that's it -
