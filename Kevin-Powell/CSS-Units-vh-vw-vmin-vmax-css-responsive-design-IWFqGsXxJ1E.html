video
my name is Kevin and I'm bringing you
weekly videos and tips and tricks and
tutorials on web development so if you
haven't already subscribed you should go
ahead and subscribe right now in this
week's video we are going to be looking
at the VW vh as well as v min and v max
CSS units we're gonna be looking at
basically what they are and how they
work but I'm not just going to look at
them for layout purposes I'm also gonna
look at how a few of these can really be
used to make some interesting typography
decisions as well and make some nice
responsive typography so on the screen
now you can see what I'm gonna be
playing around with it's a simple simple
layout that I've done in code pen I'm
going to put the link down below so you
can play around with this basically I've
just set up a two column system here
it's sort of like a basic landing screen
type of thing and I put a big image down
here just so we can scroll and scroll
down a little bit if we come down I've
put everything starting around here all
the other stuff is just the basics to
set everything up starting here is where
I want to look at so the first thing
that I've done is I have selected just
everything the universal selector and
change the box siding over to border box
just because that makes our lives much
easier that's not really a v8 VW thing
it just makes our lives a lot easier for
layout stuff so if you don't already do
that I encourage you do that on all your
sites so the very very first thing that
I want to look at is the V H and V W
units and we're gonna look at them with
this hero that I've set up right here so
the hero is this area here that has the
gradient on it with the background with
all of this stuff inside if i come here
and i give this a let's start with a
height so a height of 100 VH which will
give us an idea of what's actually going
on and you can see the height of it has
just increased so V H and V W stand for
viewport height and viewport width and
they're super useful you've probably
seen a lot of websites that have a
full-screen section for when you get
there so you get on the home page on the
desktop it takes up the whole space and
you scroll down but even if you resize
the window it's always the same this is
how we're doing it it's 100% of the
viewport
height is how we look at that so you can
see now that second I scroll down that's
where it's ending and if I change the
size of my viewport it's still the same
so that's really cool it's always
matching the size of my viewport height
one thing to be really careful with this
is when you start getting into mobile
views so when you're starting it in the
small screen sizes this can cause issues
and just to show you the type of issue
that this can run into would be well
let's just shrink this down and now when
I scroll over everything is spilling
outside and this happens on cell phones
sometimes because we're using the
viewport height it's a smaller viewport
height the content is longer and it
causes some issues so if you are using
this I strongly encourage that you go
ahead and use some media queries to go
ahead and fix that
now of course you don't have to have a
ton hundred I could do whoops not eight
hundred I could do eighty and then it's
gonna be 80% of the height and of course
you can use this for widths as well so
I'm not necessarily wanting to do this
but let's say I do width of eighty
viewport width and now no matter what my
viewport is it's going to be 80% of that
size and it's going to adjust
automatically you can see the white on
the side there is 20% and the rest is my
80% so you could use that as something
for a container or something instead of
using percentage and where viewport
width is different from percentage as
percentage is always based on the parent
element so maybe the parent is already
smaller let's just get rid of that
because it's weird
so actually we could do this on our
button just for fun with 100 viewport
width so even though it's inside of
something there I start with a hundred
percent actually so a hundred percent
it's going to stretch to be a hundred
percent of its parent and one hundred
percent viewport width means it's going
to be the same width as my viewport so
just a quick difference on what those
two are and why the viewport width can
be useful because sometimes you do want
to
something outside of the full width of a
container okay
so then where do V Max and V min come in
well I can do AV max here so let's do V
Max and what V Max is is it's looking at
a viewport maximum which one is bigger
it's gonna take 80% of whichever
viewport unit is bigger so right now my
width is bigger that's 2 smaller than
this actually that's set this up at like
20 so we're gonna see right now it stops
getting smaller because right now it's
based on the height my viewport is
taller than it is wide so it's looking
at this and it's setting it to 20% of
the viewport height as soon as my
viewport is wider than it is tall which
is right there you can see that it
starts getting taller and taller and
taller so it's taking the taller of the
two units and if I do have V min it's
the other way around it's gonna take the
smaller of the two units so right now my
width
it should be 10 of this cuz that's the
smaller one oh I was getting down to
zero and it's because I have padding on
there right right right I have my
padding that's on there so that's the
Pat let's just put this to zero my
padding is gonna keep a height on there
no matter what I do so let's just take
the padding off having zero height 50
the min and it should keep getting small
there we go there we go okay so that's
why so it's stopping there so it's
looking at the smaller of the two units
so V min looks at the smaller of the two
units and the max looks at the bigger of
the units and those are a bit weird and
you might be wondering when should I use
one of those or the other but before I
get to there one other useful place that
you can use it is actually in your
padding here so in if I have my height
set it is 100 viewport height so it's
always going to be full screen I might
want to also set my padding in viewport
height so if I do this as a 10 viewport
height so I have a padding of 10 on the
top and 10 on the bottom that means my
padding will automatically adjust based
on the size the height of my screen
which is kind of nice so you know I'm
adjusting the height already so I might
as well also adjust you can see it's
slowly getting smaller on the top it's
not gonna make a huge adjustment but it
should be enough to make a little bit of
a difference so that could be something
you could play around with now I
mentioned we're gonna get into type and
the whole V main V Max thing might start
making a bit more sense once we get into
type so here in my type I have my title
and my paragraph so I've called that
hero title and hero text and instead of
doing the font size in M s we can switch
these out and setting a font size for a
title in viewport width can be super
useful so I think you put with let's try
10 maybe a bit big
let's try 8 okay so I sort of like that
size and I think it looks nice at this
layout
but now when I'm gonna increase or
decrease the size of my screen that font
size will increase or decrease with it
and it's gonna keep things more or less
in proportion as I go around so it makes
for a very very responsive type which
can be super good for titles and super
super handy for titles because it's a
nice big font but when you're getting
onto a smaller screen size you sort of
want that to get smaller or else it's
too big and you're used to probably
making media queries that are going to
affect this at different screen sizes
and now I don't have to worry about the
media query as much but I probably still
would want to build in media queries
because at one point it might get too
small and at one point it might get too
big this at really big screen sizes can
get things really really big so you
might build in a set size for very small
screens and a set size for very big
screens but everything in between having
something as a viewport width can make
for very nice responsive titles but you
notice I'm saying titles and not
responsive text it doesn't work so good
for paragraph text because paragraph
text is generally smaller to begin with
it's not bold and if it gets really
small it can be hard to read so let's
set this to four viewport width that's
probably too big let's try three then
let's go down to two maybe two and a
half will be perfect so looking at it
there right now this looks pretty good
but now my paragraph text is getting
really really big it's sort of screwing
up my whole layout and when I'm going
smaller and smaller and smaller it's
getting harder and harder to read my
title is still super easy to read but
this has gotten super super small so I
don't really suggest using this for type
it just gets a little bit funky now if I
change this over to viewport height I'm
not saying that it's the best thing but
you can see here it's not going to
change based on this so it's you know my
width is not going to affect it it's
only the height that will actually
affect it which can be useful but it's
still a little bit extreme you'd
probably want to build a minimum size in
there using
your query i'm just because right now
it's getting really really tiny but it
could be useful that at smaller screen
sizes it is shrinking a little bit you
know if you're going onto a cell phone
it's a smaller viewport height and width
but it might work okay not sure if I'd
really do it from a paragraph text but
I'm just saying that it's a possibility
and it will probably work better than
the viewport width which has more
extreme changes most of the time but in
general I would be sizing this in my AMS
I think I had that at like 1.5 or so 1.2
now where the viewport max the V Max and
the V min can be really useful if I put
this as my V min where this gets really
useful is it's looking at the smaller of
the two sizes so right now the smaller
of the two sizes is the viewport width
so it's going to keep shrinking and
shrinking and shrinking just like I
wanted it to and as I make it bigger
it's going to keep getting bigger and
bigger and bigger and bigger and oh it
stopped because now my viewport height
is the smaller unit so as soon as my
viewport height became the smaller unit
this isn't being affected anymore so
that's really really neat and a fun way
that you can play around with the size
of font where it's not going to blow
things out on the large sense now that
does mean when this starts shrinking
down it will affect the font size but
that might not necessarily be a bad
thing either and in general not many
people are running around with screens
that are this shape though obviously if
someone's on a mobile device that's
turned in landscape mode then you know
this could happen
if you are going to use any of these at
any time one thing I strongly suggest is
you do lots and lots of extensive
testing you should already be taking
into account lots of different screen
sizes different screen orientations but
if you're using these units for anything
especially for type make sure you check
every possible situation because you
might run into one where all of a sudden
something really weird happens
so just as a little bit of a word word
of warning um but I do think they're
very useful units I don't use them for
type a lot I do use the vh a lot for
setting heights of things or
occasionally when I need to set a height
a lot of the time it will be with VH
that I'm actually setting it and for
font sizes I don't use it too much but
I'm starting to try and use it more for
my big big big titles because I really
do like when my title is responsive like
this and I don't even have to worry
about it
so in all I do think that the V H and V
W are super useful and a little bit
easier to understand what's going on the
V min and V Max are a little bit harder
to use and a little bit harder to wrap
your mind around but they definitely
have certain things that they can work
for you will notice I didn't set my font
size with V Max that's going to lead to
some Gigantor sizes it just gets way out
of hand and it never really gets small
enough because it's always looking at
the bigger size and it works better if
this is always looking at the smaller of
the two sizes and again you can just put
a V W in there if it's easier to grasp
just know that you'll definitely need
media queries for potentially the
smallest size and definitely for the
larger sizes where things can start
getting really big so I think that's it
