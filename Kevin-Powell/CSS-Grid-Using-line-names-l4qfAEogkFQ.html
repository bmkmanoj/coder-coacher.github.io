looking at how we can use line names to
make it easier to use the CSS grid hi
and welcome to this video I'm so glad
you're here there has been a kind of new
people at this channel checking out this
channel checking out my videos so just
thank you so much so for all you new
guys welcome I'm so glad you're here
just in case you're really new and this
is your first video my name is Kevin and
I hope you've learned how to make the
web and how to make it look good while
you're at it in last week's video I
looked at a super simple way that we can
use the CSS grid it was just like a
basic basic introduction let's set up a
super basic grid using the most basic
properties we can and then just use
spans to either use span row span
columns and that was it so there was
nothing very complicated about it in
this video we're gonna be looking at how
we can also use line numbers to dictate
exactly where on the grid we should be
going but also when you're using the
line numbers it gets confusing sometimes
in the example I'm using some relatively
simple even though it's a layout you can
definitely use in one of your projects
but it's it's giving me simple enough
and even then the line numbers are kind
of weird the way the line numbers work
I'm not I mean I understand how they did
it but it's just it can get kind of
trying to remember which line you're
dealing with as a pain so instead of
trying to remember numbers you can
actually give them specific names and
that just makes your life so much easier
so I want to show you how you can do
that and by doing that how we can get
this really cool like sort of overlay
effect that you used to have to use
negative margins for and a whole bunch
of crap like that the grid we don't need
to do that anymore and you can really
well I guess you could sort of do no you
can do it with this pants like we looked
at last time this really needs some
explicit start and end points to pull it
off so yeah I'm really it's a cool thing
the grid it's just amazing I'm so happy
it's here I'm still wrapping my mind
around it I don't I'm letting you guys
know now I don't have a 100%
understanding of everything it can do
yet I'm still learning along with you
guys but as I'm learning new stuff I
want to be showing it to you
and yet the naming of the lines is one
of the first things I learned I'm so
happy I did so I definitely want to let
you know about it so let's jump right
into it
all right guys here we are in code pen
to start this off so the link of this
will be down in the description below if
you want to follow along or if you want
to play with my code or do whatever you
want with it you'll notice I have done a
little bit of work right now and it
doesn't look so good
I know I've been telling you guys that
this channel is all about learning how
to make the web and how to make it look
good too and I've been ignoring they
look good too part of it and they'll be
ignoring it a little bit in this video -
it won't look super sexy but I think
it's gonna the layout of it sexy you're
just not necessarily all the visuals but
that's gonna get there when we when we
do the big grid series I'm gonna build a
full-on website that one's gonna be
focused not only on using the grid to
make a full website but it's also going
to be looking at how do we can make it
look good while we're at it with that
out of the way though let's look at what
I've got here I have three sections so I
have a section here at sort of my title
section a section two which is my little
info thing here that's gonna be three
columns and then a section three that's
gonna have a container inside of it
that's gonna do Center my content where
this could be like the rest of the page
so my markup on this one is really
simple I think this is all I need so
again this is just three divs here that
are gonna be three columns when we get
to there I'm so I'm gonna pop open my
CSS I have down a little bit in here but
it's pretty much just to set the colors
and my fonts and stuff like that nothing
much else and I haven't done much and I
put a background up on this one here
another thing that I do want to mention
is I am using Firefox and I'm using
Firefox nightly which is they're sort of
the developer version and it's because I
want to use their inspector it's better
than the chrome one for the grid you can
actually see the grid and you're gonna
see that it can do some other really
cool stuff while we're at it too so if
you are using the grid and you're having
trouble with it I didn't do it in the
last video I only thought of it after
but using you're gonna see how it works
and it's really cool if you didn't see
it in the first video I did when I
checked out the grid my very first one
the live one that was a while ago so
what do we want to do we want to set up
our grid and on this one I'm actually
going to set it up on the body I don't
know if I'd normally set it up on the
body
but I feel like for just a simple demo
like this it will work pretty good so
what we're gonna do and just what we
what I want this to look like actually
just really quickly is I want this big
area with the image just sort of a boat
you know maybe 3/4 of the page half the
page overlapping that a little bit I
want this my three columns are gonna
sort of overlap it a bit and then my
more content could go here will just be
what fills up the rest it down at the
bottom and actually I'm gonna I'm gonna
make these three columns before and I'm
just going to do that really simple I'm
gonna do a display flex on my section
two so right away I get three columns
there so that it makes it nice and
awesome we can do anything just defy
content space around and as well as do I
need anything else I'm gonna leave it
like that for now maybe we'll need
something a little bit after but I think
let's see I'm gonna leave it like that
so far so good just so I have my three
columns and the sizing is a little
better alright so for my body here what
do I want to do I want first we're going
to do a nice little display grid and
while I'm doing this what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna do it without the grid line
names first or at least I'll try to no
one actually when I do display grid just
run really quick thing you'll notice
that things change a little bit
so the collapsing margins don't collapse
anymore once things are in the grid a
little bit like flexbox in that sense so
what I'm yeah what I'm gonna do let's
set up my columns first so I'm gonna say
a grid Tim template columns and I want
one that's gonna be just one columns
yeah so I'm gonna do one fr so I'm gonna
put like just an empty space here on the
side that I don't want content always to
be in then I might have a main content
area in the middle that's sort of like
what you'd traditionally have as a
container and then my little empty space
on the side there so let's do an eighty
viewport width and then one fr and we
can close that down so you can see that
it's worked and things are automatically
coming in so here's my one fr so it's
taking up one just far if you're not
sure what that is it's one fraction so
it's one fraction of the remaining space
or the leftover space so this is taking
up eighty viewport width and it's stuck
at eighty viewport
with so there's 20 left 10 and 10 now if
I switch this over to a qu FR of the
remaining space now it it's also going
to work based on like the size of the
content but you can see here as this is
getting bigger this one now is a lot
bigger than that one so it won't shrink
thing well now it's getting a little
side-scrolling and stuff but at the
smallest sizes they might look the same
but as they get bigger you'll notice
that this one is taking at more space
because there's more available space for
it to take but in this case I want them
both to be the same so just one of our
80 viewport with one fr or the leftover
spaces now for my columns what I want to
do is I went into a grid template and up
my columns my rows I should say so I
wanted that big first area so I'm gonna
do a 50 viewport height I guess then I
want to do I want a little overlapping
section so I'm gonna do a 5m 5m you'll
see you'll see how this comes together
and if you have a little sketch of
things going into this it could really
help so I have 50 then a 5 a 5 and I
think I'm just going to do an auto you
can figure out the rest for me it's
pretty much what Auto means on that so
now when I want to start positioning
stuff if I was going the traditional way
what I'd have to do is figure out all my
line numbers and that can be a pain in
the butt so let's go find my body and
this is where anything that has a
display grid on it I can click on that
and it's gonna highlight the grid here
so we can see my grid coming up so the
way the numbering system works is like I
have line 1 line 2 line 3 line 4 and if
I'm going up and down I have line 1 line
2 line 3 line 4 so that's all good and
dandy so let's just say here I wanted my
so I have my section 1 here and let's
say I wanted to go from this side all
the way to that side what I could do so
let's go find section 1 here so what I
could say is a
grid column and I could start at line
one and then I do that and I say end at
line four and it's gonna take up that
whole space because it's starting at
line one it's going and ending at line
four if I did a one over three it would
instead end at the third line and one
thing you might forget always the first
line is always the very first line and
the last line is always the last one
it's not it's not zero one two three
it's literally one two three four so I
could do something like that and it's
gonna work
now for this one here now that's my
section two I want that one to be in
this area over here so if I go on this
section - I would say grid column and I
would say two over three and it would
fill up that space this is a really
simple layout and already I find that's
like weird right
I don't know and imagine if you had like
at twelve columns or something you'd
probably be like oh my goodness what's
going on it's gonna you know is this
three is it four is it twelve why do I
have I have twelve columns why is there
a thirteenth line it's crap like that so
I I do find it not necessarily the most
intuitive and we're gonna see that more
like up and down now I don't actually
want this place like this so I'm gonna
start naming them
that's this videos about naming them so
I just want this works and on a simple
layout you can definitely get away with
it but personally I just find it so much
easier to name our lines so let's go and
look at how we can do that right now and
I'm actually well we could we can name
all the lines so let's name all to name
a line you have to put it in square
brackets and you just put it before
right there so I'm actually going to
extend this out a little bit so we can
see what I'm doing so this will be
naming my first line now because it's in
square brackets if this was SAS it
wouldn't compile so I'm actually not
doing this this is all written in
vanilla CSS meant to say that the start
and I completely forgot so just note if
you are a big SAS fan for the moment we
won't be able to name lines I'm making a
sad face right now even though you can't
see it
which sort of stinks but we can still do
grid areas which is great and we'll be
seen that in the next video so let's
call this page start should I call it
page start yeah page starts fine then
I'm gonna have content start then I'm
gonna have so my first line here is my
page start and then I have one empty
space of when I far then I have my
content start and then I have an empty
space if not an empty space but I have a
space of 80 viewport width then I will
have a content end and then I will have
that empty and not an MP I keep seeing
empty space then I'll have a space of
one Fr and I will have my page end so
now instead of having to worry about
these numbers you just have to remember
what you called stuff so I can literally
now write page start over page and and
it's gonna look exactly the same and
just to show you if I did this to
content and it's gonna stop where I that
line right there so I don't want that to
be content and though I want this one to
go to page and and this one over here I
could change this to content start over
content and so I wanted to start at my
content start go to my content and that
is awesome so I love the fact that we
can do that now I'm also want to name my
rows over here so I'm gonna call this my
hero start so I'm starting my hero area
all the way at the top and again Lynam
one is this first one up here so I'm
doing a hero start then I'm going to
come down to this line and I'm going to
call this one my info start because
that's I have my little info boxes here
so I want this to start there now what I
can do which is fine because I'm gonna
have whoops now I have this 5m so what I
want this I want this
start here but I actually want my hero
area to end on this line so I'm going on
my 5m then I'll have my hero end then
I'll have another 5m and I'll have my
info end and then I can just call this
let's call it page bottom oh we can just
call it bottom it's not really page
bottom five paid or content bottom maybe
let's just call it bottom so again
that's if we look here hero start then
info start hero end info end and then we
have an auto that's gonna fill up once
our content actually is in there so
let's go take a look at how this is
gonna work and it's really I really like
how this works now so section 1 my grid
column is okay but now we want to change
my grid row so grid row goes from hero
start and it ends it hero end now my
section two is actually getting pushed
down but as soon as I do my grid row I'm
gonna do my info start over info and and
now it's overlapping like that so again
this is my hero start and this one down
here is my hero end and this is my info
start and my info end so this overlaps
on top of the other one I think that's
awesome I'm love the fact that we can do
that and then let's take my last one
here and my grid column on this one will
be my page start over page and so it
should fill up the whole space and then
my grid row will be it's going to start
at the hero end and go to bottom
now you'll notice that it's overlapping
on top of this one which is not what we
want obviously another thing is the auto
just takes the amount of space that it
needs so let's just make this a bit
bigger or well not gonna see it at all
padding 150 pixels zero just so there we
go so the auto is just it's it's taking
up the space that it needs to take up
there's no set width on it it's just
it's automatically adjusting to the
space that it needs to adjust you so
yeah this is going this one is going on
top of that one and that sucks that's
not what we want obviously I don't want
it to cover luckily when we're using
this stuff when we do have something in
the grid we can do is that index on it
so that index of let's just put 10 and
it will pop up and come on top of
everything else so that's really really
awesome and cool and I'm super happy
with that and we can actually let's why
is this here I want that to be down a
little more section one let's just do
and this is where I mentioned it in the
last video and I mention it again today
because ever Pete you always hear like
oh what's the point of flexbox the grid
is so much better the grid is a two
dimensional and is really really awesome
but flexbox still has a place so I can
do display flex on this and then just D
justify content center align items
Center except that should be that and
bang right in the middle
I'd have to play with that a little bit
actually and actually let's go back up
here maybe make this like 60% of eh
instead it's centering down to this
point so maybe it's not perfect for this
example but it's just to show you
flexbox still has a purpose
I used flexbox also to put three columns
here and we can fix one little more
thing on this actually because now that
it's taking up that much space this
looks really weird and that we have this
big empty space on the bottom but
luckily because it is using display flex
I can do in a line items Center
and it will Center it vertically in that
space as well and that just looks a lot
nicer right now so flexbox still has a
place and it's near and dear to my heart
but the grid does really cool stuff too
and now to finish this a video off one
thing that we can do now they were
they're supposed to implement a sub grid
or they weren't supposed to implement
they talked about implementing a sub
grid the sub grid never came it would
have been cool it might still be in the
future apparently they're arguing over
the best way to implement it but because
we don't have it now and sometimes it
would be really useful to have a sub
grid we can sort of cheat a little bit
well it's not really cheating it's just
the way we have to work until we have a
sub grid so my container here let's give
it a background of pink so we can see it
because I want this big content area I
don't necessarily think a light blue
would be the best background on it but
it's nice that we could have an area
with a different background color still
filling up something on here and then
having just the content held in the
middle in my content area so with a
container and remember my container is
inside of that last thing so my section
3 is taking up all this space and the my
container is living inside of there so
what I want to do is I want this to be
display grid that's awesome except the
only problem is right now I can't use
the other grid now this is where if I
did a display sub grid and the sub grid
worked I would have been able to use my
original line names and everything if I
just do a display grid I can't use my
original line names this is its own
distinct grid so it's not looking at the
existing lines if I come into here now
and go on my section 3 and come on my
container and we turn this grid on
you'll see there's no existing grid on
there right now so I can't use my grid
names at all and that sucks except I can
because I can say my grid template
columns are in err
because my grid template lines are
inherit hmm they're not showing here
grid template columns spell - right I'm
fairly certain oh you know why I did
that wrong guys I hope you were yelling
at me while I was doing this I don't
want my container to be a grid
I want my section three to be the grid
since kind of like a bit again so I'm
gonna do a display of grid on this one
so again let's go take a look
so we can see that there's the grid but
it's not it doesn't have any lines on it
and I sort of spoiled it now the grid
template columns inherit so it's
inheriting my grid template there we go
you can see it's actually working I have
the same ones so now my container I can
use my grid whoops grid column of
content start over content and and my
container now lives in the middle as
part of a grid inside of section 3 using
the same line names that I was using for
my big grid on top so it's not an
official sub grid but it's easy enough
we just need one extra line where we can
inherit and if you needed your rows as
well you could easily easily enough just
do and inherit on your rows and it would
work magically there as well and this
would this would actually work pretty
well because as I said more content goes
here this is set to auto so if we had
some lorem ipsum text that I just
happened to have stored away on the side
here so let's go and insert that in key
times to paste
paste and you know get your images and
this is just gonna keep drawing my grid
is just expanding along longer and
longer and longer so this could actually
work for like a full-on website and I
don't see any reason why not and there
we go I hope you liked the video if you
did please hit the thumbs up hit the
like button all of that other stuff
leave a comment down below let me know
you liked it if you have any questions
about the grid or you think I could have
done something differently in the last
video a few people gave me really good
suggestions on things I could have
actually done to make it easier so if
you have any better experience or more
experience with the grid let me know
about it and I'm building all of this up
to get to building a full-on website
using the grid yeah thanks a lot for
being here don't forget to subscribe if
you haven't already subscribed to bring
your new videos every single week and of
course until next time don't forget to
make your corner to the Internet just a
little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
