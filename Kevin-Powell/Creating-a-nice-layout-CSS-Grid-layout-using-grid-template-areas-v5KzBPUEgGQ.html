exploration of the CSS grid these videos
have just been insanely popular you guys
seem to have a huge appetite for it so
in this video I'm looking at grid
template areas as well as just the grid
template property just in case you're
new here my name is Kevin and I bring
you weekly videos on how to make the web
and how to make it look good while we're
at it so as I just said these videos
been crazy popular so I'm super excited
that you guys are as excited about the
grid as I am because I think this is
just fantastic
coming from a print background I can
actually start thinking about things a
bit more in a print way than I used to
be able to and I'm finding it a bit
difficult to change my mindset when I'm
building the websites still but it's
it's getting there and the the grid
template area is being able to really
lay things out exactly where you want
them is awesome and you name your areas
and then they just fall there it's
fantastic so as I mentioned I'm gonna be
looking at grid template areas but I'm
also going to look at the grid template
property so that one is a shorthand for
your grid template rows or grid template
columns and your grid template areas you
can combine it all into one property so
that's we're gonna do that on two
different things so I have a full web
site it's gonna be it's a wall it's a
simple layout but I'm gonna try and make
this one look a little bit prettier I
have a Photoshop file we're gonna follow
so I'm gonna do it for the whole site
we're gonna do a big layout and then I
have a little individual card element
and I'm gonna use the grid on that card
element as well and both of them will be
using areas on top of that another thing
that I'm gonna be looking at is the min
Max property so the min max what's not
really a property it's what you're using
when you're it's a value that you're
using for your grid and column sizes
it's pretty much like a max width and a
min width smushed together so you can
control your minimum and your maximum
size at the same time it has a few
limitations but it's super awesome once
you sort of get used to how it works so
we'll be using that a little bit for a
few of my columns as well so in this
week's video as I said we redoing our
grid template areas and here is the
layout that I'm gonna be trying to build
I have a little header at the top a big
area here a main area of here a sidebar
and then footer down at the bottom what
I've done with my layout is I have
broken it down so I've done a bit of an
overlay
here just to break down the different
areas since we're using grid template
areas and I'm also gonna use a grid
template areas on my card here as well
so I've broken that down as a separate
little element that is threw off to the
side so I wouldn't have overlays on top
of other overlays now let's go jump over
to code pen and we can see what we're
gonna do over there so here on this
document what I've done is I've already
gone ahead and done my HTML so I have
the mark-up done but just to explain it
a little bit I have my header right here
so that's that black bar that went
across the top that has an h1 in there I
have a hero div here which is gonna be
that big one that had the yellow
background on it so in there I have a
title and we'll just an h1 in a
paragraph so that's my h1 here my
paragraph right there then I have my
main area so in my main I have an h1 for
the title and then I did my div class of
card so my div class of card here let's
just make this a little bit bigger my
div class of card has an image in it now
that image does have a class on there
let's go find it I just called it card
IMG I have an h2 which is my card title
and then I have a div for my card
content just because I have a paragraph
as well as a link and maybe you want
more multiple paragraphs so I want to be
able to contain all of that in one thing
so I did div for my card there I have an
aside just for my little sidebar there
that just has an h1 and a paragraph in
it and then my very simple footer now
I'm going to be using sass for this or a
CSS with the S CSS syntax and so I
brought it in a Google font I've are 2
google fonts actually I've set up a
whole bunch of variables here and a
couple of mix-ins just to make my life a
little bit easier and I'm not going to
go into details with these but if you
want to see them and see how I've set
them all up go to the code pen the link
for that is down in the description
below and you can check them out a
little bit more as far as the styles
themselves all I've done is a very basic
style here on my body so and it's not
really doing very much and we want to
make that doing a lot more now for this
because it's my entire page that I'm
doing in this I'm gonna put the grid on
the body itself so we're gonna just come
down here and do a display
grid and you can see nothing very much
changes if I undo that just really
quickly things will get a little bit
closer together let's just take that off
completely and then when I put it back
hope you're going the wrong way okay
I'll just type it back out display grid
things spaced out a little bit more and
it's because when you have display grid
there's the collapsing margins don't
collapse anymore so that is important to
know now I want to set up my grid
template rows and my grid template
columns and then we're gonna bring in
the grid areas from there so what I'm
gonna do is let's set up my rows per so
I'm gonna do a grid template rows so I'm
thinking for that top bit let's go look
at Photoshop really fast and as you mad
a little bit on this so for my Photoshop
file here I'm gonna have a set height on
that I'm gonna have this be like sort of
maybe 50% of the screen this is a
general content area so I just want it
to fill in as I go so I might have more
content later on so we're going to put
that height to auto for this row here
and then these two actually will be
exactly the same as one another so for
the rows here I'm thinking of 10m for
the height maybe yeah I said about 50%
so 50 viewport height and auto and again
Auto will grow and shrink along with it
and then another 10 M so this is Auto
just means take as much space as you
need depending on the content that is
inside of it then for my columns grid
template columns we can set this up and
I'm gonna do we're gonna start off with
one thing and then we're gonna come back
and modify this a little bit because I
do want to look at musing min max for
these as well but for now I'm going to
do a 1fr so this is just one empty space
then I'm going to look at trying to
think my main content area I'm just
trying to break this into like fractions
here so 5 to 1 so this is just how much
of the available space do I use so my
main content area
using a five units two units and then
one on one down the side so if we're
looking at my Photoshop file that would
be these are the one and one on the
sides and then this area would be about
five and that areas about to I could be
more precise with this but I think that
should work for this demo and as I said
I'm gonna put some min/max values on
both of these later on we're gonna look
at that as well but let's get the layout
going together before we get into that
now where this gets really powerful is
where we bring in our grid our grid
template areas so what I want to do is
my grid template areas now this is where
it gets super easy so we looked at line
names before but now what I can do is I
can just say what I want so I'm looking
across here so across the top I have my
four columns so I want all four of those
columns to be my header at the beginning
so I can just write in header header
header header and now that whole first
column I know not my first column sorry
my whole first row is all going to be
header it's gonna use up all those
spaces so that's cool
now I could just keep typing across here
and then well when you close that and
then do another one and then another one
beause that you know go across but that
becomes really hard to read so I'm just
gonna push return and now I'm going to
do my second one so my second one was my
big hero area so I also want that one to
go across I'm a new hero hero hero hero
now we're getting into the main content
area so I have a few different things I
have here so where the header one here
is my first row then the hero here is my
second row now we're going into this
Auto one but I want the first one and
the last one to be empty so to make
something empty you just put a period I
mean your period I'm gonna say this is
my main area I'm gonna say this is the
sidebar and another period so the first
row of 10 M not 10 M sorry the first
column of 1fr here is going to be empty
then I'm in my main content area using
this 5fr then I'm going to have my
sidebar using the 2fr and then I'm
I have that last one at their area empty
and then for my footer just for them
again footer footer or footer footer and
that's it it's really really awesome and
it is that simple so next what I want to
do is I want to start placing everything
on there so this is where it gets really
really easy to do so let's start with my
header and we'll work our way down so my
header my grid area is header and we
should see that all of a sudden push
everything down cool right so then I
have my hero area so my hero it's grid
area oops
area is and boom everything else you get
to move down now let's go to the next
one I have my main so my main the grid
area is main bang and last but not least
and I'm out last of all as we have a few
we have a side so the grid grid area on
that one is my sidebar and last but not
least my footer the grid area is footer
and there we go so I have my my header
going across the top
my hero area here an empty space my main
content area my sidebar and then my main
footer down at the end there so let's
just make this look a little bit nicer
so we can actually you know it we want
this to look decent so here my header my
header in the footer will look identical
so I'm just gonna do a header footer
they're both gonna have a background
that is black they're both going to have
a font color that is yellow let's just
scroll up so we can actually see that so
that's looking okay I want to Center the
text in there so I'm just going to do it
a display flex and then do a just defy
content
of center and a line items center so
that should bang it right in the center
it's doing just that so that is perfecto
I also have my header title and my
footer title which look identical so
maybe I shouldn't have made two classes
for them but too late now
if somebody used my mix in for that move
this a little so I can do may include
I'm calling this one font alt so it's my
alternate font my main font is a
Merriweather here and then my alt font
is six caps and my alt font what am I
gonna actually if I don't do anything it
should come in oh it's because the
default color is black that's why we
don't see it so let's change the color
to yellow and then we should see it cool
and the font whoops the font size should
be I'm trying to remember my I'm trying
to remember my variable names here my
font size font size so it's my font size
font size and I don't remember whose h1
or h2 that looks too big huge - that
looks better okay so that's in there and
we should also see that going across the
bottom awesome so that's that that's
done so we can move on to my hero now so
for my hero let's just move it up here a
little bit we can give that a background
background is URL and so I do have this
URL right here I'm just gonna paste it
in it's hosted up on code pen so that
will be my background image and this one
is also gonna be pretty nice and simple
to set up display flex and again I like
showing whoops I forgot my semicolon at
the end of my background there I like
showing that flex still has a place to
live but you're probably sick of hearing
you say that by now display flex I want
to change my flex direction to make it a
column so the things don't stack on top
of your next to each other like that I
want them on top
items center justify content Center and
that should plop it right in the middle
my hero title so hero title let's do my
ad include on there so on this one I'm
also using my font alt so that you can
see that clipped in right away but I
need to give this a different font size
so my font size I have an extra large
for this one so I'm sure I haven't h1
font size and I don't think I've
actually used it in here that's okay so
extra large and that is perfecto
I think that's good margin:0 there's a
lot of space there margin of 0 and I
also have my hero subtitle subtitle so
my hero subtitle is in @include and this
one I called my font base because it's
my base font style won't change right
away but I have a few little things I
want to change on this so I want the
color I want the color to be white and I
want the font side looks the font size
to be font size probably the h2 again it
looks alright and padding enough padding
margin of 0 I'm just going to leave that
there for one second let's go look at
the Photoshop design looks a little bit
big but they both look kind of big let's
zoom back in I chant grid areas pretty
right there yeah that's good enough I'm
happy with that
so now we can get down on to the main
here and my sidebar the main I don't
think I have anything left to do on that
actually the sidebar we're going to set
our background color on there so I have
a background of Dark Reign you might say
it doesn't look very dark but whoops I
spelled with an A and some padding on
there would be good padding
hope I spelled it right 1.5 m
what do you yeah I called it dark red
because it's the dark one I have some
text it's a lighter color and we'll get
there when we do our card I think I can
do my card now actually so let's get
into the card in another card I'm also
gonna be using grid areas on and it's
I'm going to show you something it's a
bit different because here my grid area
is always just go like all the way
across all the way across all the way
across
well not sorry they use yeah I sort of
you know it's sort of broken off and
each row is broken into it but we can
have grid areas that also go up and down
so for my card um and I actually will do
two things when I do this card I'm going
to show you two different ways of doing
it when it's a little bit faster than
another one so with this let's get into
it for my card so to begin with we have
to do a card let's put a little cards
okay so for my card I want to do what I
want it to be a display grid so I'm
gonna do it the same way I did before
grid template columns
I've I'm gonna have to write I think
let's go look this is why I had this so
yeah I have one column here and then one
big column on the side and you can see
this area before I had like grid areas I
was breaking my gritty areas up the
thing across this time I'm breaking the
grid areas up up and down a little bit
differently so I just want to show you
know this is spanning two different rows
whereas on this one nothing spans two
different rows so I I want to show you
how that works so grid template columns
I have a one fr3 FR maybe will work I
hope so and for my grid template rows
I'm gonna do something also a little bit
different on this because I don't want
my first one to be very big right
I want it to be as small as the title I
want to make sure it's not bigger than
the title itself because if we come back
to here if it's bigger than the title
it's gonna cause some weird issues like
this space here will just be some
padding on it but I really want this to
be the small as possible this the top
row should be tiny tiny tiny so what I
can do for that is its main content so
it's gonna be as small as possible to
fit the content in my first row and then
my second row I can just do an auto on
it I could probably do auto auto - to be
completely honest I find with my
experience main content and auto often
work exactly the same I don't have tons
of experience with this but from there's
probably some subtle differences between
the two but for most of my experience
they do but so now what I could do is my
grid template areas and so my first
again I'm going across so I have a one
fr and a three fr so I want my image and
then I want my title next to it but then
what I want to do is I also want my
image on the second row and I want my
content next to that so I can have my
image so by doing image and then image I
can have the image part go to down and
yeah I think it's gonna work out nicely
so let's do my card image and I'm
actually going to just to do this let's
give them all background color so it's
this background of pink so we can
actually see exactly what's happening
background of pink I have my card
title card with a D card title with a
background will you let a light blue and
last but not least we'll do my card our
card image won't get a pink background
though cuz it's the image itself
oh well that's my card card card card
content we can see these other two at
least a card content will be a
background
I don't like green so at least we can
see them okay
so right now it's looking like this so
my card image I want this grid area to
be my IMG and right away it pretty much
fixes itself
I want my card title the grid area is
going to be title and I don't think
anything is actually in the change now
with these ones because they're fitting
in the only space they could grid area
of content content content here we go so
this image would be reaching down to fit
both of those so if it wasn't a square
image it would have the room to move up
and down which is cool so we get rid of
those backgrounds I guess we really need
those but we can see that it is working
what else do I need I need to do a few
more things to make this card work
actually before I do those few other
things I mentioned that we don't have to
write it out this way necessarily so
there is another way of writing out your
template areas so instead of writing it
out this way with all three of these
there is a shorthand and the shorthand
for this is just grid template so if I
just do a grid template like this what I
can do is I sort of break it apart I'm
actually gonna bring that back so I'm
not gonna forget I have a min content
and an auto and let's just comment these
out so I don't forget what the values I
put on them are so I can do a grid
template and I love how this works
so grid template so I'm just gonna you
don't have to put the space here it just
makes it easier for me so I'm gonna do
my first one so I have an image and my
title and then I can say what I want
that row to be so that row was a min
content no thing just I can just put a
new line so my image so this row is
gonna be an image and then a title and
it's gonna be a min content then my next
one is also going to be an image and
next to it is the content and that one
will be an auto and again it's say I had
a footer for my cards too I could also
do something like footer footer
and then that could be set to whatever I
need it to be but in this case I don't
need that but what is you notice this is
sitting at my rose but it's not setting
at my columns so then to set up my
columns I just do a - like this and then
I can put my columns so when fr3 fr and
you can see it's working and say this
was like a five it should you see its
switching a little bit or let's just
make this like a hundred pixels so you
can really just see it is working it's
shrinking down to a hundred pixels there
I'm going to leave this at three F R
though so the the grid template is the
shorthand for doing everything you can
give it the area names the rows and the
columns and it works really nice and its
really nice to visualize so why don't we
refract or other one that's up here too
and so I'll just put a space so header
header header header that's over 10m
I'll just comment these out because it's
gonna screw everything up so that's over
ten M then this is over fifty viewport
width this is an auto this is another
ten M and all of that is now I can put
my columns so just keep it on the screen
oops I don't want that I want to do it
10 here so 10 M and to keep it on the
screen I can do it over here
one fr5 f R 2 R 1 F R I believe that
should work do I not
header header header oh grid template
not areas anymore
there we go and it's working and I think
this can go on its online right yeah
perfect dope so there we go so the this
might even be easier to deal with than
doing it sort of the the longhand way
this grid template short way header all
the way across you're taking up 10m
height here all across you're taking up
a height of 50 viewport width empty
space main content sidebar empty space
you're Auto because I want you to grow
and shrink with the content and then a
footer all the way across using ten and
then what are they going across well
it's a 1 a 5 a 2 and a 1 so this like
all of this goes or all of those go over
a 1 fr these are all going over the 5
the 2 and then those last ones are all
with of one fr so that's cool it's a
nice easy way to write stuff out let's
finish up my card here and before this
video gets too long so for my card let's
just make it look pretty at this point
and I want to show you also how the auto
works so when we add more content you'll
see that it can that it can grow I also
haven't said any gaps up and stuff I
think maybe I should have four here but
let's see so my card that's looking
alright so what do I need to do here
let's give this a box shadow because I
do have a drop shadow on it 0 0 1 M rgba
0 0 0 0 point 5 that looks decent yeah
so here you can see that it is getting
stuck to there so let's go back and add
a grid gap to here so my where's my
here's all my stuff so here I'm gonna
add a grid column gap of I don't know
1.5 m now it's important that I'm doing
this as a column gap because we can do a
grid gap and it's just going to do the
columns and everything but then I'm
going to get spacing between everything
is it's going to put spaces between my
rows and it's going to put spaces
between my columns so I don't want a
grid gap I want
grid column gap and you can also do a
grid row gap if you want to just control
your rows or if you want them to be
different so that just gives me my space
here which and that looks perfecto so
I'm happy with that I want to let's go
back to my card I don't want my image
getting stuck on the side there so let's
give myself some padding on here
padding:1em should use them at 1.5
because I'm using that everywhere that
would look better so that's looking
pretty good my card I want this image
people to grow and shrink so let's just
make sure this has a max width on it of
100% I should probably put a gap on
these as well right so a card lets us
keep all of this together grid column
gap will stick with money so I can make
too big that should be okay I'm gonna
get rid of the space on top I can get
rid of that space that's on my card
title margin of 0 that will stick to the
top better good mmm is there anything
else that I need to do I don't think did
I let's go look here quickly
these weren't bold so let's take the
bold off of that font weight is 300
probably make the font a little bit
bigger but I'm not gonna get into that
now I can't make the link look nicer and
I do want to let's look at how this is
gonna work because at one point things
are gonna get ugly we don't like my
image is gonna literally disappear
because there's no space for it the max
content the max width on this is 100% so
even though this is you you know I have
a 1 fr here but that one fr is gonna
shrink to nothing because there's no
available space cuz the text here like
this this can't get any smaller so it's
just gonna shrink away to nothing the fr
is not like representative of how much
room it's taking it's if there is
available room how much room do I take
of the available space so if there's no
available space that image can shrink
away to 0 which we don't really want to
so we want a lot and even that sidebar
is getting really really narrow so we
want to stop that from happening
and I'm thinking I was gonna use the
min/max
on my I'm just gonna stop that like this
5fr thing I'm gonna stop it from getting
smaller so let's go find that again so
here I have a 1 F are my 5 f are my qu f
are now that's on big like when we start
getting bigger and it's growing but
that's fine um that will work it well
I'm wondering this probably could get
too big that way but that's okay let's
see but I do want to stop this area from
getting too small
yeah from getting too small so if I want
to stop that area from getting too small
what can I do I can do the min max now
min max it's taking me a while to really
grasp the proper way to use it and I
still feel like I'm struggling a little
bit sometimes so what I'm going to do
though
we'll do a min max on this now it can be
really tempting to say something like 1
F air 5fr there comma-separated so 5 by
far if you've never seen the min max
thing you can see this isn't working
because this isn't valid I want this to
be like let's just say 10 pixels for now
so it's valid so this is sort of like
setting a min width and a max width at
the same time you've probably used your
min width at times or a max max width at
times so the min max for the grid it's
you're studying both the minimum and the
maximum at the same time the important
thing is the minimum has to be you can
use em schrems things like that but it
can't use the fre unit it can't use I
don't know if I could use a percentage
or not say I do like 5 percent that work
maybe yeah it seems to be working so I
guess you can put a percentage but it
can't be like abstract II sort of things
like FRS it needs to be a something that
gives it like a specific
value the other thing is obviously the
minimum needs to be smaller than the
maximum or it just ignores one of the
values I forget which one so in this
case my biggest that I wanted to get so
it just at one point will hit five but
my minimum value let's try 25mm and
let's just see where that stops that
there we go
so that's too small but you can see now
what's happening is when it gets to the
width of 25m it just stops and it stops
getting smaller and it can't get smaller
than that so now and this one is also
stopped shrinking but I think it's
there's probably a line of text here
that can't get any smaller
because my two side bar is like you can
see this area here is getting smaller in
this area is getting smaller so those 1f
RS are still disappearing until at one
point I do get a vertical scrollbar so
let's change this up a little bit bigger
30 so it's gonna look like that which is
pretty cool maybe it's getting too wide
but and then it's gonna shrink and then
it's gonna eventually lock into place
that's still pretty big though I like no
it's not terrible it's a bit of a
squared off card but it really depends
on the content that's inside of it as
well but I think what I also want to do
is give this a min/max because I don't
want that getting like that narrow that
doesn't look so good
so let's give that one a min/max as well
so I'm just saying if that's 30 let's do
a min max like half of that so half of
that would be 15 and my big was 2 and
don't forget to come a separate them
because I always forget to come and
separate them so let's go see how this
is gonna look so that looks pretty good
this is gonna go it's gonna start
smashing and then you can see that this
they both no see right around here the
sidebar is gonna stop getting smaller
right there my sidebar stops getting
smaller and the other ones still
shrinking is still shrinking and then
all of a sudden that gets smaller so
that locks now I still have my fruit my
Fr my one
far on this side my 1fr on that side so
they're still shrinking away and then
eventually we get the scrollbar and a
few people have asked me about that I'm
not going to be doing it responsive in
this case but you just build in some
media queries and rearrange stuff and
it's pretty straightforward I am going
to be building a full site or a full
page anyway using this so I will be
using media queries in that one but I
just don't want these I want to try and
focus on a couple of things in these
videos and the media queries will come
when we look at a larger project so
that's looking pretty good let's just
fix my link because I want my link to
look good on this one
saying I don't want to waste time on
stuff and then I have I'm wasting time
on this color was yellow and my font
size on it was a little bit bigger so
I'll do like a 1.1 in just a bumper up a
touch and that looks fine and I could do
a hover and stuff but again not trying
not to waste too much time so I'm happy
with that let's add some more cards in
here just so we can see what I was
talking about so there's one card copy
paste paste paste paste and there's
multiple there's sort of stuck together
there a card card card margin-bottom 1.5
m and I'm using 1.5 m everywhere so that
probably should have been a variable as
well but c'est la vie so now you can see
that they all go and this whole area
just sort of stretched down and if I
paste more of those in here paste whoops
paste paste paste paste it's because
this row is set to auto it can just grow
forever and forever and forever and the
footer will always just sit down at the
bottom so that auto thing can be really
nice because it just fits the content
that you need to fit in there so that
obviously makes life a lot easier and I
do believe that is it I'm pretty happy
with this so once again this is
available on code pen you can come and
play with it I'm going to delete a few
of these cards because we don't need 8
million of them and there
oh there's the grid areas I really like
how they work I hope you like that as
much as I did there it was a lot of fun
to build that and it makes it I just
find it makes it super intuitive to make
a layout like this it really makes my
