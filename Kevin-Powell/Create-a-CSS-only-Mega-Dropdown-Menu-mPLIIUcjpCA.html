how to make a mega menu and what is a
mega menu it is these giant dropdowns
that you get on all of these sites a lot
of sites are using them these are some
big brands I'm looking at now they
sometimes have pictures in them like
this sometimes it's just links like that
it's these big menus that have sort of
these subcategories in them that you can
then go around and choose extra stuff
instead of just a regular simple
drop-down menu or even just a you know a
regular menu across the top so if you go
online I'm sure you've run into things
like this so we're going to be taking a
look at how to actually build one of
them so stick around and you'll see how
to do just that and just a really quick
shout out before we get started I just
want to say thank you so much all the
new subscribers my channel started slow
I've been doing pretty much nothing to
promote it it's just been growing on its
own and you know it's been slow and
steady and I've just had a whole bunch
of people subscribed recently and it's
sort of blowing my mind so thank you so
so much for subscribing I really
appreciate it if you aren't subscribed
of course hit the subscribe button new
video every Wednesday about learning
code and all of that but that's enough
of that you guys want to learn how to
make a mega menu so let's go and look at
how to do that so what I've done now is
I've set up a basic menu I'm assuming if
you're looking at making this crazy big
menu you know how to do these a nice
basic menu like this if you're not too
sure but what I've done so far do check
out my video on how to create a menu
with an awesome hover effect on it and
once you're done with that come back
over here so as you can see I have this
nice simple one I have a little hover
effect on there I'll have to change the
color because I can't see my text but I
have a very simple one I have a
navigation inside my navigation I have a
container inside my container aul which
I've named a main menu our menu main I
should say and we'll see why once we
start making some more interesting
things with this and then I've put in a
few list items here that are links that
I've just called tab 1 2 4 since I don't
have any real content to be putting in
there for the CSS I've imported my
Google font here
I've so far done my box-sizing on there
to make padding a little bit easier to
deal with I've set up some basics on my
body I've switched I've switched I've
created my container just to make it
work and a bit more relevant to what
we're actually doing I've styled my nav
the nav itself has pretty basic styling
I have a white background on it and a
very subtle drop shadow for the UL I've
given it a margin and a padding of zero
and the list style of none like we
normally would and I've also thrown a
position relative on here which is going
to come back and help us a lot later on
and I'll mention that when we get there
I've made my L eyes a
display:inline-block so just so they'd
go one next to each other you can also
do that with a float I tend to use
inline block because that way I can
still see use text-align:center on here
text-align:center if I need a centered
one instead of left or right which you
can't do a float but if you're more
comfortable using floats by all means go
for it and here I've just styled my my
nav a so I've given it the color of my
colors some padding on there to give it
the size and I've created here my hover
effect which I also will need to change
the nav a oops
however color to my white so we can
actually see it when I'm hovering on top
that looks a little bit nicer there is a
reason that I have this on my list item
the background color and again just like
this position:relative will jump it will
see that when it comes up which will be
very soon actually so right now I just
this is a nice normal navigation I can
click on one of these make it just work
like normal but I want to make it a mega
menu so the first thing we need to do to
actually make this a mega menu is we
need to build the sub menu and the sub
menu will go inside of each of these
list items so I'm just going to build it
on this first one too
begin with and then we're going to come
back and build it you know just
incorporate it into these other tabs as
we once we finished the first one and
it's all styled and looking good so I'm
just going to push this on its own a
little bit so we can see that you know
folk make it easier for you guys to
focus what I'm doing normally I wouldn't
create all this empty extra space so
what I want to do now is inside this
list item I want to create a div so I'm
going to get a div class and I'm going
to call it a menu sub and I'm going to
close that div the way I'm doing this is
I have my main menu and then I have my
sub menu but I'm starting everything
with menu just so in my CSS I can be
nice and consistent and I can know
exactly what's going on and I'm making
this a nice big div and inside of this
div I'm going to come around and I'm
going to add some things in there and
it's mostly going to be a whole bunch
more links so I have a list pre-built
whoops my spacings a little off so I
have this ready to go already just to
speed things up and a whole bunch of
links to throw in there so let's just
save that and see what happens when I
hover of course once you have all your
list item set up don't forget because I
was pasting it in from something I
already did I forgot to include my UL so
we have an unordered list again and then
my honored list has all of these it's
not better yet but what I'm going to do
now which should fix it is choosing my
menu sub and setting this up to be a
position:absolute and there we go so I
have my tab one two three four and then
underneath that I get these links that
are right there and this is where my
position:relative is coming in on the UL
so this app there being positioned
relative to my UL if I didn't have that
on actually I don't think a big change
will happen right now yeah I didn't
think so but this will come back very
soon to help us out
okay so with that position being
absolute the other thing I want to do
here is give it a background of four
four four so we can sort of see it and I
also want to give it a width of 100% and
now this is where that 100% will make it
100% of the UL so it's going to match
the size of my UL and stop at that total
size so if you don't want it to actually
be that big you could say eighty percent
or fifty percent or whatever you want so
when I hover over you can see those all
up here and it's working nicely and of
course normally I'd also want to do a
display:none so it disappears so when I
hover over I and then I have to fix that
so now when I hover over I need that
display going from none I needed to
actually show up okay so then what I
need to do let's just scroll down a
little bit to move it up for you guys
I'm going to say my nav Li hover
so when I hover on top of a list item I
want my menu sub to display block so we
can see right there it worked I hover on
top and then the display mode of that
changes from none to block and I get a
nice simple drop-down now if you just
want to build a nice simple CSS only
drop-down this would be all you'd have
to do and the last thing we would need
actually for a nice simple one is a nav
menu sub Li display block just to reset
them so they're not in line block and
then they stack up like that and then
you'd have a nice simple CSS only drop
down we want it to be a little fancier
though right we need a mega menu we need
lots of stuff in there different
categories some columns and all of that
good stuff so there's a little bit more
work to be done yet
so the first thing that I'm going to do
is I want to bring in some categories
in here because usually we have a lot of
categories so h3 will be my cat - Gauri
clothes h3 and let's just take a look at
that and we can see that's working cool
menu sub we should just change my menu
sub color to white as well
color FFF there we go
the other thing these list items will
have a padding of 0 there's it the links
that have the padding oh it's the links
that have the padding my menu sub links
will have a padding:0 and right now this
is kind of annoying that I have to keep
hovering on top so what I'm going to do
is do an inspect element on there I'm
going to go to my li because it's the
hover state of my li I'm going to go
over here to hover and I'm in Chrome
it's a little bit different in the other
ones and just click hover so it's
permanently hovered so if I change my
HTML and when this refreshes I'll lose
it but as long as I'm only changing my
CSS it doesn't actually change the Dom
over here so I keep everything and it
just makes it a much easier to work so
that looks okay a little bit of styling
that I want to do yet let's just think
for a second I'm going to have a lot of
these categories let's just take this
whole thing here copy and paste another
one in so we have just two sets and you
can see it reset I just click on hover
and it comes right back and we'll go
back to my CSS so I have that now it's
not looking super nice so what I'm going
to start with is some padding of 2m on
there just - there we go right away that
looks a lot nicer now for visual
hierarchy reasons it's really kind of
weird looking right now the spacing is
just way off as far as I'm concerned so
what I want to do is come in and say my
menu I forgot what I called it oh I
didn't call it anything it's just an h3
I'm going to give this a class of menu
cat to Gauri
we're going to copy that whole thing and
paste down here as well
and we're going to say menu cat to Gauri
Marg in top of my sister with margin so
I want more margin top and probably a
lot less bottom so margin top will be
say 2.5 m left and right zero and I
bought a margin of maybe point it's just
to zero and see what happens
it's better but I need some on the
bottom point five
mmm what happened why is it not working
all this in oh whoops
0.5 M yeah there we go okay so I have
this I don't want that space up here
though I only want the space here let's
just yeah I don't want any space up
there so what I'm going to do then is
say a menu cat to Gauri
whoops I forgot the period menu category
first of type margin top of zero so the
first one will always have a margin top
of zero but all the other ones will keep
this margin and it will space out nicely
I put my padding at zero for those I'm
going to add in some margin let's just
say margin bottom of 0.25 M just to
create a little bit of spacing between
them three five
like that and I do want them to also
have a hover effect so menu sub a:hover
let's do a text in a simple
text-decoration:underline so when I
hover on top I get this little underline
going on I think that looks fine it's
nice and simple it that's all we need
cool so we have that now the main issue
right now is if I keep adding more
they're just gonna keep going underneath
and underneath and underneath so I have
my submenu which is nice and then I have
my categories but if I really want this
to work I have to build a column system
into my menu so inside of my sub menu
I'm going to come in here and add a div
class is equal to menu column just call
it menu column I think I'm a let's go
with a menu column one actually because
I think we're going to do you know a
couple of different ones and I'm going
to divide this up into four parts so the
one will be one-fourth of my menu so
we're opening that there and we're going
to close div here so nothing really
should happen right now I just have it
just like that but what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take this menu column
one that's not the right one yeah and
I'll copy that whole thing and I'm going
to paste it one two three more times so
right now it's going to look terrible
it's just going to stretch down and I
have to scroll down to see everything so
we need to make my menu system work my
column system work not my menu system my
column system so we're going to come
down here and do a menu let's move that
up menu column one
and I mentioned we're going to have four
so we might as well do it properly from
the beginning menu column to menu column
three and a menu column four I don't
know if I'm going to use all of these in
the demo but it's good to set them up
properly so all of them will be a float
left and float left I'm not sure if I
need anything else for the time being
and then my menu column one will also be
due to do a width of 25% nice thing with
a column system of four is that it's
really simple to use and there you go
wow isn't that look great and it's super
nice and you know it didn't take that
much time to actually set up and I have
all my links in here and I can go
through obviously it's all very
standardized right now but you can come
in and just for fun to show you if one
of these only had two items in it and
then I copied this whole thing copy and
paste save that you know extra
categories in this one or less
categories in another one or anything
like that and you can get tons and tons
of stuff into there and it looks really
really nice and I'm pretty happy with
that actually and the fun thing with
this is it's using CSS only so just to
go over one thing a few things that I
did here that are really important is
remember I said that I put my background
color on the list item instead of on my
link hover so just to show you why if I
put this on my link cover instead when I
first hover over its going to look
exactly the same but when I go off my
link then that color is going to
disappear and that's a problem so what
then when I'm coming through here you
know this is working the same way but
I'm not hovering on top of my link
anymore whereas when this is my list
item as long as I'm inside of this area
this is all part of this list item so
this hover
is still working while I'm in here which
is one of the ways we can do this with
CSS only so that's really really
important that we do with that now on
the tab to just to create something that
looks a little bit different let's go
and grab this whole submenu it's really
long
copy that whole thing let's throw that
on my tab tube so I'm going to go inside
my list item just like I did before and
paste that whole thing in there but just
for fun let's change a little bit of
what we have here let's come and make
this one a column - instead of a column
one just to show you a little bit of
what we could do so there it's a width
of that if I do a menu call - then my
width would be 50% so if I go in the two
at whoop oh and I just saw a problem
right now things are shifting around so
this one's working great but when I go
in there I don't want the edge of this
matching here I want the edge of it to
stay in this I want it to be exactly
where this this one is you keep pointing
at the screen but you can't see me doing
that so yeah when I hover on top of this
one it should be lined up exactly like
this one is which is nice and easy to
fix luckily we just have to find where
right here my menu sub so I've already
positioned it absolute and it's relative
to my UL so all I need to do is on that
one now change
I'll keep it up here the left to zero
and I'm going to save that and now you
can see that it's always lining up with
the left but you can see that it's still
lining up in the same place because
we've told it that the left has to be
zero and its relative to my UL so it's
staying in the exact same place all the
time the little jump you do see is from
a scrollbar
disappearing and reappearing right now
so we can quickly quickly fix that just
by taking off
why is that one so long why do I have so
much there one two three four
I screwed stuff up I have too many I
added a column to which is taking up 50%
but I never got rid of one of my column
ones don't have room for all that so
there you go
just to show you now this isn't you know
I'm running into empty space now because
this contents not big enough but it's
just to show you that you know I could
put paragraphs in there or longer text
and it would fill up that space no
problemo
so once you've created it once it's just
a simple column system if you're making
something like this I'm sure you used a
column system you can even use bootstrap
or something else like that to help you
create this I don't think that would be
a problem at all and it then just comes
down to styling and making it look good
which is probably the hardest part of
all of this there's a few little tricks
along the way and this is the CSS only
way of doing it so I really hope you
