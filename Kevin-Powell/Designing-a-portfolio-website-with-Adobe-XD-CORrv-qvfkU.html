video where we're doing something a
little bit different than we usually do
because I'm going to be designing a
website using Adobe XD if you're new
here and you might because this one is
different from my my other videos my
name is Kevin and I teach you how to
build the web and how to make it look
good while you're at it I mean your
weekly tutorials where we're learning
how to build the web but this week is a
bit of a departure because I'm designing
something too so you might have stumbled
across my channel because it's designed
instead of coding I will be doing these
from time to time but my main focus of
this channel is the code side of stuff
boom
design is important too so I wanted to
talk about it with this video all right
so I'm really excited about this I've
had a fair amount of people asking about
design stuff in general so what I wanted
to do with this is I had to design
something anyway for this series so this
series is going to be first the design
and the raining event is building and
coding the web site using the CSS grid
because that had so many people asking
about the design side of things I
thought that it would be useful to make
a couple of videos looking at how I
approach the design process and actually
designing and designing the site I also
chose to Dobie XD just because I want to
learn it I mentioned a while back that
I'm not super happy with XT and it's
still not perfect and people gave some
awesome suggestions for other software
thank you so much for those suggestions
I just haven't had a chance to play with
them at all where's at least them
somewhat familiar with XD so I decided
to stick with that now it doesn't mean I
won't look at some other software we can
use in other videos down the line
so what are we designing what we're
designing a portfolio page this is sort
of a generic portfolio that you could
use if you want to reinstate ideas from
if you want to if you me a single page
designed by the portfolio items when we
click them will have a modal that pops
up with a whole bunch of extra
information in there this video is the
design of the main page and only for
mobile display so I'm doing mobile first
we're going to design the whole thing
then in the next video I'm going to
probably be looking at doing the
interactive elements so what happens
when we click on our hamburger menu what
happens when we click on a portfolio
item what's the modal that we see and
any other interactivity that I might
have and then in the last video were
will take all of that and make
you know stretch it out so it works on a
large screen as well and ported over to
the large screen so I'm really happy to
be to be doing this I want a lot of
feedback on it do you like it do you not
like it I just want your feedback so if
you do watch the video please leave a
comment down below and let me know what
you thought of it I really really
appreciate it and with all that out of
the way let's start designing our
website all right so this is one of the
sites I love I find coming up with color
schemes is a pain in the butt so this
one's really cool it's called coolers
you get on here and all you have to do
is click start the generator they do
have a Chrome extension as well and a
app and an Adobe add-on so I'm gonna hit
start the generator just to show you
what it is in the design I'm going to be
doing for this one I think I'm gonna go
with in a simple color palette but you
can see it gives me a bunch of colors
but if I just have to push spacebar and
it's gonna give me new colors and I sort
of like this actually um I wanted I'm
gonna Lock this one and this one but
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come on
this adjust and I'm gonna modify this
one a little bit it's make that a bit
darker and bring it this way into the
blues a little more sort of want a bluey
design and thing my primary color and
this one we blue those are locked in
place now so any time I hit spacebar
it's gonna look for colors that sort of
go with these two there we go
so I can get ones this is you can see
here I can use one of those maybe as an
accent color I think I'm going to lock
you in place too and I think I'm just
gonna go with something in that range
I'm gonna leave that up in here for now
actually another site that I love and
this one's cool too because it does
offer color inspiration but it's also
for typography inspiration so it's web
font combinations and as image and
there's color palettes so it's really
cool type spiration you can sign up get
new stuff in your inbox if you like that
but I just come and visit it myself so
it usually comes with four colors and
there's a lot of options and they're all
using google fonts so it's really cool
and it's a nice thing a bit of a lock up
with the type and everything it has the
font sizes set up and all of that I
actually used one of these in my grid
areas demo when we looked at the grid
areas I used this one with six caps and
Merriwether and I really liked it
and I don't know if I use those colors
but I did use this font and the
Merriweather here I really liked it and
I didn't play with it quite as much as I
wanted to so I'm actually gonna be using
the same one again in this one I think I
really like fixed caps as a big headline
font
the only drawback with it because it is
so narrow is that you do need to keep it
pretty big but I think that's pretty
cool but this is again type spiration
really cool site I really really like
this one just for getting a few ideas or
finding fonts google fonts it's always
the same things at the top and this you
you'll find some fonts that maybe you
didn't know about that are quite
good-looking and my last thing I'm going
to show you is Pinterest it's the place
where everybody my wife is always on
Pinterest she's a elementary school
teacher and there's all this stuff there
I know like home waves use it and if
when you want to redecorate your home
there's actually a lot of website design
so this is one of my own boards where I
just pin stuff that I like pretty much
whenever I'm bored every now and then
I'll come on here and I'll just pin
stuff and anytime I see something I like
I throw it up there and I don't come on
very often when I do I might find 10
sites or something but when I'm looking
for something specific sometimes if I'm
looking for navigations I'll look up
navigation design and pin some stuff on
that or and I just try and add to it
every now and then and then I like to
come and look at it some times just to
get some inspiration and remember some
of the cool things I've seen there's
some really neat stuff sometimes it'll
link to the actual website which is
always nice sometimes it's just a
mock-up but whatever it is it's it's a
cool way to look but yeah it's a really
nice way to get some inspiration and
even you could you know if you're not a
designer and you want to get better at
design look at these types of things
these are the types of things that can
make you a better designer because
you're looking at good design and you're
learning how they're doing stuff like
with font sizes with their colors with
their spacing and everything it's it's
always great to get inspiration from
stuff that looks good to start with so
yeah I do any project I'm working on I'm
always going to be trying to get some
inspiration from stuff like that so that
is and my Pinterest isn't like
a social account really it's just for me
to a place to save stuff that I'm gonna
keep reusing it's the only time I'm
really on here I have a few other boards
but it's mostly this is the only one
here for a head to anymore so with that
out of the way I'm going to now jump
into actually creating it so I have a
bit of a color scheme here that I'm
gonna leave up and I've already picked
my fonts I'm not gonna be using these
too
I'm just focusing on these three here
let's just see if it gives us any other
ideas that I should I kept that dark one
let me be a lock that one into for a
dark color it's kind of a boring color
scheme I guess but this is the type of
color scheme that can be really easy to
use you're using a lot of neutral colors
a punch color and you're pretty much set
I think if you're just sticking with a
bunch of neutrals you're good to go
with one one color that just jumps out
if you're not really into the design
you're having trouble with colors
neutrals and this one even has maybe too
much Bay and we'll see how it goes but I
think yeah this looks pretty good um the
nice thing with this is the URL you can
bookmark it and always get back to your
colors to just thought that's a good
thing to mention so I'm actually going
to be using Adobe XD to design this one
I thought it would be fun I'm not super
comfortable with XD I mentioned a few
times now that XD on Windows isn't 100%
up to par it's getting better it's not
we're sketch is I don't think the Mac
version is either but and when I did
mention it other people gave awesome
suggestions of alternate apps and I just
haven't had time to play with any of
them yet I'm really sorry but there were
some cool suggestions and there are
things that I might make some videos on
in the future once I've had a time now I
haven't had a ton of time with XD and
say have a lot of fun title projects
recently but it is familiar enough to me
and there's some cool functionality in
here so I'm going to be designing this
one with XD and I'm gonna start with the
mobile layout and then we'll port it
over to the large layout so I'm gonna
click right here on my iPhone and it's
gonna give me an iPhone artboard let's
just move that up onto the screen
properly and get this to fit right there
awesome
so let's rename this I'm gonna call it a
mobile and portfolio page I think I'm
only gonna have a home page I might have
a splash page coming up - I have an idea
of how I want this to look I've sketched
it out I have it next to me but so I do
encourage you to have at least an idea
of what you want to be doing and things
can change as you're doing it but pretty
much what I want is I want a nice big
area here so I'm gonna take my square
tool and I'm just gonna drop a big nice
area in here just be careful XD tends to
have borders on by default so I'm just
gonna click that off because I don't
want a border on it
now I'm going I want this to be a big
background image in that area so one
cool thing with this is if I come here
these are some pictures that I've found
online that I want to be using and I
think I'm going to take this one and I'm
just gonna drag it so it's right on top
and see it says copy but it highlighted
it all in blue so if I just grab a photo
and drop it in it's gonna drop it in at
full size which is not what I want I
just get this big giant image that I can
place but if you've already made a
square so let's just come in delete this
just really quickly and put in a circle
here and let's grab that and so if I
just drop it it goes but you can see
what I'm dropping it on there it
highlights it so now it's gonna clip it
to that circle and I can move my circle
around and it's sort of like doing a
background size cover whatever I'm doing
it's trying to make sure that my picture
fits in there it gives this weird
psychedelic effect well with a circle
which is kind of cool so for in this
case I want it to be a full screen area
here so let's just do that turn off the
border and drag that picture right in
there it's a little bit dark so I'm just
gonna take my opacity slider here and
drag it down and one nice thing with XD
compared to photoshop oh I still the
board know my borders off okay
you know one of the nice things here
with this instead of Photoshop is just
it's a lot more there's less clutter you
can focus on the things you really want
to sort of be working on I'm some of
that a little hamburger menu up here so
I'm just going to zoom in to place this
and I'm also I'm gonna click here now
there's no guides yet in XD which is
kind of annoying but if you select your
artboard you can turn on a grid and I'm
gonna make this a little bit bigger
let's go like 15 so I can have a grid on
so at least my grid I can make sure my
alignment is pretty spot-on so I'm gonna
take my line tool there and just drag
that out like that now let's leave it
there for the moment I'm gonna make this
let's go get that dark blue color copy
that go back over to XD and paste that
in and let's make that maybe 2 pixels so
this is one of the best features of XD
is this repeat grid thing I'm gonna
click on that now it's gonna screw it up
a little bit because it's so stroke but
you can see it's repeating it and I can
go on and on and up I just want a little
hamburger menu here I'm gonna double
click on this first one just to move it
down so I can actually see the whole
thing and now that's not what I want a
hamburger menu to look like but now I
can just click here and shrink the
spacing between I love this and then say
I decided later I want to make this
bigger I mean I want to make it 6
they're all gonna change at the same
time that's really cool but I think 2
pixels will be enough this is a zoom
back out command one should get you back
to a hundred percent that's too tight
you know add too far apart still there's
something like that that looks a little
bit nicer cool
should I bring this I'm gonna bring this
into as a symbol let's drop that in new
symbol so I'm gonna save that whoops I
thought it wouldn't I didn't realize it
would come back out but the nice thing
with this is now because it's a symbol
if I do make more pages I can always
keep it in there and I should also save
that color actually and it's gonna make
my life a lot easier so let's add a
color in there too yeah it's annoying
that it comes out each time there we go
super so now I need some text on here so
let's just grab my text tool and let's
come with welcomed you
my port no just publicity welcome to my
portfolio beyond the next line so let's
bring this here so let's change yeah
that's fine so my color in this case if
I just click here does that work there
we go so welcome to mine I want to
change the font on this one to
Merryweather good good good
and so let's save that character stylin
now - as 20 points the size I want no
I'm not undo that let's make this a
little bigger so let's just get this
laid out a little bit before I start
saving any character styles welcome to
Miami option or alt-click I always say
option I'm used to I teach on Mac so
used to using those terms so let's have
this a portfolio I have to type it in
all caps as far as I know I can't
actually make that part of a paragraph
style yet which is annoying because six
caps you definitely want it to be whoops
six caps needs to be all caps six caps I
want this to be spaced out can we click
and drag here
oh no oh there we go awesome good how
big do we want to go 200 let's go 200
cool and one nice thing with the font
sizing in here is I can just click and
drag on this bottom thing I love that so
that's okay but I want that to actually
be the other color I want this to be
this colors so let's come back into XD
and let's change that fill color that
didn't change copy/paste
oops lundi oh it did change okay and we
can add that color in there too
cool oh I was dragging stuff off it's
probably sitting out there I think I
just need to select something that's cuz
it already is a symbol but I think if I
click on this click plus I don't have to
drag it in there whoops there we go so
welcome but this should be a bit smaller
that was what 36 let's make it like 20
yes yeah I just did command all of them
so let's close this off for a second
yeah I was just dragging them away there
that was cilium see I'm still getting
used to this whole X do you think let's
just make this smaller this way cuz
that's cool to be able to do it this way
I think that looks pretty good I just
want to bring it down a little bit okay
so I think that looks pretty good there
I'm going to sort of try and go through
this a little bit fast and then I think
I'm gonna come back after and fix it up
a little bit with some of the details
and stuff because I want to add a little
bit more detail this to this the I think
that looks alright
what if we want to make our artboard
bigger all we have to do is click on the
name and then we can drag that down and
it just show you where the the fold is
there so let's just drag this down
because I do have a lot more stuff that
I want to put in here we're gonna have
sort of a little introduction area here
called intro or something like that and
I think I just want a box that's gonna
have the info in it I'm thinking of just
doing sort of a squarish box something
like that and I should have the grid on
actually for for this part just to line
everything up nicely so let's say we do
something like go that super and we in
turn that grid thing off now so what am
I going to do with this no border it's
gonna be a dark fill color and in there
I'm gonna have a little bit of text so I
have my text saved on the side let me
just go and copy that okay so let's just
grab my text or actually I want it to be
this font so I'm just going to option
click that down
to bring stuff forward I know in the Mac
version there's like an extra menu up
here on the top I don't know I'm just
looking here I know what the shortcut is
I just wanted to see if there's an easy
way to do it
I don't know actually yeah I went too
many layers that would do it
and I could just drag that on top of my
rectangle whoops that's right so
obviously that's too big let's a shrink
it down quite a bit smaller and this is
gonna say making it making it happen so
that's gonna have to be a lot smaller
let's just change that over to white
make it easier to see making it happen
I'll select both of them and I want to
just Center it right in there so I'll
just make sure that they're centered
which they are wanna make this smaller
still see this is where this font gets
tricky with fonts we're down to okay
let's just bring that down to 30 and I
think that's the smallest I'm going to
let that happen
and let's Center those again yeah I
don't think I want to get smaller than
that that's getting sort of maybe that's
too small let's go up to 32 whoops
32 now what I changed my opacity oh
that's what I did before yeah I don't
know I want to make sure it's easily
legible I'm fighting right now with font
size and just padding I want to make
sure that I have space sort of like
around it when things get too close to
the one mistake people do is they put
too little space around stuffs a little
bit with their big font size but you
know I don't want it like right up on
the edges like that I want it to be 32
seem to be right around where I want it
so that's okay and then the other one I
want is this font shift command and this
right square bracket will bring it to
the top so it's the shift commander
shift control actually I copied that but
that's not going to work in this case
because I want to text box so I'm just
going to push mighty to use my text tool
and then
go to box and let's go get my text iso
from lorem ipsum in this case and I lost
my text box didn't it yeah okay I'm
making new text box it's fine
so what I'm gonna put in here I want
Merriweather font size is 16 and it's
kind of annoying that the letting is
done that looks alright my font size I'm
going to be like 14 I don't like going
that small usually and I want to Center
it and I can probably let's just make
this the same size as my text to try and
sort of line it up like that
25 is probably a bit too big let's go
with like a 22 and let's move that up
and something like that it would be a
bit more balanced like this but not
really what I was after to be honest
with you something like that I don't
want to make this font size any smaller
maybe if I just put like a little
divider in here
like that one let's make you white and
make sure everything here is centered so
I'm just select it all and Center it
nice thing here is I can see the
distance between usually it will sort of
highlight it a bit more than what it's
doing
can I do an even distribution distribute
there we go perfect and that looks
pretty good this could be a little bit
too dark though it's a little hard to
read I don't want to be pure white and
actually I'm gonna change the color of
this box do you make this one I think
that makes more sense
cool that looks alright I think that to
do for the mobile view it'll look a
little nicer I think on the big screens
but what I want to do here is I want to
put in a couple of images so let's just
get another square like that and I'll
copy this actually
over there so I have to let's just make
it so we can actually see them and I
should let's do it with this color
um and no border and one thing that's
nice so just like when I brought in my
picture up there I can do the same thing
here I want my two pictures of a
computer so I'll drop that one in there
and I'll drop this one right there
super and that looks pretty good
again it's automatically fitting the
image to that so that's kind of nice
that it does that like that yeah I think
that looks alright and it's also
clipping it to the artboard which is
awesome I'm wondering if I should put
like an overlay effect on these so I'm
actually going to take this copy paste
is that gonna put it right on top but I
want to switch it to blue it did work
okay so copy paste actually you can see
I have there this is on top of the other
one if I lower the opacity we can see it
now the with XD I'm pretty sure if I
just lower the opacity and then I export
my assets it's gonna export a
transparent blue thing like this and
it's gonna export my image if you want
it to export together what you need to
do is this background blur thing there's
an object blur which will blur the
object itself or there's a background
blur if that's on it's gonna blur what's
behind it I am so past it you will play
with the color the UM this is how blurry
it is and in this case I don't think I
want it to be blurry at all so my blur
will be zero I just want to bring maybe
I should do it with the dark color let's
go back with my late blue something like
that looks pretty good and I'm just
gonna option or alt drag that over so I
have one on top of this one too I'm not
sure if I want that or not yeah we'll
come back as I said I want to focus a
bit more on the layout right now we'll
come back and do some more of the
details a little bit after so here I
want to get into my portfolio section
were not the portfolio sorry I wanted it
what I wanted to here is heavily gonna
about Me section this is sort of like a
little basic intro and then
and we're gonna get to a portfolio so
the first thing I want to do is just
make let's bring up our grid again
that's a no you have to go all the way
to the top I can probably do it my
layers but there we go I'm gonna bring
up my grid and I'm going to how much I
didn't have any space there okay I'm
gonna bring in an image so let's make
where I might as well line it up right
with that right since we're already on
that and maybe we'll do like that um and
about where's the middle there so we'll
go maybe a bit bigger something like
that let's see how this looks
let's go find my image I got this one in
this guy whoops not what I wanted to do
let's try that again right in there okay
that's better
can I move that inside of there I don't
think I really get any control when I'm
in that it hmm do that but it's not at
all what I want you I just wanted to
sort of position him a little bit
differently okay so I'm gonna have that
and I'm actually new my copy/paste again
and put on a fill but my field is gonna
be white I guess I want to desaturate
the picture and I'm hoping this works if
not I'll have to go into Photoshop I'm
out zero opacity can I do this in here I
want this to be black and white hmm I
definitely with exeed not everything can
be done here it's not meant to be a
photo manipulation it's must be have
your asset ready and you bring it in so
I'm like for now let's just leave that
we're leave the color picture for now I
might end up liking it and then I can
come in after and I can come into this
after and play around with it a bit more
after the fact I'm moving this over is
yeah that's way too big of a margin on
the side maybe here will be better okay
so with all that out of the way let's
come and put in the name so this guy's
name is going to be Joe portfolio this
is gonna be set in Merryweather so let's
go with Merryweather let's come here and
set my color we want the font size
obviously to be a lot bigger it's like
50/50 could be okay I want the sleeve
bold maybe yeah it looks better and I
want this to overlap a little bit right
around there I think that would be cool
and let's just might as well bring it so
it's the same merging on both of those
which does that mean I should just make
my font a bit bigger yeah something like
that might well I'm thinking I'm lining
it up to like where my margin would be
but that's a pretty bad idea actually
because some people might have longer
names than other people well this won't
work anyway
but anyway I think that'll look pretty
good so there's his name this grid is
really bugging me so let's turn that off
I really need to learn the shortcut for
that oh I have a stroke on here border
move that up just a touch I just think
it'd be easier to read the name of this
is amok and white so I might switch that
out at one point so then I want to take
this and use a designer and developer
but this one I think six caps I have
there should be an all cap I can't
believe there's not an all cap thing
they need to fix that designer and
developer super which needs to be a lot
smaller I should have used my
I don't have a character style I thought
I had one because I actually want it to
be the same as that by a different color
so let's take this one and add a
character style and let's apply it but
change the color so my color in this
case what color should I use this is
gonna be dark enough I'm not sure if
this is even dark enough no it's not
dark enough that is that the one that
looks I guess that would be that and
this is gonna be too dark isn't it let's
just try this one though that might work
I sort of want like a little hmm
anyway we'll see we'll come back here
and that's gonna line up right there
perfecto
and then right after that I'm gonna need
a text box and should I take this as a
paragraph style yeah let's take that as
another character style they like to
call it and let's put in here I want my
grid again again anyway this is gonna be
left aligned so I have a bunch of lorem
ipsum and I keep making text boxes and
then not using them so let's drag that
back now paste that in there and set
that to this one there we go
that looks better and I want multiple
paragraphs here so let's just drag that
to have it off
is there no paragraph okay we'll just
double space it for now some of the
things that you take for granted and
aren't always available but that looks
okay
it's a lot of text that's okay I don't
want to make the font size and you
smaller than that I think that will be
awesome cool so let's grab you and make
you bigger because I need more stuff
because we haven't even put a portfolio
in yet so we're gonna have to expand
that down cool cool cool and one thing I
will since we're on here let's put my
grid back on and
just bring this right up to there just
so we have equal margins on the two
sides good good good
and when we are done this I do have to I
will be looking at doing the the desktop
one two so this might be a long video
okay so we have that done now I want to
do a portfolio so I think for my
portfolio what I want to do is give a
big area here with a light background
color on it it's gonna have to be pretty
big I have five portfolio pieces that
we're putting in I guess that'll work
let's go get my color I should have just
saved all these colors in my color
palette mmm I think with this one so
let's set my background on there Phil
yeah that's perfect
and turn off the border and add that as
a color perfect good
I should add this text color as a color
too good
okay can I rearrange those no sort of
bugs me they're out of order
okay so my spacing here one thing I want
to check is just there we go
I just wanted the same space here and
there except it's not perfect because
this is a bit too big there we go 53.5
maybe I'd want to change that but anyway
so here I need a title so do I have
that's gonna be another character style
for my titles because here I want to put
my work just like that I'm not sure how
much space I should put there let's just
move that maybe around there and now I
want to bring it in so we're gonna do
here hopefully it should be snapping to
the grid and it's if I undo that I'll
see my border is off by default let's
just take you there's no border but as
soon as I put one in its annoying anyway
see I thought that it would there let's
snap to there shrink this down snap to
that side perfecto
so I want a featured portfolio item see
now I want this space and see I want to
measure it's not measuring what I want
it to measure like I don't care about
the distance from here to here I want to
make sure this like you think if I'm
moving these around it would be looking
at anyway whatever let's just eyeball it
my work so yeah I want a big featured
image and then a couple of small ones so
there's my featured whoops there's my
featured image and then BOOM and they
should go right in the middle I'm
guessing that's the middle there and
there so we have five different pieces
work now this is the fun part with this
so I think should I've done this let's
delete you you and you I'm gonna use
this repeat grid again and drag this
over but I want to take the space out so
I can bring that down to zero and drag
back to there and drag that down and
take this space out down to zero and oh
I can't see where these pieces end I
will once I bring my pictures in so I'm
doing this on purpose because now if I
grab all my portfolio pieces here so
this one this one this one five and I
just copy into here oh I have let's just
take four of them and I copy it into
here it's gonna populate the whole thing
automatically cool magic and the cool
thing with this is if I did want to do
more I could always have more and it's
just gonna keep repeating them and I can
bring more images in and I love how this
works and there's a really cool stuff
you can even have it include text and
everything which is really awesome as
well and I'll just bring that one right
in there so that would be my featured
portfolio piece and then I get my five
other ones just like that and yeah
that's what I want my portfolio to look
like and they're gonna have a nice hover
effect on there too so I should probably
make an overlay
we'll come back to that details details
and then we'll do that and once again I
figure out my layers can I just select
ha ha ha you can't do that
good all right so that looks pretty good
now what I want to do is I'm gonna do a
contact section as well as my footer
then we're gonna come back up and refine
stuff because there's a few things that
I want to fix up a little bit but for my
contact let's go and just copy this down
because I want the same title let's
Center the text here so it's centered
which we'll just be able contact and I'm
gonna move that up I just want the space
here to be roughly equal to the space
there so something that looks out right
it's not telling me but that's ok I'm
gonna turn my grid back on for a second
oh good and it's because I want to draw
some squares and I'm gonna make sure
they're properly placed so let's go with
something like that that makes sense
it's just to keep my alignment on the
sides really the main reason I put that
on so now we can turn that back off and
this is gonna be my contact form so what
I'm going to do let's go back up to here
and let's make some text name so that
let's make this my Merriweather here and
it looks a little bit faint that's okay
I'm gonna keep it like that for the
moment and we use that awesome far-off
are we a bit more space maybe we can use
this awesome repeat grid here and I want
a name we're gonna have name email
message so there we go I can control the
spacing now which is super cool let's do
like 20 pixels I probably should have
come up with like a spacing unit say
like what's one spacing unit gonna be
but anyway in this case it's 20 pixels
so at least I'm consistent there and so
we have name and the nice thing with
this repeat grid is I can change text
and it's gonna be named email and the
message I can change text but I think if
I change one of these boxes it's
actually going to change everywhere
let's see yep
okay so we'll have to do this a little
bit different let's keep my message
there that's just the spacing I said 20
let's stick with that it looks ok and I
will just have to draw in another box
for this one there we go so it looks
good I don't really like these boxes
though so it's my fill color my fill
color should be I guess this one well
that's too dark nope not gonna be that
one let's go in and feed ff8 what's that
look like that looks a bit better and
then my border maybe can be this one
it's really subtly can I let's just I
drop and I drop and I really like this
zooming thing for the eyedropper that's
pretty good actually except I don't like
the color of my text here I do that no
hmm I went with that really light color
here and I'm using the same one what
what about this color looks like a dark
grey that I haven't used anywhere else
so let's use that for these these forms
are already really subtle so if I do
this on this one
all of them will change because they're
all linked together because I'm using
the repeat grid I guess I kind of made
my grid and then released the grid and
played with this but anyway I think that
looks pretty good
I like using the darker color there the
lighter color that I used up here it's
because I'm trying to go for more of a
hierarchy so I have like the white space
here plus the big title plus the picture
really just get your attention on this
area so I think that works really well
then I have the darker color here so
then your attention sort of naturally
leads to here I could have used the same
color here for sure I think hierarchy
wise it's really obvious we're stoled
one font another font another font so
the the font choices the size of the
font and all of that but just by
lightening this one up it makes it even
more obvious that it's not the next that
or that it is what follows and then it's
three separate pieces of information and
because they're all blocked off it's
three separate pieces of information but
they're all related to each other one
thing that's really bugging me right now
is just this text by itself coming from
a print
ground it's a widow or orphan I forget
which one we call that but in
typesetting you don't want something
like that
this one's technically allowable but it
still bugs me um but yeah I won't get
into the details of that just a pet
peeve of mine
so we'll just delete that because it's
lorem ipsum and I can do it I want with
my text it's just I don't like looking
at it I know once it's on the web and
things are moving around it might happen
at different screen sizes but anyway for
now we will do that now that I'm looking
here though I find this is a little too
light if the font colors a bit late I'm
gonna come back to that let's finish
everything off and then we'll come back
and refine like I said we would so
contact me this looks good I just need a
button now so let's go and Drago to
square that can be my button that gonna
tell me looks a little too close so this
button should have no border and my fill
should be really you need to use my
eyedropper there I sort of want to use 6
caps I'm just scared that it's and it's
not going to work but let's try it first
just actually that's okay I wouldn't be
able to make the font smaller than that
this could probably be a little bit
tinier that's okay the way I'm happy
with that um yeah I can read that for
sure
plus just the convention of it being a
big blue thing after my form I think
that works fine cool I think that's not
too bad actually it's really simple I'm
not trying to do anything crazy with
this form but I think it looks okay so
let's just we need a bit more space here
for my footer now the footers me really
simple too
I don't want to reinvent the wheel and
have some crazy information in here I'm
just gonna make a box let's turn off the
border and the fill color can be you
know I want a different color like we
have the blue the blue those are things
they're supposed to stand out this is a
footer so we'll go dark and again at
this spacing and this spacing should be
the same now I don't want to be in six
caps but what are they gonna say follow
me on social media we're gonna put some
social media icons so this can be this
font
actually nah let's make this white
that's okay and then let's lower the
opacity on it just so it gets like the
bluish the nice thing with that is if
the color changes actually I should
probably have done the same thing up
here here I think I have a color gray I
think I shouldn't have put it here's
gray I should have put it as white with
a lower opacity on it just by doing that
maybe like 50 even 50 it's 260 just so
it's not too light the nice thing with
that is if I change this color the wall
that's not the best example but you know
it's gonna change with or even let's do
it the cool way edit this color you know
now it's a light red or like a pinky
color then it goes into the blues by
itself and the greens whatever color I'm
setting this to because it's still lower
opacity it just follows my the color
that I've chosen so that's kind of neat
and I like doing that so I think I'll do
that there and I'll do that here so
that's just white actually let's make a
new style for that white with a 60%
opacity to be consistent we need some
social media icons try not to make them
too big repeat grid three of them should
be more than enough and we'll Center
that on the screen follow me on social
media I do want the icons to stand out
more than the text because I think the
icons are more important than the text
people will just see these social icons
and click on them because they know what
social icons are and down here we can
put like a boring old copyright copy
right 2017 I don't know how to do a
copyright symbol on a PC I always forget
if you're on a Mac it's option G which
is super awesome and easy to do Jo
portfolio first I'm putting a copy right
on here but if you want to use this
design you're more than welcome to oh
and speaking of copyright the images
I've used are free to use they're all
from up splash I think there might be a
few different sources but I've linked to
any of the pictures I've used if you
like them I have linked to the the
source I got them from
but they're all free open-source images
let's put a divider here because I'm
digging my dividers again let's go with
white and just I want this to be really
subtle like it 10% will work nicely
maybe 20 I do that it's 20 I might then
bump this up to 30 and I'm actually
gonna drop this down a little bit 15
there we go it's actually pretty well
balanced out to UM just I want this to
stand out more than this and I'm digging
those lines that I'm using a little bit
have I used many I only used one a I
have one here and actually I should drop
this one down too
let's do it to like 50 maybe even less
like 30 or what it was my other one my
other ones 15 should I do 15 there too
it wasn't really centered let's go like
there I think the line should be subtle
it's a little decoration that I'm
bringing in and because I have a line
there and I have a line here there are
different widths which is kind of
annoying but I have a line there I have
a line up on this one I probably should
use that design element more so I'm
gonna bring some up here too
these ones won't be super subtle though
I'm just going to set them to this dark
blue color that I'm using in a few spots
just make sure that text is that color
it is good and do something like that
I'm not using this to tell me cuz here
that pink bar is lining up right with
here this font is not taking up the
whole space so it's not really actually
centered you can see that big gap on the
bottom one so let's just move that up a
little bit there we go
cool so that looks good here this
already looks better one I'm not sure so
I was happy with this blue and the more
I'm working on it the less happy I am
and I'm on a big turquoise kick so I
think I might go with the turquoise
instead of a blue like a bluey turquoise
I like that better and the nice thing
here is because I'm editing this like Oh
anything that used that color is
changing if anyone's used to illustrator
you know like colors are linked to what
you did before used to Photoshop once
you set something like it's not linked
to that color
is that color here anything I've set
using these colors is that color so if I
make the change here it's going to
change everywhere I've used it so just
another example if I edit this and I
make it red this is change let's just
make it bright red you can see the Oh
seeing that's good I did that this is a
different color what color is this you
should be that color too except let's
undo that to get my blue back and then
all you should be this color there we go
so I think that looks pretty good I'm
happy with this subtler line I think it
looks a little bit nicer my text is and
again my headline stands out this is a
little bit subtle headline stands out
smaller a different font and then this
is nice and subtle but looking at it
it's maybe too subtle I'm gonna edit my
gray here and go with a darker gray I
don't want it to be the same I want to
be distinguishable distinguishable I
don't want to be different so it's
obvious I don't want to be so close that
it looks like maybe it's the same but I
don't want to be too light either
because if it's too late it becomes hard
to read and I don't want this to be hard
to read it should be like this gets
their attention now I want to read the
text let's make it easy to read to many
people I see all these WordPress themes
that do something like this yeah well
maybe not that extreme but like they do
something like this and it looks nice
really like if I'm looking at this on
just a visual but I don't want to read
the text I like it but if I want to read
it I need some contrast and I even think
this is like pushing the limits of
contrast so it's dark in that like that
but I'm happy with I'm happy with I'm
happy with guys that's awesome
really nice well really nice I'm patting
myself back there a little bit but I am
happy with this layout let me know if
you're happy with it first of all but
also an in the next video what I'm going
to do is look at some of the interactive
elements so when I hover on top of this
what is gonna happen when I click on it
what's gonna happen I want to have like
a screen that has a description of the
project with like a bigger picture or
something like that so that and also
this what's mine what's my mobile menu
look like when I click on that what are
we gonna see so all that is to come in
the next video and then I think I
probably won't have time so after I've
got all of that design
do another video on making it work on
the larger screen sizes but we'll see
we'll see how that goes and if I need to
do that or if I can squeeze it in the
next one I think this is good a long
video this took a little while to do but
I'm really happy with the result if you
have any suggestions or anything you'd
like me to see added to it just please
let me know maybe I'll have time to
squeeze it in as long as I haven't
already filmed the next one and yet but
I would love to know if you have a
suggestion for some of these interactive
elements and stuff you'd like to see
happen please let me know I will
definitely be using JavaScript a little
bit I've had lots of requests for
JavaScript so well we will be building
this on the grid all the interactivity
will be done with JavaScript and I'm
gonna challenge myself to make it with
vanilla JavaScript because I'm using
jQuery all the time and I want to go
back to really understanding and just
JavaScript JavaScript I think that's a
useful thing to know how to do awesome
guys there is the site I hope you like
the look of it if you have any
suggestions for interactivity what
things are going to look like or
different elements you'd even like me to
add to the site please let me know
depending on when you comment I might
not actually have time to do it for my
next videos because I'm gonna be filming
those shortly but it doesn't mean that I
won't be able to add them in when I get
to the stage where I'm coding things so
if you have suggestions anything like
that please let me know about them any
comments anything like that please leave
them down below let me know if you liked
the video let me know if you didn't like
the video I really appreciate any
feedback whatsoever on this since this
is something that's just different from
what I've done before and that's it so
yeah again I hope you liked it and don't
forget until next time make your court
on the Internet just a little bit more
