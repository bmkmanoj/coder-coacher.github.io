getting into some of the more
interesting thing but basically I've
built out this website out using the CSS
grid with some fallback see they're
using flexbox or floats and now we want
to go through and make a navigation for
it that when we click on it will slide
out and slide back in and right now I
haven't done anything at all for the
navigations we're going to jump right
into doing that so to start off with I'm
gonna go into my partials file here and
I'm gonna make a new s CSS file so it'll
be underscore nav a CSS and I'll go into
here so we can import that and I think
that would make most sense to import
right here so I'll import my nav I'm
gonna close that back down and I am
going to run my gulp if you don't know
about my gulp build there is a video
specifically on that that you can go and
check out but go look at part one and
that one links over to the part two we
can get more information on it just in
case you're joining us just for how this
an avocation is going to be working but
basically it's just compiling my CSS
files and giving me a browser sync so
what we're gonna do will we got to build
out our navigation so first let's come
over to here and for this I'm gonna
build the navigation over here and I was
gonna build this using the grid but then
realized that there's no real point
because it's really going to be just
two-dimensional if we go over to Adobe
XD here and I'm gonna zoom out a little
bit and let's just go and take a look
it's a really simple navigation it just
has the four parts of it there's not
really any reason to be using the grid
for something like this because it works
perfectly well with flexbox
the grid I'm really just reserving four
things right do you need a two
dimensional layout and not either a
column or a row so let's go and do an
have on this and in my nav I will have a
ul with an Li times four and so I'm
using Emmet to be building this out so I
just push tab and bang there we go and
actually it's undo that because inside
of there I need a link in each one of
them awesome
hmm so I think let's just go back to XD
for one second year we've home about
portfolio contact so I think we'll just
call those home and I'm gonna copy paste
paste paste home and that was silly of
me let's get rid of that yeah see why
I'm gonna click here and then ctrl or if
you're in a Mac command click there and
you home about portfolio and contact so
it's typing it out in both places at
once so I don't have to do it myself so
let's save that file and see there we go
it is coming in except why are those two
not links I screwed something up one
second oh these got placed in the wrong
spot somehow that's okay save there we
go okay so they're all links now awesome
I also need to have my little icon that
I'm going to click on originally the way
I had designed this I'm gonna change it
up a little bit cuz if we look at my XD
what was going to do is gonna have my
three little bars and it was gonna go
over to this and then it was gonna go
just with a full screen covering but I
think what I'm gonna do is actually make
this so it's it's more like this and the
little X will be here so it's actually
gonna be the same icon and it's gonna
push back and forth instead of switch
you know being in a different spot and
stuff and you'll see what I mean as we
build this out alright so now we want to
bring my button in but there's a few
little tricky things for bringing the
button in first of all is how I'm gonna
position it so I'm gonna use some
absolute positioning inside of my
welcome thing here so the button will be
placed inside of that and I'm gonna be
doing it with an inline SVG there is
someone who recommended using inline SVG
and they're completely right and I
apologize for not remembering who it was
I did a quick search in the comments but
I find it really hard to find stuff in
the YouTube comments
but basically what we're gonna do here
so I'm going to put in a button the
reason I'm using a button is this will
be a JavaScript event so having a button
makes a lot of sense the class of this
button class we'll call it menu button
and so we're gonna use an inline SVG
here as I said so let's open it up in
Illustrator and let me just get that so
it's on the screen a little bit better
for you all right so when I thought this
would be a lot easier than it was so
when we have an object in illustrator we
can if I do a file save as you'll see
what I'm sort of mumbling about here
when I save as SVG and before saving it
I can see the SVG code so I'm gonna
click on that but I'm gonna go oh my
goodness this is really messy so a lot
of stuff going on here I have this weird
clip path going on I don't know why
there's a clip path there's a Phil
there's strokes there's stroke widths
there's a ton of extra stuff in here I
really don't need you know it looks
messy that means it probably is
considering this is just three bars so
what I did is I looked at what's going
on and first of all they're grouped and
I don't know if that's actually causing
an issue but this clipping path is
causing an issue and so on that I'm
gonna come up to here to object I'm
gonna go to path oops I need to select
it object and not path and want clipping
mask and I'm gonna hit release looks
exactly the same but that's really
important it's gonna give us some
cleaner code the other thing here is
there is two layers so there is my lines
themselves and there's actually a white
box here in the background so I'm just
going to select that white box and
delete it so that's good again I don't
know if I need to do this but I'm also
going to ungroup these and it's this
path not sure what that is so I'll
delete select that one and delete that
one as well I'm not sure what that was I
want to make sure I just have my three
layers and I thought I don't group them
but let's do that again
it's not saying select all there we go
shift command or shift control G it will
ungroup things so I just have one layer
with three objects in it the last thing
I want to do though is I don't want
lines with strokes on them I want just
three rectangles so I'm going to select
all of them object path and I'm gonna do
a outline stroke which makes them into
actual rectangles so now they're
actually shapes they're not lines that
have a stroke on them just a lot of
steps that I had to do to clean up that
file but now when I do my save as save
and yes and when I do
SVG code oh my goodness that's so much
better
much much much nicer so I'm gonna take
everything from here and copy it and
we're gonna clean it up a little bit as
well so just because I don't need
everything in here but I'm just taking
all of that for now let's copy all that
and let's go back over to our files now
cool so in my button here I'm just gonna
hit its tab over and just hit paste and
for the moment I'm gonna make this
bigger just so we can see everything
that I'm doing
so SVG version layer I don't need this I
don't need so let's delete all of that
this I don't need so we'll get rid of
that I'm gonna definitely keep the view
box I don't know if I need an able
background I don't think I need that or
this to be honest so I'm gonna get rid
of those you can see here that it's
putting on a fill color I'm gonna leave
that for the moment actually we can
delete that as well I'm gonna leave that
just for a second actually so let's just
hit save on that and go and look at what
that's given us and oh my goodness we
have a gigantic box which is fine here
where I have my SVG opening tag in here
I'm also going to put height of I think
it's 17
I'm used to doing it that way height of
17 and a width equals 30 yeah there we
go
so if you're wondering where I got those
numbers from it's actually the view box
these are the court the the final
coordinates and stuff this could
definitely be a lot cleaner than what
we're seeing here and I'm wondering if I
delete this just curious I think it's
gonna look the same I really don't think
I need that and this could definitely be
a lot cleaner but I'm to be honest I'm
not super comfortable with SVG's and I
don't want to start trying to make my
own I'm just really not very yet at all
tab that over these are all inside will
tap that over and I think I could have
liked a lot of this just directly on my
each one of these geez or something like
that but as I said I'm not comfortable
enough and I'm going to shrink that down
and that's awesome so let's go over to
my nav now and on here we're going to do
my menu button and let's style it a
little bit so it's position is going to
be ABS absolute and I'm a little worried
I'm chopped I don't know 5m left
5m probably way too big I just yeah
that's what I thought would happen so
let's just jump back over to my welcome
and you just need a position:relative on
it to put it right there
awesome good good good so it's just I'm
just trying to position this where it's
going to go so that button this is
obviously as I mentioned too big so
let's do a 3 and a 3 on there maybe that
makes a little bit more sense I think
that'll be better
cool and we also want to do background
transparent border:0 awesome good so I
think that looks pretty good I'm also
gonna get my little X icon the same way
but I'm not going to show you the whole
process of how I did it okay so we also
have now my nav ul let's just do my
margin:0 or
padding:0 and list-style:none I'm
assuming you know how to style a
navigation a little bit if you're
watching this video if you really don't
know I do have a lot of other videos
where I will spend a little bit more
time on the actual styling of things
here just because I want to sort of get
to the nitty gritty and actually doing
some some of the more fun stuff with
this instead of focusing on that and
because of the way buttons work that's
actually moving a little bit when I
click on it hmm
that shouldn't matter though because
when it click everything's gonna move
anyway awesome
I'm also going to do a display flex and
flex direction is going to be flex
direction is column good and the reason
I'm doing that is my nav know I can put
it all this on the UL I think the height
will be a hundred viewport height so to
fill up the screen yup and then my flex
and that flex my justified content space
around awesome they want to build in a
new thing I think it's I remember
they're calling it space space something
it has a different name to it and it's
so that like in here it's always small
then big big big small because it's
putting an equal amount of space here in
here and then here and here they
actually want to make one that's finally
an equal amount of space everywhere that
would be pretty good just because it
does lead to a little bit of unevenness
and I want to do in a line items center
that makes sense cool good good good
let's just go back to Adobe XD for one
second so I want to change my font to my
serif I want to put these lines between
them obviously they're gonna look a lot
different in a second so that's a lot of
that's gonna be put on the
of actually just I'm wondering do I
won't be able to click on like the whole
area instead of only being able to click
on the word and yes I want to be able to
click on like a big area right so my
spacing these out properly let's go onto
my that's actually out of its background
will be accent that much we know
and okay so I'm gonna have my nav a I
don't know if I have to do anything on
my allies mine I have a the font family
I do have a mix in for this except it's
in my typography because I never moved
it over my saw serif one and I just need
to give it a font size which is gonna be
of a decent size so let's do an at
include saw serif and the font font size
will be sort of a two rm5 RAM for RAM
oops
good and and the color what was my color
color would be dark oops
dark blue yeah there we go the oops
sorry text decoration will be none good
and I'm gonna throw some padding on
these padding I was like three M it
doesn't actually change anything it just
gives me a much bigger area that I can
click on and around them so visually
they should look identical to what I
just had and I lied because I do need
something on my nav nav oh I will have a
border bottom of one pixel solid dark
blue they're not oh I did Center and I
do stretch
I can do stretch and then
text-align:center cool so what's
happening here when I just did Center on
this it's actually because their flex
items they're as small as they possibly
can be so the padding on this is
actually giving it all of its size
that's weird why is all of one second
let's see the background of pink so I
can see them maybe I just went in I
think I just made the padding way too
big okay
one m3m or something like that that made
that there we go okay that's better
good let me take that pink off so well
that pink is what's giving it its entire
size including the list item so I list
items usually stretch the whole thing
automatically because they're
block-level but once I made this flex
they're shrinking to be as small as the
whatever's inside of them so an ended a
line item center they're centering on
the screen but when I do align items and
let's give this a background color to
background of light blue and I turned
off the pink there so you can see that
this is my list item so when it's
centered its centered on the screen but
when I do stretch it's filling up the
whole space now so that's also why I had
to add the text aligned because when I
didn't have the text aligned it meant
these were trying to go left this is
just my 3 mm of padding there so then I
added the text align Center so I'm
Center aligning inside of that space my
nav a yeah good okay and we can turn
this off now save I just don't care
where the bottom of these are here oh
display:inline-block links are in line
elements so the padding doesn't actually
add height to them in a really strange
way so by adding the padding by adding
the inline block it just means they're
actually the right size now except
they're really not
well I'm gonna have to do some flexed if
your background pink because they're
these massive spaces here so instead of
this I'm gonna do a display flex a line
items Center justify Content Center
what's this space that's just like but
why are they stuck to the bottom is what
I'm not sure about I'm gonna have some
problems with this I'm not setting this
up properly at all instead of doing ok
let's and I can probably go back to like
this actually
let's leave the pack so padding:1em
instead of 1 em 1 2 3 4 so this is 10 20
30 40 50 60 70 80 you're divided by 8 I
don't know how to do that but we have
calc right I think this work calc 100
divided by 8 100 viewport height divided
by 8 no that's too big it is
wouldn't that make it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 oh
I have the height of the text that's
also god that's so annoying a line
height line height of 1 or 0 even there
we go line head a 1 so line head a 1
means it's there's not actually really a
line head on here it's not accounting
for any of its height right or the
height is the text its self oh that's
still too big and the line headed oh
this should okay let's go back this
should be 8 and a line height of 0 and
it should fit perfectly
perfectly enough good okay so let me
explain again I want I have to divide
this by into eight pieces because I have
top and bottom padding and but I have my
the height of my Texas getting in the
way so by putting the line hit to 0 the
height of my text isn't calculated in it
anymore and I can evenly divide
everything there is like a micro
fraction thing it looks like one or two
pixels sticking at the bottom but
because I'm also on my nav nav is going
to be position fixed top:0 bottom:0 save
left 0 right 80% Oh Noddy no 20% we can
probably do more than that 10% there we
go I wanted to go most of the way I want
just maybe 15 I want to leave a little
gap there on the side and said index of
10 I guess because it's going below some
other stuff so it's gonna by being fixed
if if we scroll we can see that it's
scrolling but it's it stays on top
awesome so that's looking good but by
default it's not let's turn off that
pink background because I don't want
that pink background to be there save oh
it turned off the wrong one pink pink
pink I want you gone
save ha okay good so that's gonna slide
out and then be able to slide it back in
I probably put a hover on this too right
um so this background alright let's
assume list item background yellow I
just want to see something okay good so
I could now do like a nav Li hover
I just realized why am i I I probably
made this a lot harder than I had you
know I'm gonna come back on that in a
second
nav Li hover we can do a background of
dark blue so I mean that works I can't
see anything no dark blue maybe I could
just use a blue pillar no I don't
remember what colors and I have let's go
look at my colors accent dark blue I can
just I don't agree no I think I'll do is
I'll do a light opacity RGB a dark blue
0.5 that's good
okay so that looks okay but here I can
click in here I can't click this is
inline-block now so can't I just do a
width of 100% and then this would be
zero there okay so my width is 100%
padding is on the top and the bottom but
there's no padding on the left and the
right and now that whole area is
clickable cool cool cool good and so we
get that dark blue and we can click on
the one we want to go on now we just
actually have to make all of this work
oh my goodness we're getting there guys
um good good good oh so what I'm gonna
do is I'm breaking this up into a second
video word we're gonna be looking at the
JavaScript is separately just because
that one's probably gonna be a little
bit long as well and hopefully a little
bit less all over the place than I was
in this one so I apologize for that but
we've styled it all and now we're gonna
make it actually work so I look forward
to seeing in the next video until you
get there don't forget to make your
corner of the internet just a little bit
more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
