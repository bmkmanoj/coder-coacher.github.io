miniseries we've looked at what CSS
variables are we've looked at how to use
them in a project we've looked at how we
can use them in media queries and then
we've looked at how we can create
fallbacks for them finally it's time to
see how we can use them to be
interactive and JavaScript and variables
just work so well together because it
makes it really easy to to modify things
on your page using JavaScript before you
could always change a theme but it was
complicated how you had to do it you
either had to have a lot more CSS or you
know we almost had two batches of CSS to
switch through your themes you just
write the CSS once change the variables
with JavaScript and bang the whole site
is changing so we're going to look at
how we can do that in this video all
right guys so here we are in code pen
once again so if you do want to follow
along the link is in the description
down below so one of the big advantages
with the variables is the way that the
Javik we can modify it with JavaScript
so here what I've done is I have two
different options well this is just a
button that is gonna change things when
we click on it and this button here is
where we can actually it's an input type
color which just brings up like a native
color picker they're real
in the browser so my native color picker
in the browser I can just select
whatever I want and that's that so
that's a cool little nice thing that we
can use so coming over into my
JavaScript now I'm gonna start with my
button down here and then we'll move up
to that one or actually before we do
that let's do a couple of things let's
set up our our our variables so we're
gonna have a constant and we'll have a
few different ones we're going to do
color input which is going to be this
button or the our color picker thing
there so that's going to be equal to
document document let's make this bigger
so we'll be able to see what I'm writing
document query see left door and input
and one nice thing with the query
selector is I can actually do like input
and then
type equals color all inside of there
so one thing advantage with query
selector in this case I only have one
input but if you ever had a site that
had multiple you could you can easily
select something like that you don't
have to have a class on it or something
even though query selector is a bit
slower than get element by class name
and all of that we're gonna have a
second one which is going to be our our
color color color button is that one
will be document query whoops I also
made a typo there
select door selector for this one we'll
just have button and our third one is
going to be our color variable which is
going to be equal to now for my color
variable it's the one that I want to
change in this case we're gonna use the
yellow background that's on there so if
we come and I look at my color my
variables it's just called yellow so we
can just come in here and say yellow
there we go
so my yellow is now setup so for my
button what we're gonna do is we're
gonna do our color button and we're
gonna add an event listener or I click
so if somebody clicks on it we want to
do something right so if they click on
it we're gonna do a function so I'm
using arrow functions on this which are
the es6 way of doing things so when
somebody clicks on this I want to change
my yellow I want to change what it is so
how we can do that is I can select the
route pretty much by doing document
document element so the document element
itself so that's the route and I can set
a style on there so we're going to do a
style I'm going to say set property
property so the property that we're
going to set is our color variable and
we're gonna set it to green so now if I
click on this
it changes over to green how cool is
that
awesome so fun so just by clicking on
that it changes now the one thing is if
this person is using a browser that
doesn't support CSS variables such as
Internet Explorer it won't work now the
advantage with doing something like this
is it can create a more custom
experience for people who are on you
know on more modern browsers but for
those who aren't there's websites gonna
work fine it's just they won't get these
types of things and they probably won't
have a button that changes the thing but
you could have it dynamically load you
know if the person refreshes the page
you're bringing in a different color
scheme or even maybe if they scroll past
a certain point
different colors start shifting or you
know you could come up with something
fun to do and so this is just a really
basic example of how if I click on
something it will change it and you know
it's not even going to change back it's
just setting the property to green
something it's a bit more interesting
would be with our little color picker
here right so that one is a bit more
dynamic so we can do color input and I'm
going to add an event listener again add
event listener so this time I'm not
looking for a click though I'm looking
for a change because this has a property
like you know it if I click on it it has
you know it's set to black right now so
I won't know if there's a change in this
so we can look for a change
and I'm also going to keep track of what
that change is if you're not used to
arrow functions the underscore here this
is the same as just writing like the old
way of doing it function with nothing in
it whoops like that and then the curly
braces so you can take that whole
function curly brace thing out and just
sort of replace it with that and the
arrow and in this case because it's one
thing I'm taking I don't need to put it
this would be the same as doing the old
function E and then having it that way
so I can just do e and then do my arrow
and just a little bit faster alright so
the first thing we should do now
actually is just do a console console
of e to see what this is actually doing
of course but if you do want this to
work you have to spell a listener right
and not even to listen so let's let me
do an inspect on here just because I
can't do it sadly within so let's go
over to my console and I'm gonna click
on my box here and let's change this and
push ok and it's changed and so it's
giving me this big thing so you can see
that the event type is change so that's
why I'm listening for changes so I'm
listening for change and then it gives
me all of these things here so one thing
that you'll notice in here is I do have
a target so if I look at the target and
the target input is this thing itself
and if I look inside of there there's a
whole bunch of crap for now most of this
isn't important or for this thing
nothing much is in here that is very
important except all the way down here
all the way down and there's a lot of
stuff we're looking for value value
value value and there's the color I
picked so if I do this again and I
change it let's just go to pure red and
I click OK
and we have another one so in there
might target and scroll all the way down
value type
there's type color value and there's the
color red that I just got so just to
show you instead of console logging II I
can console.log the e target so e target
is what we word this whole big thing
we're looking in and I can get the value
itself so dot value so now if I click on
this and I change the color let's go
with turquoise ish the new console log
is just giving me the color just to show
you that work let's clear that and make
it a little bit easier to see push ok
and it gives me the color and if I come
in here and it change again it gives me
the color so that's really cool right so
what we can do is instead of console
logging this we can actually use it the
exact same way
we did it here so even
we can copy all that and paste it I just
realized when I did this I never really
showed you what's happening so we'll
look at that in a second so I want to
change my color variable but this time I
don't want to change it to green I want
to change it to my e target value so we
can get out of here let's go to my
elements and let's find cuz we're in a
code pen so let's just do an inspect and
here's my body and here's my head and
here's my HTML so let's click on this
one so this whole set property on the
document document element as I said
that's the same as the root and the root
is this baby right here so if I come on
here and I change my color now and I
click OK you can see that it's added
class style is equal to and it's
changing the so it's still called yellow
which is kind of weird I should Robby
change the name of that but it's
changing yellow to be that instead so
that's why it's changing right here if I
click here again now I can go down and
click OK and it's gonna change it there
and with my green button here if I click
it's just going to change it to the
green like I originally told it to and
then once again I can come in and choose
my new color there so this is something
you can't do with sass variables and
there are ways of doing this with
variables but you probably imagine a
world where this you know right now I'm
changing the variable yellow and I'm
only using the variable in one place but
if this variable were used in 15 or 20
different places on my website I could
change them all at the same time which
is something that could be a lot more
complicated before so it just makes it
really really easy to make quick changes
to any variable you have on your website
on the fly and these variables can be
modified based on anything that
JavaScript could could monitor pretty
much so that's really really cool and
you can do some really fun stuff with
that so yeah go forth and explore this
and see and have fun with it because I
think it's a really cool thing that's
being underutilized especially now that
browser support for it is really
increasing sadly it's not there a
hundred percent but it's much better
than it used to be that was a lot of fun
I think that was cool I'm looking
forward to seeing where they goes but
I'm definitely going to be in court
bringing them into my workflow from now
on so I had a lot of fun exploring them
