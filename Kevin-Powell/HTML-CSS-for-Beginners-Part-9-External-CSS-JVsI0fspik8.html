we're at part let's say 9 I guess 10 I
don't know we're getting along there
we've done a whole bunch of videos and
we got a lot more to go
we've just started looking at CSS we
added some colors to our page now things
are finally starting to get more
interesting in this video we're gonna
start looking at external CSS which
really just you know blows the walls off
of what we just looked at in the last
video so let's jump into it and start
doing that alright guys so for this
video what we want to be doing is moving
all of our CSS to an external stylesheet
so what I'm gonna do to start with is
I'm going to delete all these inline
styles that I have so these are there I
have another color one here let's save
that and refresh what happened to made
one whoops didn't mean to take off the
whole tag save that my first website
there we go ok so we're back to this and
what I want to do now is I want to make
a new file so I'm going to do command N
and I'm going to save it so I'm making a
CSS file so I'm going to put this in my
CSS folder that we created a while back
and I'm going to call it style dot CSS
and hit save
so now that I've saved my file I'm gonna
come back to my index.html and I'm gonna
go up to my head and in my head I'm
going to add in a link I'm gonna tell it
that this link is going to a style sheet
and I'm going to get an A to F some age
the hypertext reference is equal to CSS
folder and in my CSS folder I have my
style style dot CSS safe and that means
I'm linking over to this file so the rel
is a short for relationship so it's you
know the relationship of this to this
this is the style sheet for my HTML
document so I'm gonna jump over to my
style sheet now
and what I'm going to do is I want to
select my body tag so now we used to
before we used to yes in the last video
assume for long ago we'd write style is
equal to and I would apply my Styles
directly in here we're obviously not
doing that anymore we're in another file
so I have to be able to select my body
tag so to be able to select my body tag
I'm just gonna write body like that
there's no greater than or less than
symbols or the triangle brackets aren't
there I'm just putting body like this
and what that is this is my selector I'm
selecting body and then I'm gonna do an
open and close curly braces so in HTML
we're using the greater than in less
than symbols or the triangle brackets
and I'm using these curly brackets in my
CSS so I'm selected my body tag and then
in here I'm going to write the CSS
similar to how I wrote it when I was
doing those inline styles before so
let's choose our background color and
you can see now it's actually Adam here
is auto filling for me and if you're
using another code editor to probably be
doing the same thing and so it's showing
me all of the different options I have
for background and let's put in my black
like I did last time zero zero zero and
save and I'm gonna hit refresh and what
we can't see the text so let's change
the color to white and I'll save that
and refresh so right away you might be
able to see one of the nice things about
this is the formatting makes it a little
bit easier to read when we were adding
them all in as an inline style so let's
do it again style is equal to background
color
whoops background color black color
white font size 21 pixels it starts you
know if I have to find my font size or
my color after it can be a little hard
you're sort of reading around a little
bit the way I'm going to style it here
is each one is going to get its own line
I don't have to style it this way the
extra space is just for me I could do
that and I could come here and do font
size
twenty-one pixels Adams doing a better
job of color coding it here than it is
over here where it's all the same color
we won't be using that so maybe it's a
little easier but after each line I'm
just gonna push return on my keyboard
I'm gonna put each property on its own
line and that way it just makes it a lot
easier for me to go through and read it
and make changes to it as I go this is
the standard way you're going to see it
on other websites we're also going to be
doing other things we're gonna be
looking at the code in the browser and
this is how you're gonna be looking at
it so we select something open our curly
brace close our curly brace and each one
of each property gets its own line and
then gets its own value and very
important at the end of each line we put
our semicolon to end that rule even
though they're each going on their own
line if I forgot to put that semicolon
it would be the same thing as writing
this so my color white font size just
like in the last video that doesn't make
any sense so we need to end that
property and then start the next one I'm
gonna save my file our fonts I should
get a bit bigger now that's all fine and
dandy but we could have done that with
our inline styled we have we'd already
done this in our with an inline style in
our last video but one thing right away
a nice power of having this external
stylesheet is if I'm working on my
internal so my inline say I wanted to
make this orange like we did last time
and he was FF 3300 and I forgot the hash
tag at the start save oh I'm being silly
color there we go I'm in the red that's
okay so I have a nice red paragraph
there but now if I want the next
paragraph red well now I have to copy
that paste it here save okay oh well I
have another paragraph and another
paragraph and you know you might have
100 paragraphs on your website so you
don't want to have to be doing this on
each one and then my goodness what if
you decide to change the color oh that
would suck
so let's just get rid of this and just
like before I selected my body tag just
by writing body there what I can come
and do is I can put a P so I'm selecting
my paragraph tags and let's do color so
you can get orange this time it's the
mean FF ACC and refresh pretty close to
orange um and well look at that all
three paragraphs changed at the same
time this is selecting all of my
paragraphs and changing all of my
paragraphs isn't that fantastic
and right away makes my life so much
easier if ever I need to change this you
know what maybe we'd prefer red I put
that over I make that one change and all
of my paragraphs all change at the same
time it's awesome this back because it's
easier to read when it's a brighter
color there we go let's come into our
font size tube just for fun oh we don't
need to do font size we already made
that bigger I have my h1 up here so I
can do that too I'll come here and do h1
h1 let's do a font size oops font size
of 70 pixels to make it nice and big and
color of pink and there we go so I can
always select a tag just by writing out
the tag here with no triangle brackets
so this is my selector I'm selecting
this I'm selecting my paragraph I'm
putting the curly braces and then I can
go through and put my properties and
change the properties to whatever I want
them to by putting the value right there
remember always end each line with your
semicolon this is something that people
forget sometimes so and it's an easy
thing to miss it stops working so if
you're wondering what's not going look
for that first of all check your
spelling Spelling's often a thing that
goes wrong if you're changing certain
things like pixel values don't put a
space here because that will also break
them
yeah so my color is still working but
the font size isn't same here everything
else is working it just doesn't know
what this is so I'm gonna put that all
together on the same line
save refresh to get it back to how it
was so right away you should be able to
see that I can go much faster by using
external stylesheet just because I can
select lots of things at the same time I
can select all three paragraphs we're
gonna see later on there's other things
that we're gonna be wanting to do that
for it's much easier to look at our
style sheet and see what we're changing
so we can easily more easily come in and
make changes and quickly see okay
there's my color or there's my font size
or my background color and we're gonna
see there's lots and lots of properties
so these can get quite long and it just
makes it so much easier to read our own
CSS then when we're using inline Styles
another thing that's really really nice
about an external style sheet is well I
have a page too so let's go over to my
page too and right now it doesn't have
any of the same styles and generally all
your pages are going to pretty much look
more or less the same so all I need to
do is come and I need to put this same
link on my page too so let's try that
out and it'll do it all again the long
way so I'm gonna put my triangle
brackets and right link rel is equal to
the style sheet for the space H ref is
equal to CSS folder style dot CSS I'm
gonna save that hit refresh and wow look
at that they both have the exact same
Styles pretty awesome if you ask me this
also means that if I come to my style
sheet and let's say we don't really like
this black background you're sort of
sick of it we want to come in and change
this to B let's go with a blue
background 0/0
let's go with like a CCE FF I think that
will be blue and there we go and well I
don't really like that font color
anymore let's try and make that a dark
blue see if I can figure that one out
zero zero that's right ffff see what
happens
oh that's a bright blue
actually it's a straight blue it's not
gonna be pretty but we'll be able to see
our text and I don't like that pink
title anymore I want it to be red well I
made all those changes this page is
looking good but what about my home page
whoa look at that my home page changed
all at the same time so external so you
can see external stylesheets are super
powerful they let us make really fast
changes across our whole page really
really quickly and not across our whole
page but across all of our pages very
fast so I really really recommend use
your external style sheets they're also
sort of standard across the web because
they're awesome compared to all of our
other options so I recommend that you
get used to them now one thing you don't
want to be doing is mixing up internal
and external so are in line I should say
so let's just say I came here and I
actually want this paragraph to be
different so I could come in and do
style it's equal to color black save
that and well now I have a black
paragraph and my other ones are blue and
maybe that's what you want and we're
gonna look at another better way of
doing this one of the problems with
doing it this way is I'm gonna you know
you save your site you come back a few
weeks later and then you're going okay
what why is this paragraph black and
you're looking at your CSS and your CSS
files probably be much bigger than this
because you're gonna have a really nice
website by then and you just can't
figure out how you made that black in
you you're sort of pulling your hair out
and then eventually go wait a second and
then you come back and you're looking at
your HTML and you see this and you start
swearing at yourself because it took you
so long to figure out if you start
putting styles in a whole bunch of
different places there's no way you're
going to remember where they are it just
makes maintenance of your site really
really hard so we don't do that all of
our Styles stay here so this is gonna
control the look of our website it's the
colors the fonts the layout of the
website and the HTML is the content of
our website and they're two separate
things and we want to keep them as
separate as possible so that's it for
this video I hope you liked it I hope
you've picked a better color scheme than
what I have come up with so far if
you're following along I'm super glad
that you've made
Pharr if you have any questions or if
you just want to say hi make sure you go
down to the comments and do that right
now like the page if you liked the video
and next video we're gonna be looking at
divs and spans so we can actually start
manipulating our layout a little bit see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
