they work and how you can use them in
your projects you're in the right place
let's go check them out hi there my name
is Kevin and welcome to my channel where
we learn how to build a web and how to
make it look good while we're at it this
is the beginning of a deep dive into CSS
variables CSS variables are amazing
they're really really cool I'm happy
they're here browser support is almost
amazing and this video itself is just
the start of a miniseries or a deep dive
into CSS variables and in this video
we're just looking at what they even are
and how you can start using them in your
projects today okay guys so before we
get into how to actually write your own
CSS custom properties the first thing I
want to look at is why they're really
cool so just this is just a really
simple site that I've come up and built
with and I've applied some I've used my
custom properties to build this out so
here we can see I have this dark color
now let's say I change dark to red it's
gonna change here but it's also going to
change everything down here because I've
used that property in multiple places if
you use two sass variables this might
seem really familiar with you there are
a lot of similarities but there are some
big differences between them as well so
just another example here is section
padding let's say I make that zero
everything is going to stick together
now you might say well I just put that
in one spot and so here I have my
section padding I have my section of
padding I have my section padding so I
only have to change it in one place and
it's going to change throughout the site
everywhere that I've used it so you can
probably see why that would be really
really useful and just one last thing
just to show you here we also have this
white color so say I change my white
over to red it's gonna change the color
of this text this over here and my
background color they're all at the same
time so it just makes it so we don't
have to try and hunt down things either
just using like a Find and Replace type
of thing and your code editor or hunting
them down manually which is oh that's
terrible
so let's go over to this and this is the
same thing but with no custom variables
used anywhere and we can look at how we
can actually write one and it's really
easy to do it the one thing you have to
do is you have to define it inside of a
selector so if you're used to something
like sass you can just make a variable
it doesn't have to be inside of
something but with CSS custom
properties they do have to be defined
and that's because they're custom
properties they act as variables but
just like font size is a property we're
making a new property we're inventing
the property but our browser knows what
font size is so we can easily change it
for us
it doesn't know what our custom property
is so we have to define what it is
while we're creating so what I'm gonna
do here is so just in my body I could
actually declare them there but where
you're gonna see the most often declared
is route now if you've never seen route
before it's going to the root element of
your page which is always pretty much in
any HTML page will be your HTML element
the reason we put them on the root it's
a bit higher specificity than putting
HTML and it also just it's convenient to
group everything together in one spot so
it just keeps it all together and by
putting it on as in your root or your
HTML element what it's allowing you to
do is they're becoming global properties
so you can use them throughout your site
because as we're going to see these
properties cascade down so to define a
variable it's really easy or a custom
property I'm gonna call them variables
now just because that's what everyone
calls them the first thing is two
hyphens so you just do - - - - - sign -
I'm whatever you want to call them I do
two of those and then I write the name
of it so the name of my variable I put a
colon and then I write the value that I
want to give that variable so it's
always gonna be name and value so it's
just like writing your own you know font
size you're writing the property you're
writing the thing here and it's these
two dashes that let it that let the
browser know it's a custom property and
not a normal property so let's just say
I come in here and I say my primary
color is 4 5 6 and so now I've defined
my variable primary color as hash 4 5 6
now I want to actually use that in my
document this is where it's a little bit
heavy to write I guess I wish they come
up with a better syntax to be honest
with you but that's ok let's just say on
my body here I want to use it so I can
say color and now I want to use that
custom property or I want to use my
variable so I'm telling it's a variable
so I put var open and close parentheses
and inside the parentheses I write the
name of my variable so I do - - primary
color and it's a little dark you
probably didn't see a change let's just
make it red so we can really see it
going there we go and you can see that
it's all changed
it just works like that now one thing
that's really important to know about
the Prime about these as I mentioned
earlier is that they cascade just like
anything else and again that's why we're
writing them in the route we want them
to be global things that we can use
anywhere in our document because let's
say over here I have this little intro
thing so let's say I come in here and I
rate second wall put it at the top if
you're going to do them whoops inside a
selector I'd say to put them at the top
just to make them easier to see so let's
say I make a secondary color here and
we'll call this one let's make this and
make this one steel blue so now what I
could do is in here I could say that the
color of my text is var and secondary
color oops color and you can see up here
this is the only thing I have in my
intro and that's changed to my secondary
color and then I'm gonna go all you know
what I'd like all of this stuff to be
that as well so there's my sales points
so let's come down here and you sales
points and in here we'll do color is bar
secondary color and it doesn't work I'm
also getting an error but never you go
it's gone so this isn't working and it's
because I've declared this secondary
color inside of intro that means I can
only use it inside of intro I can't
actually use it anywhere else so for
something like this it is important to
know and this is why we generally don't
declare them inside of selectors like
this because it gets limited to this
area so what I'm going to do is but one
thing you will notice is it doesn't
break the site one thing with sass
variables if you're used to using those
if you put in an invalid one your sass
won't compile
with this it's just gonna ignore it it's
gonna go oh I don't know what this is so
I'm ignoring it it would be the same as
if you did like padding fifty pixels I
misspelled padding it doesn't break my
CSS file it just doesn't know what this
is so it ignores it so one nice thing
with them is if you made a mistake
somewhere whether it's a spelling
mistake or something else it will still
work well your site will still work it's
just that one property will not work you
can also create like a mini fallback so
you can say if secondary color isn't
working make my text yellow that's
another option as well
so I want it to be secondary color but
if for some reason this isn't working
you can put yellow this could be useful
for troubleshooting problems because if
secondary color is working it's going to
ignore this so if I'm in this one which
is my text here at the top if I add
yellow here it's not going to change
because secondary color is working so
it's using this one first
and then if this doesn't work it's gonna
use this one over here this isn't
working so it's falling back to yellow
so this could be useful for just
debugging issues you could throw in this
and see what happens and you could find
any mistakes either spelling mistakes or
badly declared variables or whatever it
is this does not count for browser
support we're gonna be looking at
browser support in another video
but we'll get rid of that and we'll get
rid of this and I'm just gonna take this
secondary and I'm gonna do a cut
let's move it all the way back up go to
my root and declare it down here and now
they've all changed yay so that's why we
usually declare them in the root one
thing that you can do which is
interesting is you can overwrite things
when in different places so let's say
here on my h1 I'm going to say my
actually let's just do it on all of them
h1 h2 h3 we're gonna give them the color
of our secondary color so they've all
changed and intro we're going to take
this off for a second
okay so all of my headings now are using
my secondary color and we're going to
make it so it's only that just so we
don't have any confusion there we go so
we can see all my headings are using the
secondary color which is this blue color
here now one thing that I can do is
inside of different areas I can actually
redefine a second what my variable is so
here on my intro which is this text
that's up here at the top right now my
whole site is seeing secondary color as
steel blue and my h1 is using that
secondary color but what I could do is I
could say in my intro secondary color
whoops oh yeah that's right
secondary color is green and you'll see
it actually changed it only here this is
the same behavior as if you had your
body you put or here I have a font size
of 0.9 and then I go on my sales points
here and I say the font size is 1.5 Ram
in that area the font size is gonna get
a lot bigger because I've overwritten my
body's font size the exact same thing is
happening here I'm overwriting the
secondary colors what the property is so
it everywhere in my site it's steel blue
except my intro it's green and then I
could come on this one and I could say
that in here secondary color is actually
yellow and it's going to change these
ones to yellow now this can have its
purposes but please do be careful with
it because it's not you you're starting
to defeating the purpose of using the
variables in a way if you're redefining
them throughout your site and it's gonna
make it just as hard to go back through
your site to fix them but it is
important to understand that they
cascade just like everything else does
with CSS but in general and we're going
to look at an exception for this when we
get to one of our videos where we build
out some stuff so just
careful with this there are cases where
you want to do this but it can be a
dangerous proposition at times and it
also defeats the purpose of using
variables if you're just redefining them
constantly the whole point of these so
you can have everything defined in one
spot and then you can automatically
change it or update it as you're going
by only changing one thing instead of
having to dig through all your other
things whereas if you have variables to
find everywhere what's the point right
so just try and keep them as much as
possible and where it makes sense in the
root because that's where they're most
useful and that CSS variables in a
nutshell I hope you've learned something

get new videos like this every single
week in the next video we're looking at
how we can use CSS variables in a more
concrete example instead of something
like this which is I think you guys
probably have a good idea but something
a little bit more complex I look forward
to seeing you there and don't forget
until then don't forget to make your
corner of the internet just a little bit
more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
