covering a really cool and underutilized
CSS property columns with them you can
make multiple columns like this without
any media queries it just works
and it's awesome and browser support is
really good Internet Explorer even
supports it hi and if you new here
welcome my name is Kevin and this
channel is all about learning how to
make the web and how to make it look
good while we're at it with new videos
every single week
CSS columns are awesome and really easy
to use so this video is part of my
coding quickie series where we look at
covering CSS concepts quickly giving you
enough info to know how to use them
without wasting your time so let's stop
wasting your time with this intro and
jump right into it so just really
quickly I am on code Bend for this so
the link to this is in the description
below I'm here we can see I've just done
a really simple thing I have an h1 over
at the top I have my a div class of
columns here and inside of that I have
four paragraphs that the first one
having a div class intro on it so I'm
gonna hide that awake because we don't
really need it and here I'm just up my
body and maich one two some really basic
styles nothing really going on there so
we're gonna move down and write
everything here so you can declare
columns on any block level element
whether it be an entire div or just a
single paragraph so first we can look at
I had my dot intro so on this I can tell
it that well it should have some columns
so to do it we can do a column count and
I'm just going to do two and this first
paragraph breaks into two columns or we
could say three and that first paragraph
up there is now three columns and then
we can make that let's change intro here
to dot columns to change the whole thing
into it so now we can see that that
whole area has turned into three
separate columns so I can go down and
make that two I could come up and make
it five whatever I need now one thing
you might be noticing with this though
is the first paragraph isn't aligning
with these other ones here so as you may
know paragraphs always have a margin
before and a margin after on them to
create the spacing between them and I
can always be a little bit annoying
because you know you don't always want
those to be there and in this case
what's happening is this is all part of
my second paragraph so because the space
before the margin before is here
it's after here there's no actual space
on top of it well as this one has a
margin on the top so a simple solution
in this case is just to select all my
paragraphs and say margin top of zero
whoops like that and now at least
everything will line up nice and tidy so
just be aware that margin top can cause
some alignment issues depending on how
you're using this and then the second
property that comes into play here is
column width this is cool because it's
not a set value exactly but it's the
minimum width you want your columns to
be so let's take a look at how this
actually works I'm going to take this
column count off and I'm gonna change it
to column width 250 pixels so what this
is saying is this is the smallest I want
my columns to be and technically
speaking making sort of get smaller than
this depending on the container size and
stuff but sort of the ideal width and
most of the time it will be the minimum
size so if I make this bigger now I have
five columns and as they make this
smaller four columns three columns two
columns one column that's really cool
right there's no media queries in there
I pretty much have one line of CSS
that's creating this so basically it's
saying if I can fit right now I can fit
four columns and what happens is here
they're gonna get a little bit bigger a
little bit bigger a little bit bigger
and then once there's enough room to fit
five of them at 250 pixels it'll fit
five of them in there if I go this way
oh there's not enough room for those to
all be 250 pixels so now I go down to
four and now there's an enough room but
oh now we only have enough room for
three of them at that size and it
automatically adjusts them to make sure
that it's working so that's really handy
and as you might have guessed we can
combine the two of these together so I
can do a column count three and have a
column width of 250 on there so if I go
bigger and bigger and bigger
now it's maxing it at three it won't
actually give me more than three columns
but when I get smaller is if they run
out of room so that again this is the
idea with or the minimum width that you
want them to be we'll see that all of a
sudden there's two even though I'm
saying there should be three columns it
knows that we also are
carrying about the width of these
columns and if I get smaller and smaller
now there's only one that's really cool
right that I can do all that without a
media query I mean this stuff is sexy
and you can actually combine all of this
into a single just columns shorthand so
if columns 3 250 pixels mam and that
will work exactly the same as what we
just saw
and I can do 250 pixels 3 and it will
still work exactly the same way and you
can actually ignore one if you do a
unitless number it's assuming that's
your column count and if you put in with
a unit it's assuming and that is your
width that you're after so if I did that
as with the 2 it will work just fine as
well
as you can see so yeah you can put one
or both of them with the columns of
shorthand and in general I would
recommend and I think it is recommended
that you put both but it's up to you how
you want to use it so let's just put
that back up to at 83 here now another
cool thing that we can do and I really
like this is our column rule and call
them rules actually another shorthand
property
this is shorthand just like border
property is shorthand so at border your
border width border style and border
color call them ruling it the same thing
you've call them rule with column rule
style and call them rule color but
nobody when you're using borders
generally uses all of them right so I'm
not gonna do it here either
we're just gonna do a one pixel let's do
dotted and I don't know liking eee so
it's a pretty light color that's too
late we won't want to see it so there we
go so you can see these lines have come
in between my columns and once again
it's really cool because when I go down
into two columns well now I only have
the one line and if this drops down to
here there's no line to worry about so I
can put lines in between my columns and
not have to worry about you know making
sure they're there or not there with
media queries or something like that
that you might otherwise have to use if
you were using flexbox to make your
columns or something but one thing you
might notice right now is this line is
really close to these columns there's
not a lot of space in there and I can
actually come in and change
that with the column gap property so
column gap well let me control how much
space there is between my columns so I
could they make this space bigger and
bigger or smaller and smaller up to zero
you can't do negative on this and it
will change the spacing between them and
I think a3 looks decent for this one and
the your line here will just be dead
right in the middle of whatever that
space is so I think that's really cool
that we can control the gap like that
and just you know the default is one and
that's I think what all the browsers
will default to on the column gap but
you can set it to whatever value you
want it to me and one last one that I
want to look at and I'm gonna do this on
one of the children so I have my dot
intro this works on a child of something
that's using columns and it's called the
column span property there's only two
properties available the default being
none and all is the other one and you'll
see this first one is now spanning all
the way across so it means ignore the
gaps just span all the way across so my
intro can now span all my columns inside
of there and then my other ones will
work as expected and then you can put
this on any child that you want to so
that can be really handy but there is a
big downside to this or a bit of a
downside anyway and that's as good as
browser support is for this column stuff
sadly Firefox doesn't support column
span which is kind of weird and speaking
of browser support it's really good but
different browsers sort of handle some
of the stuff in a little bit of
different ways so I really recommend
checking out how the browsers are
handling it when you do this do some
cross browser testing and stuff because
sometimes you doesn't work hole 8 how
you expected to but it works really well
across the board and yeah there's
there's a lot more to columns than what
I've looked at here so I've also put the
link to the MDM stuff about this down
below if you're curious I think this is
enough to get you started and you know
being able to understand what you need
you to get working with these if enough
people are interested though I might do
a deep dive into this including some use
cases for them just like I did for my
margins and padding series but for now
