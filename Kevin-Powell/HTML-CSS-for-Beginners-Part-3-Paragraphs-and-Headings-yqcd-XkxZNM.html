three of my HTML and CSS for beginners
series if you've never built a website
before I strongly encourage you go check
out the last two videos but of course
you've watched the last two so what are
we waiting for let's go and learn all
about paragraphs and headings the Hawaii
YouTube and welcome to part three of my
HTML and CSS for beginners series if
you've never built a website before and
you didn't see my other videos I
strongly encourage you to go check those
last two ones out but of course you've
watched the last two so what are we
waiting for let's go and learn all about
paragraphs and headings so if you
remember from the last video we got our
my first website up here and that's all
we did and well now we're gonna be
looking at putting some real content on
the page and looking at a couple of new
tags now so we're gonna be looking at
doing paragraphs and something called
headings so we're gonna start with a
paragraph and just to show you why
paragraphs are important so we've got my
first website and then why don't we just
come down here and write this is really
cool I'm building a web page and I'm
gonna save that and I'm going to refresh
and I bet you that's not quite what you
expected to happen so I have my first
website and I have this is really cool
I'm building my web page and well
they're all on the same line but I put a
nice big space here what's going on well
the the problem is the browser doesn't
really know what this empty space is the
browser is pretty much ignore empty
space the only spaces they care about
are the first one so it's treating this
whole thing here the same ways it's
treating this one space here just to
show you also like you come here and put
a whole bunch of spaces let's save that
so file save and let's hit a refresh and
it looks exactly the same
so the first space counts and after that
they're all completely ignored so if we
want these to be different paragraphs we
actually have to tell the browser that
we want them to be two different
paragraphs mmm as you might have guessed
we have a tag for paragraphs our
paragraphs are nice and easy it's one of
the easy ones to remember you're gonna
be using them a lot
appiy so I put my little triangle
brackets I throw a P in there and that's
telling it that I'm starting my
paragraph but obviously if I save that
and I refresh you so I move down a
little bit but nothing really changes so
when I do my paragraph I also need to
tell it that I'm closing my paragraph so
this is the end of my paragraph so I do
that
slash and I put my P and I'll hit save
so command or ctrl s and I'll refresh
and there we go I have two separate
paragraphs now this first these tags are
telling it this paragraph is ending it's
gonna come down and start the next one
and all of our text should end up being
in a paragraph tag now there's more than
just paragraphs with the website there's
also what we call headings so headings
are a higher gilko a hierarchical
hierarchical hierarchal they pretty much
go from most important at least
important so let's take a look at what
those would look like let's just come
down we have six heading tags so we have
and you know a heading we have
paragraphs headings but no it's not just
H we have six so it's an h1 I'll just
write a heading 1 in there whoops anyone
close h1 and let's save that and refresh
over here and see what we got and
there's my heading 1 and you can see
it's big its bold it's much bigger than
the text over here so you know it's more
important a heading is more important
than the paragraph so by default the
browser's making it bigger it's making
it bold that's making it stand out so
you can take a guess I have a heading 2
and I'm gonna save and just take a
little guess at what that might do and
see if you're right so a heading 2 as
you probably assumed is less important
than having one so it's still big it's
still bold but just not as big and bold
as my heading 1 and let's go through and
do all of them
and okay so I got my six headings there
let's hit save and that's hit refresh
and you can see they're all bold and
they go down in sort of descending order
of size the thing that's really
important in what headings is they
actually have an actual importance to
them Google is looking at them it knows
that a heading one's probably more
important than heading 2 and heading 3
so it takes that into consideration when
it's reading the text on your site as
well so there's real meaning behind the
headings it's not just a visual
representation you're really saying this
text is more important and that is
something that's important to know now
things do not do one thing you do not
want to do age 7 there is no H 7 so I'm
going to save that and refresh and
you'll see it looks just like a
paragraph so don't do H 7 h8 h 9 and I
just you have 1 2 6 and I've also seen
people do things like p1 this is my
first paragraph close p1 and then PA -
this is my second paragraph close p2 so
let's save that and refresh and oh right
away you can see why you don't want to
be doing this it's not working it
doesn't know what the heck and h7 is or
what the p1 or p2 are they're not real
tags so we can't use them they're not
going to work properly and I understand
why people do it
we have h1 to h6 so why don't we have an
h7 and if we have H ones down to h6 is
why can't I number my paragraphs - but
it just doesn't work that way all of my
paragraphs are just P tags and my
headings I can choose from my h1 to my
h6 and that's all that we can choose
from so that's a nice short video just
looking at how we can start putting
content on our page we can start writing
some stuff so try it out see how it goes
for you I don't think I'll get too many
questions on this one but if you do have
any feel free to leave them down in the
comments below and have yourselves a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
