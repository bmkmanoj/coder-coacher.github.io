parallax effect as well as the music
section with the album covers so hi my
name is Kevin if you haven't been
following along with this series I would
recommend that you go over to the very
first videos in it because we are far
along in this one now where we're gonna
be looking at the music section and the
parallax effect
like I just mentioned we don't need too
much to talk about this one this is jump
right into it so this is what we're
gonna be building and we have this
parallax image in the background here
that we're going to do first and I'm
going to follow up with styling our
music section here and this I don't
think is gonna need too much work as far
as the parallax image that I have that's
gonna be in the background here I'm not
gonna do it as a true parallax effect
with JavaScript I'm just gonna use the
background attachment fixed if you
really want to I do have other videos
that explore adding parallax effects
instead so yeah we have that we have to
put our background color on this with a
drop shadow and that's about it I don't
think it will take us too long to do so
let's go and check that out so here's my
site so that's good so we want to add
our parallax image in here now what I
think I'm gonna do is so far
everything's been on my home dot a CSS
file because it's all been stuff for the
home page but I see the parallax as
being something that could be used on
other pages as well it's not limited to
only this page so I'm actually gonna
make a new file and I'm going to do a
save as and in my components folder so
in my s CSS and then in components I'm
gonna call a parallax SC SS and again
the idea here is this is a component
that can be reused on multiple pages
it's not something that's specific only
to the home page so we'll save that and
then we're gonna jump over to our main
once this on freezes cool main and I
want you in my components I now have
parallax and I'll save that so that's
good so now we can bring in my parallax
effect so I'm gonna go back over to my
parallax here
and I'm gonna do a parallax the hardest
thing here is gonna be to figure out how
big it needs to be so it's actually
responsive across different screen sizes
so let's just scroll on down here and
here's my parallax and all I have here
is an empty div there's nothing actually
in here and I want to use a background
image but because this is gonna be a
component that I do want to be able to
use on other pages I'm gonna add
parallax home on here so the parallax
will take care of the effect itself and
the parallax home will set it up for my
home page so if I I'm gonna have my
parallax and parallax home
the reason I'm keeping this in my
parallax even though it's specific to my
home page is if I had the main settings
here but this was actually over here I
just don't find that is easy to maintain
I find you know I'm coming to the site I
know I need to modify the parallax I'm
assuming it would be in my parallax
component so let's just start off by
giving it a background that's pink so I
can see what I'm doing that shouldn't we
shouldn't see anything yet because it
doesn't have any height or anything like
that I'm gonna give it a height because
it's an empty div either we could use
padding or height but I'm gonna give it
a height of like say 30 VH so I want it
to be linked to the height of my screen
I'm just guessing at the 30 right now
the one thing I want to watch out for is
say different screen sizes see now it's
it gets a little bit bigger at different
screen sizes and everything so say we're
on a cell phone and this is the Galaxy
s5 actually that's we're gonna have to
fix this because that's gonna be weird
there but let's go to a larger screen
actually that's not terrible the 30 VH
my Oh see these get bigger at larger
screen sizes so this is overlapping here
that's not ideal so with the smaller
screen sizes it works really well but
the big one it doesn't so maybe instead
of eh I could actually use the
max so it's gonna use the bigger of them
so if the height is bigger it's gonna
use the height yeah that looks better
there we go perfect so at the v-max good
and let's just see when it jumps to here
actually I think we're gonna have it
disappear but worry about that in a
second so I think that is looking good
so the background itself is actually
going to be controlled with this but we
will do our background size of cover I
don't know if I need to do that because
I am doing the background attachment of
fixed let's save that I can take the
pink background off and I can come on
here and do my background image is
images power locks home JPEG I think is
what I called it yeah I did so there we
go we can see that the image is there
and it's working let's go to a bigger
screen size of Sweden see it a little
more so there's the image so yeah it's
giving it to that type of effect where
it's just sliding around in the
background and I think that looks pretty
good at the smaller screen size we
didn't really get it in you know the
image isn't perfect so maybe I could do
as well a background position of center
just so we can see yeah you still get a
little bit of the effect going on it's a
bit more subtle at the smaller screen
size but that's fine now where this
isn't going to work is what we saw
before when we go into like the cell
phone sizes here so we go to the cell
phone's sizes here oh no I have some
side scrolling iPhone 5 really mmm I'll
have to check that out I didn't have
that before those are well check that
out after when we do some bug fixing at
the end I think but what I don't want
this year this just looks kind of wee
so we're gonna get rid of that so my
parallax this is fine but I'm actually
going to do we're gonna say it's a
display of none and then @include we're
gonna use our media query and a media
breakpoint up medium and we can take all
of this stuff and put it in there and
we'll also have to add a display block
so it's gonna from this medium
breakpoint and up it's gonna switch from
display:none to display block and get
all of these so it should disappear
there so in this OH and that actually
fixes the side scrolling which is weird
because that's just a background image
hmm curious but I'm happy it fixed it so
that will look like that so you get your
singers and then you just get into the
music which I think on a mobile device
like this makes a lot more sense and if
you're wondering how I got this I always
get questions so it's just in Chrome's
inspector mode and you click this and
you go into like the mobile and you can
choose cell phones and stuff like that
or just go to responsive and control it
this way so now you can see that it's
there and when we cross that threshold
it's not there anymore that's perfect
I'm happy with that sweet good that
looks really good
I'm happy with that let's get outta here
so I think that looks pretty nice I
don't want it to be something it really
stands out it's supposed to be something
to sort of subtle but a nice little
effect there and now on to our music
awesome
so the our music I can actually close
the parallax so we're jumping over to
our music which I'm just going to do in
the home because this is all part of my
home page so let's go and look so I had
music let's look in here so I have music
and with a container the display too
so my class I might have done this
off-screen actually so just in case I
did the display too here is just to get
the font size the same as this one I
probably should just change the h2 font
size everywhere but
um yeah I probably should just change
that font size everywhere but I've
started with this display too so I'll
stick with that so this is looking good
we have our music then we have all of
that we have our link here and our a
link with our little sort of
call-to-action thing there so we need to
give this the dark background a drop
shadow and just space it out a little
more so I have music and then a
container inside okay so let's just
start with music margin top of 5m when
you're not sure I'm just guessing pretty
much when I say 5m and I see if it works
and if it does work and then I'm happy
and if it doesn't work then I need to
modify it and at the same time we'll
give it a margin bottom - a margin
bottom of 5m good so now I need the
background on that but I can't do the
background on the music because the
music is full with because it's my
container inside so this will actually
also get music I'm going to add the
class music container on here so then I
can say dot music container has a
background that is Lac I think that's
what I called it I'll save that I'll
save this and that should update except
it's the same color why is it the same
color music music here
oh no I must have set okay let's get out
of here for a second then I made a
mistake along the way that means oh no
ok custom let's go back to my custom
thing here I set my body's background to
black but I don't want it to be black
my body's background should actually be
you know what that's kind of weird um I
went with so this is actually dark that
so this is black so that's what I want
these are black so that's what I want
but when I get to here it's a light gray
and this is the dark aha
so does that mean I need to change a
couple of things right so my body's
background isn't black my body's
background is gray there we go so that
looks better so my body's background is
gray but that just updated all my colors
everywhere so this is too light now and
these are too late now oh that's
annoying okay so what's this one that's
I can fix that one really easily
that's my about about about about title
about I never even about text that's
about text right I can just take the
whole about though I never even used it
but I have a dot about background is
black there we go so that's better
these guys here though so my band
members my band members band band
members is the whole thing and then each
one of them is a band member so I should
be able to come here and say background
is black of course that doesn't do
anything okay
why not inspect
here so I have a background there that
it's not using obg inverse is important
for some reason oh really
okay well if I just take off the BG
inverse I should be okay I think so
let's try that
the BG inverse has an important on their
background color that's kind of annoying
they should make that easier to
overwrite so let's go and find my band
members about they're in here they're
not inside this though they're inside
this container band member so we'll
destroy it the first one if I just take
this off and save okay so I can just do
that and set the color that way instead
that's kind of annoying
I'm shrink that column down here's the
next one
BG inverse and my other column B G
inverse save okay so my colors are
falling back into line now I think what
this should be darker to but whatever
I'll leave that I'll leave that like
that for now this looks good this looks
good now I have this good now one thing
I have this drop shadow on these ones
and I want the same drop shadow on that
so we can grab this box yeah now I
realize this could probably become a
mixin or something to make my box shadow
but I'm being a little bit lazy so my
container here can just get the same one
shouldn't be repeating myself that way
but there we go I have my nice drop
shadow on there the next thing I want to
do is just add a little bit padding
padding top of say I don't know 4 no
it's give me too big let's try for him
actually that's not too bad at all and
so we knew the same padding-bottom of 4m
cool now I need some space under here
and I need some space on top of there so
let's just go and
look music so I have my h2 class of
music title so I'm gonna grab that music
title so that will be a margin bottom of
I don't know 1m it's a big font size so
just remember it's taking that font size
see that's even too big so I don't know
maybe point 0.5 M that's better so I
want some space on there too right so
let's go and look at that that's gonna
be down down down I have my paragraph
there I think what I want to do is add a
class on top of that to give me some
space so I'm gonna call it class is
equal to music call to action and by
using that what I can do is have my
music call to action and say margin-top
I don't know I'll try to you know this
is a big font size when M is in me a lot
of space this is a small font size so to
you know one M is really tiny so
actually I think that looks pretty nice
and pretty balanced overall so yeah I'm
pretty actually happy with that it's
going nice that's looking pretty good
and then when we go to work let's just
leave it like that for a second when we
go to our small screen sizes let's just
see what happens here I just want to
make sure it looks good cuz right now
this is three I don't know what it's
gonna look like it's getting whoops
where did it go I'm just oh they're
stacking right mm that looks kind of
ugly actually this big wall like that
and they're not even that big I think
what I'm gonna do
cuz I have these if we look at my where
is it inside here the container you can
see that blue space like this empty
space here in this empty space here our
because each one of these is oops that
shows each one of these is a 3 so I have
3 6 and 9 so I'd like a 1 and a half and
one and a half of empty space on the
side there that you can see so I think
at the small screen sizes instead of
stacking this way I'm gonna keep three
but they're just gonna use up more of
the available space I think that makes
more sense so let's leave it like this
so we can see what's on my screen and
this is where it's cool because you
don't actually have to give it a screen
size anymore I'm going to say that it's
a column so at all screen sizes it's
just a column taking up whatever space
is available and then it's going to
switch over to an MD three and well a
three at the medium screen size so if
you just put call it's not actually
defining anything but it's always going
to be a column this would be the same as
using like extra small so it's just it's
always a column and it's going to just
use up all the available space we got to
do that for all of them call call call
so I'll save that and let's see what
happens there we go and you can see
there they're going right up to the
edges now and I think that looks much
nicer the space my padding here is too
big I shouldn't have put m's actually I
should have used just that space looks
off now um that's okay so I just want to
say that my music my padding here
instead of using m's I probably should
have used something like five vertical
height five vertical height let's see
what that looks like maybe that's too
small yeah it's way too small
try fifteen and obviously that's way too
big so we'll go with something like
seven right in the middle so a seven and
a seven so that looks good at this
screen size now what happens here let's
go and look it still looks pretty good
awesome and I did height so even if it's
a really big screen it won't change but
if you get on something that's really
tiny for whatever reason you can see
it's adjusting a little bit so it's
using up a bit
space cool I'm happy with that I think
that looks pretty good guys so we have
that nice parallax effect there which is
looking good then we get to the music
when we get on to the smaller screen
sizes it gives us something like that
where it's still doing that because it's
just album covers we just wanted to look
like be visual so I don't want it to be
this big stacked up thing but it just
takes up more of the room so the images
can stay a little bit bigger and even at
the really small screen sizes that's
fine
cool good awesome I'm really happy with
that
suite and that's that section done thank
you so much for watching the video if
you liked it please hit the thumbs up if
you have any questions or any comments
or anything like that just don't be shy
