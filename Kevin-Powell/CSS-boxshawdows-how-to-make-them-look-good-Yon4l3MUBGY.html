can make sure we're using the box shadow
property in ways that aren't ugly cuz as
nice of a property as it is and as
effective as it can be if you're not
using it properly it just will make your
site look super amateurish and I don't
want you making those types of mistakes
so let's go and look at how we can use
it in nice and effective ways so once
again I mean code been this number
actually looking at three different code
pens but as usual they are linked down
below so you can come and play around
with the code if you want to um so the
very first thing with the Box shadow is
it's important that you use low opacity
so let's just bring in a really simple
one here we'll give it like a 25 pixel
blur and we'll just make it black and
when that comes in it's not looking so
hot and even let's add a little bit of
spread to this and my goodness there is
a drop shadow but the shadow is almost
overwhelming so it just doesn't look
very nice and I see way too many people
do stuff like this or they do come in
with an RGBA value so just to lower the
opacity just to make this a little bit
easier to read I'm gonna put RGB on its
own line so I'm just gonna put a line
break there but it's all part of the
same thing and so let's come in with
black so black is easy in RGB a because
it's a whole bunch of zeros and then
I'll see something like 0.75 that's
great that you're lowering the opacity
but you haven't lowered it enough let's
bring that all the way down to 0.25 now
things are starting to look a little bit
better so all we've done is lower the
opacity but man that's already a lot
better it's not great by any means but
it's less in our face I don't think it
looks great but it's passable I'm just
gonna come here and actually take this
spread off and bring that down to zero
by removing the spread which was making
our shadow bigger than it needed to be
there are reasons to use spread but this
wasn't a very good use case it just made
the shadow bigger for no reason it's
almost like you're going well there is a
shadow here and I want to make sure
people see it now though it's starting
to look good now I know some of you are
gonna be screaming at me saying it's way
too subtle you can barely see it that's
sort of the point here but if you really
need to make your shadow stand out a
little bit more try
coming in with a little bit of vertical
offset something like five or ten pixels
just moves it down a little bit it's
gonna make it a little bit darker on the
bottom because it's the the way it's
working right so we have lose a little
bit on the top we gain a little bit on
the bottom so you can definitely see it
more but still really really subtle so
we went from a super strong black not
very subtle of shadow to this super
subtle shadow box shadow should always
be very subtle unless you're using them
in hacky ways which we'll be seeing in
another video the whole point is to
slightly enhance your design by adding a
little touch because really what our
shadows doing they're adding depth to
our design they're saying that this box
isn't sitting right on top of the
background it's actually hovering a
little bit over it it's giving it some
elevation if you have a really strong
shadow it's like your main source of
light as a flashlight we don't want two
flashlights to be our main source of
light it I wouldn't think so as I just
said shadows I had some depth or
elevation to things and the size of the
shadow affects how far off something
appears to be so it's going to take a
look at this second example I have where
I have these two boxes I've called one
box lower and the other one box higher
this is the higher one right here so
this is the one we're going to focus on
for the beginning and later we'll make a
small modification to the next one over
there so if I want to make this box
higher actually appear higher up than
the other one which value out of all of
these do you think I should change think
about it for a second
so what it is is it's the blur and if
you don't believe me take a piece of
paper and hold it over the table but
hold it close to the table and look at
the shadow the shadow probably has some
pretty hard edges and then slowly raise
the paper higher and higher the shadow
is going to get blurrier and blurrier as
you lift it it's probably getting a
little lighter too as the light sort of
gets more diffuse i'm so in this example
I have made my shadows a little bit
darker just because it makes it easier
to illustrate what's going on so here on
this one if I actually change this all
the way up to 60 pixels now when you
first happen you may not notice it but
now take a look at the two of them let
your eye travel from one to the other
one and you're gonna see this one looks
a lot higher up than this one this one
looks like it's close to the background
and this one looks like it's hovering
much farther up and you can even enhance
it a little bit more if you wanted to by
just coming and changing the opacity and
lowering the opacity of it would even
amplify that effect a little bit more
but you want to make sure you can still
see them I'm gonna leave it at 0.5 just
to show you still see for sure there's a
big difference between the two there and
the same principle applies if you're
using in set spacing as well so if I
just came on both of these and said
inset to move the shadows inside this
one looks like it's really close to the
background and this looks like it's much
further away because it has the much
bigger shadow on it this is probably a
little bit more effective maybe let's
just drop this to 40 you still start
getting the same idea though let's take
those in sets off and just to highlight
it even more here my blurs 15 let's make
that blur 5 so now it's looking like
it's even closer than it was before this
is just just just off my background and
this one's hovering way far away from my
background normally you wouldn't have
differences this big but it just really
highlights the difference between the
two and the visual difference you can do
now if you are playing around with blurs
and other things like that
one thing that's really important to
avoid is make sure that you don't have
offsets that are going in opposite
directions right now I have a just a 5
here and a 5 here so it's a really small
offset I'm gonna make this one a little
bit bigger just to highlight now what I
want to be doing so if I do that at 15
it actually still works pretty good even
if this is just it sort of still matches
with where the light source is coming
from but what I wouldn't want to do is
have a negative 5 on one of them and a
positive one on the other that just
looks really weird and to make it even
look weirder let's just put the blur the
same on both so this one has a shadow on
the top and this one has a shadow on the
bottom the shadow is indicating the
direct the offset is helping indicate
the direction of the light source so if
we have two different boxes or more than
two boxes with offsets going in
different directions
it just becomes confusing where is the
light coming from it doesn't really make
much sense what's going on here so just
make sure you avoid things like that
because it just gets kind of weird so
let's bring that back
to how we had it before great so I hope
that highlights how we can see that
there the difference is in elevation by
playing around with your shadow to
highlight how this works even more let's
go and jump over to this third example
all right so what I've done on this one
here we have our little lonely box all
by itself and when I hover on top it
gets bigger I'm gonna go off it gets
smaller so just a really simple
transform and scale on this one with a
transition just to make it a smooth
transition now because the shadow isn't
changing it looks like the box is
physically getting bigger along with the
text inside of it
but it doesn't look like the elevation
is changing it really is just my box is
getting bigger and smaller if I wanted
to make it look instead like my box is
getting closer are going farther away we
can do that but it means on hover we
also have to modify the shadow so let's
just copy the existing shadow that I
have right now and I'm using the same
principles I was just looking at before
but what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna
come and give this a really big blur and
on my transition here I'm also going to
transition my box shadow for 300
milliseconds so it's the same duration
now just a quick note on this for
performance reasons it isn't really the
best practice to do a transition with a
shadow it should be limited to things
like transforms and scale and opacity
but for this example I will be doing it
and you'll see it used occasionally but
just be aware that for performance it
can knock it you might give it like a
jittery animation or some problems
because it causes some repaints to be
going on so if I do that and now I hover
on top
see how my shadow gets bigger and
smaller now maybe 100 pixels was a bit
too much let's go with like 70 and I
think that looks pretty good so now
instead of my box looking like it was
getting bigger and smaller it really
looks like it's being elevated up off of
the page which is really cool now
because the offset here was 5 down I'm
actually going to make this one about 15
so it's I think just a bit more
consistent with the light source as it
moves
the page so it looks like it's really
moving a lot so you can see it's it's
bouncing all the way up and all the way
down so it gives you that artificial
look of it coming closer to the person
as they hover on top instead of it just
growing and shrinking now if you are
doing this one thing that's really
important make sure that your blur is
enough now too big it's gonna look
really weird 100 look probably a bit too
big and now 150 is probably even way too
much but also I'm at 20 and if I just
made this 40 the change isn't enough the
blur is increasing but it's not
increasing by enough for how much my box
is increasing in size and that can make
it a weird sort of feeling for the
person is it getting closer is it
growing like what's what exactly is
going on here
it's a little bit confusing so you might
have to play around with your numbers a
little bit when you're doing this until
you get to something that you think is
you know it looks good and is working
just like on this example to really get
the difference in elevation that you
want between two different items you'll
want to play around with a little bit
now if you do want further reading in
that I'm gonna put a link down below in
the description that talks about
material design it's they're just on
their shadows because there's a lot of
thought that the material Google did
with material design that really dives
into the whole Ellah idea of elevation
and it's really interesting and if
shadows are something you want to learn
how to use properly in your design I'd
really encourage you to check it out
also think about that when you're
overlapping content so here my lonely
box if I came on this and we added an
inner box so we add in that inner box so
let's come and style this up inner box
I'm just going to give it a little bit
of padding and a box shadow on here to
start with so 0 let's try 5 pixels 20
pixels rgba I'm doing the same thing I
had on my original box so if I do
something like that
oops I didn't put a hyphen on this one
there we go so my inner box the distance
and I'm gonna take off actually the
hover because I want to be able to go on
top of here
so this box the disc the shadow that on
this one is the same as the shadow on
this one so if you're looking at the way
the elevation is working it's sort of
like it's up a little bit and then it's
the same distance between this and here
right so we're sort of like stepping our
way up so if I wanted to make it look
like this is just a little bit on top I
could bring that down and now you know
it's I'm layering my content I have
several layers of content that are
building up but just remember it's
always in relation you're not always
focusing on the background but where
this can get interesting is if you have
it overlapping on multiple things so if
I do position position relative on here
and then I come down onto this and I do
a position position absolute bottom
negative twenty five pixels let's go
with and we should probably give this
away background background wait there we
go so one thing you want to watch out
for this is now my shadow and this one
doesn't really make sense anymore
because this distance looks like it's
less than this distance but it's also
going on top of this one that just
doesn't work right you can't be closer
to the background even though you're on
top of this so when you're layering
things if you're gonna have layers that
are overlapping take that into account
so here my blur is 20 on this one my
blur might be 35 or something like that
just to really give it more of the
appearance of being a little bit higher
up so this has a more diffuse shadow on
it making it look like it's hovering up
even higher so just be careful with that
when you are creating your your shadows
and your layers on everything here and
just as a last note just always remember
going all the way back to the very
beginning when we made this always
remember why you're adding shadows we're
not adding them just for the fun of it
and it's not to make shadows that just
stand out because shadows that stand out
are gonna ruin your design you want to
add them to add depth to your design and
we want to keep our shadows as realistic
as possible and in general is
subtle as possible something like this
looks pretty good it's a nice subtle
shadow if you really wanted to don't be
scared of also doing like here I'm gonna
bring it down a bit but then I'm gonna
add in and negative spread so say I do
negative 10 pixels here um so now my
shadow it's changing the way the light
is working it's looking like the light
sources a bit higher up because it's
only casting the shadow on the bottom
here it's not casting it all around so
I've just changed where my light source
is coming from so play around with
things like that but make sure you're
consistent with your light sources and
that your shadows are very subtle they
are not meant
they shouldn't be things that really
stand out the strong shadows look weird
they look amateurish and I don't want
you having amateurish shadows in your
designs now you know better and you
shouldn't be having stuff like that so I
hope I gave you some insight if you're
using box shadows and you have some
