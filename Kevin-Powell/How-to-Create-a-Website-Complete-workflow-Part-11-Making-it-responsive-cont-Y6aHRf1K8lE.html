series on making a responsive website
from scratch including my whole workflow
if you missed the last week's video I
would suggest going to check it out
because it's the first part of making my
whole site responsive in this part I'm
going to be covering the call to action
where I add the little pink triangle
things I'm gonna be fixing up the footer
which is really easy to do and I'm also
going to go to the navigation which I
had forgotten about and I run into some
trouble with the flexbox elements and
they're not really working how I
expected them to so that takes a little
bit longer than expected but I think
it's a nice learning experience because
you see some of the oddities of flexbox
popping up in that and yet that's we're
gonna be doing in this video so let's
jump right into it so I'm gonna go and
open up my call to action I have lots of
stuff open right now I called the action
called the action ahead under components
and I'm also going to want more padding
on the top and bottom so let's come in
here and do my media query at media and
width of 725 pixels so right away the
padding will be like 10m I need a lot
more space 10 M 0 whoops 0 I need a lot
more space cool nice and now I want to
bring in those pinkey things so those I
mentioned will be done with some pseudo
stuff so my and before and my and after
and I can do a lot of it on both of
these
so my content for both of them is
nothing my display for both of those
will be block my width
I shouldn't have to play with that's
given the background color of accent
which is that bright pink and a position
of absolute which also means that this
needs a position position of relative
okie-dokie so that's good to go
position:absolute
okay I think that's it now let's focus
on my before first so on my before I
want it to start at the top right top
let's just do top:0 bottom:0 laughs 50%
I just want to see it to make sure
there's something there there's
currently nothing there um content
display:block is good position is
absolute top bottom left why don't I see
anything then let's do my little inspect
on here I should have a before top and
bottom I have a top bottom and it has a
lift I come I don't see it okay let's
take off the left for now then just for
fun 100% oh okay it is working okay with
top bottom because I only did a left I
didn't do a right that's fine I want to
just move it over actually let's just so
you can see what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
do a transform on it transform and a
skew skew
I always forget what X&amp;amp;Y let's try this
45 degrees that's sort of what I want
but now it's it's the opposite right but
it's actually sort of what I want to do
and now I just need to move it over so
I'm gonna do a laughs yeah I want to
move it towards the left so it's just
try negative 100%
and it should move over half look at
that it just sort of sliding the whole
thing way over to the left
except this skews not enough I want this
to be a lot sharper 7502 sharp 60 hey
we're getting there I think that
actually looks pretty decent
I forgot my border though let's go back
up to here border of 1m solid white aha
okay so that's good this this line here
is my after that I haven't done yet so
let's do my after I'm gonna copy you I
see we're gonna have a little problem
but it'll be easy enough to fix
after I'm just trying to think now I
just want this instead of being left I
just wanna move that to the right
instead haha
awesome actually I'm surprised that
worked out so well so the problem now is
I see this big white line here and this
big white line here and that's just that
the fact that the border is showing up
but luckily that's gonna be easy to fix
so this one my bottom will actually be
negative one M so I know my border
thickness is 1 M so I just want to move
it down what and then this one is the
top negative 1 M so moving whoops I have
to have a one on there of course that's
a little bit of a problem but we can fix
that with a simple overflow:hidden here
we go hey that went much faster and
better than I thought it would let's
just make sure that I don't cover up my
text I'm covering up my text of course
I'm covering up my text and if this was
no it doesn't matter okay good
I'm covering up a lot of my text at one
point there actually
oh no I'm still covering up text okay
this should have a container in it to
hold it because it's going to wide
call-to-action I'm gonna do a dot
container dot container call-to-action
and closed if and my call to action
container my call to action container
dot call to action container what will
this do it will width of like 50% and
this should be in my media query do the
real except it's not working
container called you action and actually
even that should be doubled
what's going on it's still not working a
container called you action the only
thing I can think it was this is in the
wrong spot it is because it's okay let's
just tab that all the way back container
container container haha there we go
that's looking better so it's being held
there it's turning off I'm still
covering a little bit there were just
way too much there actually there's a
lot of pink going on there right and
then as we get to there it starts
getting better and better so I just
think this instead of 100 I'm going to
move those over even more 125 negative
125 and now I moved them over too much I
can barely see oh yeah they're getting
smaller and smaller and smaller and
smaller and smaller and bigger and
bigger and bigger and bigger I sort of
want that to be the other way around
right I don't want them to keep getting
smaller but at the small screen size
it's good that's even worse wait wait
wait why when I had a hundred percent it
was like gone 100 100 that's not so bad
why did that look terrible before to me
it looked like they were getting so
small that's weird that's perfect guys
it looks good it's not overlapping
anything is it is it no it never
overlaps of course it's jumping back at
the top that looks nice that looks good
that looks good and then it just ah ha
super that looks awesome
I'm super happy with that um cool to
build a container into here so let's
jump in
to my I really just need to limit let's
say container container footer all these
containers that I'm doing I'm putting
like this in my footer sauce and my
other one isn't my call to action
some people might be cringing at that
they might you know they're probably
saying that they should be in the the
base along with the containers container
just so all the containers are together
for me I find it easier to find
something for the footer in my footer
file but to each their own max width
before I was doing a max width in pixels
and then I spent with M's let's just say
you know it was the 1m is 16 pixels so
10 is 160 it's almost a 210 so let's
just do like 25 my haha yeah I'm happy
with that gifts the only thing I don't
get is why my nav isn't in there did I
not put my nav inside that container
because honestly I nailed it SuperDuper
okay where's my nav wise my nav outside
of that silly-willy let's take this
closing div and take this tab that over
and close that closing div save awesome
possum except don't like I gave it that
width of 80% originally and I don't like
what that width of 80% is doing where
did I do that I did that I'm line we can
just take this right off now I don't
think I need that on there even for the
small screen sizes let's just see no we
don't need that on there because it just
stops it gets to the right spot it locks
in that background is working exactly
how I wanted it to work awesome
so happy with that and I completely
forgot my navigation crud I don't like
having hamburger menus like that I'm
actually going to worry about my
navigation let's go and fix the nav the
Naville not I believe take too long to
do so let's shrink you back down let's
go find my nav file because I built this
with flexbox it will be kind of fast
this should have been the first thing I
did but I completely forgot main of
super you well that's all good the main
thing I'm going to do here is actually
main nav where's my display flex so on
here at media man width of 725 pixels I
want to change my flex direction to row
and to show you what that did it did
nothing apparently
I forgot to tab it there we go that's
what I thought would happen that was
weird
okay so it puts them in a row instead of
going like that so first things first
that is awesome that's done my
background color is on my A's
background boarder bottom I'm gonna turn
off okay we got a few things to do here
though um my height in height is auto
already much better right guys much
better we're getting close
my main nav position will no longer be
absolute um at media men width of 750
pixels 725 position initial its relative
it's fine much better much better much
better and it's cuz they're flexing so
that's shrinking now but that's okay
we're gonna fix that up in a second um
just going through here my L eyes but
I'm just trying to think my main nav
okay I need to take a look at this for a
second
I mean header they're all in my main
header right and there's a display:block
Oh cuz they're in my grid yeah good and
then I my logo and then my main nav and
my main nav the absolutes turned off so
that makes sense
so even in here could I just do a flex
of yeah there was exactly what I wanted
so a flex Avada will stretch it all the
way across now I can come in here and
say I'm just gonna copy this I'm using
it a lot
my border is none cool my my nav toggle
display:none and I just I'm looking for
my background color and I can't find it
um my hover is gonna change to
background border border is it all the
way up here
background accent oops okay background
of none this is give it a margin top of
one M and a margin left of two M that's
when I get it away from there a little
bit it was a little bit too close to my
a policies' for me um so that looks much
much much better I'm overthinking it
text-align:right that not work why not
why is it centered some line items no
the justify content on my nav a the
justify content on my nav a justify
content justify content flex and
perfection super and let's just see
what's happening with my hover now is
it's gonna give me that weird hover so
my hover is also gonna get changed so
well this should actually be here my
hover will be a background
none and a color would show you with my
color of let's just say darken text in
verse by 15% there we go just a nice
little simple hover I don't like that
let's say my color changes to accent ah
it's kind of weird actually that color
I'm gonna lighten that up Leighton
accent I like 50% 25% hmm darken it's
more in line with what I want oh except
my padding is weird
yes it is I didn't think about that
what's going on because they're that
weird shape Oh actually undo that then
flex basis flex basis Otto Otto yeah
because I don't want my aides to be
stretched out so I start filming for a
little bit there cuz I was running into
that little problem I wouldn't take a
mental break it came back and now
everything is there but its side
scrolling all the way out here and I'm
not quite sure what happened I don't
remember it being like that when I left
so I'm just gonna come on my main nav
here and give it a background color cuz
what's going on and of course now there
we go so a background
of oh no I can't do it here sorry
background cuz it turned off my
background background then let's just
change that to pink and it's all the way
out there why is it all the way out
there what in the world did I do okay so
I figured out what happened but I paused
my recording is it was just taking way
too long but I'll show you how I
actually found out that since I do think
it's important thing so obviously that
is an issue and I was looking through on
my inspect element and I couldn't find
anything that would put it there I was
turning these on and off and I was going
crazy and I really couldn't figure what
was happening so eventually what I
decide to do is go over and look at the
computed and computed is cool because
it's going to look at things or actually
before I even got to compute it I went
all the way down and I saw that the
position left on there was gigantic and
I never told it to have that position
left so because I saw that huge number
here I went something has to be wrong so
that's why I went to the computed and on
the computed it's going to show you
everything that has been computed so
you'll see all your user agent styles
and stuff like that in here but I did
find that on the left property I had a
value of the ten seventy three point six
nine here and I went that's really weird
and luckily it also tells me where it's
coming from so it's showing on my in my
CSS line 522 if I wanted to look at my
regular CSS file my main nav has a left
of a hundred percent I didn't look at
this I went oh yeah it's because I was
having that toggle from being a hundred
percent to zero and go back and forth so
that means all I need to do is make sure
and just to take a look at that I had my
left at a hundred percent and I think
before when I was working and I just so
I'm just into a left of zero and save
and it should fix that
Oh except I'm in a tab there we go I'd
open that up so ya know we just saw that
a slider right back in there and that
takes care of that now what I was
talking about before what I'm trying to
do right now is get those two a line on
the right side instead of the left side
of my
lies and to look at what's happening
with the Li is just so we can get a bit
more of an idea let's give these a
border of one pixel solid red so now we
can see that I have this big space here
but my text is stuck on the right I'm
actually wondering for this if I turned
off the Flex what would happen
display:inline inline-block
that's interesting because it's keeping
the same thing oh my eyes are big now
I've tied hang padding padding on
something display:inline yeah there we
go that's a lot better so I just turned
off the my Flex was causing some issues
I couldn't align it the way I wanted to
do so I went back to making my allies
inline block so that's gonna keep them
in the line across the top here my
text-align:right and the last thing I
had to do is I also have my display flex
on my links themselves so I was just
turning that off if you know a better
way of doing that where we could fix all
those issues please please do let me
know because I feel like I should have
been able to do that with Flex box but
everything I was trying just wasn't
working so let's turn off that
background let's get rid of those
borders that we don't need anymore
and there we go this site is finally
finished I have my nice little hover
everything there is working I have a
border on from my hover there um buttons
let's just fix that up a little
housekeeping now right at the end
buttons button primary button I should
also be doing my border color is the
same thing
copy paste save there we go just so we
don't see that border
so that's cool those are working well
this looks nice let's make all this a
little bit bigger now just to make sure
cool cool that list still looks good
everything is looking good my buttons
look nice the hover effect on them
everything is looking SuperDuper awesome
possum guys thank you so much for
watching this whole thing of course
there is another video that is going to
be coming out that were I am going to
quickly look at taking this and putting
it live on the Internet I'm gonna be
doing it with github pages just because
it's super easy to do now that I have
this on github but I'm also I'll look
quickly at pre pro at just how you could
set up an FTP in there if you wanted to
use an FTP instead but the github pages
is a nice way to get websites up and
working online as well so yeah thanks so
much for watching this in the next video
will sadly be the last one in this
series I had a lot of fun building this
site so I'm sort of sad to see it go but
I have a lot of really fun things that I
do plan on working on in the coming
videos so I look forward to seeing you
in the next video if you've liked this
video please let me know if you have any
comments or any better ways of doing
