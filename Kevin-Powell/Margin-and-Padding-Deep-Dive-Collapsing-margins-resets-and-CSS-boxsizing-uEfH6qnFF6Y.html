series where we're going to be looking
at collapsing margins resets and the box
sizing property so stick around hi and
welcome to part two of this series where
we're doing a deep dive into margins and
padding's in this video we're going to
be looking at collapsing margins and
when they don't collapse CSS resets and
resetting our margins and padding's as
well as the box sizing property now one
thing they can cause the most confusion
is collapsing margins a lot of people
really don't understand what they are
what's going on how they're working so
we're gonna start there we're gonna work
from there into when they stop
collapsing eventually we'll get into the
hole resets just get rid of some of how
that's happening or how we can better
handle it and then finally we're going
to be taking a look at the box sizing
property which just makes padding make a
lot more sense alright so welcome back
to code man we're gonna be continuing
our look at margins and padding's so I
have two pens here again the links for
both of these are down below so if you
want to explore them a little bit this
first one is just to give us a really
basic understanding of how collapsing
margins are working then we're gonna go
into text which is a more real-world
example of where you'll run into this
type of problem and also where we'll
explore fixing it and some other stuff
as well so right here what we're gonna
do first you can see I have my demo box
which has the margin 100 top and bottom
and auto left and right just to Center
it and then my box is inside that just
have a color and a height all my other
styling is down below but for demo
purposes we don't need to get into that
I just want to keep all the demo stuff
up here so what the collapsing margins
even mean well a collapsing margin let's
go on my box one here and give this a
margin bottom of 100 pixels and that
will probably do what you expect it
creates an empty space underneath of 100
pixels what a collapsing margin is is if
two things have the same or have margins
that are touching one another their
margins will collapse or one of the
margins will collapse pretty much it
means they'll merge together so if I do
a margin top of 100 pixels on my box -
nothing changes the top margin of this
and the bottom margin of this are
merging into one another so it's not
creating a 200 pixels
based like a lot of people would assume
would happen it would be a more
intuitive behavior but it's not what
happens because CSS that's just how it
is so to highlight how this is working
or not how it's working but what's
actually going on here we're gonna look
at the inspector so I'm just gonna
right-click and choose inspect element
if you're in chrome it would be inspect
and I don't know what they have it in
edge or Internet Explorer and Safari
it's inspect I believe as well the only
difference in Safari so you'll have to
go in your properties and dev tool
settings and stuff to turn it on if
you're in there so this gives me a whole
bunch of stuff actually probably be here
when you turn it and it gives me this
little arrow thing and it's the same in
chrome it's a little different in Safari
it's like a pointer or like a target
thing or something but this lets me go
on top of stuff and highlight what it
looks like and what's actually going on
and if I click on this one here and
gives me their properties but if I go to
computed or layout I can actually see
the box model so the box model is my
margin my border my padding and the
content itself inside so you can see
what I'm doing this it's highlighting
the different parts so I have the
content itself and that yellow area is
the margin on the top I go on this one
there's the yellow margin on the bottom
so you can see that the two margins they
both have a margin but the margins are
the same size and they're just merging
into one another so if I take this one
and I make it 200 pixels that one's
gonna win so here I have a hundred
pixels and it just stops because that is
merging in to this one here which is 200
so the bigger one is gonna win and
that's it and then my smaller one there
is just smaller and does is effectively
nothing it's it's useless the small one
is literally not doing anything at all
so you can see it's a little bit of a
weird behavior but you wouldn't think
that would cause too much issue because
it's not often you'll run into stuff
like this where you're trying to create
a bigger space like that right where
this becomes a big issue is on my first
box here at the top I'm gonna add a
margin top to my box one and you might
have run into this before so you might
be going you know what's gonna happen
trying you know the the logical thing
would be it would move it down inside my
box my demo box here so let's add like
300 pixels to make it big and obvious
and what just happened my whole box move
down I hate this so much
personally but you know we live to get
around it and I just I don't like it
because it's not intuitive and I like
things when they're intuitive and they
work the way you expect them to and no
one would expect something like that to
happen unless you know about it
obviously so what's happening here is I
mentioned before if the margin bottom of
this and the margin top of this were
touching they've merged together so in
this case because my one and my demo box
both start at the same point even though
this is the child of this one they're
both lined up together at the top so
their margins technically are touching
so if their margins are touching they
merge together so if I go and I look in
my inspector here sometimes you're
hovering around trying to figure out
what's causing it you can't move there's
a big empty space I don't know what it
is that's not just my body there must be
something else eventually you figure out
it's the thing inside the thing that's
actually causing it because you know
whoops let's just click on here if I use
here so I'm I won but if I'm looking at
it in here I'm going I'm looking at my
demo box and there's a huge space on top
of my demo box I don't get what's going
on I see that there's the my margin here
and here but yeah I set that up what's
going on why is there that giant gap oh
it's coming from this and sometimes it's
not even this one right it's like nested
like seven deep because you just have a
bunch of divs going on or something so
it can be a bit annoying to try and find
but yeah that that's kind of weird now
one solution I've seen or just to show
you you know what what I mean by the the
margins touching is if there's anything
to create a separation between them so
here if I give this a border top of say
15 pixels so we can see it solid black
it gives me a border so now I have a
hundred pixel margin then a border and
then my 300 pixel margin so this border
is going in between the two margins it's
creating a separation between the two
they're no longer touching each other so
there are no longer collide
singing or merging together so one
solution I've seen from time to time is
padding top one pixel so what's
happening here is we can't even see it
it's so small
so let's just make that like 10 pixels
so we can see it on our screen see that
purple line now on the screen at the top
here just over here we'll see that
purple line that's the padding so the
padding is creating a space between the
margin and the content inside of my demo
box so that's creating a separation
between the margin of this and the
margin of this so I've seen people set
that to one just to create a little like
invisible line and then use their margin
on this like they would expect to but
why do that when you could just say that
this padding top is 300 and then you
don't have to worry about a margin on
that at all you're already setting a
padding top on this anyway so just do it
all in that so again padding is creating
space inside of something margin is
creating space outside of something but
padding is a lot more behaves in a way
you'd expect it to behave a little bit
more so padding doesn't merge because it
doesn't margins can merge together or
collapse together is the technical way
of saying it so you might be saying I'm
never gonna run into a situation like
this these boxes this isn't a realistic
thing so let's look at something a
little bit more realistic and we're also
gonna use this to push things a little
bit more into our resets and and look at
some other behaviors that you might not
expect as well so here we just have some
basic text again there's some more
styling down below that doesn't really
matter too much for what we're doing
here so here I have this nicely set up
I'm happy with my text but there's some
stuff I want to do one here so one thing
to know is that by default all text has
margin on it that's why we have space
around everything here right so I'm
getting all these spaces everywhere this
is all just coming from margin all our
text as margin not for sure cuz h1 sits
a little smaller but as a general rule
of thumb the margins on your text is
about the size of the text size it's
usually set to 1m it's like point eight
three or something for each one so here
I have a div class of intro and then
ivon h1 inside
of it so what I see sometimes happen is
someone does intro background blue
that's good light blue maybe so it looks
a little bit light blue there we go
so that looks okay but you know what I
don't want my I want my text to be a
little lower down I don't really want it
to be there and well they're already
doing some styling so they already have
like their intro each one they have you
know font size - let's do like I don't
know 50 pixels make it bigger something
like that and then they go Iowa the
color is steel blue so they're styling
wait they're text so while they're in
there texting I want some more space
around it so let's add some margin top
of 50 pixels oh I thought it didn't work
let's make it bigger and weight the
whole that can't be right
I'm putting it on my text I want the
space on my box my box my text is inside
my box this is the collapsing margins
guys even though in a lot of the time
this is just the way that the text is
rendering you'll get like a spacing
around it so it looks like your textures
and touching it but it is cuz you have
your intro and then you have your h1 so
what's happening is this is merging with
that then they go okay let's just like
add like padding of like 10 pixels here
and like boom it's massive
okay because they have the whole thing
here so we can just take all that off
but now okay I have my padding of 10
pixels but that's not ten pixels that's
huge what's going on why is it so big
now this is because of the default
margin on here so I'm just gonna do a
little inspect on here inspect is your
friend it's always what's going to solve
your problems so you can see h1 has a
margin top and a margin bottom so you
can see that we have a margin top and
bottom on there and after the margin
there's a padding so what you'll often
have to do when you really want to
control how something is gonna look is
then have a margin of zero on it so now
that there's a margin zero on it I can
control exactly how big I want this
padding to be whether I wanted to be ten
fifty whatever I want now the font is
rendering a little
because there's some extra space on the
top and bottom so it's not perfect but
you get a much more fine tuning once you
get rid of those margins now just really
quickly if we look at all of our text
all of our text has a margin top and
bottom and what's happening is you can
see here and this one they're merging
together they're doing the whole
collapsing Martin thing and here and I
have my list there so we can see that
they're collapsing together and once
again here they're collapsing together
we have tons and tons with text is just
constant collapsing margins oh and just
one thing really fast in case ever
you're you're doing something and you're
like some spacing issues get really
weird I'm a demo box here if I change
this to a display grid because you want
to use some nice CSS grid stuff let's
just undo that see how everything it's
collapsing margins so like my spacings
not terrible and then when I turn off
that and see how the spacing just all
got a lot bigger so display grid
collapsing margins no longer collapse
and this is the same also for display
grid display grid then a current flex
flex box is the same thing I'll also
have to do like Direction column for
this though so let's turn off my display
flex you can see they're closer together
and when I turn that back on they all
get spaced back out so just to know
sometimes when you change the parent
container it changes the way the
collapsing margins work on the children
weird
it's how CSS works and it's with display
flex display grid I think is the only
time that actually happens but don't
take my word on that there might be then
those are the times to probably run into
it the most anyway so just be aware that
that might happen so a lot of things
come with a lot of different things come
with our defaults so like we were just
looking at so again if I look here I
have my paragraphs my h1 all the way to
h6 h2 h3 here I have a pre for like code
blocks and stuff those have margins on
them this is a list my list items all
have padding and margin on them figures
have margins on them everything this is
a quote I think is that a quote that's
just a paragraph okay well it's just a
paragraph I don't know it's indented but
you know everything comes with some sort
of default on it almost it's it's kind
of frustrating so one thing you might
want to do and you don't have to do this
but a lot of things that people do
especially when they're first starting
off is they just want to turn all the
margins and padding off all of them off
because that way they don't run into
issues like this and there's not these
weird things happening so we can do that
with the wild card selector which is
just this this just means select
everything selects everything any
element it's selected the only thing
this one won't be selecting is pseudo
elements but we're not going to get into
that and they're our way of selecting
those two but we can do this so I'm
selecting everything and I going to say
margin:0 padding:0 and when I do that
you can see everything just gets stuck
together now my lists get a little
screwed up because they had their
padding so this does mean you're
overriding everything so if you do have
lists you do probably want to have to
add padding back to them so they're not
sticking out the side and looking really
ugly it might cause some issues along
the way with some other stuff so just be
aware that you're starting from scratch
but sometimes starting from scratch is
easier because you probably wanted to
change a lot of those things as well so
now what I could do is I could just say
h1 h2 h3 margin bottom is like 0.5 M and
even margin top is say 1m so what that's
meaning is the space on the top is
bigger now then the space on the bottom
and to me that makes more sense because
now the heading is closer to the content
that it should be with which is an
important thing we'll be talking about
more in the next video I could say my
paragraphs have only a margin bottom of
even like 0.75 M maybe if you'd not sure
about m/s it just means that so you have
my font size is 10 this would be 7.5
it's in relation to the font size so
your font size is 20 then it's 75% of it
this would be 50% exact
we the same so my font size is 50 my
margin top is 50 I do have a whole video
on m/s and REMS if you're curious more
about those um but we're not going to
get too much into that but yeah it just
means you're coming through and you're
manually bringing it all back in
afterwards so you do have to take into
account that this can cause some issues
like with my lists here that you'll have
to be doing everything from scratch and
maybe you don't want to do that if
you're used to the defaults
sometimes that's okay and you get used
to it and you just work around them but
sometimes the defaults really do cause
some issues and it can be easier just to
reset everything and then move on from
there also just here I'm adding margin
top on my headings but pretty much for
everything I try and use margin bottom
only just by sticking with margin bottom
on everything you know where your
spacing is coming from use your padding
all over the place because padding is a
little bit different because you're
pushing things inside you're adding
background color to stuff but when it
comes to margins just as much as
possible and there's always gonna be
exceptions but if you can just go I'm
always gonna use margin bottom you
always know where the space is coming
from you just look at it I look at this
I see a space I know where that space is
coming from I know you just know because
it's always coming from the thing above
because that's your everything is margin
bottom so that could be one if you are
using a reset try and stick a margin
bottom all the time and it will probably
make your life a lot easier in your own
coding okay so with that out of the way
let's get into the last thing of this
video which is box sizing and this is
what can also make your life a lot
easier so to look at this I'm actually
gonna go back to this video right here
and let's go down to number three
because we never got to play it with
number three and he's lonely so I'm
gonna give him a width of 100 pixels
alright and let's actually put some
content in here let's make its height a
bit bigger too it's making a little an
actual box and let's just write hello
world in there so we have some content
does that fit it's a little tight color
white and you know what let's take these
two out because we don't need them okay
so we have hello world perfect Oh
oops and you know what make this a
little bit bigger just there we go okay
we're good so here I have my box it's
200 pixels by 200 pixels and I have this
text inside of it now I don't want my
text to be touching the side or touching
the top I want to create some empty
space around that so you know let's use
some padding so I mean your padding top
50 pixels and a padding left of 50
pixels but oh man my whole box just got
bigger because remember the total size
of something is the margin plus the
padding plus the border all three of
those come together to make the total
size so now my box is actually 300
pixels the 250 pixels tall because I
added 50 pixels and it's also 250 pixels
wide here oh that's kind of annoying
right and just to show you let's turn
number two back on just for a second and
we'll actually just do height 200 pixels
width 200 pixels let it just be like our
our baseline so this was the original
size and now we can see that it's gotten
wider and that's annoying because then I
have to go all my width is actually now
has to be 150 and this should be a
hundred and fifty okay let's go take a
look again okay now it's you know what
them I think it's a little big let's
actually make this 30 and 30 whoops
where do we go 30 and 30 oh man now I
have to change this to 170 and 178 the
picture it's annoying you have to keep
sort of playing with them you don't want
to do that do you know you don't so what
we can do for this is we can use box
sizing so box-sizing the default is
content of content box which means that
the size of the box is on this one here
the content let's hover on this boom
there we go so the size of the box when
I'm giving it a width and a height is
calculated based on the content box it's
looking at only the content box we can
change box-sizing to border box there's
no padding box
they tried I think they they wrote a
spec for it but nobody supports it so
there's no padding box there's content
box and border box there's
also no margin box content box or border
box and oh look at that smaller now so
what's actually happening now is whoops
2000s a little big it's calculating the
padding part as part of the total size
so it's going okay I need to be a total
height of 200 pixels so my padding is 30
so my content will be 170 and the same
here for the width well I need to be 200
and I have 30 so I'm going to adjust my
content box inside to be 170 so my total
is 200 and if we come when we add a
border around here border 25 pixels
solid red you can see it's adding that
border inside of my box instead of
adding to the total size because if we
take this off it's by default everything
would add to the total size so the
border box just makes for me makes my
life so much easier because now instead
of always having everything get bigger
and bigger and bigger and having to
really figure out your widths and
Heights and well Heights you probably
won't use too much but you it can get
annoying so this just make sure that
padding is always adding to the inside
of your box it's really just pushing
things in it's not creating extra empty
space on the yeah it's not creating
extra empty space it's just pushing
things inside your box which i think is
a more intuitive way of working and in a
lot of projects since you're already
setting up something like a reset or if
you are setting up a reset and even if
you're not you can still use this I
can't come on here and say that your box
sizing is order box and I do that like
all the time I don't usually actually
use my reset just I don't know why but I
will use this pretty universally I find
this is like a lifesaver it just makes
things much more intuitive and easy to
work so it makes padding make a little
bit more sense and it makes it work the
way you sort of expect it to so you know
a long
your your resets that you did you can
just add it in there so I hope you've
learned something about what we
discovered and if you did of course
leave a comment down below to let me
know or if you have any questions don't
be shy go down to the comments as well
also if you ran into a strange behavior
or something you're not understanding
with margins or padding's that I haven't
talked about please also let me know
down in the comments if you liked this
video and you haven't yet subscribed to
my channel I encourage you to subscribe
because you get more content like this
every single week next video we're going
to be looking at is a real world example
of using the white space that we can
create with margins and padding to make
a really nice-looking layout before we
get to that though I just want to give a
big shout out to all my patrons who
helped make this possible if you'd like
to support me or just learn more about
