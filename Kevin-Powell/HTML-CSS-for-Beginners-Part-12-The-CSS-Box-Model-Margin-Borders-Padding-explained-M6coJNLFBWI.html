got a really simple page here we have
our title I've got a div with a class of
box on it with a paragraph in there and
everything we're going to be doing today
is with our CSS so I'm gonna come down
here and we're gonna start doing a
little bit of CSS another thing that I'm
going to throw in that I haven't looked
at yet is some comments because I think
they're gonna be useful if you remember
back in HTML sorry I said we weren't
gonna be in here but look this is an
HTML comment and there's my HTML comment
it's just a little reference for myself
we can also put comments in CSS but if
you use an HTML comment in CSS it will
break your CSS and cause things not to
work and that causes a whole bunch of
heartache and you're wondering what you
did wrong and it's really annoying
so do not use HTML comments in there you
have to use the CSS comments and CSS
comments /a star this is my comment star
forward slash closes the comment so it's
a little bit easier to write and let's
do know this is the box model the CSS
box model to be exact
okay so I have my CSS box model that we
want to explore and it's a weird name
kind of weird in general but it's not
too complicated so when I'm gonna start
with is I'm just gonna give my box a
background and let's make it pink I've
been using pink a lot but it stands up
nicely on this background without being
too abusive on the eyes so I have a box
there's my box it's nice and pink and
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
gonna give this box a width of 300
pixels and I'm going to save that and
hit refresh so now I have a box it's 300
pixels and the height just just
automatically calculated and I can
obviously come in there and give it an
actual height as well if I want now
there's three different parts to the box
model and this
why I want to show you comments but the
three different parts are margin will be
looking what that is
I have padding and I have the border and
I put those in the wrong order but
that's okay a little cut paste the real
so I have my line it all up I have
margins borders and padding and we're
going to be looking at all three of them
margin is nice and simple I'm gonna do a
margin of 50 pixels I'm gonna save this
and I'm gonna hit my refresh button and
you can see it moved over a little bit
so it sort of popped off to the side
let's make that even bigger let's make
it 500 pixels so we can really see it
and it's moving all the way down there
and I even have a scroll bar going up
and down on my page now what margin is
doing is it's creating an invisible
space all around my box that nothing can
go in so let's add a little bit more
text actually after this we could use
another paragraph so I'll just copy this
one so I've got this 500 pixel space and
just to show it even more there's my
paragraph after so I have 500 pixels
here and then I have 500 pixels here and
I have 500 pixels there it's pushing
everything away by 500 pixels and it's
even doing 500 pixels on it's putting
500 pixels on all sides so let's jump
back up to here and let's just make that
a more reasonable 50 pixels save that
refresh and there we go 50 pixels here
50 pixels there and 50 pixels over here
as well and well that's what margin is
it pushes things away and we can control
any of these with say I can do a margin
top 50 pixels so it's only going to look
at the margin top so here I have 50 and
then those ones it's keeping at the
defaults that we had before now you do a
margin bottom of 100 pixels save
and it pushes that down 100 pixels I can
do a margin on the left of let's say 200
pixels and it will push it over by 200
and I could do a margin on the right too
except we won't see anything happen
because there's nothing over here on the
right side so let's just bring that back
to any margin 100 pixels and refresh and
there we go there's my box and let's
take it next look the next one is our
border border has three different
properties that we need to worry about
so it's probably the most complicated
one or it is we have a border width
first of all so I'm going to do a 5
pixel border I'm going to have a border
color of red and I'm gonna have a border
style and I'm just gonna bit solid for
now it's the one you'll see the most
often but we'll look at a few different
border styles in there
so I've saved that I'm gonna hit refresh
and you can see it's put a border all
the way around my box and that's pretty
simple it's a red border it's five
pixels thick and it goes all around the
sides just like my width I can add a
border only on some size so I could say
border left and I'm just gonna copy that
save refresh and I only get a border on
the left and you know I could actually
use this and then come in with our
border right width of 10 pixels border
right style of solid and a border right
color of green and refresh and then I
get a green border over on that side
you'll also see it doesn't really matter
the order that I put them in with color
style and with the style of color and
you could any order you put them in it
will work fine but what did you forget
one of them let's take off my border
left style and it just disappears
completely
including
with the width just doesn't isn't
included there so what if I forget the
color the color won't go to a default
and if I forget a size it shows up
anyway I didn't save my CSS bad there we
go the width does have a default on it
so if you forget the width you should
still see a border it's defaulting to
what looks like two pixels if you forget
the color it will go to a default color
and if you forget the style it just
won't show up so make sure you have a
style there is a shorthand for all this
you can just do border and write the
three properties you want five pixels
solid green and I get on all sides or
you could of course do a border left
five pixels solid red and I wonder
what's gonna happen now I have a border
and a border left
well this one is second so this should
work and this should overwrite the left
side and there we go my left border is
now red whereas the rest of them are all
green if I accidentally put this one up
here it doesn't work because what's
happening is it's making the left border
red and then it's coming here going well
all my borders are green so all the
borders are becoming green the order
here really matters it's a continuation
of the Cascade and the way the Cascade
works it's reading through this in order
so it's making all of my borders green
and they like oh the one on the left
should be red instead and we can do that
I mentioned that there's other options
and solid so let's just keep that and
let's just change border style and
dashed dotted double groove hidden means
you don't see it none we don't see it
inset Ridge solid outset a lot of these
are really ugly just so you know let's
try they groove
and what's gonna happen now is it's
gonna set them all to green solid it's
going to make the left one red and then
my borderstyle instead of being solid is
gonna get overwritten again and turn to
green and let's just make this a lot
bigger 15 just so you can see it a
little more it's putting this really
ugly 3d effect on it
that's the groove let's try it in set
one too many semicolons inset and it
does another really ugly one let's try
the double is not terrible double is a
double border
there's dotted gives me square dots this
obviously looks better if it's a smaller
number not as ugly even though I
wouldn't not super nice either right now
but you get the idea in general solid is
what I'm going with and in general I'm
not overwriting the same style a whole
bunch of times I'm making one style and
I'm sticking to it
and let's make that 10 and there we go
I got my red border now the last one is
padding and people mix up padding and
margin all the time because they work
really similar to each other so I'm
gonna make the value of them both the
same and right away you're gonna see the
difference I'm gonna hit refresh here
and won't look at that my box is huge
now padding and margin both work in a
very similar way and they both create
empty space
the difference is margins create empty
space without a background color padding
creates empty space with the background
color and that's a very big distinction
the problem is if you don't have a
background color you don't see the
difference especially if you don't have
a border either they both look like
they're sort of doing the same thing I
have margin and I have padding what's
the big deal let's bring that back so we
have our box there we go so but it's a
very big difference margin is pushing
away from things
empty invisible space padding is
creating empty
faced with my background color and
that's a very very important thing to
remember I think I need more background
I need padding and just like all the
other ones I can do different things I
can say are different sides padding top
25 pixels padding left 25 say 50 pixels
tabbing right 100 pixels and padding
bottom three hundred pixels make a big
big padding on the bottom there so I
have my 25 on the top 50 on the Left 100
on the right and my big 300 pixels down
here on the bottom both for margin and
for padding there's shorthand for doing
this if you want things to be different
though so let's say I want my padding
and I want to do 50 on the top 100 on
the right 300 on the bottom and let's
just do 25 on the left this time it's
gonna change a little bit I think yeah I
didn't keep the same numbers this is
going top right bottom left and the it's
not that way we end a comment and let's
put that underneath there we go so top
right bottom and left it's like a clock
so we start here we go around clockwise
and that's the only way you'll ever
remember it if you try and just go you
know the order of it seems pretty random
and then till you go clockwise and then
it sort of makes sense
I can also shorten it up so we know if I
just do 100 pixels it's just going to
put 100 pixels on all four sides and if
I put two values pixels you'll see that
it's doing it's starting at the top
again so it's going to keep doing this
the wrong way it's doing top and well I
can't fit it in the way I'd want this
first value is top and bottom and the
second value is left
right so if you know your top and bottom
are the same and your left and right are
different from the top and bottom but
they're the same as each other you can
write it out like this and it's much
faster to do and you can do the same
thing with your margins so 100 pixels
and 0 will make it a hundred on the top
and bottom and zero on the left and the
right so it should come close over to
here you can add a third value in there
so 100 and 200 pixels means 100 on the
top zero left and right and 200 on the
bottom so my left and right are the same
my top is this and my bottom is right
there and you can do that for your
padding as well and let's just change
that one back to 100 now the last thing
to remember with the box model is the
way widths are calculated so right now
the width of my box is 300 pixels and
that's 300 pixels starting here and
ending right here and I'm going to bring
up something it's called the inspect
element it's just gonna help us
visualize all of this a little better
and I do have an entire video on this
but just very quickly you can see there
is my paragraph and there we go this is
what I was looking for the blue box
there has the width of 300 pixels on it
so I have a 300 pixel box but then on
the left and the right I have an extra
25 pixels of padding so I have 25 pixels
here and I have 25 pixels here and then
I have an extra 10 pixels here and an
extra 10 pixels here and then I have an
extra 100 pixels here and one extra
pixels here 100 extra pixels here all of
this together is what gives me my total
width the height is the same thing the
height of it isn't well I don't have a
height set so height doesn't really
matter so the total width of this whole
thing isn't 300 pixels the total width
of this entire thing
is 300 pixels plus a hundred on my
margin plus a hundred from my margin
because remember this margin is left and
my margin on the right plus padding of
twenty-five on the left plus a padding
of twenty-five on the right plus a
border of ten plus a border of ten which
should give me let's see how fast I can
do my math three four five five fifty
five sixty five seventy hopefully I got
that right
gives me a total width of five hundred
and seventy pixels right now this might
not seem like the most important thing
to remember but very soon we're gonna
have two things that go next to each
other and if they run out of room they
don't go next to each other anymore they
fall one on top of each other
so understanding how the box model works
we have our margins our border and our
padding so margin is empty space around
my block or on my element border is
border or stroke around my element
stroke for anyone who's coming from
Photoshop or illustrator and padding is
empty space with background around my
element and all of these add on top of
my on top of width and height and the
width is really the more important thing
here so I'm not you know I'm setting a
width of 300 but this is much bigger
than 300 now and just to show you
padding of say 500 and right away you'll
see whoops let's just you 500 on all
sides and now I have like my big
scrollbar here even though I've only
told this that it should be 300 pixels
it's clearly not only 300 pixels because
I have my big scrollbar it's way too big
for my screen now so that's the CSS box
model it's not too complicated there's a
few
to remember in their but the biggest
takeaways margin is empty space pushing
things away padding is empty space that
includes my background so every time I
need more background I add padding and
the border gives me borders around my
box and all of those add on top of the
total size of my box I have the original
box plus my margins plus my border plus
my padding and it's important to
remember and they also go in that order
I didn't mention that but it's always my
box my padding my border and then my
margins on the outside of that and it's
always going to be in that order it
doesn't matter which way you write it
here if padding comes first it's still
gonna look exactly the same you can't
change the order of them so that's it
for this video hope you liked it and
I'll see you in the next video we're
gonna keep getting through this very
soon you're actually able to make your
own page with your own layout and we're
getting close again if you have any
questions any comments make sure you
leave them down below in the comments
and I can't wait to see you at the next
