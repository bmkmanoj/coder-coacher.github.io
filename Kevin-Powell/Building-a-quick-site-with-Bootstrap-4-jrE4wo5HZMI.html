to be setting up a couple of things
give me a second and we'll get started
hi a couple people here thanks for
joining me in the chat nice to see you
basically what I'm gonna be doing today
is building out a website using
bootstrap really quickly as fast as I
can it's going really well thank you
human error ribeiro Eber no you bear no
really sorry for anyone who joins in the
live chat if I don't pronounce your
names properly I'm always have a little
bit of trouble with that I hope you're
doing well thanks for joining tonight or
whatever time it is where you are so the
story behind this I needed I didn't do a
video this week yet and I felt bad about
that I've been under the weather a bit
and I wanted to do one using something
else how you wish thanks for joining us
so what I want to do is build a website
really quickly with bootstrap and the
reason for that is I'm actually teaching
in the classroom an introduction to
bootstrap class and I just thought of a
new project that I wanted to do
probably on Friday so I have a couple of
days to get this done but I wanted to
have a few little things prepared before
I got there so I'm gonna do two pages of
a multi-page website more or less just
apologize I might be coughing a little
bit from time to time I'm getting over a
cold but hopefully it's not too bad
oops
let me know how the stream health is and
if things are not going well because
it's telling me it's low right now the
navbar section hi Ryan
yeah navbar can be a bit of a bit of a
pain with this so it will be one of the
first things we are doing luckily I am
gonna be using SAS for this just you
know but I've done a really basic setup
on my SAS I just have my main one where
I'm gonna be importing variables I'm
gonna be importing the bootstrap just
the whole bootstrap thing and then I'm
gonna be writing all my code in one
place I'm not trying to do best practice
we're trying to I want to be doing this
as quickly as possible pretty much I do
have some text files here that I do need
so let's get those open basically it's a
website for a food like a bakery type
place let's just move well that's not
what I want I'll move this down I didn't
think of needing my text file right away
but that would have been smart so it's
for like a bakery type of thing so I'm
gonna start just by doing a really quick
sort of throw together to have the
layout properly set up and then after
that I'm gonna run through and actually
style it and everything put some
pictures in and all the fun stuff good
to know I'm not the only one who has
trouble with the pronunciations alright
so let's get started on this so this is
going to be a bar that goes all the way
across the top I have my navigation I
don't have a logo I didn't make a logo
so we won't have a logo for now we'll
just put the name so let's just get
started and see how this goes I'm not
even sure really where to start with
this or I before I do my navbar I guess
we're gonna do oh I don't even know what
to call this at your service and the
telephone number top bar not the best
name in the world in there I'm going to
have a container with a row with two
columns column times two so each one
will just have a power
in it for now so copy that and I'll copy
this one do you have any questions while
I'm doing stuff please ask away in the
chat I definitely appreciate it
and on this row what I'm also going to
do is I want my columns to be spaced out
as much as possible so I'm gonna do a
just defy content oh geez I figured what
they call it around between I think is
what they call it I'm not sure if that
worked
we'll come back to that after I don't
want to be jumping into the
documentation now I know you can do a
justified content center oh it would
probably work actually if I did like a
column 3 3 yeah so this is getting
pushed all the way to the right side
that's getting pushed all the way to the
left make that a 4 and a 4 I'm gonna
worry about breakpoints and all of that
a little bit later as well as we go yeah
so let's just keep going um so okay we
have that now we need the nav bar
so the nav bar I do use this one we will
be going to the documentation I don't
like writing there nav bar Oh from
scratch because it's just there's too
many different classes and everything to
remember when it comes to their nav bar
and I just I don't use it clearly enough
I don't use bootstrap all that often
actually except when I'm teaching it in
class these days bar so I'm just going
to take do I want this big one yeah
let's just take this big one here copy
that and paste that right in and save
that and see what it looks like
of course I'm just gonna change this
right now on the nav bar there's usually
only two parts you really have to worry
about
there's the nav itself where we have the
nav bar navbar expand the light and this
I'm gonna change mine to a BG dark just
so we can actually see it a little
better on the screen if your BG is dark
you probably want this to also be nav
bar dark so the text changes to light
and here navbar expand LG I'm gonna
change this to small because I want to
see everything right now so this is
talking about where does it break so at
small screen sizes now it turns into a
drop-down menu instead of at the large
screen size you can change small medium
large all there bootstrap stuff you can
play around with in there Darryl I just
used the call for I didn't put in them
the MD yet because I don't know which
one I want to use quite yet I don't
think I'm gonna stick with this we'll
see though as I go and with the new with
bootstrap for you don't have to put a
breakpoint if you don't want to but I
will put one in eventually because if
not it looks probably really weird on
cell phones and stuff it might be okay
we'll see oh no my screen keeps freezing
I had a problem last time I did a live
stream too and I don't know what's
causing it because my internet should be
fine okay let's just try one thing I
don't like bringing this up when I'm
recording but that's okay settings now
let's back up to where I put it it
shouldn't hopefully it over time
did I just know don't restart my
computer now of course it wants to do
that while I'm streaming hopefully it
sorts itself out I had this problem
before and it sorted itself out as the
stream went hopefully the same thing
happens this time fingers crossed
sorry about that guys I need to figure
out what's happening with that
mm yeah it just keeps up and down I
don't know why it jumps around so much
so here yeah so we have the navbar
expand small which is good because now I
can see everything so I can delete the
stuff I don't want I don't want my
drop-down menu which means I also don't
need all of that I don't need the
disabled one I don't need the forum I
think for now I'm gonna save that so
it's nice and simple now I'm gonna need
more than that but I'm gonna do just one
thing right now where is it I have my mr
auto so the UL always comes with the
class or if the one I copy has the mr
auto and that's margin-right:auto I
change that to an Origin left auto it
shoots the links off to that side so
that looks a little bit nicer and also
in here I'm going to do a div class
container and we'll just close that all
the way down here just so everything
lines up nicely oh that's not text right
yeah there we go okay so that's lining
up on the right side now and everything
looks good
of course I'm gonna need more links I'll
just add like a few for now even though
I'm not really look that's fine
just fix the alignment on those I'll
come and actually put some real links in
there after now we get to the fun part
of the layout pretty much I'm just
looking at how can you override the
color of a navbar say you want it like
stripes the navbar you can use this BG
dark they have the BG light too they
have BG primary they have all those
things so if I do primary to go to their
blue at one point I'm actually going to
change the bootstrap primary to be the
colors that I want em which we should be
getting to relatively soon you could
also just take this off and now it won't
have a background color on it and I'll
change this to navbar light so I could
do something like that
and then in my you know then I get to
say navbar
I think this worked background linear
gradient red blue the SAS is going to
compile kind of slow yeah there we go so
I can I could technically do something
like that and then just put whatever
background I want on there you could get
an image repeating image that's just
going to make your stripes or whatever
you want on there is one way to do it
but I'm gonna stick with it for now like
this and just change what the primary
and all of that is so the screen is
clear now so glad to hear that
and I won't be doing a lot of videos on
bootstrap for probably but you know if
demand is high enough maybe I'll come
back to it every now and then the thing
I like about bootstrap and what I'm
hoping to show here is just how fast you
can build websites with it so I do think
there's limitations to bootstrap
especially with the grid coming out now
I think part of the beauty of bootstrap
will be lessened a little bit because
it's not going to be you know the grid
just makes the CSS grid is going to be
pretty awesome but making websites with
bootstrap can just be so fast so here
I'm going to use a div class Jumbotron I
think
and in there I guess in each one
there's some weird characters in there
that's okay I think of Sadie lists
whoops they list that's my fake company
Sadie lists for all your corporate or
major events there we go I guess this
could be in strong tags or something
just to make it you know stand out a
little more I'm gonna format all of this
a little bit better will make the
jumbotron look nicer I'm just you know
building this skeleton of the site right
now so that will be there then I don't
know I thought I had more text for the
site I'm sure I used to have more text
but anyway that's okay so here we're
gonna do an H h1
I want this text to be pretty big so I'm
gonna add on the class display one that
should make it really big maybe too big
but we'll stick with that for now here
we'll just do a paragraph of lead I
guess to serve you is a pleasure see
what that looks like oh did they take
lead out there's no way that's the size
it's not their big paragraph oh my
goodness
I thought lead was bigger than that okay
um and this will just be in a div class
equals container
and lead and I guess we can do a text
center up here on that excuse me yeah
I'll be playing around with the
variables pretty soon actually because
as you can see I don't have a lot of
text to be putting in here I thought I
had more maybe we'll get some lorem
ipsum or something just to fill out more
of this layout and this one will just be
a regular paragraph copy that paste that
in this I think I did it I'm gonna add
in a section on this section of like I
don't know
welcome it's a bad name section message
so like a message from the owners of the
company it's a terrible terrible name
I'm bad at naming stuff if anyone wants
to suggest another name I can put on
this but I all means I will accept it
the reason I'm doing that is because I
want to space it out put a background
color on it and stuff like that then I'm
gonna have another section down here
with a class of services and in here we
will have our container with our row
with our columns
I may need three columns each one of
these will have an image plus an h3 I
think that makes sense for the moment
I'm just gonna use some placeholder
images so we have on splut I'm local on
my computer so I need to do the whole
thing on splash it I'm just gonna do
like 600 by 400 and on all of these too
did I make a mistake there oh there
there okay good so then on each one of
these I'm also gonna add in the class of
image fluid to make it fit inside the
column now it's probably getting a bit
too narrow so I will have to add my
break points to those but again right
now I'm just trying to do this really
really fast h3 is here will be catering
service the curry pastries I'm not going
to be pushing bootstrap - it's too too
far just so you guys know what this text
center I'm using mostly their basic
types of things on it for the most part
probably yeah I guess this could be
intro I'm just my Jumbotrons kind of an
intro to you that's okay yeah I'll go
with that thank you for you and then I
just my footer I'm gonna bring in some
some other text after just so we can do
some more interesting stuff sorry for
that that was loud um should all this no
this should be broken up a little bit
right did it uh closed paragraph we'll
just make this a few paragraphs can I
drag I can okay I've been wasting my
time this whole time
I am using a vs code for those of you
who aren't familiar with it and my
footer will also have a class of text
Center awesome so I do definitely need
to make this look a little bit you know
better and I think a bit more text will
also help it out a little bit but let's
start styling this up a little bit
because that's more fun but already just
I don't know I just I love how fast it
goes when you're using bootstrap I'm
just putting something together so the
first thing I'm going to do is I want
some color so I'm going to come into
coolers which is Co olor sco if it's
small on your screen hopefully that's a
little bit bigger
I like this just for fast ideas on
getting color schemes because it's
really fast and easy to use it's such an
awesome resource um so I'm just gonna
push spacebar here and when I push
spacebar you can see that it just loads
in a completely new color scheme I'm
thinking I probably passed a few there
that I would like to actually but let's
keep going I was thinking if oranges
just because bakery I was thinking those
but let's go with something a little bit
more fun I like this blue so because I
like this color I'm just gonna hit the
lock and it's gonna lock it in and now
when I push it it's gonna find other
colors that work well with that are
within general so let's just keep going
I don't want any that are too similar to
bootstraps colors either just so we can
actually make some pretty decent changes
I sort of like these I don't know how
well they'll work I have to let's just
lock you lock you lock you I don't know
if I need a fifth color whatever we'll
stick with these for now and I'll
probably change them as time goes on so
on my variables here what I'm gonna do
is change a few things I'm gonna change
the primary I'm gonna change the
secondary I'm gonna change the dark
let's start with those so my primary
will be let's make you my primary
my secondary will beat you I don't know
if I'm even gonna use that color very
much this one will become my dark save
all that and right away actually you get
this I'm gonna take this off for a
second and that once that compiles you I
don't know if you'll notice too much
okay let's just I'm gonna change it to
this one for the moment whoops just so
we can actually see it change there we
go so now my dark is now this pink color
or orange II pinky whatever color so
because that's my dark the BG dark has
been replaced where's the BG dark that I
had so that's been replaced with this
which I'm using my variables the one
thing they do say is to import your new
variables or your custom whatever they
say to use before their you import the
bootstrap stuff just for fun what
happens to I do it this way so gonna
stop working oh it gave me an error even
is this way giving me an ER I'm still
getting an error why oh this is causing
the air that's why yeah so if the
variables are coming in after it's not
working I need to have these up here so
when I save now it's my variables first
and these are overwriting the things
that are in here which seems a little
backwards but you know that's that's how
it is so that's how it it's because they
use the default flag on stuff and it's
just sort of how it makes things work
can we see the live preview the live
preview my browser is really small can
you not see my whole browser oh no you
should be able to see my home browser it
is small oh my goodness guys sorry
that's weird I thought I had my whole
screen being captured I apologize so
much let's shrink this off and fix that
for you
I'm missing in this will probably wreak
havoc on my stream I am so sorry about
that I tested everything ahead of time
thought I had it set up so you could see
things properly and all that time you
couldn't see it I really apologize thank
you for bringing that up until hopefully
can you guys see everything now I don't
know where my screens getting cut off
because I don't I'll have it in a second
my the streams a little bit behind where
I am right now anyway I'll keep going
for now so I think I'm going to do that
as my colors I should have put some
buttons in here right just so we could
use some some buttons where could I use
buttons um this is where more text would
have been good or even on this let's
just say we do a href is equal to BTN
BTN primary more info
that's not what I expected to see right
there
one second
okay
a little bit of my browser might be
missing but I think you guys got more of
that now that looks pretty good okay I'm
sorry about that again um
- dude you my font size is so big that I
wanted to have the chat here so I could
see it while I'm working
and it's also off the bottom um where is
it stopping one second I know why
no I don't know why
okay can I actually do this live is this
gonna work
it's gonna screw everything up no it's
just gonna cause more problems I'll just
deal with it like this I thought I had
the whole thing I thought I was
capturing my whole screen I don't know
what I was thinking there so let me fix
that up for you guys to be more
something you can actually see a bit
better okay hopefully this is a little
bit better than you can see now now if
anyone knows why my buttons not working
that would be awesome
oh because I did an href another class
that would answer that and the href will
be going nowhere for now that looks more
like what I wanted cool so you can see
now my primary button has also changed
colors so it's not the bootstrap primary
color it's my own color that I just set
up on there
okay so let's save that and now let's
actually make I'll this a little bit I'm
gonna come and probably be changing the
colors a little bit after as well so
let's go right up to there and so what
did I call that my bad names that I had
my top bar so a top bar background of
primary padding of five pixels let's
just do like 0.5 M 0 and see what that
looks like the only problem is when I
save stuff it will be a little slow just
because the rent I'm compiling the
entire bootstrap each time so it might
be a little slow right now there's a
margin bottom on these paragraphs
bootstraps reboot takes the margin off
the top and it only leaves margin on the
bottom which is a really good thing but
it's leaving my spaces off a little bit
here so the spaces that are coming there
I could do it in my own CSS but I could
all
so come on here and class mb0 for
margin-bottom zero if i do that on both
of these paragraphs there we go
it fixes that right up actually you know
what I could do is I could move these
comments to where you guys don't see
them so I can still keep track of that
and then you'll have more real estate
for you guys to see and I can make this
bigger now that I know that I'm not
using the whole screen
and this will work a little bit better I
think and this even there we go I think
this will work much better I'm gonna
disappear for two seconds though sorry
about this guys one second
okay sorry about that and I'm glad it's
looking better I got a few people saying
that it's looking better smiley I'm
doing good how are you doing thanks for
joining in okay so let's keep going here
um so over here what I want to do with
my Jumbotron I eventually want a
background image on that my navbar I
think is okay I'm not sure about my
colors on there but that's okay for now
my jumbo tron I'm just gonna give it
some more padding of like ten viewport
height on the top and bottom zero on the
left and left and right
oh I need to keep some there now let's
just do padding top 15 viewport height
padding-bottom 15 viewport height I
guess I could put a container in there
too and get without having to worry
about you don't want even more than that
which surprises me a bit that's about as
big as I'll go I think all right yes I
tell I am using sass which is why I have
my nice little thing right here and my
imports so my jumbotron um I just put a
background on here my background I let's
just use a for now another placeholder
one so URL HTTP on splash it I'm too
lazy to buy 800 let's say in background
size cover and let's see how that is
looking Q this is why you shouldn't just
take random placeholder image you don't
know what they're gonna look like but
that's okay I'm gonna leave that there
for now where we visit that the next one
I had was my dot intro did I forget to
close something No
why are they I have an extension on it
extensions with sass yeah an extent I
was SAS with vs code which makes the
brackets match colors and as you can see
they're not matching colors so that's
really weird
but the colors does it want me to put
this in that fixed it okay so my intro
I'm gonna give this also a background
color of primary and padding I don't
envy port height 0 I'm a big fan of
viewport height for padding top and
bottom Jumbotron needs a margin margin
bottom zero these font sizes are way too
small though I wanted this to be pretty
big so one thing we can do I'm just
going to shrink this nav down I don't
really want to look at it I did lead but
I think what I might do is a display
like 3 and class equals display for
something like that that's too big what
if I did like 4 and does it go up to 6
or is it 5 the biggest 5 is the biggest
4 it's the biggest what if I did a lead
on this one then I'm trying to do as
much as I can without having to style
anything to serve you as a pleasure I
need some better fonts in here too but
we'll stick with that for now then we'll
get to my services I've not a big fan of
how this is looking actually to be
honest but anyway let's keep going
these I don't know I have to get some
fonts in here too I think
intro on my services
patting we might actually I'm gonna come
in here and make one of my own section
adding of 10 G H 0 just so I don't have
to section padding I think that makes
more sense because then what I do want
to change it later which will definitely
happen I know where to go and change it
hi Mart thanks for joining us ok so
that's looking alright and then I just
have my footer which will be a
background of dark we might as well do
the same padding and color let's go with
white for now cool
good so I mean basic my colors are not
so hot I'm not super happy with it but
it is starting to come together a little
bit just on a very quick basic basic
layout that you can see there what do I
want to do oh man I forgot about this is
that coming from a Jumbotron or from a
little white few pixels there I forget
if that's coming from my job I think it
looks like it's coming from my Jumbotron
I'm gonna have to check that out after
the code I'm doing now I wouldn't say is
a hundred percent good for a
professional environment I'm trying to
throw something together just really
fast so there are parts of it that are I
think are okay but just the way I'm
using my sass files right now I wouldn't
say is something that's from a
professional environment it's more of
just throwing crap together as fast as
possible to make a layout as quickly as
possible where same with here like just
I'm importing all of bootstrap I
should only be importing the pieces of
it that I actually need I should be
having a lot of separate sass files
instead of just one big sass file where
I'm doing everything pretty much but you
know it's and I'm just trying to use
bootstrap as much as possible which is
why I'm also doing some of these things
so it's sort of a mix of yeah it's more
of a quick throw together than perfectly
good but it also gets the job done a
quick and dirty let's say I think I'm
gonna go find some fonts and maybe some
better colors if you guys don't know
type figuration is a cool site because
it gives you color schemes and font
choices from google fonts I really like
types duration a really cool resource to
have there's not a ton of combinations
in here but there's some really nice
ones I tend to use this one a lot
I think it looks nice so I think I'll
take something different this time juju
I don't know this one
okay I'm gonna do this for now and I
might change later on no I won't change
later on I'm running at a time already
as it is
okay so this is cool because you get
your fonts and your colors right here
the only problem that I have is when it
says seeing google fonts whenever I
click on that it doesn't actually bring
me there it just brings me to the Google
Fonts main page as we'll see in one
second so when that loads in its
supposed to bring me to that font but it
doesn't so then you have to look for it
Playfair gotta spell things good though
play fair I want this one plus use play
fair and Laura plus and what sizes do I
need customize Laura I'm gonna just go
with the regular and the bold and play
fair I think I'm just gonna go with the
black for now so I need okay let's go
with the regular and that and I'm gonna
do the add import copy that I'll just
pop this right at the top because why
not I actually don't know what the the
variables are in bootstrap for their
utilities I don't even know where to get
this stuff in here building gaming sass
this is where the theming one is a good
place to go if you want to read up but
making changes to things because I
definitely want to be changing my body
BG at one point and my body color
functions I'm not worried about spacer
I'm not worried about colors due to do I
was hoping it would mention that type
it's probably called font family saw
serif maybe
I was hoping it would just be right
there hmm let me just make this bigger
for one second
functions all theme theme colors
components I could dive into their their
sass file a little bit but I don't
really feel like doing that especially
because I didn't import it proper ID you
have it okay let's go look vendor it's
probably under typography type heading
dududu heading color it font size lead
where's the font
okay one second what am I wasting my
time for here I know I don't have a side
I don't have they really don't have
their font does anyone know what the the
variable is for their fonts family
this is all just for Styles huh I would
have thought it was there I guess
variables would make more sense
colors primary don't they have a thing I
thought I used to have a way of quick
spacer body BG color BG do the in color
this is slowing me down a little bit
fine it is yeah okay or then it's the
font-family base I'll just change this
one cuz that's font family base is set
to this one anyway okay I did it
variables so font family saw serif will
be changed too
which one am I going to change it to
play fair no Laura
yeah there we go that worked it looks a
lot nicer to a much better than what we
had there yeah I should've just done a
search ok so that will be okay and then
for my ice to go back to this for one
second
since I'm in my fonts they just have a
base a saucer if they didn't said
anything else I was just wondering if
they had like a secondary font I know
they only ever use one okay so I'll just
have to set up my own cool so I'll do
font family serif
it's not even saw serif this is let's
this change was it base oh this is not
gonna compile font family we'll call it
heading as
Playfair and see what happens there okay
so that should work and then anywhere I
want I can just set that up so and again
this is where it's not really best
practice but let's just do those three
because that's all I have and should I
also do just in case they do have the
classes for all of those font family
font
save font wait oh is it 800-900 whoops
all right so there we go let's make this
so we can actually read it oh that's my
display one I don't want that to always
be pretty big of course I hate that
picture right now so I'm actually gonna
go and look for a nicer one
so unsplash where I've been using
unsplash it is where I get most of my
bakery images from for stuff for just
like quick things it's all free
commercial free no this is pretty nice
actually for this type of thing there's
some good ones here but I'm wondering if
I can do something fun with this oh I'm
using Firefox save file accept
does this ask me where I want to save it
- no it just downloaded it I usually
immune Chrome I just use Firefox verge
of developing stuff so I'm not usually
downloading stuff here it's probably in
my downloads right bring that off-screen
downloads yeah there it is so let's open
up Photoshop you can see my thumbnail
that I just made drop this in here I'm
just because it's gonna be a gigantic
image and I don't need it to be that big
well export that
I don't know why that export function
takes so long I should just use the old
save for web that would be fine
and again this image is massive massive
massive right now desktop digital is
image mean BG dot jpg shrink that down
and let's see a Jumbotron we can change
this out now image main image main BG
dot jpg I think was what I called it
right cool
so obviously my Jumbotron I want the
text to be white instead so let's just
do that color white and I think what I'm
gonna do just make this bigger
background position coalition Center
right just so I can keep that piece of
bread always being there I think we'll
look the nicest so it doesn't matter
what size screen rat it's always sort of
staying there it's not working quite how
I was hoping that would look in the
white text isn't as nice or as easy to
read as I was sort of going for hmm but
should we stick with it for now what I
was thinking of doing is maybe doing
something like this of having a
container row-column medium six or
something like that and then taking this
h1 inside of there and the reason I
would do that is just so
now my text is just too big or maybe if
we did that isn't eight just so my text
wouldn't go all the way across and then
I did it with the medium breakpoint so
as this shrinks down that's pretty
terrible call them large yeah it's it's
breaking but the font size is just so
big maybe not the best thing yeah I need
to play around with the image a little
bit
one thing I generally do in Photoshop
for background images let's just change
this up to twelve and let's open up
Photoshop again so in Photoshop what
I'll do a lot of the time is I'll just
do a levels adjustment and if I want it
later I can do that or if I want it
darker I can do that and it just does
the whole thing like really really fast
it's for fast adjustments this just
takes white out of the image and this is
just taking black out of the image so
that's one thing that I'll do I don't
know if all of that is on screen for you
guys so yeah this will take white out of
my image that will take the dark out
another thing I like to do is solid
colors on top now let's just go and you
know they take a color that you like
either lower the opacity on it just sort
of do that or play with the blending
modes multiply or an overlay will
usually give you some interesting types
of effects and you can play with the
opacities and all of that as well but I
think I'm just gonna play with my levels
for now to make this a little bit faster
so you know something like that I'm just
going to group these together so I can
export it quickly
and export it's not perfect by any means
but it does definitely look better we
can actually read our text now I don't
necessarily like the white color that I
have on there right now just because
it's too white you know I have like this
brownish color here I have these other
colors that are kinda nice and the white
is just really bright so I'm not a huge
fan of that but yeah I was hoping to get
through more of this but I am sadly
running out of time I need to got work
tomorrow how do you make that responsive
images can you show us how to make with
that bread photo sure dududu there's two
different things we'll look at actually
I'll bring that image if it's a
background image just having the
background size cover sort of so
background there if I take this off what
happens is the image will just you can
see it's repeating itself because it
just doesn't that's what it's gonna do
and it doesn't really adjust or do
anything so a background size cover for
background images is sort of the
responsive fix because it is a
background image depending on the
positioning of it and stuff though it
won't be perfectly responsive but all
parts of it hide like right now it's
cropping the bottom and the top of my
image off and if it gets too small it's
gonna crop the sides of an image off but
that's fine if I were to use that down
here because I am using bootstrap I just
have to use the class image fluid and
this is sort of the magic so even this
image is really big and I would suggest
not using one so big but main main BG
JPEG even though it's a gigantic picture
because I have my image fluid on there
it's just it's working by itself I saved
that without it you can see it's a
gigantic
it's causing everything else to go off
so image fluid right there is you know
the easy way to do it
basically all it's doing is max with
100% height:auto maybe a
display:inline-block on there it would
already be display:inline-block let's go
look fast what are they putting on there
yeah all it is is a max width 100% and
height of auto that will make any image
responsive just don't do it with it
super giant image like that this is like
a 1.6 make image that's now super tiny
Oh
parallax sure this is sort of a fake
parallax but why not we're doing
background attachment fixed and we get
sort of that type of thing going on
which is always fun yeah I agree that
anything like that just makes it nice
the good thing with this compared to a
real parallax is just super I think it's
a lot easier on the computer real
parallax effects with the JavaScript you
can take they can be quite intensive and
not the best you know can cause some
slowdowns and stuff especially on slower
computers or mobile devices and stuff
this is for the the cheap and easy way
to do it right I wouldn't I'm not about
to start getting into the JavaScript now
it is getting late here and I need to
get to sleep very very soon I didn't get
as far into this as I was hoping to but
I will maybe pick this up again and
continue it or do something else with
bootstrap live in the near future
fingers crossed maybe and what I might
do for live I know a lot of people last
time I went live we're asking that I do
more live videos so I might do once a
month instead of a recorded video that's
edited do and a live one sometimes
they'll be shorter or longer but about
an hour because that's what I can fit
into my schedule right now
um yeah I'm a little bit not too happy
with my color schemes to be honest let's
let's just see if we can't fix this up a
little bit and I make this my secondary
make this my primary was almost what he
had so it's not making much of a change
there this is almost the same too but I
think if I save all that up if I do my B
g-body B G is dark my body color let's
use there's a F EE Evie gets to see what
that does
how ready that looks a little bit nicer
right the whole thing just got a lot
darker looks a lot nicer I like that
more right away just darkening
everything up like that yeah here needs
some spacing so the light here if I go
in my images since we're dealing with
bootstrap on my images everything here's
really crowded together this you know
they're just the text the image and the
buttons are just stuck together so on
all of these images margin bottom of
three units let's say let's see what
that looks like
the one thing I don't really like with
bootstrap is with the margin bottoms I
never really know what their margin
bottom three is going to be exactly so I
end up playing around with it a lot
the navbar being it shouldn't get lost
that's debatable there is easy ways of
doing it the actually I'm curious if
this is gonna work the navbar they do
the a bar fixed I think is their class
but is that gonna cause problems it's
not member fixed I thought it was never
fixed now I got to get that before I go
components mat bar
good thing you can do it fixed fixed or
static placement fixed top Oh
Harriet fixed top was that bootstrap 3
where it was a navbar fixed or am I just
making stuff up now yeah so it's gonna
cover what I already had there which I
don't want obviously so one solution you
can do for that I'd have to do it in my
own CSS here is navbar and position
sticky top 0 which means it will only
stick to the top once it gets to there
so it's gonna be normal but then once it
gets to the top of 0 then it will stick
into place this is that index very big
top zero there we go I don't know how
big I need to desert index I was hoping
that would be big enough so that is a
fun and nice one to do
his position stick you have bad support
I never really use it it's such a cool
feature though oh that's terrible
Wow I didn't know that what's wrong with
here not supported on any table parts
though okay and that's getting fixed ie
not surprising
what's wrong with Chrome oh it's still
four tables okay it's not as bad as I
thought but they don't like it on tables
I mean Opera Mini is not supporting it
the one nice thing with something like
this if it's not supported it's just not
gonna stick so it's just gonna go back
to the original behavior so at least
it's a good graceful degradation which
is a good thing you want to if it's not
gonna work you don't want to break your
site you just you know now came my
things not stuck to the top not at the
end of the world really but it is really
cool and let's just change my footer I'm
gonna space things out I'm gonna do a
little bit more on the spacing here
because I'm not happy with it I think
the spacing in bootstrap goes up to five
it does that's probably too big maybe if
I do okay well do a four on those and
then I also want to do it on my buttons
no we'll do it on the text I'm just
pushing control or if you're gonna Mac
command so I can put it in three places
and only have to write all this once
margin-bottom before I might as well do
it the same on both of them I'm just to
space things out a little bit more make
it look a little bit nicer and I should
probably change the color of my footer
because I don't like that it's the same
might be weird that it's lighter than
everything else that's not terrible not
as bad as I thought it would be you know
what darkening that whole thing up
really made it look a lot nicer I think
if I had like a pattern or something
back here
I could look even better and more text
and stuff because it's just it's kind of
a boring site right now it just doesn't
have enough stuff on it or even a
pattern on this or something like that
could really make it better the last
thing that I didn't really look at was
just if I'm making this smaller right
now this is starting to look really bad
so you do want to bring in your
breakpoints so the call is fine but you
don't generally want to stick with that
so say we did a call say it's a call for
to the medium screen size and just
because I want to do one I'm just gonna
try one thing out for this so then
they're gonna go like this really
they're gonna go full-size why are they
touching I didn't know they touch the
side how my image isn't these images
aren't big enough oh whoops I made a
mistake that's why md4 that would work
better screen size first number after
there we go
that works a little bit better as you
can see now there's more spacing issues
coming up so my buttons should probably
get a margin bottom on them as well
gonna paste in three spots I can so that
looks a little bit nicer and then what I
was thinking though is just for fun at
the small screen sizes they're gonna be
a column like eight let's say and the
reason I'm gonna do that just so we can
I don't think it's going to be the
nicest design necessarily but just
because I want to see if this is gonna
work or I can move my justify content
Center there we go just so one nice
thing with bootstrap four is you can you
don't have to use the off-site classes I
like the off-site classes but now you
don't have to work with like units of 12
anymore which is really handy yeah I
don't think it's the nice design I think
the bigger images were nice there I just
wanted to Center those in the middle for
the fun of it absolutely
sadly guys that's all the time I have
for tonight thank you so much for
joining me
do I still use floats in my CSS
personally no the only time I will is if
I need to get text around an image then
I'll use a float and I'm actually
working on a video that deals with that
TKO that sort of goes through the
history I'm going from floats to flex to
grid and I'm being really inspired by a
really good article that also be linking
to in that video so looking at all three
and where they sort of factored into
today and where things are going so I
think that'd be interesting jemelle
before I go what - what helped you need
with your assignment if it's something
simple maybe I could give you some
advice
and yeah thanks a lot for for joining me
this was a really like impromptu thing I
wasn't planning on doing this at all but
I thought it would be fun and especially
since I didn't get around to recording
my video for the week the one way to
make it up to you guys and yeah I'll
give Jim a la minute to see if he has
anything stop patrolling so do you see
it any more tutorials on pseudo elements
I don't think so
unless there's something specific that
you would want to see me cover I wasn't
sure what else to I thought I covered
most things there's obviously more you
can do with them but yeah if you have
any suggestions on what you'd like to
see with them I'd be oh you're my ears
are always open
all right and hi Elzy ping sadly I think
you got here right as I was finishing up
say I'm gonna have a good night
everybody are a good morning wherever
you are and yeah until next time don't
forget to make your porn in the internet
just a little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
