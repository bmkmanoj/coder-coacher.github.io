my series on building a responsive
website from scratch looking at the
complete workflow in today's video I'm
going to be doing two sections of the
site because the first one is going to
be really really nice and simple and
really fast so I'm gonna look at the
call to action as well as the footer in
the call to action there's nothing
that's gonna be too fancy but we will be
using a background blend mode because
we're gonna take a background color and
a background image and make them blend
together so that's kind of cool and in
the footer we're gonna do some fun stuff
where we're going to use a pseudo
element to put in our background image
because it's gonna let us play with the
opacity so that should be a nice little
trick for you to take on in your future
projects as well so on the screen now
you can see this is what we're going to
be doing I'm not gonna be doing these
two pink things I'm gonna talk about
that once I start coding it up and for
this one as I mentioned we're gonna put
all this in there and then I'm gonna use
a pseudo element to actually put this a
palacios in the background because I'm
going to be using the SVG I had from all
the way when I did the logo in one of
the first videos but enough of looking
at all this let's jump right into the
code if you haven't been following along
with this series we're doing mobile
first so everything I'm doing is gonna
be done just for cell phones and then at
the end of this series I'll have one
probably one video as long as it doesn't
take too long to go through the whole
thing and make it look good at large
screen sizes right away you can see
there's this box here if this ever
happens you've probably seen me have
this problem before when you grab text
from Photoshop stuff like this happens
sometimes let me just scroll down and
find it if you do a shift return which
is a soft return which is the same thing
as a br you get little boxes like that
but you don't actually see it in your
HTML let's just save there this will
update in one second there we go
so that looks much better one thing I'm
also looking at this now and I never
fixed it before but my line height on
those is okay the line height here is a
little bit high my h1 the title large
actually a title large
this line height is way too big so let's
just jump into my typography and fix
that first title large line height of
one let's even do like a point nine
maybe yeah I think that looks a little
bit nicer I like when it's all capitals
I've mentioned it before all capitals
you can really shrink down on your line
height so the spacing doesn't look too
bad
super so now the first thing I'm gonna
have to do is I can actually close a lot
of these that I have opened and close
that close colors I'm gonna make a new
file I'm gonna save this so what I want
to be doing in my sass folder here and
I'm gonna be doing this under components
just because I think it makes more sense
for layout purposes it is a layout thing
they call to action but I see it like a
button is something I reuse all the time
my call to action is something that I'd
probably be putting on multiple pages
and lots of both potentially in lots of
different areas I had it at the bottom
my blog page and probably have at the
bottom of almost all my pages so I'm
gonna throw this right here a call to
action sass and we'll go over to my main
here and make sure that we bring it in
so I'll copy that paste that in and put
call to action you can jump back over to
here now and actually get started so
you'll notice I'm going to open up
Photoshop for one second here I have
this big pink area here and then the
green with the background image on it so
I'm gonna actually have the green as my
background that's going to be the
default background and I'm gonna create
these with some pseudo elements once we
get into that so for my background that
would be dot CTA and let's think I need
to have my background color secondary I
believe cool that's the right color and
then I want a background image of
URL um it will be dot dot go back image
and I think I gave this really long name
call to action background I don't know
if its background or background image
background it was that ok great so you
can see the images come in let's just
give that a background size to
background size of cover and I'm gonna
make that a bit bigger just so you can
see what's going on we can see the the
picture of the phone there actually
let's enter this to background position
center there we go just we can see the
phone a little more and what we'll add
it let's add some padding padding of say
5 m 0 yeah it looks pretty good so we
can see our phone a little bit now
obviously there's a problem my back my
background that I chose I did a JPEG
instead of a PNG because this allows me
to change the color if I need to what
I'm going to be doing I could have
brought this background image in as a
PNG that already had transparency on it
but it creates a heavier file size so
why not use a blending mode so to do
that it's not too hard its background
blend mode right there and I'm gonna use
multi ply so let's hit save and we
should see it there we go I find those
so cool that I can do that through here
now just be careful if you're doing
sites that are a little bit if you need
backwards compatibility this won't
function on all your browsers going way
back and this one the multiply ones not
too bad but just be aware that this
isn't something that's fully fully
supported going too far back my color
should be white right color is text
inverse that's good what's wrong with my
button my button isn't a button but I'm
sure I set that up let's go find it call
to action oh I didn't put a space I put
them all together
there we go that looks better my button
looks like a button now and you know
what honestly for the small screen sizes
that's probably about as far as I'm
gonna go
and because of that and I don't want to
jib you guys let's do the foot or two I
think it makes sense that will jump into
the footer and do that because if I'm
not gonna give you as a three-minute
video right so let's jump into the
footer and do the footer too so I'm
going to and it's just the reason I'm
not putting those those triangle things
here is just they're gonna start
covering the text at a small screen size
and I don't you know I don't really have
the play with it at a smaller screen
size so at the small screen size the
call-to-action will be like that and
it's only at the large screen size where
they're going to jump in so we'll get to
that in another video let's jump down
and do my footer now so I'm going to
make another new file save that this
will go under layout footer SAS and
we'll go back to main copy whoops
paste and call that footer because I
don't think my footer is going to be
overly complicated either actually so
let's just think about this for a second
actually let's go check out my footer
the big the most complicated thing with
my footer is that background image and
that's not going to be too hard I'm
gonna use the same thing I used up here
it's just an SVG I'm gonna use the same
SVG down here and it's gonna be really
cool how I do this and a nice little
trick that you can do just so you can
load in less elements so let's just
start off with setting up my footer
I need that dark color and actually I
should go into my colors and make one I
never made a dark color just felt it
dark I usually use RGB I'm just into
something a for for for just because
it's easier off the top of my head let's
see if that looks background
of dark I think that looks okay color of
text inverse except all my links hahaha
usually I don't like doing stuff like
this but I think I'm gonna say all my
flips all my footer links are color text
universe yeah yeah I'm just gonna do
that it's gonna make life a lot easier
and there's no reason not to
let's just keep my footer down here
since we're working on that I have my
social links and then I have my nav
footer and I also have this title that
title needs to look a bit fancier let's
start with actually one more thing here
padding of again let's say five m0 and
yeah that title doesn't look like what
it's supposed to so that title is called
I think I gave that to oh I didn't give
that a title let's give this a class
then class is equal to title footer save
and I'm gonna put this one in my
typography for consistency sake I have
tied a large I have my title box title
box title intro and will have its text
intro let's stick with my titles
I need my title footer so let's just go
grab that again and look at it it's all
caps I have my letter spacing on it and
I have this line on the top and the
bottom so let's set that all up I said
it was all caps text trance transform
uppercase letter spacing four pixels
line height of one
and my letter spacing is probably a
little big there actually let's go three
okay yeah I like that letter spacing a
bit more okay now I just need to get
that line on the top and bottom I'm just
gonna use a couple of pseudo elements to
do that so we're gonna say and before
and after and we're going to do what
content they're pseudo elements so they
need some content or they won't do
anything I'm gonna do a display block on
them so we can see them I am going to
give them a height of one pixel so
they're not very tall and a background
color of text inverse and I'm giving it
text inverse because I wanted to be the
same color as this text so they're
taking shape there but to in my face
though so I'm just going to give them an
opacity of like point seven maybe 0.25
0.25 I want them to be kind of subtle
that looks better and I want to pull
them off let's give them a margin top
and bottom of point 5 m and 0 and the
right and left I guess 0.75 M 0 I'm sort
of cheating a little bit because I had
this is giving me margin on the top
there but it's just I'm saving a little
bit of lines of text and I think it's
going to be fine doing it this way so
that should look pretty good it's gonna
get kind of wide though we'll see I
might have to build a container into
this hole I have a container I might
well we'll see for now it's okay though
I'm worrying about small screen sizes
let's jump back into my footer now and
what do I need to do I need to fix all
of these so let's start with my social
links since they're the next thing my
social links are called social links so
that makes life easy social
link's and we're using flexbox right so
let's give this a display of flex and
that's gonna make my life a lot easier
cuz they're just gonna go in a line now
I can actually I let's make them bigger
obviously they need to be bigger font
size lips font size what should we do to
rim bigger three rim that looks nice I
want them to be centered and I want the
space so justify content is for my
spacing space around we'll put the equal
amount of space all around everything so
that looks nice and then there to die
there ain't let me just want to go look
here quick yeah it sort of faded them
out here I'd lowered the opacity on them
so let's let do the same thing here
opacity of 0.8 that looks okay my
spacing doesn't look too bad on them so
I'm gonna leave it like that and it
should just sort of yeah I'm gonna
definitely have to fix this at large
screen sizes just so it doesn't get too
big but for my small screen sizes it is
just fine guys so let's jump down to my
nav footer right so the nav pretty sure
yeah so let's go and do nav footer again
display flex puts them all in a line we
can then do my justify content just like
we did before of space around that
should space them all out nicely they're
getting kind of close to the edges and
that's should I'm gonna give this a bit
of a smaller width let's give this a
width of like 80% and then we need to do
a margin of zero Auto since that does
80% so that looks better it's also
actually not zero Auto
let's say like one autozero
yeah there we go just to give us the
space on the top and actually up here
margin top of like 0.25 mm 0.5 m this
one has to be smaller than this one
because my font size here is 3 M R M so
this margin is relative to that so just
to be aware actually it might be easier
let's just stick to zero Auto and do all
my margins here so margin is 0.7 m 0
that should give me equal spacing at
least that way so here I'm dealing with
3 M here I haven't set it so here it's 1
so I'm not trying to like figure it back
and forth and trying to balance it out I
just know that it's the same on the top
and the bottom so everything balances
out nicely I also want to get rid of
that text decoration text declaration of
none and I think they were bold they are
bold okay
so that would be font weight of font
bold black black no whoops that's
because I didn't put my font bold yeah
there we go
SuperDuper so the last thing I need to
do now is just to throw in that my
background image on there so to do the
background image I can't actually just
well I could but if I said background is
URL assisted background image actually
if I just did background it would
overwrite that but because these are two
separate things now we can work image /
logo SVG I'm guessing yeah I mean
there's other problems now Beansie it's
pure white and I can't lower that
whiteness if I change the opacity of my
footer everything inside my footer gets
screwed up so instead of doing that what
I'm going to do is a position
relative here and then I'm gonna say
before actually before all my other
content I'm going to have something that
has no content in it that is a display
block that is position:absolute and
let's just save that and so just to show
you what I'm doing I'm going to let's
just put the background on it right away
background is URL of we said it's image
logo dot SVG and we can't see it now
because I don't have a height so let's
just give this the full size so I'm
doing a position:absolute which means
top of zero bottom of zero right of zero
left of zero I want it to take up the
whole space so quote we can see that it
is working but the problem is it's
repeating itself over and over and over
again which I don't want it to do
obviously so that's obviously I keep
saying obviously but that's not too hard
to fix let's say a background size of
cover might even just oh no I want
contain in this case I don't use contain
very often but for logos it works the
contain is just going to make sure that
my logo is always actually in there and
I see the whole thing with cover you get
some clipping so let's just go back I
can lose parts of it it's gonna make
sure that it fills up that whole space
but I'm definitely going to lose it so
I'm gonna say contain which means I can
always see they'll think my logo and
it's always going to take up as much
space as it can but it will repeat we
have to do a background repeat' of
no-repeat and we'll do a background
position of center perfect and center
should Center it vertically and
horizontally and let's now just do an
opacity of like 0.2 cool at this screen
size I'm not in love with it but I think
you know it's gonna give me the exact
look I was after a larger ones and I'm
gonna lower this even more actually
let's make that point one point zero
seven five there we go
really really settled five percent just
a little subtle design element that's in
there and even now at the small screen
size it doesn't bother me as much either
which is perfect exactly what I was
after and that's it it looks nice my
mobile version of the site is now
completely finished which is awesome
it's working it I think it looks really
nice I'm really happy with it my noggin
is working everything is looking
fantastic so thank you so much for
