be looking at how we can create
different shapes using CSS we're gonna
look at how we can make anything from a
little simple circle to this section
here where we get a little triangle sort
of sticking down like that as well as
changing the shape of my image here and
doing this big different section here
when I look at a whole bunch of
different ways we can create these types
of shapes okay so I'm not gonna focus on
the HTML of this one too much but I'm
just gonna look in my section one here
of my h1 and my one icon so the one icon
is what I'm a focusing on there on the
section two will be looking at the image
as well as doing something with our
whole section two in the section three
so therefore sort of decoration where we
use it so we can actually see the the
shape difference going on with those
ones so let's get started on this and
we're gonna start really nice and simple
with my one icon so the one icon that I
did this is just really basic stuff on
creating shapes so let's do one icon and
let's give it a background of our GBA
and we'll do zero zero zero 0.3 just so
we have something that we can sort of
see great then let's give this a width
and a height because for this I think
that makes sense to do and there we go
we got a nice little square there we can
do a margin:0 auto and that will put it
right in the middle and i can do on this
a border radius of 50% so if you're not
familiar with the border radius to make
circles it works really well just make
sure you're working with a complete box
because if you're working with other
things that makes ovals that sometimes
don't look really terrible so just
putting a border radius on a perfect
square gives me a nice little circle
like that now do you actually get my
smiley face dead set in the middle here
I used to always do a display flex on
there and use my justified content and
align items I just learned a really nice
trick the other day which is display
grid and place I
Center and oh my goodness it goes in the
middle
and what place items is doing is it's a
shorthand property for justify items and
a line item so it's doing a justify item
Center and a line items Center and it's
putting it right down in the middle and
I can use that with my nice little
display grid they're so nice now browser
support very questionable I don't know
if I'd want to be using this in the real
world but really nice and cool and just
as a little side note you can learn
about little things like that in my new
newsletter I've just I created one
there's more information of that at the
in the description below but also I'm
gonna talk about it a little bit at the
end of this video so let's bring up the
font size to like 2m just make it a
little bit bigger and this is kind of
fun to do also if you have a background
that's already like an RGBA
and you make the color the same rgba it
just be the same thing in a bit darker
because here it's just gonna be like 0.6
now right so it's like layered opacity
on top of each other so a nice little
way to do that so that one's the really
basic one and i want to jump down
quickly to section 2 because i don't
want to spend too much time i think the
more interesting thing there was
actually the this part of it than
anything else and so i want to focus now
on my or not not there yet actually
let's jump up creating that little arrow
shape now there's other ways of doing
this this isn't the only way but i'm
gonna be looking at using clip path and
some other stuff to do some more
interesting stuff down in section 2 so
here to make that little arrow thing I'm
gonna do it with pseudo elements you
don't know a lot about pseudo elements
please check out my other series where I
drove more into those there's should be
a card popping up somewhere for that to
write about now
I have one before so I want to select
both my before and after and I want to
give them a position:absolute let's give
them their content of nothing whoops
find the right keys there there we go I
give it a width of like 200 maybe 150
pixels and a
of 150 pixels and I'm gonna go to
background of red just so we can see
what we're actually dealing with right
now so there's my two boxes that I've
just made um so let's move them down
bottom of zero and I think that's it for
the moment and because what I want to do
is come on to each one separately now so
one will start with my before and for
this one I'm gonna move it to the right
by 50% so it should move on over a
little bit and then I'm gonna do a nice
little transform and we'll do a skew on
it now excuse it weird property if
you're not sure what it is let's
actually hide my after we're just gonna
do with one now so we're gonna see what
one square is doing when I skew this so
I'm gonna ask you of 20 degrees and you
can see it just sort of like okay it's
gonna take it and just sort of skew it
I don't really know in other word so
it's pulling the top one way in the
bottom the other way and the bigger the
number here the more it gets skewed
whoops we can't do a 90 degree because
it's gonna disappear for say 50 it gets
pulled and pulled 90 degrees it's just
it's pretty much laying flat and it
doesn't really work like say we did 80
degrees it's starting to get like that's
a 90 degrees it's it's skewed all the
way over and we can't see it so I don't
want it to be that extreme though so
let's try like 20 but I don't want to
just do 20 degrees like that I'm gonna
do a 0 comma 20 and you can see what
that's doing is it's actually sort of
twisting it instead of skewing it which
is exactly what I want because I want it
sticking out at the bottom now the only
problem is I can't see it so I'm also
gonna fit is that said index doesn't
have tips doesn't have to be that big
but let's put 100 and so you can see
it's sticking out a little bit here and
I move my bottom down maybe just a bit I
don't know
whoops
negative 1 ma I should say I just want
to make sure this isn't sticking out
here I want it just to be sort of a
clean thing like that so that's great
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
bring my
after back on here one after and now I
want to sort of do the same thing with
that one
so let's copy that and get my after in
here but obviously I don't want my right
I'm gonna do this on the left so you can
see the dirt on this one you know the
two sides are touching they're lining up
perfectly by doing that and instead of
doing 20 we can doing negative 20 and
now it's sticking down it's coordinate
actually this can be used for other
stuff too it's this nice little chevron
shape you can use this pretty much
anything or not anything but you can use
it for other design elements but all I'm
gonna do now is just take my background
that I have here and change my red to
the same one and look at that we just
get a nice little sort of arrow pointy
thing instead so that's kind of cool
again there's other ways of doing this
the nice thing with using before and
after to do this is browser support will
be super super good and you can use it
for different stuff does take a bit on
markup but you get there now let's move
on to looking at some clip paths because
clip paths are really cool browser
support is it could be better it's not
terrible but it could be better now if
you're gonna do a clip path on an image
like this it's probably decorational so
even if it doesn't really work it's you
know some graceful degradation which
isn't the end of the world
um so I'm gonna start by doing the clip
path on my image itself so we can come
down here and take a look at two image
which is the class I put on my image and
I'm gonna give it a clip path now clip
paths are kind of weird to work with if
you're not used to working with them but
I'll show you a really cool tool in a
second so for my clip path you there's
other things you can do I can just write
in circle circle just like that and I
get a circle and in here I could write
in my radius 50 pixels and it's gonna
give it a radius of 50 pixels or I could
put you know 25% even and it's gonna
deal with 25% of the original image
obviously if this is bigger than the
original then you get something like
that so if you know there's kind of
useless
so clip paths are kind of cool they're
nice for just cropping
things down and doing some fun stuff
with them a hundred percent will give
you you know you're not really gonna see
it ninety we're gonna start seeing it
come in I would think oh there we go you
can see that now it's starting to clip
in at fifty percent um so that's a nice
fun thing you can do you can also
there's other options here and there's a
link in the description to something
else and I'm gonna look at a fun tool
that we can use and we're gonna look at
how it actually works I'm gonna be right
in polygon which lets you come in with a
custom one so when you circle it's
obviously in me asset circle and stuff
like that and there's other shapes you
can do but I want to do one that's my
own custom shape so I'm gonna put 0 0
here and just to explain actually before
I do that and this is my zero zero point
so you're dealing with the x axis X Y X
and y axis is X YZ m and so this is my
zero zero so this is my first point if I
come all the way along here I'm staying
on my zero for my Y but my ex is
becoming one hundred percent because I'm
moving all the way to the end of it then
down here would be 100 100 and this one
would be zero one hundred so let's set
that up just so there's no clipping at
all to start with so 0 0 is my first
point my second point is 100% 0 my third
point is 100% 100% and my last point is
0 100% and I give myself a perfect
square so that's kind of cool and now I
can play with these numbers I can come
this is my zero zero so if I make this a
25 pixels it's gonna move over 25 pixels
and if I take this one here 100 pixels
it will move down 100 pixels and I start
getting an interesting shape coming in
there now also I don't need to have
necessarily this many points let's come
in and add another one let's just say
50% 50% and see what happens and you can
see it's adding another point in to the
end there so it's going in order so it's
always it's the same way I'm taking a
clock it's going to start in your top
left welcome
starts in the middle but it's gonna
start top left and work its way around
so the 50% 50% got added between this
one and the one that I have there so you
can start to come in and create your own
shapes like that so that's kind of cool
I'm gonna put the link to this site down
in the description below which is a
really nice one because it comes with
all the shapes that are already there
and you can play around with them and if
you get a shape and you want to modify
it Hey look at that you can come modify
it and it gives you a nice code that you
can copy down below so custom polygons
you can even just click and add some
points in and do anything you want I'll
create some crazy shapes and stuff like
that or you can use some of the ones
they already have and modify them like I
mentioned so this is really a nice
little tool that you can use and again
this link will be in the description
below for the purpose of this one I'm
just going to do nice and simple where
I'm gonna change this this one here
actually to 75% and let's put this back
to a zero zero just to have sort of a
cut off angle on that something a bit
more interesting nothing too crazy but
it's kind of fun and now the last thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to change
the angle of the between my two
different sections here so let's go in
number two
now I'd sort of set this up ahead of
time but um so I gave it a margin bottom
of negative ten I'm gonna take that off
for the moment just so we can see why I
would have done something like that okay
so on my two that's going to we're going
to add another clip path in here so
we're going to clip the path and once
again it's in me a polygon so this is
for my entire section so this whole
thing with this salmony color here and
let's just make this bigger so we can
actually see what I'm writing and so
let's start again with a zero zero
because we don't want anything on the
top to change so that will stay 100%
zero then ideally we'd be going all the
way down so let's say we go like 100%
actually let's just make it a square and
then we'll play with it because it's a
little it's nice to be able to see what
we're actually doing right
100% 100% and now I can see my my whole
section and it I mix these up flips this
one here should be 100 100 and then this
one should be a zero 100 there we go
okay so that's the normal one now the
idea here would be to take this corner
and move it up so that's the third point
so that's this one here and I'm moving
the this access the up and down access
is always right here on this one now the
tricky part is how do I know how much I
want to move it up by so say I came on
here and I said let's move this up by
like I want to move it up 100 pixels
well it's not gonna work because it's
not moving it up 100 pixels it's moving
it from the top down 100 pixels so
that's not working at all and then what
happens if I want to take this and your
re then I could go and like calculate
the whole thing go it's actually like 1
or I don't know how tall this actually
is but say 865 pixels let's just see you
know that's actually we're getting a
little closer but it's guesswork and
then what happens if the content in this
section changes and then the height of
the whole thing changes which is bound
to happen or your change your thing and
well look at that my line already is
going kind of weird the angle of it is
changing as I'm moving around which is
straight-up awkward so what we could do
instead of having to worry about
something like that is we could do some
fun little stuff with this and so what
I'm gonna do is instead of having a set
number here or even you know I could put
this at like 90% obviously and look it's
working but once again the angle of it
keeps changing as I'm moving around like
this it's a very soft angle and then as
I do this it gets to a steeper and
steeper angle but what if I don't want
that angle to change I want that angle
always to be the same so what I'm gonna
do here is I'm actually gonna use the
nice little calc CSS function and I'm
gonna do 100% so it's starting always
where we originally had but then we're
going to subtract destroyed 20 viewport
width and I'm purposely using width here
and not height because I want this
number to change with the size of my
screen
so now yes the space is getting bigger
but you notice the angle is always
staying exactly the same isn't that
really cool that the angle is just
matching the whole time so that's really
fun now the problem with that is I think
it's a bit too big so let's bring that
down to a ten so there we go we can see
that the angle always stays the same it
just sort of takes a larger truncated
larger screen sizes which makes sense so
it's just always gonna stay like that so
it works really really well but I have
the problem of having this empty space
here so I'm going to just come on and
that's where having the negative so I'm
going to do a margin bottom of negative
ten viewport width and that's gonna suck
the next section up into that empty
space and that's super cool because I
know this this number here so this space
that's underneath is always ten viewport
width so my margin bottom ten viewport
width and it just sucks it up and it
works perfectly so I think that's really
nice and handy for these types of
sections where you might want to get
these you know it's kind of trendy to
have sections that are off by a little
bit just be careful again clip paths a
browser support I'll put a link to the
can I use because it's always updating
so I don't want to show something on the
screen now it might eventually you know
if you find this video in six months it
might be different but as of the time of
this coming out it's not terrible by any
means it's just not amazing
one thing I guess that could be good is
if the clip path didn't work in this
case it doesn't break my layout at all
right like the site's still working so
again it is disgraceful degradation if a
website does come on here the padding
might be a little off so it might not be
perfect but hey it's not too bad so I
hope you liked this video if you did
please hit the thumbs up if you have any
questions please leave a comment down
below and if you curious but the
newsletter that I mentioned pretty much
what I'm gonna be doing is I've already
started it the first issue has gone out
it's gonna be a weekly newsletter every
Sunday delivered to your inbox I'm
looking at things like I did with this
place items these sort of obscure little
things that I fall upon that aren't big
in
to make actual videos out of you know
something that I can't expand long
enough for its this is really cool thing
that I want to share with people quickly
things that I might include in my videos
from time to time but I won't actually
build a whole video about so it's sort
of like these YouTube videos but my idea
with them is that you can read them in
an early three minutes so really not
long but just to keep you up to date on
these cool things that I've been finding
and I'll probably also be going into
some design decision II stuff as well
cuz I do get a lot of questions about
how to make designs look nicer so on
little tidbits and things that you could
try to make your designs look better so
a little bit of a combination of the two
of them once again any information you
might want for that is in the
description below thank you so much for
watching also thank you so much for my
patrons for making this all possible and
of course until next time don't forget
to make your corner the Internet just a
little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
