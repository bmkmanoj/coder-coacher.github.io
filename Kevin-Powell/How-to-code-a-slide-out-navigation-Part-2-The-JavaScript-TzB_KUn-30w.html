we're gonna be making our navigation
menu work and I've got it working right
here actually just it should give you a
little preview of what its gonna be
looking like so we're gonna be making
the hamburger icon change into the X and
back when we click on it and of course
the whole thing is gonna slide out and
slide back in we're going to be using
es6 and arrow functions to do this
there's not a lot of JavaScript that has
to go into this so it's a nice little
introduction to JavaScript maybe and
into arrow functions I'm gonna do my
best to explain the difference between
the old way of writing it and with arrow
functions and yeah let's just jump right
into it and see how I made this so I
would incur if you didn't see the last
video it's strongly encouraged that you
go and check it out so that's where we
styled the navigation here so what I
want to do is I'm gonna start off we
have my navigation so I'm gonna do a
translate translate transform translate
X so X is on the left and right so I'm
gonna say negative 100% so it's gonna
move it all the way it's gonna take its
full width and just move it 100% to the
left which means it will disappear so
let's just refresh that there we go
so now it's gone now what I want is I
want that whole thing to be able to
slide out okay so what we want to do is
we want to have when we click on this
that the navigation comes out right so
I'm gonna leave this in my navigation
Styles because it's controlling my
navigation maybe I could make another
partial for it but I think that makes
sense to leave it in here and I'm gonna
make a class called nav is open and
actually I'm gonna put that down at the
bottom I think because I'm not actually
I'm gonna have a nav is open and so when
my nav is open my nav is going to
translate transform translate X back to
zero so it's going to go back to its
original starting point so I'll save
that and let's go over to my index file
here and on my body we're gonna add the
class is equal to
nav is open save and when I save this it
should pop it there we go
cool so on my body if class nav is open
is there mine is there and if we remove
a nav is open it's going to disappear so
the functionality and my CSS is there
but now I want to make it work with some
JavaScript so we got to go and do that
so I'm gonna make a new folder and we're
just going to call this Jas and in this
Jas folder I'll make a new file and I'm
gonna split this into two different
JavaScript files just for demonstration
purposes but normally you're probably
better off keeping them in one or using
gulp to combine them into one or
something like that so this one's going
to be called Navi is and we'll go over
to my index I'm gonna come all the way
down and right here before my body ends
I'm going to put in a script SRC is
equal to J s Navi is and we're gonna
save so that should be included now in
this video I am going to be using es6
which is the newest way of writing
JavaScript older browsers don't support
it you can use something like babel if
you want there'll be a link to that in
the description you can bring that into
the gulp build you could also use pre
pros or probably code kit to have es6 it
converts it for you into the older way
of doing stuff which was a lot more
complicated but I'll explain a little
bit the only big difference is I'm going
to be using is I'm going to be using
Const and I'm going to be using arrow
functions so if you watched or I've done
any JavaScript tutorials you probably
see var a lot which is your variable
with es6 they've added Const through a
new line Const and let basically
variable like this had some issues with
it in just the way that it was scoped
and this sort of fixes them let is a lot
like the variable in that you can change
what the variable is later on whereas
writing it like this it's still creating
a variable but it's a variable that
can't be changed you can't
redefine it after and for the purposes
of the videos I'm making now we're going
to be using this one to declare our
variables so what I want to do is make
my nav toggle so I want to do nav toggle
is equal to and now I want to select the
where is it I want to select my button
so it should be all the way at the top
of my file I want to select my menu
button here so what I'm gonna write is
document so I'm gonna look in my
document I'm gonna do a query selector
you might have seen other videos that
are using things like get element by ID
or by class name and stuff like that
query selectors a lot easier to use if
you're coming from jQuery and I find it
also it's a little similar to how jQuery
worked where I can do my query selector
and then I was right in here what I want
so this is a class so it's dot so I'm
selecting a class and it was I just
forgot the name of it already menu
button so I'm gonna zoom with menu
button and that's it I'm also not
putting a semicolon at the end
semicolons aren't required to put in
JavaScript so I'm not gonna put them
anywhere because it makes my life easier
and you're not going to break anything
by not putting them so just by not
putting them anywhere I knew I won't
screw up anything or is if you are
putting them you don't want to put one
in the wrong spot so just don't put any
pretty much the browser just does it all
on its own anyway
so now we want to do something with our
button so what I'm gonna say is I'm
going to say my MAV toggle and I'm going
to add something called add event
listener so this means now it's gonna
listen for something to happen there's a
lot of different things you can do in
the next one we're also gonna be
listening for key keydown events but the
one you'll probably see the most often
is click so you're always going to put
the the event itself in quotation marks
so I'm gonna say click and then when I
click on the button I want to do
something so I'm gonna put a comma and
now it's well what happens when somebody
clicks and in this case I'm just going
to put in an anonymous function so I'm
gonna write and the old way of doing it
would have been writing function like
that and then put
in my curly braces and then writing the
function in here but I said I'm going to
be using es6 so I'm really using arrow
function because it means less
keystrokes so I have my click and to do
an arrow function it's pretty simple I
just have to do it you know I could have
just that and then my arrow and then I
could write a really simple thing here
on one line or because this is gonna be
on multiple lines I still need to put in
my curly braces and then I can write my
function here so it's a lot shorter to
write and if you only have if this is
empty so this would normally be like
function here if you're gonna function
and it's gonna be an empty one you can
have just an underscore instead of
having the parentheses so it's just to
save another keystroke so this here is
the exact same thing as writing it click
as writing function whoops is writing it
like that so you can see it's a little
bit simpler to write or a little bit
faster right it also scopes the this a
little bit differently if you know what
that is if you don't don't worry about
it too much so now that I have this I
want to do something and let's just
check if this is even working we want to
see if it's working the easiest way to
do that is do a console.log so I'm just
going to console.log we're in a console
log test and let's save that and to see
the console I'm just going to do my
inspect element and jump over to console
and now when I click on this I should
see the word test show up there and
there we go and if I click again it
should come again you can see here the
instances how many times is how many
times I've clicked on it so I know that
it's working awesome
now what do we want to do when we click
on it I don't want to have a little test
run
I want something to actually happen so
what I want to actually happen is I want
to add the new class that I came up with
nav is open I want to add this to the
body when I click on that
so let's come back to here and so we
want to select the body
luckily selecting the body is really
easy document.body so I don't have to do
a query selector and all of that to get
my body I can just do it like this and
then I wanted
want to add a class so we can access
something called the class list so this
is I'm gonna go on my class list and do
I want to do something so you can add
and remove stuff from my class list so
in this case I want to add and then in
parentheses I can write what I want to
add and I want to add nav is open now
one thing before I save this and we
check it out to see if it's working
you'll notice here I put a period and
here I didn't put one here's a query
selector it's looking through the whole
document it doesn't know what I'm
looking for it could be an idea class a
tag whereas over here
i knows i'm working with a class so if I
add the period here it's gonna add a
class of dot nav is open and it's not
gonna work so it's just it's an
important distinction to make because
I've made mistakes where I included the
period here something's not working and
it's been two hours trying to figure it
out and it's a stupid typo so I don't
want you to run into that same problem
so let's save that file and let's see if
it works so now when I click there we go
it popped out and if we go back to my
inspect element it's gonna refresh so we
go back to how it was and this is really
zoomed in let's go find my body so
there's my body so when I click you can
see the class nav is open has been added
now there's a problem it's just
appearing and I want it to I don't want
it just to appear I want it to slide out
so that's nice and easy to do let's go
back to here and I'm gonna go back up to
my original nav where I have my
transform and I'm gonna do a transition
and we're gonna transition my trans form
we're gonna do an ease in out and whoops
i misspelled transform and so we're
gonna do an ease in out and it's gonna
last 250 milliseconds and I'll save
let's refresh and now when I click it
should slide out there we go so it's
transitioning the transform its easing
in and out and it's taking two hundred
and maybe I should just do an ease in
not easing out oops so see if that looks
nicer
I think I like that better it sort of
speeds up as it goes or maybe if we
slowed down started it fast and then
slowed down I'm gonna go with that one
actually so just an ease out on there so
it goes whoop now I also want to be able
to close it and the problem is my button
has disappeared and I want to be able to
click on my button to get it to go back
so for this what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna come on my index and we're gonna
add in a new div so here's my button
that I'm clicking on here's my
navigation that's sliding in and out and
then there's the rest of my content and
I want the rest of the content to slide
with my navigation so right here I'm
going to add a div div class is equal to
container all maybe not the best name
but it's kind of descriptive it's
containing all of the content other than
my navigation of course so I'm going to
do that I'm gonna come all the way down
let's just tab that over and we're gonna
close that dip I'll save that and now
what I want to do is I want it to we'll
come back to here so when my nav is open
my nav is going to transform and
translate that much and I'm also going
to have my container all that's also
going to transform and it's also going
to translate X now how much it
translates here
I'm gonna match this number up with this
right here so right now my nav is taking
up 80% of the screen so I'm gonna have
that be 80% so let's save and hopefully
that works I'm going to click and it
should slide out and the only thing here
is on my container all I do need to
include it transition but I don't want
it on the nav is open do I transition
I'm just trying to think no I don't want
it to only be I want my container all to
always have the transition on it whether
this is there or not
right right right right yeah so I'm just
gonna come down here and add container
all just whoops we're gonna add a
transition Tran that's actually I should
make maybe a variable for this but for
now I'll just copy that save refresh and
that's this check they should slide it
together there we go that looks better
good good good we're getting there now
the only thing is when I click on it
again it doesn't close so I wanted to
close right so I could add another thing
in here because we have add and I could
also not close we could do a remove so
you can remove something from the
classlist or you can also toggle
something from a class list so toggle
this means if it's there remove it and
if it's not there add it on so let's
save this so now when I click it should
slide out and when I click it should
slide back in awesome look at that it's
working perfectly super happy with that
another thing is the transition not that
yeah the my transition is one of the
properties that not my transition my
translate is one of the properties you
can do that should usually always result
in smooth animation so that's good too
cool so that's working now the last
thing is I want this to actually change
into an X so it when I click it turns
into an X and when I click again it
turns back into the hamburger so what I
want to do is I'm gonna go back to my
index and right here we have my
container all and there's my button so
my menu button and I'm a SVG in there so
what I want to actually do is add in a
second SVG in here and the SVG I want to
be adding is my my 3 my my my x thing
and I didn't realize this when I did the
last part but if I go into my images
folder and I go into my clothes icon I
actually get the whole icon right here
so I should just be able to copy you
and paste it directly in here endure it
at my style and I can get rid of you and
I don't need the ID on there that's
coming from sorry let's just clean that
up a little bit and let's save that so
then it's way too big but just like last
time I added the height and width to it
so right after my view box here we can
add in a height is equal to 17
now width is equal to 30 there we go so
I have my open and my close the thing is
there's my this first one here is my
hamburger so I'm gonna have a class of
hamburger right there and over on this
one I'm an addict class class of close
icon save that so with my close icon I
don't want to see my close icon right
now right so let's go back to here
whoops not here into my right over here
so my nav is I'm going to add my
hamburger right here so I have my
hamburger and what do I want to be with
my hamburger actually let's start with
my close icon close icon I want this to
be display:none so I don't have the X
when I click though I want it to turn on
so here inside my nav is open my closed
icon will be a display of block good
good good and also when nav is opened I
want my hamburger to be a display:none
because I don't want my hamburger to be
there so you can see there's the X when
I click it's a hamburger when I click it
goes back and forth now the only thing
is with the display:none we can't
animate that or do a transition on that
but I think it's you know because
everything's moving I really don't think
we're losing anything on that I think
it's fine the
that one just sort of clicks over and I
think that's working really good and
there we go okay so now that all of that
is done there is one last problem and
what that is is right now everything
looks good this is nicely positioned but
if we do a little inspect on this and
I'm going to open up my responsive
design what we're gonna see is that at
the small screen sizes I don't see my X
anymore so this is getting down to about
the 320 and that's not good so what I
actually need to do is have this
reposition while I'm resizing the screen
so to do that let's jump back over to my
nav SCSS here actually let go back to my
index we want to be looking at my menu
button so do we have a menu button let's
just gonna go in here and basically what
we want to do is inside my nav is open
we want to have my so when the nav is
open the menu button will also transform
and so I'm just gonna copy this copy
paste translate I don't know how much
I'm gonna start with a negative 50% so
it should be like 50% of its self and
let's just I'll bring it down to 320 and
let's do a bit more than that 70 maybe I
want to make sure that it's easily
visible which it is and even when I get
bigger it means it's gonna stick closer
to here and won't be so far off the side
and on really big screen sizes so if I
get out of my responsive you here and we
just make that really big it sort of
sticks here it won't be centered
anything but I think that's fine so it
just sort of and there we go so the end
as you we can see so this space is there
and here it's just a little bit bigger I
could put a transition on that so it
would sort of slide I wouldn't slide
back in but I really don't think it's
needed just like when the X which is
because everything is moving you don't
really notice that it's not in the same
spot so I think I could leave it like
that but if you really prefer having
something transition you could
definitely on your menu button just add
a little transition on it and then it
sort of slide into place instead of just
appearing there so you can see it's a
really small amount of JavaScript to
create something like this was just
really cool it doesn't take a lot to do
hopefully you're not disappointed that
it wasn't a lot of JavaScript but in not
the next video but the one after that
we're gonna make the modal's work
because the next video will be the
modal's and then we're gonna be making
the modal's work and that one it's gonna
be a little bit more intensive and a
little bit more sort of substance to it
instead of just turning classes on and
off we're gonna having to do quite a bit
more because we're gonna be animating it
because we have to select the right
modal to open and then it's gonna have
to fade in and fade out and it's a
little bit more complicated than this
one but hopefully it's a nice little
introduction to JavaScript just keeping
it nice and simple here so I hope you
like this video if you did please give
it a thumbs up also leave a comment down
below to let me know you liked it and if
you didn't like it also leave a comment
down below and let me know you didn't
because I'd like to be able to make my
videos better if you have any questions
about anything I did in this one please
feel free to leave a comment below and
I'll get back to you as soon as possible
and until next time don't forget to make
your corn in the Internet just a little
bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
