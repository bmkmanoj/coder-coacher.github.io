winner for the contest and to do this
we're gonna make a thing - to find the
winner for us so I think this would be a
fun little bit of JavaScript so what
I've already done is I've written some
CSS and I've written a little little two
lines of HTML and I've come here and
I've created a variable called winner
button and that's this thing right here
that I can click on that doesn't look
like a button so that is selected and
then I have a variable here of winner's
name which is this right here
which right now just has three little
dots in it that is awaiting the winner
I've also made an array here of all the
people who have entered into the contest
so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna
scroll all the way down past my array
and we're gonna start doing some stuff
so I'm gonna make a variable here which
will be in a function a winner so let's
pick a winner pick a winner that sounds
like a good type of function to do so
this is a function so I'm going to say
num because it's gonna take a number and
when we do the number it's going to spit
something out and this is an arrow
function so if you're used to the other
way of doing something this would be
like a VAR click a winner is equal to
function whoops
function with the num in there pretty
much with arrow functions in the whole
es6 thing we don't have to actually
write the word function anymore saves a
few little keystrokes along the way so
my pick a winner is taking a number and
it's going to what do we need we need we
need to generate a random number so the
first thing we do is Const winning
number so we're gonna have a winning
number and it's gonna be a random number
so we can make a random number with
JavaScript really easily just by doing
math dot random and to see what this is
actually doing let's have this console
log the winning number as we work along
with this if I do a let's just run pick
a winner let's just have that fire off
and we should see a random number show
up there there we go and if I just
change my code here or running in
and there we go and we'll do it one more
time and you can see it's always a
decimal so that's not a good thing now
we can easily enough multiply this so
say I did times 10
now we're not dealing with decimal we
still lots of decimal points is but at
least we have a number there but this is
still obviously an issue because we
don't want to have a decimal we can't
have you know in between Jew winners we
got to pick a number so we can wrap this
in something called math oops math floor
and my math lower here I mean there's
gonna put parentheses so my math floor
is taking this number that we were just
looking at and then it's rounding it
down and so now it's picking a random
number and it's pretty much always going
to get a number between 0 and 9 that's
actually just yeah we'll leave it like
that for a moment and we can just see
it's going through it always be a number
between 0 &amp;amp; 9 with the way this works
there's my zero it can never reach 10
because it's always rounding down but I
don't want to multiply it by 10 I want
to multiply it by how many people we
actually have here so this here is
called contestants so here we're gonna
be accepting the argument of num so
we're just going to multiply it by that
for the moment and now it's gonna be
mean not a number because I have to put
something in here so now if I put a 1
it's gonna always be 0 I can't have
anything else because it always will
pick a number but let's put 2 here and
now it will either pick 1 or 0 there we
go there's a 1 there's a 1 anyway you
get the idea it's either gonna be
picking 1 or 0 at random every time now
obviously I don't want it to be doing
that and I don't really want it to be
giving me a console.log either every
time what we want to do is we want it to
tell us who the winner actually is so we
can have it do that so instead of
console logging what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create an another variable
called Whitner and this is a little bit
more exciting and the way the winner is
going to work is it's going to be equal
to
contest's contestants and then winning
number so it's gonna take this number
that's randomly generated and then it's
gonna find that person in the array so
to show you a little bit of what's going
on here if we do contest dense and I put
I don't know 15 it's gonna find the 15th
person inside of contestants except I've
probably spelled it wrong whoops we need
to consult log that so if I console.log
that there we go so to pick an to pack
an to pick an to pick an is our
contestant number 15
now one thing with the this is it's
always rounding down so it's starting at
zero and counting up but that's okay
because at zero we do have a person work
low is running in there at the zero so
the reason for this is arrays always
start counting from zero and work their
way up so here we have our zero and yeah
I think that's that's it right um so
then you know whatever number ends up in
here it will give us a name so yeah
that's pretty much it so what this will
do is we'll randomly generate a number
it will put that number as my winning
number and that will find my winner in
my list and it will save that as a
variable so we need it to do though once
it gets that is we need it to return the
winner because I don't want a
console.log it that's kind of boring
what we want to do is we want that to
show up where these three dots are and
that's easy enough to do so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to select my
winner button which is the button here
that I can click on and on that winner
button I'm gonna add event listener and
what I want to do is I want to listen
for a click so when someone clicks we're
going to do a function whoops that
should be a arrow and here I'm putting
an underscore whoops that should also be
a comma
I'm not doing so good I'm doing an
underscore that it's the same is just an
opening closed parentheses within arrow
function it's just a you know can do a
little bit less typing by putting an
underscore to save yourself some
keystrokes I thought that was really
silly and then I started using it and I
loved it
all right so what we want is we want to
take my winner's name and we want to
change the inner HTML and what are we
gonna change it to let's just do hello
so when I click on this the three little
dots should be changed to the words
hello so let's try that it worked oh I'm
getting nervous now because we're
getting really close super close we're
pretty much there um what we need to do
now is instead of having it say hello we
want it to print out something from my
pick a winner but we're gonna do one
more thing here just to keep going I'm
gonna make one more variable called
number of entries because we need to
know how many people we have are we have
and that would be contestants dot length
so it's going to take how many
contestants we have it's gonna count
them all it's gonna give me a number and
we're going to use that number in here
to say that pick a winner and we're
gonna put in our number of entries so
what's gonna happen now is when I click
on this not yet soon when I click on
that it's going to run through all of
this it's gonna take the number of
entries we have so it's gonna put that
number in here it's gonna run that
number it's gonna randomly generate a
number based on that it's going to then
use that random number to find out who
the winner is
it's gonna take that winner and it's
going to print that winner as the
innerhtml and it's gonna replace this
with what we just did sound good I
almost feel like I should have added
like a countdown thing now or something
I'm actually kind of nervous
I'm not even the one who's up for this
this is fun so should I do a countdown
see what countdown five four three two
one
and the winner is slacker King
congratulations yeah awesome so there
