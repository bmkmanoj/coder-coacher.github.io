you
there we go so hi everybody I see a few
people are already following along so
let's get rid of that welcome first time
I do a live stream so a little bit
different for me so hopefully it goes
off without a hitch but we'll see how
this goes
the main reason I'm doing this is
because I've played around with
bootstrap a lot but I haven't had much
of a chance to play around with
bootstrap for you here we go now my
audio I'm so hi everybody
Hey see if you're capable are already my
audio is not good or if the videos not
good let me know in the chat every time
I die so I can see it all the time it
different for me so it goes off without
a hitch so yeah I haven't had a lot of
time to prep for and I started the
middling reason and I saw this I found
the head nose much but the more I
started playing with later around with
bootstrap a little more I realize like
oh my goodness be a rendez-vous stuff
for you I've changed more than I thought
everybody so I'm gonna just down the
source my audio is not good or the
videos a little bit well know in the
chat time I don't live swim so well then
get started on this don't you ever do it
so yeah I haven't had a lot of time to
come up for and I started the feeling
witness on the head coach much but the
more I see playing with late around a
fuccinelli more than otherwise
viciously a run Dave this time the
description is more than I thought
everybody site so I'm gonna do stuff I
don't know my audience knew in the
Chinese delight well then get started on
this the batteries over so yeah that's a
lot of tea for everyone I started the
feeling
like my languidly i don't think i'm the
description of change more than I
thought every site so I'm gonna do I
don't know watch me win the child and
get started on this yeah the bottom
super I finally started playing with I
don't think I'm the description I've
changed more than I thought every site
so I'm gonna do stuff I don't love you
in a childlike way and get started on
this batteries oh yeah that's the bottom
super and it started actually playing
with late I don't think I'm the
descriptions more than I thought every
site so I'm gonna do stuff you in the
child and get started on this pursuing
yeah this bottom see for eyeshadow and
it started actually playing with late I
don't think I'm or non-licensed aside
the distortion Kingsmore them
you
okay so that should be better
I had the stream going live on my
computer and I didn't realize it so I'm
back oh not hmm
I'm just going to check something here
really fast YouTube's never seen I'm
going to stop the stream for just one
second and start this back up in one
second so the stream will stop and then
should start any second now again sorry
about this well I can't stop there hmm
let's see if I can fix this live
okay so let me know again if the audio
is no good I think I figured out what
the problem was I think everything
should be alright now but if there's any
issues whatsoever please let me know so
hi I'm back um okay so let's hope this
goes a little bit better sorry guys it's
my first live stream I don't really know
how this works to be honest with you so
I hope this goes a little bit better now
so as I was trying to say um I found
this template and I got it from this
I'll add this to the description of the
the event once it's over I will be
posting this whole thing up live on my
on my feed so I'll put that in there so
you guys can get to it if you want again
I'm not going to do the whole thing I
just it looked very bootstrap II to me
so I thought it would be a nice way to
get started and just something to try
and follow without actually having to
build out a full design excuse me
okay so this will be a lot more raw than
usual it's going to be a bit more you
know oh I'm not even showing you what
I'm looking at that should be better uh
I forgot my there we go okay so now you
can actually see what I'm looking at see
I'm not very good at soul live-streaming
thing so this is the design that I'm
going to be doing and I hope that it
yeah again it's a bootstrap II type of
design it should be a nice good one I
think to do um so if I go and look in
here I've already gone and got all bunch
of the images from there so I don't have
to do that live and I've just gone and
downloaded bootstrap so let's just go
and find that oops that should be in my
downloads it should be all the way up
there
so I'm just going to bring this whole
bootstrap file into my live event here
that will take a second to copy over so
yeah the whole thing I want to do here
is bootstrap has really changed from
what it used to be and I thought that it
was a smoother transition than it was
but it looks like they've made a lot
more changes than I had originally
anticipated some of them are really
awesome I love what they've done with
the new column system the new column
system is real it's the same thing but
they've made it better it's really
really cool
but the navigation - they've fixed one
of my biggest pet peeves with the
navigation so that's really nice but
they've also put in a whole bunch of
other things in there that I'm not so
used to and so I'm just going to set up
my file a little bit more here I need to
have a CSS folder and I'm going to do C
s CSS my own s CSS instead of sass like
I usually do just for I guess the fun of
it and it's bootstraps written with that
anyway that's what I'm going to do um
so I'm going to use those now what I'm
going to do and maybe some of you have
already done this from your bootstrap
days but I'm going to grab the bootstrap
file and in bootstrap 3 there is the
variables if ever you use the bootstrap
a CSS but I'm going to go and grab they
have a custom folder now file so I'm
going to take both of those and actually
copy those and bring them over to my own
s CSS your new call it vendor and in
there I'm going to put those in there so
I have my custom and my bootstrap and I
have Adam open right here so we can go
actually it's rename this folder rename
I just want to get rid of all that just
to make it easier for me so I'm going to
come in here in vendor and I'm going to
open up both of them just so we can see
what they are so basically the whole
point of this is the variables are
things that can be changed over time and
ok and if you have any questions or
comments feel free to use the chat if
the audio is not working if the video
doesn't look good anything at all please
let me know I had a pretty
I'm also not used to looking at the
camera when I'm looking at the code so
what what they've done is they're just
importing everything here and in to
overwrite their variables we use the
custom folder now or this custom thing
it tells you what to do right here they
actually made a mistake with this
version of the alpha with the alpha 6
they tried something where they put the
custom here if you have used the other
versions you would have seen it whoops
up top I just delete it okay you would
have seen it here and you need to put it
back if you want this to work properly
I'm going to leave it here now just so
we can see the mistake that this causes
but just so you know if you are using
the version 6 of the Alpha and you're
going to set this up like I do you're
going to want to move that custom up to
the top over there I also just realized
I don't have pre pros on which I'm going
to need okay so what do I want to do
well the whole reason that I'm coming in
here is because I want to turn off a lot
of these one of the things with
bootstrap is we don't want to be using
all of these there's just way too many
you're probably not using all of this it
just makes your CSS file bigger than it
needs to be for absolutely no reason so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
turn off a lot now these I'm going to
keep normalized in print I'm going to
keep type images code I don't need so
starting here tables I don't need so I'm
just ctrl and if you're in a Mac I think
it's command clicking to select multiple
lines except it's not working very well
let's just it doesn't work okay code I'm
having some trouble here
buttons I want to keep forms I don't
want tables I don't want code I don't
want transitions I'm going to keep
drop-down I don't think i need button
groups I'm not going to need input group
I'm not going to need and don't need
navin Ave bar I do want cards I want
cards of replaced Wells and something
else breadcrumbs no paginate and I can
always come back and turn these on
because as you'll see this is gonna be
really simple Jumbotron no alert no
progress no media no most of these I
don't really need and for most projects
you're probably not using a lot of these
so you might as well come in and turn
them all off and utilities I do want so
with all that I'm just going to comment
them all out bang now they're not going
to actually get imported into my project
so this is super important to do because
it makes your CSS files so much smaller
and it only brings in the CSS you
actually need from bootstrap so this is
a really good thing to do and it's one
of the reasons you should be using the S
CSS from bootstrap and not be using just
regular CSS it just it really condenses
down on your projects they're just going
to add a project just top live event add
project and I'm just going to go in my
settings and let's go and just make sure
that it's going to do the right thing so
compiler settings sass I want it to auto
prefix on I want to replace a CSS with
CSS so it just means that it's going to
replace this with CSS so it's just going
to move it pretty much into there which
is exactly what I want to do so what I
actually do need to do is make a new
file and I'm going to save this right
away and I'm going to call this just
main dot CSS could be style a lot of
people call it app so I'll call it main
dot s CSS hit save and I'm going to do
let's just import boot strap so that's
just my lips at import and it's going to
be bootstrap right yeah boot a vendor
slash bootstrap dot s CSS save that I
can save this file now and I just want
to double check mm-hmm I didn't compile
I just got an error but I didn't see
what Mayor was what was my error
oh I had just made a mistake here guys
whoops I forgot so now I have to go I'm
going to leave custom alone because
custom is getting the right one but for
all these other ones I do have to point
them at the right place I should have
done this before that was silly of me
these are the types of mistakes that I
make regularly but you don't get to see
when I'm not doing it live so let's go
and fix that so let's just do so I'm
currently here so I want to step into
here so it's back one step which would
put me there so back another step and
then into bootstrap and then once them
in the bootstrap I need to go into a CSS
oh no did I lose odd anyway okay and
then I think that's it right yeah that
should be it
ah and I would have to fix it for all of
these actually usually I would do it in
one big shot because I might be turning
some of those back on but that's okay
trying to go too fast here so you guys
don't have to watch all this boring
stuff and then from there boot oops I
already did the bootstrap bootstrap
slash a CSS slash save let's see that
there we go success good
so it's compiled so now if I go and look
at my main I don't want that to be in
vendor whoops I don't even want that to
be there why is that doing that delete
main let's try this one again there we
go
that worked properly this time oops
cancel and there we go we can see my CSS
file did work properly and everything
all the the bootstrap stuff is coming
through so I don't need this file open I
don't need my boots
custom I'm going to be using the custom
a lot I'll be using the main a lot I
will not be coming in here I don't think
anymore okay so let's make a new file
and let's start actually doing some some
stuff here I'm gonna zoom out and let's
actually start doing the bootstrap stuff
now so this is what you're probably here
for so the first thing actually what am
i doing
the easiest thing honestly for me to do
is using their website to go to
getting started quick start starter
template and just grab that copy paste
that in there save it index dot HTML and
the only thing I want to change because
I don't want to link to different
jquery's and even their third J s and
all that I might as well just link to
their original stuff people might have
it cached it's going to go a little bit
faster just because this is where things
are going to be a bit different so I can
get rid of all that up to here delete
and just change this over to CSS slash
main dot CSS and that's the file I want
to be linking to delete hello world and
let's get started so I'm going to move
that out of the way
and we usually when I start I have it
like this
so let's just start quickly and then
we'll make sure that it's actually
working so I'm gonna have a header again
let's jump right over and I really like
their new documentation the new
documentation is much better organized
in my opinion the other one was it's
easier to find what you want so I want
components and navbar mat bar I think
the nav used to be in layout and then I
don't remember exactly how it was but I
remember the nav in nav bar were two
different places which was kind of
confusing and should I just grab this
one
let's grab this one I don't have too
much extra stuff in there and paste that
right in cool so nav I'm going to have
to change a few here
one thing I like nav bar toggleable I'm
going to switch that over to small so
you can change what size it toggles at
let's just save this and actually just
check really fast what this is looking
like I always feel how to do the live
preview now with the new preview cool so
it's working actually let's just move
this down I'm just trying to do a
navigation right now I'm not going to
style it yet
I'm going to put this like here get rid
of pre pros for now let's just organize
my window a little bit better oh yeah
I'm gonna yeah MTG I will be uploading
these streams so once I'm done I will be
uploading this to my channel it'll
probably be up tomorrow I think it takes
a while to process the file I'm probably
not going to edit it because I think
this is going to be a long one so I
won't have a chance to edit the whole
thing but I do plan on I do plan on
uploading them so there might be a bit
long though just because they're
unedited and high cron is nice nice to
see you guys here I'm so happy people
showed up honestly I wasn't sure if
anyone would be here so it's exciting to
me that there's actually people watching
this thank you so much guys for tuning
in it's really really cool makes me
super excited and see I'm just trying to
use my windows a little bit better here
umm and again sorry for those of you who
were here early on sorry for the audio
mistakes I want to learn Java for
college but I don't want to yeah I don't
blame you ah yeah this is a little bit
easier than Java I don't blame you at
all don't don't procrastinate too much
on that though um okay so there's my nav
bar um I'm just gonna try and set it up
a little bit like theirs so they have a
transparent nav bar I don't even think
of that call me ray
cool right thanks I will I'm not
familiar with the lever all at all sorry
if I if I if I knew a little bit I was
actually talking to someone about it I
know someone who works at a big company
and he was talking to me a bit about it
but I don't have experience with it I'd
love to learn a bit more about it though
especially after talking to him about it
but I don't have time it's hard to find
enough time just to make these than to
get into that stuff but maybe one day I
have two young kids it's hard to find
some time for this stuff sometimes um
yeah I don't know if they make
transparent nav bars probably not we
will have to play with that a little bit
I want to add a container in here right
so let's just do that nav I guess right
here would make the most sense uh dot
container tab that over and close div
that work yeah there we go so that's in
I know they used to have a thing here to
move it over to the right and it was
like nav right or something like that
but I think they got rid of that I
remember looking for it yesterday I
think it was when I first started
playing around with here and I was going
crazy and then it whatever it was that
it actually worked I think I found it in
the nav actually instead of the nav bar
um any of you know we at this moment I'm
in work but I'll see the stream later
yeah cool MTG yeah so as I said it will
be uploaded when I get whenever whenever
YouTube processes the whole thing it
will be up there so yeah have fun at
work I should be looking at the chat and
so looking up here but have fun at work
I think
horizontal alignment is that what I want
yeah so you can actually Center the nav
now that's right that's exciting I
remember there was one thing that drove
me nuts with bootstrap is I can ever
Center it so we can Center that so just
justify Content Center I want it on the
end and it's a lot of stuff you'll see
is like this now because they're using
flexbox so you see lots of
justify:center but then justify end and
not write necessarily
and so I think I use it on their doing
on the UL class so let's just throw it
on their navbar nav justify content and
that didn't work at all is it because
I'm into my nav bar nav because they're
just doing that on a PI did this do they
misspell something if any of you see
what I'm doing wrong please let me know
hmm okay we'll get back to that after
then because I don't want to waste time
on just this as I said this might be a
painful process guys oh what's up right
lots of question marks let me know what
that is I'm just trying to fix mine I'm
gonna skip I'm going to keep going a
little bit I'm not going to get hung up
on a nav and doing little details like
that so right here I'm going to call
this my header no this is call this a
section main all right no section here
Oh like I usually do in here I'm gonna
have an h1 it's going to be creative
template close h1 then we'll just do a
paragraph paragraph I think the class
that I want on this is display one I
think that's what they're callin and out
for the really big text
welcome to Mongo closed P one mistake I
always do guys when I'm doing bootstrap
stuff is I forget so let's just do
actually for my hero I can probably get
away with this and just do a text Center
let's save that I should have yeah so
display one makes your fonts really big
now they have display one down to
display six yeah ray I'm not I'm not
familiar with it at all it's something I
wish I was familiar with but sadly I'm
not I know people who are but I'm not at
all I wish I was and then we can also do
a button here so a dude a button button
we'll call this one primary for now
and we'll restyle it I'm going to use
their mix-ins I think a little bit too
trying it that to work because I think
that would be cool and honestly I'm not
going to do this whole thing down here
I'm just trying to play with it a little
bit so let's get to this next section
here this is I want to get into the
columns get into some a bit more of what
we're actually if you guys want me to
get into these little details let me
know in the chat I can try and maybe get
into some of these finer details but I'm
just trying to play with more of the
bootstrap classes and stuff instead of
really finicky CSS stuff so let's call
this about s so its section about which
will have what we do straight about us
whenever I see this I'm not sure about
the best practice for headings and
paragraphs because usually you want the
heading first and then I think you know
what I mean
what we do story about us I'm just going
to do in each two and we're going to
forget the story about us or maybe I'll
do that as a spam I'm not sure and after
that we will do plus oh no ah let's do a
container first dot container dot row
I'm not used to doing bootstrap duh
actually there's all that text let's
just do the images then those three
images will be column this is what's
cool I can just do column times three
you don't have to do something like
column small three or column medium
stuff like that you can just plug in
column it knows there's three of them
it's flexbox it's smart you could also
do something like column four you don't
have to say at what screen sizes it's
just going to be persistently four and
you can just do a column medium so to
stay a column it break when you get
smaller than medium and stuff so even
these let's put these as column smalls
and we'll to make sure it works in a
second column small column small column
small and inside each one of these I'm
going to put an image of loops um so for
my image it's going to be IMG / I forget
what I called them
let's get out of boot strap for a second
about us yeah I had good names
about us
or was it that I - ate the whole thing I
did but us zero one dot jpg and let's
just save that and see if this is
actually working oh I didn't put
anything in my button whoops I can't see
what that says learn more I think what
I'm going to do is I'm going to get up
to here and then I'll go back into the
CSS and start styling stuff just so we
don't spend the whole time writing HTML
because that would be kind of boring
weird my browser go there we go yeah you
can definitely have the PSD it's I
didn't make it sadly it's a nice design
I found it today we're looking around
so I'm actually when I'm done this I'm
going to put the whole thing on github
so you could find it on there there'll
be a link in the description once the
whole thing is uploaded but also a live
event where is it in here design files
I'll leave this up on the screen if you
want for a second but I don't think you
want to write that whole thing down but
this is where I found it there was no
copy writer on it so I really hope that
the guy who made this doesn't mind it's
a really nice design I should get your
name and let's go check that out
actually I was downloading a few on here
that had some copyright stuff so I
didn't want to infringe on on anything
so then I you know this one I found that
didn't have anything so Alexander Kassar
Casa cough thank you so much really nice
design I really like it really cool
colors and stuff really nice and super
good for practicing like oh my goodness
one thing I always tell people I've had
lots of people ask me how to get better
at this and if you're not a great
designer you don't want to waste time
designing find free templates online and
just go crazy trying to do them because
people make some crazy stuff sometimes
and it can be really that's a really
nice way to push yourself because you're
not coming up with the idea yourself
you're someone else's come up with cool
ideas and then you have to just figure
out how to actually do it so that's
where I got that from so this seems to
be working it looks good let's get rid
of that
and I'm just going to copy this paste
paste 0 to 0-3 save oh no it's not
working oh no what did I do wrong
container row column small that should
be working let's just get rid of the
small for a second but it should be
working I've been playing around with
this a little bit earlier today oh I
should on my images at the class right
let's do it for all of these at the same
time class is equal to they change the
name of the responsive it used to be
image responsive now it's image fluid ah
that was my problem ok cool there we go
so I have my three columns you can see
just by calling it a column it actually
does work which is awesome
and it should you know it's just going
to stay three columns all the time which
I don't want so I can just come in here
and then add my column small and now
there'll be a column from the small
screen size and up but they should there
we go they stacked on top of each other
at that point and I think I don't know
if this going to work but I'm going to
try justify content center I'm not sure
if this is going to work now it's
problem at the image fluid and I might
not think they have something to center
stuff they have more utility classes and
stuff that are more useful now
a high-cost whare I'm circus Kawara it's
not using it's not letting use the
skeleton that's weird
I don't know it it's giving you an error
with their CSS file I guess I'm not sure
what the best way to fix that would be
to be honest with you um I haven't new
skeleton in a while so but that really
surprises me that it doesn't like there
s CSS does it give you a specific error
if you're using pre pros let me just
open it up here it should tell you where
the errors coming from the new version
if you're on the newest version it's so
much better at being able to find the
mistakes it used to be a bit of a pain
in the butt like here it's highlighting
where my error is so you know it's
telling you what line in in what file
and stuff so just make sure it is the
skeleton one that's causing it and hmm
maybe yeah I'm not sure what would do
that it if you have a chance now if
you're you can just try and do it again
and see if and error does come up and
let me know what it is put it in the
chat and I'll see if I can help you up
yeah we'll try and fix those because
they're small images maybe I should have
made my images bigger but I just took
them from the size that we see here I
don't want the font right now
um let's bring that text in here oh I'm
getting a selected font fail during last
operation I've never seen that before
it looks like it's lorem ipsum anyway so
let's just go grab some lorem ipsum
that looks like too much story okay so
let's put our text in so we have a bout
container as I said I mean just doing h1
we'll do an h1 and we'll do what we do
close each one and let's going to get a
clasp on there but I'm not sure what it
will be yet and then a paragraph of the
arm ipsum close diagraph cool and all of
that should be centered so text Center
should do the trick I don't think that's
changed awesome
okay let's actually styling this
normally I'd go through my whole project
and then come back through but again I
think that'd be kind of boring it just
won't work in the browser is pre pros
giving you an error though you're saying
it's refusing to use the CSS that the s
CSS so when you have your s CSS file so
if you're using pre pros you've put in
the project file that you want do go to
your settings and just check the where
is it compiler settings and just make
sure that if you know make sure it's
compile compile is on it is for me
always by default but just double check
just to make sure it will be working I
also always have autoprefixer on you
don't need to though and then I usually
use replace segments so I'm saying if
it's in my CSS file it's going to go
into my CSS file instead but you could
always just play around with that a
little bit and it should you know when
you save your s CSS file oh just make
sure once you open skeleton save it
because even though the file is there it
might not do anything with the file
until you save the file and then it
should export that into a CSS file so
maybe maybe it's that try that out
because you need to make the save once
it saves it exports the CSS file and
then it's normal CSS and the browser
should be able to read it let me know if
that fixes anything okay so yeah as I
said let's actually start doing this a
little bit
so I think I do this a little
differently than some people whoops
wrong thing I'm going to go into here
and vendor and what some people do is
they just start doing all their own
stuff in the custom or they start doing
I don't know what so I'm actually going
to do my layout folder and I'm also
gonna have a components I don't know if
I'll need components I'm not gonna have
variables I'm gonna put all my variables
inside of their custom folder because
they already have a bajillion honestly
there's so many variables that they have
created I don't think I'll need my own
so I'm just going to be using their
custom one for that so let's jump up to
here and let's make a new file save as
and we're going to save this one in
layout and I'm just going to do this one
as hero dot s CSS hi the red you know I
hope you're doing well thanks for
joining us um so what do I want to do I
want to go to my main dot a CSS file and
import that so I'm going to do layout at
import layout slash a hero
it worked awesome cool so I'm going to
do my dog hero I don't think I'm gonna
do a lot as I said I'm skipping the
navigation right now I should show you
guys the navigation actually because the
navigation class is let's just go look
really fast you're here for bootstrap
for one thing that's really nice I'm so
happy with all the links are actually a
class now of nav link so that's just
incredible that is so awesome because it
used to be that if you're use bootstrap
3 you'll remember you had to do it as
like I don't remember if it was I guess
it was navbar L but then it was like the
DIA when you're in your CSS like you
literally when you're doing your nav
stuff it was like dot navbar out ul Li a
and then you'd have that and then you'd
like it was really annoying so I'm so
happy that they fixed that and now they
just have nav links you need to restyle
the links you do nav link
need to redo the nav item you can do nav
item which is all the list items you can
even build the whole thing without
ordered list now you can just do it just
with links if you want to it's a million
times better and it's more or less the
same thing as it was before they just
added a whole bunch of classes in here
and for those of you who have joined us
since the last time I said it thank you
so much for joining as I mentioned
before I thought no one would be here so
this is awesome that you guys are
actually here so for my hero what do I
want I want to do a background first
background-image:url now I'm in my sass
file but you have to member this is
going to export into my CSS file so I
just have to keep so I want to go back
one step and then go into my images and
then go to my hero BG JPEG let's hope I
stuck with what I always call this it's
rendered let's hope it actually look
good it worked awesome so again I'm
writing this as if I'm in this file I'm
not writing it as if I'm in here because
if you write it like back back back and
then in images it's not going to work so
pretend you're in your main CSS even
though you're not let's add a bunch of
padding padding of what 20 vertical
height viewport height I would say
vertical because it just seems to make
sense
that's not terrible I'm probably okay
that's okay ish is that okay ish it's
okay ish make it bigger 30 cool so
that's looking a bit better and I think
once I play with my fonts it's gonna be
the right size so this is we're coming
into the custom file and I'm going to do
a split view here let's go into the
bootstraps variables as CSS variables
and I'm going to split this down split
down close it here so the whole idea is
you go into their variables folder and
then you copy stuff up into your folder
so what I'm going to do is I'm even I'm
going to start with my colors because
the colors are right at the top and I'm
actually going to show you why
I mentioned at the very very very
beginning that there's a mistake in
their bootstrap file in this version of
alpha that you'll have to fix and I'll
show you exactly what I'm talking about
so why it's going to stay white just
look at this really quick let's change a
few of the colors just so we can match
that whites going to stay white black
and stay black red should I change the
red they don't usually you didn't really
use any red okay let's just make red
this color except really okay
copy I'm going to change red to this so
what you want to do is you want to come
up here so I'm just going to make a
comment for colors oops
and all you need to do is take what they
did so red you can even copy and paste
it and then I want to just paste in my
new value now what's really important is
you don't take the default the default
makes it so easier for you to overwrite
if you start taking this default it
screws it all up so I'm just taking the
color I want and red and it's going to
overwrite their variable of red orange
I guess they probably use orange in here
somewhere right hmm David yellow they do
they don't have a lot of colors in this
which is great I'm gonna soak a we don't
need that one you can always come back I
want to grab the yellow here so zoom in
cool copy that so let's do a yellow
yellow paste that one in whoops
actually tab I know it actually works
hmm weird
usually it lines up okay that's fine
orange yellow I have I'll leave it like
that for now I might want to come back
in here after it it takes some more
let's get this color that looks sort of
like a teal right teal I don't know how
long I'm gonna go with this guys just
you know I be finishing this site and
we'll see how far in I get so just to
show you as I mentioned I've been
talking I could come in and change a lot
of these but brand primary so I've
already used the brand primary color
because my button is a button primary
right so I'm going to come in and change
the let's just copy that makes it easier
whatever I'm still in colors so brand
primary is defaulting to blue I'm going
to make this red just for now just for
fun and take off default get rid of all
this spacing here so I want to remake
that this red color I'm gonna save my
CSS should compile properly but my
button didn't change and just to show
you that this I think is working let's
go to my display one and I'm going to do
text primary and that should become the
red color
aha see so this actually became the red
color but it's not changing my buttons
background color which is a problem and
you don't want to have to dive in deep
and do a whole bunch of stuff which I
did at first I was like this is driving
me crazy what's going on you're going
through like three layers of variables
to find out that you did change the
right variable and this is the fun of
doing things when they're still in beta
right it's one of the reasons they
haven't officially launched it you're
going to run into some problems if you
do want to play with it so all you need
to do is take this which is the order it
was variables mixing custom and if
you're using it if you find this video
in the future and you're using a newer
version of the Alpha this custom will
probably be up top here again they moved
it to try and fix some problems and it
fixed those I guess hopefully but now
when I save it a compile and look at
that it changed magic so just so you
know the custom really does need to be
at the top here for everything to
compile properly so that's the one
change other than commenting stuff out
in here that I would do if I
you now I don't really want my button to
look like that right and I don't think
they have any maybe they have a
transparent button now I haven't looked
at their buttons too much oh is that
really their secondary button now ha
cool they sort of have what we want
actually one other thing I want to do
everything's square edges in this and if
I look here it's round edges on my
button
so I'm actually whoops I'm in the wrong
file and here enable rounded I will turn
to false so I'll copy that you don't
need to comment it like I am I just I
like having the comments to so I can
find what I want and was going to switch
this over to false so all reefing that
has rounded corners your cards your
buttons a whole bunch of other stuff if
you just set that to enable rounded to
false and let's make this bigger I'll
zoom in I'm going to save my file and
you'll see that those become hard edges
so that's going to take everything that
had round corners and take it off which
is really nice people to do that in one
step so if you're used to overriding it
whoops all the time yeah that just makes
your life easier
the secondary button actually looks a
lot like what I want but it would take
some changes and I think what I'm going
to do instead is I'm going to try and
use their button mixin I've used it once
before I don't know if it's different
from the old one let's where's their
mix-ins box shadow transition oh don't
be in here mix-ins buttons so I should
be able to make my own button here which
is cool but I don't know if they hmm I
don't want it to have a background color
but button variant you know this is
really cool that you can really easily
include an EM to make your own buttons
let's just try it out so it's called
button variant so I need to give it a
color a background and a border do I
have to give it let's just try giving it
a bore
background:transparent I should just be
able to write transparent that should be
fine so let's find out so that I made a
components so we'll go to components
component I don't have anything new
save components I'll call this just
buttons CSS so I'm going to do I want to
call this one like button ghost it's a
ghost button I think that's what we call
these things right when they look like
that some a new button ghost and I'm
gonna use their mixin so it was @include
what am i including again did I close it
oh man why did I close it button variant
I think button variant and it was color
so it was gonna be white so I might as
well use white transparent and the
border I do want to open this back up
actually buttons em commit border just
for the border color
I'll put white and we'll see what this
looks like oh wait I know it didn't work
no button no mixing name button variant
why not I brought in there I misspelled
it
copy paste no oh no did I not bring it
in - I'm sorry guys I brought in the
mix-ins
why is my thing not working and oh I
know why
silly me that was main whoops wrong main
closed you I didn't import it
um components that was buttons right at
import comp own and slash buttons was a
button or buttons I make mistakes like
that all the time so it was buttons okay
save that's good now and now my button
variant should work a success it did
work okay good so that did work now I'm
getting my success message so let's make
sure that actually worked I want to go
back over to my index and the little
disorganized with my files button ghost
hey there we go it worked
cool I'd probably want to change the
hover and stuff on there but just to
show you I just want to go quickly to
look at how they're they're mixing works
a little bit there this color also I
want to change obviously so this would
be text do they call it text white by
any chance they do cool so this could be
class is equal to text white as well
whoops hey there we go so I would say
it's perfect when you look at the design
but it's you know hmm they broke it onto
maybe I should have put in container row
oh actually this would be good to show
you something else you can do now which
is really cool
column those do this is like your column
eight so one of the problems that we
used to have actually I'll show you two
things right now and again if you guys
have any questions what I'm doing don't
be shy so one of the things you can do
now let's just save this and see what
it's going to look like so yeah there's
my column it's in the column that's
working out well what you used to be
able to do if you had a column eight
then you could come in here and it used
to be a column offset or was it columns
size in the offset it's just offset now
so I could do an offset to two eight ten
twelve yeah so I could do that and then
it will Center what you know and then if
you had something like a column seven
well too bad you couldn't Center
column seven and again if you if you
missed anything earlier you don't have
to you don't have to do an MD seven you
can you can still use all the same
naming one but if you just do column
seven it's just always a column seven so
let's just say I wanted use a column
seven and I wanted to Center it you can
I just forget how it's not in the row
let's go find that I know you can do it
I just completely forget what the
classes and this is where I said I will
be diving a lot into their their their
documentation for this to be able to do
anything in here it's probably under
utilities I'm guessing a display image
replacement helpers spacing no that's
for my margins and stuff maybe it's not
under utilities layout grid let's see ah
man I can't believe I forget where I
found this before offsetting columns no
that's what we're just looking at before
right yeah just they've changed it for
the offset now oh man
I'm annoyed I don't want to get in there
mix-ins for that would it be up higher
no gutters no gutters is nice and easy
to do we'll look at that after oh here
we go justified content justified
content center so on the row I just have
to do it just defy content center just
like we were looking at before and that
should Center it so you don't need you
don't run into those problems that we
used to have before where things would
just be impossible to Center if you
didn't have the right column widths and
stuff so this is much nicer cool um I'm
going to leave that like that I know
it's not perfect to the design or
anything but I'm just trying to run more
through bootstrap than to be perfectly
styling everything so let's look at this
next section because I don't think
there's a whole lot do here um and if
you do what if you guys want to see me
style stuff a little more just let me
know I will style it a little bit more
than what's currently going on but for
the moment I just want to explore a lot
of them the newer boots
be stuff so that's working out actually
let's just make it and we can close my
hero we can close my buttons we can
close bootstrap variables I'm going to
keep cuz just you know we can jump in
here when you want it when you're ready
to do your fonts and everything honestly
just set it all up like colors your body
stuff like those just go look and the
easiest way to find something in here
you want your body command F to do your
find/replace thing just find find and
then it's the second one like you have
the first up there and then this will
get you where you want your body
background color if you need to change
it bang it's right there the default
text color bang it's right there so just
nice and easy to change things really
quickly the link colors everything
you've ever wanted to change just make
sure you use this and it makes it so
fast to change stuff yeah I reply to my
messages message me if you just send me
a message on on YouTube through YouTube
I get it or whatever you want I try to
reply to as much as my stuff as possible
so if you need yeah send me a message
about anything right and I'll be glad to
help out I try and reply as fast as I
can too um so yeah don't be shy I try
and help people as much as I can and
it's what I enjoy doing okay okay I'm
nice pace it out a little bit okay let's
just do this really fast let's space
that out new whoops not a new Photoshop
file I knew here this will be my about s
layout underscore about s CSS don't
forget what I did before where I forgot
to import it I constantly forget to
import stuff about
and it's sort of what I always forget to
import stuff into my main it's really
annoying so this was called a boat or
let's try about try what I called it I'm
padding 10 vertical height 0 viewport
height that seemed to work perfecto
cool that looks good and good good good
ok so I can go back into my index and
who do I want to do all that cool 1 2 3
4 5 columns and they have borders on
them so we could look at some of the
border classes we can do in stuff too
which are cool section class stats let's
try that whoops what am i doing we're
not in CSS okay so in here i will do a
dot container with a row with whoops
container row column one two three four
five five twelve divided by five twelve
doesn't divide by five let's just do
column and let it do its magic where
we'll just figure it out all by itself
column times five yes so this stats
actually can have a I forgot their
background classes guys I haven't used
bootstrap and way too long because I
don't think they've changed this from
the old one
utilities I guess colors background
color is just BG okay it is uh except I
don't know what let's just hope it's
this one which is success I think
let's try BG success BG success and see
what happens
oh I don't have any Content that's this
good Oh completely the wrong color
that's okay we'll leave it like that for
now I know I have there their color in
there somewhere so in here in there
columns let's just put how do they do
this hmm so I'm going to do a paragraph
and with the class is equal to display
one again so this should be on its own
line there we go and close paragraph
let's just fix that and let's just fix
all of these at the same time P class is
equal to display one close P and now
we'll come in and do the numbers 42 123
$15.99 24 so this should be nice and big
there we go
they should all be white so I'm just
going to say for this whole thing text
white that should change all the text to
white super and then after that
paragraph we're going to need whoops
print anymore paragraphs
and again it's five columns and I think
actually let's I'll do this first though
but the five columns are because I'm
just using call and I'm not saying how
big the column should be it's just magic
and it works and it evenly spreads them
out so it's a nice thing that used to
not be able to do closed paragraph and
let's just copy the text that's fine I
don't care if the layout changes paste
maybe put these in small tags - it's
going to keep you in the errors here
isn't it copy okay they're all getting
the same here I don't feel like getting
that error over and over again for the
font missing save let's just see if that
looks okay actually those font sizes
look fine
success is green primary is blue what's
the one that's the light blue though I
thought success was like a pale blue but
I changed some of the colors
primaries like the dark blue success
warning this one one two info ah info is
the one I was thinking of VG info thanks
for the help Toby yeah that's it got the
color I was after cool um so what I'm
going to do is text white and also text
center um am i doing that oh yeah
they're centered okay
so this should be evenly spaced and now
I can add borders to these because if we
zoom in a bit on this we can see that
there is a border on them I don't know
if this is gonna work perfectly or not
hmm
yeah that should be okay let's try let's
see what happens um so on the column
let's just try I forget what it is I've
done B zero to get rid of the borders
but I don't remember how to add the
borders uh borders I want just on okay
not border right I can only turn them
off I can't turn them on add classes to
an element to remove borders or
somewhere oh I thought I could add
borders use boarder utilities to quickly
style the border and border radius can I
add borders I thought I could add oh
well I can
we'd have to go do some custom CSS for
that so what we'll do for now is and
this is the cool thing one nice thing
about with using bootstrap is I haven't
really done a lot of CSS yet for this
anyway I haven't done a lot of CSS in
general but you know if I look here the
only thing I need is my borders and more
padding I got the text color I got the
centered text I got the spacing I've
gotten everything I really need here the
background color and I haven't written
any CSS for it I just need to add the
spacing on there so it really does help
out for that type of stuff so which is
really really cool um so yeah let's keep
going I don't know if I want I want to
do some cards is there anything in here
that looks like it could use cards these
could use cards I guess this could be
cool too because this one's a different
height from the rest of them which is
something I definitely want to look at I
think I'm gonna be like another half
hour guys and that might be it for me I
mean two things let's try and do some
cards it's not really the best use case
for cards right here but I can still do
you know it sort of goes it's the text
to go with an image so let's I'm gonna
skip a whole bunch of stuff and do that
and then yes because I want to explore
the cards and then I'll see if I'll try
and throw this together too with the
different height things here because I
know we can do something like that now I
don't know if it's going to work out
perfectly but I know they they have
something for supporting different hided
columns that might work out well for
this we'll try it out haven't I've never
tried it so we'll see how that works so
meet our team section whoops not dot
section team we need our container we
need our row we need a column
let's just do a small for oops times
three just to show you can still do it
the old-fashioned way so that's good
this is just a hover state I'm not going
to bother with the hover State for now
okay do I do it this is the first time
I'm doing a live stream so I don't know
how often I'm going to do one to be
honest
I do want to do it somewhat regularly
but I don't know I'll see how the
reception for this one is overall and
just in general I do want to make it
semi regular in the very least it really
depends on my schedule and stuff - I'm a
teacher in real life so and right now I
have a bit more relaxed schedule but
coming up soon I have another class that
I'm teaching so I guess that'd depend
plus there's family and everything but
yeah I do want to make it regularly but
I can't promise every Thursday night
maybe at one point it will become
something I try and be more consistent
with um this is this was really just an
experiment to see how it would go and if
anybody wouldn't show up so just so you
know but yeah if you do like it please
let me know and I'll try and definitely
do them more often I need to know what
to do for them though I don't know what
type of content what stuff you guys want
to cover I've had lots of people asking
me about bootstrap so I thought it'd be
a fun one to do but if there's anything
specifically that you'd want to see me
cover we could always look at that so in
each one of these I want to do a card so
I'm actually going to pull bootstraps
documentation back up because their
cards their classes on their cards I
still they're not that difficult but
they're not super duper easy yet
components card so I just want something
like that right image on the top and
then their text so you can see there's a
whole bunch of different cards that you
can do now there's ones without the top
there's with the image there's grouping
there's you know lots of cool stuff you
can do with their cards with the feet
you know something like that with
on the top you can play around with it
as much as you want but I just want this
nice simple one it has image on the top
with some text so let's go and look at
doing that
carousels do you want me to do the
bootstrap carousel or to do a custom
carousel Gino I could just add a random
carousel into here for sure using
bootstrap I wouldn't mind I have a bunch
of images and stuff so I could
definitely take a look at doing that
just so you know this is bootstrap for
that I'm using in case you missed the
beginning so I haven't looked at the
bootstrap for carousels at all maybe
they've changed them a little bit since
3i you know I haven't done much with for
at all this is so angular I love
actually a live stream that would be fun
but sure I I I'm happy you like it right
and it looks like there's I haven't
checked the stats at all so I don't know
how many people are coming in and out of
here but it looks like a few of you guys
are watching so that's cool so yeah I
could try and definitely make this a
little bit more regular off talk to the
wife and find a good time to do it and
sort of snuck this one in okay so let's
look at this card I'm going to do a dot
card inside my card I have an image that
has a class of card image top and then
that's going to have a sibling of a div
called card block and inside my card
block I will have a card title oops I
will have a let's do a paragraph that's
a card title and see what that looks
like because I think in the actual
design their names aren't that much
bigger let's see how this looks
card title plus a paragraph of card text
boom hey I would only does one of those
when I press tab cool and for my images
I completely forgot what I named them so
let's go look team one two three that
makes it easy
um oh this shouldn't be a diff class
this should be an image class right I am
G so the source on that one is IMG /
team zero one dot jpg and let's just
save that and see what happens
oh and it probably needs to be
responsive because it looks squished car
image card top image fluid and again
it's image fluid now and not the old
image responsive that look better yeah
that looks better
cool so that looks like it's working
this looks a little busted though but
let's see what happens card oh that's
why because this shouldn't be closing
there save yeah that looks better
okay cool and let's just go through his
name in Mathew to a cheese mat you dicks
and this should say graphic design good
good good so I'm going to switch this
over to like an h5 or something just to
make it close h5 so my whole card should
be a text center and then this can also
be a text cap be tell lies nope text and
that's about a cap B tell lies but I
might spell that right I know you can do
that I'm a hundred percent sure I can do
that
utilities utilities it's not only
typography transforms see then misspell
that no I spelt it right hey
do you know did you want me to do the
carousel in this project I want to make
sure I wasn't I was talking about other
things I could do so I wasn't sure if
you were why is that not capitalizing
that's frustrating
anyway I'll finish this up and I'll
throw a carousel in here randomly just
in case that's what you're after um-hmm
at least I know I did it right does this
can this not go on there does it have to
be on here or something no that's why I
thought it should be on the h5 that
would make more sense that's bizarre
okay sorry I want to see why that's not
capitalizing sorry this is really big
just because I usually zoom in to make
my demos capitalize important is it it's
on there too oh because I'm didn't
capitalize ah I want I don't want
capitals man uppercase what am i doing
guys it's getting late here a little
getting a little tired okay so that is
good let's just wrap these three guys up
really fast I'm actually going to copy
and paste this whole thing in a second
because you'll see there's a border on
it I don't want any borders because
there's no borders going on over here so
on my card itself the car the the
borders are all coming from the card
that much I know
so this is where that whole border thing
I was talking about before I knew you
could turn them off I think you could
add borders do you just need a nice
little border zero on their border zero
and there you go they're gone no more
borders so that's cool and even that's
just math this should be text can you
did I think yeah could have been more
muted in that that's not very muted we'd
have to play with our colors and stuff a
little in there let's just grab this
whole card
copy what's this oh my column that's
okay we can leave the column copy-paste
and
and paste will change the picture I
won't change all the text and all that
three to save ah magic and let's just
make sure this is sort of working oh no
wrong wrong thing here they should at
one point snap hey I got that dissenter
I don't even know what I did to Center
them
I must have added a tech center you'll
see this is breaking because it was set
to the column and not like anything
specific when it runs out of room that
looks kind of ugly actually when it runs
out of room it will sort of snap around
just figure itself out because I just
made them random columns why are these
imaged why is that stretching that's
nasty that's weird I'll have to inject
that at another time because that's
weird that it's an image fluid that's
bizarre
hmm I'm gonna have to investigate that
another time if it wasn't so late I'd
look at it now but
yeah I have time if I'll do that now
Gino I'll check out that cuz you know I
do want to look at this to you okay I'm
gonna do carousels and then I'll jump
into this because I think the carousel
should be pretty simple
I hope let's go check it out I don't
know if they've changed it at all
actually if I'm doing the carousels I
will have to bring that back in because
I think I might have turned off I did
turn it off crappie let's bring that
back in because I'm going to need their
carousels now and I can close that again
is that going to be under component sirs
that used to be under JavaScript right
see this is so much nicer how organized
this now with just components and
they're all there instead of yeah I love
their documentation a lot more okay
let's find one that looks good that's
just it's not it that's my carousel is
it there we go that's with controls aha
that's what we want what else do they
have in here actually oh they have
little lines oh there's no dots well
they put lines now instead of dots
was it dots before I seemed to think it
was dots before and with captions cool
and we can play with the options a
little bit awesome okay so let's start
just by taking that doesn't help me at
all though let's just showing me how I
can do the caption here's the big one
see of course the okay div ID carousel
example okay let's just write out a
custom one here let's make our own let's
do a section carousel and let's check it
out okay so let's do a carousel here and
if anybody else wants to see me do
something other than this thing just let
me know I'm here for you guys I'm just
playing around here with bootstrap a
little bit so you know if there's
anything you want to see I'm really here
for you so just let me know so in here
we need a div with an ID I don't do a
lot of ID's I'm carousel I'm just going
to call it carousel
and a class of carousel and a class of
slide and I just want to check this out
really quickly
oh well that so the O L here is going to
be these things then why is this I have
a class of slide on it though hmm
that's how they do it I guess okay and
we're going to need that data thing too
because that's when you see this data
ride thing and it's carousel one or just
carousel this is what's used for the
JavaScript the JavaScript is going to be
referee I D is what these are
referencing so this data target these
need to be the same as the ID there so
I'm not using carousel example
indicators I'm just oh this is hmm
interesting anyway I'm just doing
carousel so these will target carousel
and there's some pretty sure is just
going to the JavaScript to make sure it
works hopefully I'm not wrong on that I
just want that on one line cool okay so
that looks a bit better um so now I need
a Noel
so we'll do well with a class of
carousel indicators with let's just do
what three slides just like they did
we'll do five slides Li times five
except they need an ID on them ID of I
know that's a data target I'll have to
add that after maybe you can do that but
I don't know how so we'll just come in
here and do a data target and again this
is just going to my hash of carousel
there we go and we need it to do a data
slide two equals zero
I'll do 0 for the first one and then
just have to manually 1 2 3 4 so
anything if you know any of the other
programming languages outside of HTML
and CSS they always start counting at 0
so 0 is 1
in computer world and one of these needs
a class of active class oops
class equals active good let's just save
that I don't think we're gonna see
anything yet
I wouldn't make sense if we see anything
I don't have anything in here
when's d-block do display:block it's
making sure my images are display:block
cool display:block image fluid but image
responsive used to automatically do that
that's interesting okay so I think
that's all I need for that and then you
always need the the div carousel in ER
so that's easy care this is the same as
it used to be so carousel inner and then
we just need our Dib so I'm just going
to do a div of taro cell item times five
because I was doing five of them and
inside of that there will be an image
with a class of D block with a class of
image fluid and let's just tab that my
image source I'm going to use the same
image for all of them if you don't know
about it ah is on splash it slash I
don't know we'll do a thousand by 600 so
just a placeholder images that look
pretty they'll all be the same image now
though hmm I'm not finished yet so
hopefully that fixes itself in a second
mmm-hmm I do something wrong I thought
I'd be seeing something at this point
that's just my controls which I
shouldn't technically need Femina copy
these because I don't want to write all
that out
that's my controls there but this just
needs to be for carousel ID carousel and
inspect and let's see what I did wrong
zero pixels tall hmm why is it zero
pixels tall okay let's just just for fun
section do I have to give a carousel
height I don't remember having to give
it a height slides only note the
presence of the D blocking image fluid
on the carousel images prevent the
default image alignment just to quickly
make sure image Class D block image
fluid I did that correctly if anyone
sees what I did wrong
please let me know I hate making
mistakes like this oh wait I don't have
it maybe it's because I don't have one
it's active carousel active so there's
none that are actually there
wow that was it okay hmm there we go
make sure you have an active image and
look at that it works cool so again here
I'll just change like this one can be
101 102 this is changing the width so
it's the width and the height so each
one of these will be a little bit wider
than the next but it's just going to
make it so each one is a different image
there we go so they're all different
images now so there you go that's a
really simple carousel is there anything
else do you know that you'd want to see
how to do with the carousel it's really
just make sure that you're you have the
ID the ID is the same as your data
targets which is super important
and then if you do have these little
things down at the bottom - they're also
looking they also have it the hrf here
needs to be your the same href as your
ID here really really important that
it's all set up and that you're just
using all of the classes they tell you
to use pretty much because it's as soon
as you don't their classes are making
this work and styling everything you can
overwrite their classes or
change a little bit it's curious what
would happen if we took d block off mmm
not sure why we need to display block it
says it's over writing something from
the default browser so it probably stops
things from happening by putting the D
block in there but as anything just read
the navigate event navigation the
documentation and that's what this video
is all about and note the presence the D
play it just prevents default image
alignment so I guess it makes sure
everything's aligned properly of course
you can come through here and play with
the options and everything and no
problems you know I'm happy that that
helped I hope it helped I mean if you
need to get rid of something it looks
like it's easy enough to get rid of yeah
here we go
that's why it wasn't working if they put
it really big - to let me know that I
really needed to have that so you do
need to have the active or it's just not
going to work because nothing's active
and then it disappears that makes a lot
of sense so if you do want to change
something we can also do that let's go
and play with that a little bit actually
since we're here so I put this yeah I'd
go all the way to the bottom just to
make sure you're after all of the other
JavaScript stuff and I'm going to do a
script low script it doesn't have to be
on this page you can make a JavaScript
file for this and link to it - obviously
there might even be ways of doing it
with boots within bootstraps stuff but
um let's see yeah so we want to select
that's using jQuery so we want to select
our carousel
carousel
let's easy enough and I'm pretty sure I
just want to make sure okay anyway I'll
do that and we'll see what happens so
you can change the delay between
automatically whether or not it should
by default it's true so just to show you
if I I can use my keyboard to control
that so I could turn that off what else
can I do
pause it's set to hover so if set to
hover pause cycling yeah you can see
when you hover on top it's going to
pause it and if you don't want to do
that you can change it to no auto plays
the carousel wrap whether the carousel
should cycle continuously or stop when
it gets to the end so I think it's
automatically going to cycle so just to
look at the keyboard since it's probably
the easiest one to show you how it's
working I come in here and it even shows
you a nice little example there I'm just
going to do that come in here and say
keyboard keyboard and I'm going to put
it to false I'm guessing that's winning
I need that false let's just see if that
worked so now yeah
now when I play with my keyboard it no
longer works and let's do interval I
think I need input anyway interval
whoops not what I want interval of like
100 it's gonna go really fast if I did
that properly do I not want those is it
comma there we go it's going so fast
it's just like glitching of the whole
system yeah
comma separated not with the the
semicolon so you can play with the
settings a little bit if you want to did
I just break this whole thing yeah I
really broke it don't do 100
is that what happened really is a Wow
interesting
okay so that is that and that last thing
I want to look at I'm going to tackle it
I don't know if it's going to work
but we're going to try because I
remember looking at it going that's
really cool that you can do that and I
want to try it out before I get out of
here and it's me the last thing I do I
think it's gonna be in the grid I know
it was in cards components was it in
cards I remember we're gonna go check
might have been in grid I think was in
the cards because I think it was really
far down there it is this is sort of
what I want to try so I don't know if
it's going to work because of the
ordering of everything but you can do
that Pinterest style thing now with
their cards heads up oh yeah it just
this is important and they're using the
discipline they're using columns the the
column property column property is a
really cool property if you don't know
what it is but it's support isn't
fantastic and I keep looking here
because I'm not used to looking at the
webcam sorry guys the support for it
isn't amazing it might be a lot better
now I haven't played around with it for
quite a while I think internet explorer
doesn't it's the same with anything I
figure you know you should double check
depending on what you're doing but it's
it probably will work um so let's try
this out um so I don't know if I have
enough images to oh I know
I don't have enough images I'm using I
want to do these images right here so
let's see how they did it I only need
images though that's okay I think do
they have any cards that are just
pictures that's just with text there we
go that one is the third one one two
what's the P three for padding um card
card card why was it doing one two three
four five six it's probably doing it
like that eh it's going up and down
where's the one that's only an image
this one yeah just throw an image in
there card image cool okay so we want to
let's just call it is it our work
portfolio our work I'll call it work
section work with a dot container fluid
and I'm doing a container fluid because
it's a full-width with my row with are
they not doing this in cause I thought
they were going to do it with columns
card call okay that's how they're doing
it dot card columns cool hmm is it just
going to how does it know how tall to be
like when does it decide to wrap up to
the do card is it the peeth know the p3
is giving pad at p3 B for padding card
one card to p3 I just want to see I saw
the p3 on a few of them now okay I'm
just curious what's causing it to know
when to go to the top card
oh no that's image top let's see what
happens so I just want something like
that so inside of card columns I need to
have I have seven so I'm going to do a
card with an image called card image
image fluid and let's know and I need
seven of those times seven good image I
think I just called them work yeah what
work one through seven so we can do all
these at the same time IMG / work zero
one dot jpg let's see what that gives us
just to start with that didn't work at
all what I feel betrayed have a div
class card inside of card columns plural
yes
do I not need oh maybe it's this that's
screwed everything up I'm curious if I
even need a row because I'm not using do
I even need a container like I'm not
using column actual so masonry yes yes
cards built with CSS okay let's just do
an inspect on here then I feel like
there's something missing card columns
card hmm so what's wrong with mine cart
oh ah card times 7 I need 7 cards not 7
images and then I need this cut delete
man see it's getting late
paste and let's try this one more time
guys so IMG / work 0 1j big aha it does
work I wonder finger to the gutters
though I didn't think of that
that's annoying margin:0 maybe it would
work
m0 sitting on p0 no anyway that's kind
of cool that that's working let's just
try putting these numbers to the numbers
ahead two three the order I think is
going to be off five six seven because I
think it's going up like this it's just
automatically but yeah the order is a
little off
that's not terrible it's kind of cool
that we can at least get that masonary
masonary me we can get it we can get it
looking good yeah that's not too bad but
it's not quite what I want and because
they put these in a oh I have that weird
ro thing back there that should yeah
okay that gets rid of my side-scrolling
do I even need the container it's just
okay I wonder if I get rid of that
spacing now Pro might not be is easy
margin-bottom
as I want it to be though just because
of the way the column system works Oh
column gap it's defaulting to 3/2 which
is sort of I wanted 4/5 how many do I
want one two one two three four I wonder
if I can change that but I still even if
I turn this off I must be happy there
must be a way to fix this this is coming
from just hard columns I wonder if I'd
have to go into there let's see if
there's any other information on that
card columns break points oh I can't
change the column counts oh you can do
it for the break points that make sense
card columns I wonder if that's in there
variables here cards find
here we go default space around the X
and the y the border Drive borders on
these there is but I can't really see it
so no that's the spacer I don't know if
that spacers what I'm after call up this
is what I want a hat okay let's just
change this I mean I using this would
probably be better but for now just
because I'm getting tired paste that in
take off the default and oh it is column
margin I'm just going to put that zero
columns I want four and card column gap
zero let's see what happens ha ha ha now
we just have those ugly borders on there
and this up you go up I'm missing a
pixel okay is there an easy way to turn
off yeah there was a thing in here
border width I turned it off manually
before on these ones using a class but
for a design like this you just want all
these set to zero right because why
would you none of my cards would
actually have a border oh my goodness
awesome except that should go up this is
the fun of using I remember seeing even
as I resize you'd want to build some
media queries into this and stuff - yeah
that's like flashing around there's
probably a way to play around with that
a little more
I don't know exists everything but the
the columns thing can I remember being a
little weird sometimes but that's cool I
mean it's not perfect but it's giving me
something I definitely want to explore a
little more too
make this work because if this image was
here and then everything would just be
perfect and let's just check the order
yeah the order is way off I went one two
three four five six seven I think
something like that so it's really going
like one two three four five six seven
so it's going it's doing it in columns
which makes sense I just didn't realize
that I'd be using the columns so I went
across instead anyway
it's yeah it's almost been two hours now
not quite an hour and a half sorry for
the rough start for anyone who was there
at the very beginning of it I apologize
first time I'm doing this next time I
promise will be better I will try and do
these a bit more regularly I don't know
how often yet but them you know I will
be making an effort to do this at least
every now and then and maybe at one
point actually lock down a schedule for
them so it will be uploaded you might be
watching this after the fact if you do
want me to actually have a schedule for
all this just let me know put a comment
down below to let me know there should
be you liked it if it was I can't
promise when to be in Abbey Beach
probably after 9 p.m. Eastern whenever I
do it because my kids need to be asleep
so just let me know just you know would
a schedule be a good idea and how often
you'd like to see these types of things
and if these types of things interest
you it's not as refined as my other
videos I'm making mistakes and it's
going to happen I added out mistakes a
lot of the time that I'm actually making
and I don't edit all of them out because
I think it's important you sort of see
the rawness a little bit I like when
you're watching a video you're seeing
mistakes how the problem-solving happens
but as you saw with this there's lots of
dead time and a bit more problems with
that so if you really didn't like it let
me know it makes for long videos but if
you're willing to stick around you want
to see this type of thing
I will interact with you if you manage
to make it in and you know you can you
can leave comments I'm gladly going to
to respond to you guys and try and do
what you're asking me to do if you want
me to cover a certain topic on one of
these live ones let me know and I'll
look into that I don't know if I'll get
into the angular stuff just yet I'd want
to do a little bit of looking into it a
bit more before I start making live
videos embarrass myself but it's
definitely something that I could
check out at one point but again maybe I
just continue with this website for now
and actually make it you know eventually
get it looking really good is one idea
maybe but if you have anything else
you'd like me to do live please let me
know and I'll gladly at least consider
it
have a great night guys or day or
whenever you are watching this and until
the next video take it easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
