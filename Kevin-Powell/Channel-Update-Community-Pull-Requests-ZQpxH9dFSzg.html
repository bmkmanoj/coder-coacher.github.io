video what's it about well it's a
channel update I want to look at where
this channel was where we are now and
where I'd like to see this channel going
in the next six months or so as well as
we're gonna do some community pull
requests to really wrap up that last
series that we worked on there's a
little side note I said that my channel
is just over a year old and you might go
and look and see that it's like 14 years
old or something crazy like that because
I made this account way back when and I
only really started uploading videos for
this purpose about a year ago now or
just over a year ago now of 1314 months
ago this really is more like the real
anniversary cuz it was only about a year
ago now that people actually started
watching these videos and it was only
like five people but there were some
people watching them so that was cool it
took seriously like two the two months
to get anybody watching at all and then
like four months before there was any
traction like any traction and just
recurring views and a few commenters
that were coming back and stuff like
that so like the first four months were
slow but that was cool cuz I was having
fun doing the videos anyway
I think it was around four months I
don't remember who was fifty or hundred
subs it was around around there so just
thank you to my first 100 subs if you
are one of the first 100 please say hi
in the comments below I haven't heard
from some of you guys in a little while
and of course a huge thank you to all of
you guys who came after the first 100
cuz you know they're all just as
important to me but no honestly thank
you so much for the support and seeing
the growth of this channel has been
awesome and honestly it's been
incredible from the discussions that
been going on in the comments some
people have been reaching out to me
through email or through some of the
social networks and we've been having
some really good discussions we've
talked about some cool stuff and fix
some stuff in the videos I was working
in so that's really good too so one last
time just thank you so much for watching
for subscribing for commenting and you
know just being awesome all around now
going to where the channel is now well
we just finished up that big long series
and man that was a long series who we've
done a lot of long series since the
channel started and each one has gotten
longer than the last one and
that had its pluses and minuses the
projects are really fun they're things I
enjoyed working on but the longer series
is the harder it is for me to do imagine
trying to work on a project and you do
one hour and then you stop for a week
and you come back and do one hour and
then you do your little thing okay I'm
gonna stop now you come back an hour and
an hour and an hour and it goes on for
like 10 12 weeks you forget what was
going on before you lose the whole
momentum of the job and everything and
it just becomes like a struggle and
after eight weeks or so it was becoming
a little bit of a struggle luckily we
got into JavaScript and all of that but
this is just a city this is where the
channel is now and going for the next
six months the long series probably not
gonna have one we will have series of
videos but they'll be short and I'm
gonna be instead of doing big projects I
want to focus more on certain concepts
so like here's one concept let's make
some videos on that cool we got that I
was like two videos one video two videos
that's going to another thing here's a
cool trick that I learned and more
little things like that as we go forward
at least for a little while until I
recover from this last series that we
just did I also want to change my
content strategy a little bit and that's
not to say I'm changing what we're
talking about it's still gonna be about
how to make the web and how to make it
look good while we're at it but I want
to target beginners a little bit more as
well as the more intermediate and
advanced level stuff I find that most of
my videos apart from my really early
ones I'm always using sass I'm using
gulp I'm doing some some more advanced
stuff and for some people that's great
but based on the comments and questions
I get on some of those videos there's a
lot of beginners that are looking for
content and I'm not sure it's all there
exactly what they need now that's not to
say that all of the content will be
beginner content because no that's just
not gonna happen
but what I'm thinking is like one
beginner ish type video and then maybe
two or three more advanced ones and then
another beginner one and then two or
three more advanced ones and you know
we'll just see how that goes and that
might evolve over the next six months or
a year and to see how that content
strategy is working but it's sort of my
goal and I also don't want to make video
like here's how this one little thing
works so you add some margin to it and
the thing moves over thanks for watching
like that's not the type of beginner
content I want to be making to me and be
like here's how margin works and here's
what a collapsing margin is and here's
when you're using padding and when
you're using margin and Oh talking about
collapsing margins why do they stop
collapsing sometimes because they're not
always collapsing margins and like look
at in depth stuff to really make sure
that the beginner understands what's
going on and I also think that can be
really useful at intermediate levels
because sometimes you're using something
you feel comfortable with it but you
don't really understand the full the
full thing of what's actually going on
or when does that behavior change and
all those little weird things with CSS
so I want to go sort of in depth on
beginner issues and then also cover some
intermediate and advanced stuff as well
I would also love to be doing some more
live videos I did a couple in the last
year and I really really want to do more
it's so much fun having you guys in in
there commenting away while I'm working
and being able to have a discussion with
you and get ideas from you while I'm
doing stuff and I missed that but I'm
busy so I am going to try but I'm not
promising anything it is a big goal of
mine to get some live videos but I don't
know when they'll be but you all anyway
we'll see what happens with the live
stuff fingers crossed but who really
really knows another thing that I'm
looking at doing is breaking my videos
up more so I mentioned this in the last
series but say instead of having one
30-minute long video maybe 10 10 maybe 3
10 minute long videos because I just
think that could be easier to digest for
people if I do that though I don't want
to like all of a sudden have like oh
this one simple concept is taking three
weeks to come out because that's sort of
boring so if I do have a certain concept
that gets broken up into multiple videos
what I plan on doing with it is
releasing the videos like Wednesday
Thursday Friday if there's three of them
are Wednesday Thursday if there's two of
them
something like that so we'll see how
that goes as well I'd love feedback
on what you think about that would you
like the long videos do you like them
when they're an hour long or 50 minutes
or 40 minutes or you prefer a few
shorter videos as long as it's sort of
like logical breaks in in each video
which one is which one's better for you
and also what type of stuff would you
like to see I already have a pretty long
list of scheduled stuff coming up but
you guys always give me really awesome
ideas so I'd love to see stuff that
you'd like to suggest the only thing is
if you do suggest something even if I
think it's awesome it might be like two
three months before I get to it because
I do have a lot of other stuff that I
want to do but I always appreciate your
idea so please leave them down below and
yeah with all that out of the way let's
get into the community pull requests all
right guys so here we are in github and
if we look on my portfolio CSS grid
there are four pull requests so thank
you to the three of you who've made the
full four pull requests see one of them
is really old so I just want to
apologize for taking so long to get to
this but I did want to make all the pull
requests at the end and there's actually
some conflicts in this one too that
we're going to start out and I'm gonna
start with this one
because I think there might be anyway
we'll start with this one
real shriek are real sukar I just want
to say a big thank you for putting this
in and it was a really nice and detailed
pull request so thank you so much for
that the first thing is he's removing
the outline that's affecting Mac
browsers so he took the outline off of
these he also the message text area is
not vertically resizable and horizontal
resize would break the send button and
the illini tum' I misspelled that I
think more than one person might have
noticed that but it wasn't working
because I misspelled it I am he also
added some future expandability which
was a really good idea on my list items
and we had a background color I was
using the dark blue and he just
suggested switching it to black because
I had a lower opacity on it anyway and
that makes a lot of sense because that
way if we change the background color of
the navigation itself it's also going to
change the background color or change
the hover color sort of along with it
instead of mixing it with some sort of
dark blue color and also remove padding
and nav Li a new li item will take its
own space without breaking the nav
the whole Li is still clickable so thank
you so much for that and as I said it
was nice and set up here so it's showing
me what's going on and he also had a
more updated one and the container all
won't overflow X when app is open the
nav was too wide when the viewport was
too wide max so they just said a max
width on it so the viewport wouldn't be
this like and nothing just the
whatchamacallit then I have the
navigation wouldn't be like this massive
navigation so limiting the max width of
the navigation and updated the container
all to fix this match with that max
width so I think those are all really
good things that you put in here so
again thank you for that but there are
some conflicts just because I'd updated
the files a little bit as we were going
so I'm gonna click on resolve conflicts
here if you've never seen this pretty
much it's just going to show you your
file and you have to scroll down until
you find a conflict so this is the
actual CSS file itself and there's if we
go down down down down down we
eventually get to the conflict here so
this is dealing with the nav is open nav
stuff this is the stuff that he's trying
to push in or pull in and this is the
original of what I had here it's a
little harder to read mine just because
of the way that it was outputted from
the SAS being compiled and also he has
all of them which are my collards these
things at the front that I can't think
of the name of right now they're all
prepended for you know WebKit and MS and
and I think there's an oh yeah there it
is so those are all in there just a side
note on those I don't know if we need
that many if you're using autoprefixer
depends how far back you want to be able
to support but most a lot of them don't
really need it so much we don't need as
many of those as we used to so if we
look really quickly here the one thing
I'm not sure about is here that you took
the height off and maybe it's because we
don't need it because translate is still
the same it's at 80%
translate zero translate eighty
display:none display:block translate -
70 well we have the container all here
which has I'm gonna go over to this one
first okay and the reason he added this
I have the transition at but I'm only
using javascript to add it in so he's
just adding it in here so to be able to
fix these I'm not actually going I'm
gonna have to I'm just trying to think
here which ones we should look at but we
have the container also what I'm gonna
do here is we're gonna say will keep his
so I just have to delete this and this
we're gonna keep this down at the bottom
and then I'm gonna come back up and say
mark as resolved and let's come on this
one it's effectively the exact same
thing as mine we just have the prefixes
and again we added that other thing down
at the bottom so I'm just gonna actually
keep his in this case since it's the
same but just it has the consorted
compiled version of what we just changed
there and it has the prefixes which is
no big deal so we'll mark that and
because we've done that I can commit the
merge now okay there we go
good so now I can merge the pull request
so I'm just gonna say thank thanks 10 or
let's just say thanks 10 thanks at 10
great great ideas there we go
I don't really know what to say but I'm
going to merge I'm gonna comment and I'm
gonna merge the pull request and I'm
gonna confirm the merge there we go
and that should be done so now I can go
back to my pull requests and we're down
to three
so about section correction let's go see
what this is this is by vocation who
I've been talking to on Twitter as well
so thank you we
we had some good things in here so
there's no conflicts in this one let's
go see what's actually going on so I'm
gonna go and look at files changed
there's one change and it's I wrote
image and when I should have written IMG
end that was kind of silly of me and it
sort of broke some stuff and it wasn't
working the way I thought it would work
and I couldn't figure out why and it's
because I'm stupid
pretty much so I'm super happy with that
so there's not much we need to do here
except awesome thanks I'll hit comment
and I'll merge that pull request in
confirm merge to left another one by
vocation you said I checked my there is
a conflict now what's the conflict we
didn't have one before the last time I
said your name he said I almost got it
right why is that a conflict patch three
you want to bring in that ok I don't see
why that's a conflict we had to make
some changes here but I don't know why
it's coming in as a conflict but I'm
gonna do mark it's resolved and I'm
gonna bring that in because I'm pretty
sure it actually does exactly what I
want it to be able to do so we can also
just say thanks merge confirm merge and
we have one more left anyway thank you
Gary
I'm ok so again let's just go look at
the file changes and the big change is
just here where we're changing from when
fr one of our the important thing here
is template that I just forgot to write
so that's the really big change here
it's weird now it's showing me the
update here he just did a different
spacing out of stuff and I thought mine
lined up but hey I'll go with his cuz
his looks nicely lined up here so I'm
just gonna go see if we look at the
files he's changing and it's just fixing
the grid column to grid template to
columns cuz this makes more sense and I
think I was just dumb in that I couldn't
figure out why it wasn't working now in
Gary's comment he also says
that chrome wasn't liking the one if our
one fr it's possible I don't know why it
wouldn't um it's just I think I'm done
because I forgot to put template in here
but if it is the case that it wasn't
liking it well this fixes it so we're
gonna stick with this anyway and that
just makes that stupid bug go away that
drove me absolutely insane so thank you
Gary and down here is just sort of a
lining of things up so let's go and say
thanks a ton and comment and I'm gonna
merge that in and confirm merge there's
also an issue here a missing semicolon I
don't know if that oh I missed one on
the last line of something um well that
was from a long time look how long I've
been doing this series oh my goodness
it's been over a month and I've been
doing it for longer than that but wolf
but yeah I never even noticed that
someone had put that up there so yeah if
it's the last line of something you
don't need to have a semicolon I
probably should add it back in but thank
you web dev DGM and real cigar for just
participating and and all of that okay
and since I last recorded but before
this video went live we got another port
across from for cash in here so thank
you once again for yet another poll
request I really appreciate when you
guys are getting involved with these
projects and stuff so really really cool
basically what this is saying is once we
go look let's see it turns out that if
you give the document body style
overflow I will scroll it overrides the
initial one that we had in our CSS which
is obvious because this is an inline
style and this is not an inline style so
the inline style is over writing it what
he means by this let's go check out the
project here so I have my project open
when I open my menu I turned off the
overflow thing so if I'm scrolling up
and down it's not scrolling but when I
close this if I open up one of these
this is the one I had working if I open
that up I also made the background have
no overflow and that's what got rid of
the little scroll bar and stuff so I
wouldn't have it the whole reason I did
that was so I wouldn't have a double
scroll bar so then when I do that
now if they come back to this and open
it I can scroll down on the page which
is really awkward he's suggested and I'm
gonna go with his suggestion because I
think it's the better choice just to
comment out the things we're not using
so if we go and look it's just to make
it so the the document style doesn't
change which is awesome it fixes the
problem it was a silly I was doing this
just so we wouldn't see the double
scrollbar look on 95% of websites you
have the two scroll bars anyway so I
don't think it's a big issue and I'm
gonna stick with what he said here I
think there are there is another
workaround we could just look really
quickly to see um if I look here at the
other option we could do I don't want to
update now later I want to open up my
nav and I believe no nav I want to find
my name is open so when nav is open
hidden I think if I put that as
important
so that's refreshed so let's just
refresh my page here it's not scrolling
if I bring this I keep clicking on the
right one fitting that up it's working I
only have the one scroll bar I can close
that and now there we go that works so
one solution is here where we allow the
double scrollbar which is what I'm gonna
do cuz wanting you guys suggested it but
just say you could use an important on
here I am a big fan of never using
important ever ever ever this is one of
the instances where yeah maybe you could
get away with it and I know it wouldn't
super rare and I'd even be tempted to
put a comment into why I'm saying it's
important because getting into important
battles is a dangerous dangerous thing
so if you are gonna use the important
don't they go that just fixes all my
problems really important that you only
use it in very specific cases
but yeah that's it so let's just review
change I don't need to review them I'm
just going to say that I'm merging this
and problem confirm merge and there we
go and that's all done thanks for
noticing this because I hadn't noticed
it problem with doing a video like this
is as I mentioned earlier in a series
like this that just drags on and on and
on where I'm doing like one hour a week
I get I would have the flow of the whole
thing and it I find it hard to stay on
top of the little the little issues with
something like this so there we have it
all the polar crests have been brought
in thank you so much for that guys
really really appreciate you putting the
time into that and I do think vocation
and me were chatting on Twitter and as
you said it's an awesome way to learn
and I a hundred percent agree getting
involved in projects like this can
really make it easier to learn and you
learn more because you're you're looking
more what's going on and finding bugs
and fixing bugs and and stuff like that
and also the back-and-forth talking with
somebody else about the ideas you have
and the problems you're noticing it can
really be an important milestone in your
learning so the next time I do a big one
I encourage you to get involved in it as
well and then we have a guys thank you
so much for watching I really appreciate
it I hope that you like this channel
update and seeing those pull requests
brought in if you have any questions any
comments anything like that about
whether where this thing is all headed
please leave them down below I'd gladly
like to talk about it
also don't forget you can follow me on
social media and all of that stuff and
one last big shout-out to say a huge
thank you to my patrons you guys really
make it possible to do what I'm doing
here on a regular basis like this so I
really appreciate it

curious about how you can become a
patreon there is a link down in the
description below where you can find out
a lot more about all of that stuff thank
