series on HTML and CSS for beginners my
name's Kevin and in this video I'm
really excited about it we're gonna be
looking at some CSS we're gonna be
adding colors and making changes to our
fonts and making the page look cool so
let's get started okay so CSS stands for
cascading style sheets and we're gonna
be getting into what really that means
as we go through this video a little bit
but the most important thing is the end
their style sheets it means we can style
our pages HTML is all about putting the
content on our page we're putting our
text we're putting our pictures and
we're putting them in the order we
roughly want them to appear CSS is what
we use to make it actually looked like a
website instead of something boring like
we see on the screen right now we can
change our colors we can change our
fonts and really importantly it's what
we use to create our layouts and
actually make a real layout instead of
just having one thing fall one after the
other so in this video we're really just
starting off with the taste of CSS I
just want to show you sort of what it
can do and in the next few videos we're
really gonna be trying to harness CSS
and take full advantage of it so let's
do our first little bit of something fun
my first web page I think it doesn't
look good in black and I want to change
the color of it so one thing I can do is
I can come into my h1 tag here and add a
style attribute and anything I put
inside of here is going to be CSS the
first thing I'm going to do in here is
I'm gonna take the word color and let's
make this red I'm gonna save that and
refresh and look at that it's red so
let's analyze this just a little bit I'm
zooming in here I just want to make it
nice and big as I mentioned this is the
CSS so the this right here is the
property that I want to modify I want to
modify the color property and this is
the value that I want to assign it so I
am telling it that the color property of
my h1 is red really important here is
I'm putting the little colon so I'm
saying color colon red and then I'm
putting a semicolon at the end and this
is telling it that the
rule is finished and now I can actually
come in and do another rule so I'm going
to change the size of my text font size
not Faiz saw its size let's make it 50
pixels we'll make it really big no zoom
out just a little bit so it's all on one
line there we go put my semicolon save
that and let's refresh again and you saw
it got bigger let's go and make it
really small 10 pixels save and now it's
really tiny if I didn't have this
semicolon here the whole thing would
stop working so let's take out that
refresh and you can see it goes back to
normal and the reason for that is it
doesn't understand what's going on here
without the semicolon this is looking at
it as the color is red font size 10
pixels which it just doesn't understand
font size isn't a color so I'm gonna put
that semicolon back there so this is one
property I'm taking my color property
and I'm changing it to red and I am
taking my font size and I'm assigning it
a pixel value of 10 or my font size is
10 pixels and there we go it's 10 pixels
and let's bring that back up to about 40
super let's come look at this first
paragraph and do a little bit more here
so I have my P and so I'm going to do a
style tag is equal to and let's change
the color to blue and let's change the
font size to 21 pixels and let's look at
another one font family and I'm just
gonna do a saw serif
so let's save that and refresh and you
can see it's gone to blue it's become 21
pixels and now I've added this new one
font family saw serif so if you're not
familiar with the term saw serif this is
a serif font it has these little
sarahfey things they're called serif so
I'm not really sure how else to describe
them these little flares that come off
the end of the letters saw Sarah if it's
just like solid bars there's no little
pieces that fly off the ends of things
and just by putting saw serif like this
I'm not actually picking
font I want to use I'm just going back
to a system default so normally you'd
actually say I want to use this one
specific font just like four colors in
general we wouldn't want to say
something like blue for red for example
I could do ff0000 save and it's gonna
look exactly the same
oops I don't want an S there save and
there we go
and for blue I could put number sign
zeroes your whoops
zero zero zero zero zero zero FF and
it's still blue what these are this is
called a hex hexadecimal which
references colors if I put this as FF
it's going to change colors it becomes
that and if I do FF here we won't
actually see it because it's going to
become white so my text is still there
but it's become white and there's a
whole bunch of things I could do like
dee dee dee dee dee dee they don't have
to be capitals and it becomes gray if I
do five five five it becomes dark gray
so there's this whole hexadecimal code
that we can use and the main reason is
you know who knows you know this is red
and I know that just because I've done
it so many times but if I come in here
and I put red like that
well it's red but what if I want a
different red that's you know it's too
bright it's hard you can't really
control it with a keyword like this so
if I instead come in with FF three three
zero zero I get more whoops mmm
let's do F f-550
it's becoming a bit more orange E and
let's make that like a five five two
more pinky making really subtle changes
right now but you get the idea this is
much better and if you're going where
can I figure all this out we can do a
color picker HTML into Google
and we can come right here to the
w3schools color picker and I have a nice
little color picker here that's very no
it's not perfect but it gives me a nice
idea and it gives me all the different
shades so I come and I can click on the
dark red here and then I can pick and I
can just copy and paste so let's say I
want this dark red I can copy that and
paste that here and then for my text
let's say I actually want something that
looks more like this one I can copy that
let's go back to my page here's my text
paste that in there save and there's the
color on my text and I think that looks
really nice so I'm coming through here
and I'm making a few changes but one
thing that's really important and
powerful about CSS is the whole cascade
thing and what it means is the Styles
cascade down through my HTML elements so
here I have my body and everything is
inside my body so what I could do is on
my body I could give this some style so
let's say style is equal to and I'm
gonna do a background - color and you
can probably guess what this does I'm
gonna make my background color black but
let's use the zero zero zero save that
and hit refresh and I have a nice black
color and that affects my whole page
remember the body is everything we see
on the screen so if I change the
background color of that everything I
see on my screen will get a black
background but even cooler than this is
now if I come in and I do color ffffff'
this is what I would use to change my
text color and why they didn't make it
text color I don't know I wish they had
but we just have color to change our
text color this is going to come in
cascade down through everything else so
I'm actually gonna take this off for the
moment let's just delete the color will
keep the font size and we'll take this
color off as well I'm gonna save all
that and hit refresh and all of my text
becomes white and I could come onto here
and say let's even delete we don't need
any of this
so that's my pee so my background color
is black my colors there let's say font
size is 21 pixels save that refresh and
then all my paragraphs become 21 pixels
and then I could come in and say that my
font family Emily is a saw Sara whoops
- serif save that and all of my text is
becoming saw serif text so I'm applying
it to my body and that's these styles
are cascading down from my body into all
these other things that are inside my
body you'll notice the one thing that
isn't changing colors with this color
white is my links my links are staying
like that and we're gonna take a look at
styling links in a future video now one
thing that's also really important to
know about the Cascade is you can if
you're more specific you can overwrite
what's going on so my h1 I want this to
be a different color so let's come over
here to my color picker and get a orange
color let me go with this one copy that
and h1 style I'm gonna make the color of
my h1 save and that can change and then
let's come down to this second paragraph
so I'll leave my first paragraph alone
color let's make it that same orange
oops
and I forgot my style is equal to there
we go
save that and now that's becoming orange
so what's happening is my body starts
off and it goes oh well everything here
needs to be white so my color is set to
white so everything inside of this is
gonna become white and then it comes to
here and it goes this should be white oh
wait no this needs to be orange and then
that becomes orange we close my h1 so
it's stopping that style we get to my
paragraph and it goes okay well this is
in my body and everything in my body
should be white so this is white and
then we keep going we keep going okay
another paragraph it should be wait oh
wait
this shouldn't be orange because this
has its
style that Styles ending with my
paragraph and then this last one down
here at the end keeps the white color so
that's it for this video quick
introduction to CSS show you a little
bit of what it can do and how it can
work so I really encourage you to play
around with this a little bit I'm gonna
put a link down in the description below
that gives you a whole bunch of the CSS
properties that you can play around with
and experiment with but maybe you want
to hold off until the next video for
that one cuz they were really gonna see
the power of CSS and start harnessing it
and doing some really fun things so I
really look forward to seeing you over
there in the next video but until then
make sure you leave a comment down below
if you have any questions comments just
tell me you know say hi I'd love to say
hi back and like the video if you've
enjoyed it and whatever you do don't
stop now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
