series we're gonna be looking at how to
build a portfolio website with the CSS
grid hey there if you don't already know
my name is Kevin and here at my channel
we learned how to build the web and how
to make it look good while we're at it
with a new video every single Wednesday
and now we're going to be looking at how
to build a portfolio page using CSS grid
the design for this site I worked on for
the past three videos you should see it
over here going by if you want to see
how I designed it you can go and check
out the video for that there should be a
card in there right now for that or
there is a link to it in the description
below I really think this one's give me
a lot of fun we're going to be just
doing the markup in this video so all
the HTML for it then we're going to go
section by section in subsequent videos
we're gonna build out the site using CSS
grid to do it I think it's gonna be
really cool and a lot of fun we're going
to be using a lot of the stuff that I've
already covered in my previous videos
but we're also going to maybe throw in
some new things along the way we'll see
how it works as we go on top of that I'm
also going to be doing some JavaScript
so once the whole layout is done we're
gonna come in with some JavaScript to
actually make things work properly right
so when we click on the portfolio items
I want to modal the pop-up we're gonna
have the whole modal for that there so
that's gonna using some JavaScript and
our menu is gonna be behind a little
hamburger so we're gonna click it's
gonna slide in and out so that's gonna
take some JavaScript as well so this
might be a bit of a longer series also
down below there is a link to github so
you can follow along I have the github
repo there you can follow along as I
work on this series there's actually two
links one of them is to my starting
point where it's pretty much an empty
thing but I have set it up using NPM and
gulp so you're gonna see them just gonna
type in a little gulp command and have
Auto refresh in the browser and it's
also gonna compile my sass for me so if
you want to use that you can use the
starter one or if you just want to
follow along with where I am now you can
find the repo for that as well in the
description below if you're curious
about how to use the whole gulp flow
there's an extra video for you you can
find that in the description below and
there should be a card popping up on one
of those sides right now that video is
an unlisted video so you can't just get
it and it's not part of the series
officially but if you want to follow
along with exactly how I'm working you
can do that so it doesn't need pre pro
s-- or anything like that
it's all free to use you just have to
download nodejs do a few little install
thingies and it's good to go and it
works like a charm so there is that
other video that walks you through that
if you want to be able to follow along
with those steps and with all that or
the wait let's start writing some HTML
what are we doing in this project where
we're gonna be building out this site so
let's just take a little zoom in I'm
gonna start with the mobile view first
so we're gonna be building out this this
is the desktop view of it and then this
is at the portfolio item there and here
there's some portfolio stuff over here
and we have a nav that opens and closes
sliding in and out so this video is just
going to be the markup that we're going
to be writing for this year so I'm gonna
write as much as the markups as I can
for this so what I'm actually going to
do is make this smaller and bring this
back up will shrink you all the way down
I don't need my layers on the side there
and let's just put you over here hey
there we go okay so I can start working
I'm not going to make one giant grid
item for all of this just because I
don't need to I don't think I need like
a really big grid I could have them as
auto grid but then what's I don't think
I'm gonna do it that way so I'm not
gonna have like a big container for the
whole site we're gonna just start off up
here with my portfolio section there so
I'm going to call this my hero and I do
use Emmet but I'm not going to do
anything too crazy with Emmet here so if
I do dock hero push tab tab there we go
you can see that it pumps that out so we
have my div class hero now inside of the
hero I don't have very much I just have
welcome to my portfolio and I'm actually
gonna wrap all of that in one big h1
welcome to my portfolio and we should
still welcome properly right welcome
welcome there we go
welcome to my portfolio and I'm just
going to put this stand we have an
autocomplete on welcome to my
portfolio it's one big sentence so it
makes sense for me that is just like
that that's pretty much done now here
for this one let's zoom in a bit on that
I have these empty boxes on the side and
then I have this here in the middle
these are gonna be background images I
don't really like having empty divs but
this is going to be let's call this
section welcome so we're gonna have
welcome left + welcome whoops
welcome middle + welcome right does that
make sense we have three dips one for
each of those maybe I could even put
that as an image you should I put them
directly in there we'll see in here that
we do have my text so we have an h1 now
I did have a question I forget who asked
I apologize about using H ones in
multiple places each section can have
its own heading and I personally find it
easier to use that except this might be
in h2 that's gonna be my h1 style that's
gonna be a mage to style so you're
actually in h2 yeah but this is h1 h2 I
know you're supposed to always start
each one sort of work your way down
maybe this would be better is like in h1
class h2 or something like that let's
just go with h2 making it happen and I
only want this text here copy that you
get to go in a nice paragraph paste so
right here we have my left let's just
save this we should see a few things on
there at least there we go so walking
for my portfolio making it happen and
that you know what let's put these
images actually in here so image to be
my image folder welcomes 0 1 dot jpg
these rpm G's actually I think ha
awesome
a computer screen our computer let's do
a laptop on wood table cool and I might
take these off but image' SRC whoops
image that's annoying image so this
won't be welcome can't type today
welcome
zero to dot PNG they're PNG is just
because I saved them directly out of
welcome I forgot my image folder I got
them right from Adobe XD I would have
prefered JPEGs but it they weren't heavy
files by any means um two computers and
a laptop on a table okay cool so that is
done that's here let's move down now on
to this one this one's a little bit more
complicated
alright so let me just think for a
second what we want to do is we're gonna
have it's gonna have to be in a
container because we need something to
hold it in the middle and I might do
that as a section about me should I do
that or section about me I can make a
container I'm gonna yeah let's just try
this and I'm gonna try doing it this way
and hopefully not have to use a
container I want to avoid the containers
as much as possible this is gonna be the
ability will be a grid and I'm also
might set it up we'll use an extend or
something like that with SAS so in here
I think we can just do our image so my
image is image folder Joe portfolio dot
jpg PNG let's go look yep and
picture of Joe or folio okay there's a
joke portfolio then I have this which is
my h1 so I have my h1 does it need a
class I think it should have a class
because I'm gonna about title Joe porch
folio then we can have my power h2 about
some title the designer and developer
designer and developer and then so we
have the image that's gonna be on its
own grid thing I should probably give
this a class actually class equals about
image so that's gonna be we're gonna
have a grid here so it's going to be
like one row that's split up a bit so
anyway we have the grid for that so
that's one item two items this and then
all of my text can go together so that
will get a div div of what are we gonna
call it
I guess about text that makes sense with
a couple of paragraphs PE times two and
I think it's the same thing on both
paragraphs actually so we'll just do a
paste and a paste because I'm lazy
where's my there it is great so that
that section done there we go awesome
okay so I think that is going to be
pretty good for that we have everything
we need in there let's move on to my
work so my work this is gonna be a fun
one to do with the CSS but it's going to
be super simple when it comes to when it
comes to the the markup here so we're
gonna have another section and it would
be called glory portfolio I'll just do
portfolio it might work
portfolio and I think for this one to
work we're gonna need a container inside
of it let's just zoom out on the design
for a second I want to see what my big
one look like oh I'm going I'm bleeding
on this one so whenever we got a fantasy
bleeding I mean I'm going all the way to
the edge so it's touching the sides and
I wasn't gonna do that here mmm
okay well let's worry about this one for
now and we'll see how that ends up
working it when we start coating it so
I'm going to do a container that's gonna
hold it I'm not gonna need a container
necessarily on this one just because
there's a white background so I can have
the about me be the its own container
I'd shouldn't need one on anything else
do I need one
I don't really need one there hmm okay
I'm gonna put it but maybe we want to
get rid of it if I can avoid using
containers anywhere I will but I'm gonna
put one in okay so we have section
portfolio container whoops I always do
that
undo not Plus inside one are
there we go now inside of here I'm gonna
I think I'm gonna keep this as simple as
possible so the first thing I need is
just my each one my work then we're
going to have the portfolio item but my
portfolio items also does have it whoops
not what I wanted to do has an overlay
there's my overlay I thought I did it
right next to it all the way over here
doing all the way over there I haven't
overlay that I will be putting on top so
to get this overlay to work it can't
just be a picture we need to have a bit
more involved in this so inside my
container let's just do portfolio item
one just this is gonna make my life
easier having a little comment there
when looking through the especially when
we started doing the JavaScript I think
it could be handy so let's have a
portfolio item and inside the portfolio
item we're gonna have a figure let me
just think do I need a div do I need a
div okay
portfolio items and we're gonna get rid
of the container is this gonna make
sense yes let's get rid of you
I don't need it we're going to do we're
going to do this instead we're gonna add
my portfolio item so my work is at the
top portfolio items gonna hold all of my
portfolio stuff and then we're gonna
have individual portfolio items but the
individual portfolio items will be
figures so I'm gonna do a figure with a
class of portfolio item so we have our
portfolio items and then a single
portfolio item so this actually we're
gonna do something like that right there
we go so all of my portfolio items will
be in this one div here
so my portfolio item one portfolio item
this is a featured one so let's add
feature to that and the way the featured
is going to work is you could remove it
off
any of them and it's always gonna make
that one the big first one at the top
but you could only have one I guess we
get more than we'll see how that works
but definitely it's the idea is that the
feature class can be changed to any of
them it doesn't necessarily have to be
the first one in here we're gonna have
our image I'm just trying to think
should my image have a class name on it
or not I don't think it's going to need
one so I'm gonna have my image
I honestly forget what I called these so
let's go and I just need portfolio 0 1
that makes it easy image folder
portfolio 0 1 dot jpg and I'll I'll just
put a portfolio item okay so we have my
figure then I have my image in there and
then we're gonna have a fig caption
hello big captioned doesn't want to work
misspelling it right let's try that one
more time fig caption yeah I'm it
doesn't want to work strange that's fine
we want a fig there it is figcaption
close and then so inside of our caption
will go with H 3 H 2 we have an H 1 for
my work so in H 2 and H 2 yeah h 2 is
perfect too because that's the font I'll
be using them H 2's H 2 with a class of
port folio title and then what's with
project title our project name since
that's what I used in my design
we're gonna have a P of port folio
description yeah why not portfolio
description a short description could go
right here and last but not least my
link I'll call it a portfolio
I think H ref I'm not sure where that's
gonna go yet and even this will probably
not go anywhere it's gonna trigger the
modal instead because I'm gonna have the
portfolio items come up in a modal so
maybe it's my portfolio link that's fine
and it says read more I should put like
more info I think makes more sense we'll
come back and actually put the little
SVG symbol in another time I think let's
just make sure all this is coming
together yeah the image is gonna be
mighty big that's fine cool it's all
there so that's it good so now I can
copy that 1 2 3 4 5
so I've 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 and last but
not least we need to take featured off
of all of these there we go
save and I was selecting them all by
pushing control on my keyboard if you're
on a Mac you should be able to do the
same with command you can place your
cursor at as many places as you want by
doing that and I'll just push escape to
get out of that ok cool there we go
let's just save and see there's 2 3 4 5
awesome good so what's next next is
gonna meet all the way back over this
way when is the contact yeah contact
cool ok so it's a pretty simple contact
form except I do want it to be able to
change layout a little bit along the way
as well so there's my clothes section so
we'll have a new section section class
of contact
so we'll go with our usual each one
contact me and then we need to have a
form whoops I'm worried about the action
and all of that after form form form so
I mean it is we have a name and email
and a message and I'm going to be doing
those with labels I'm a big fan of
having the label now I'm just wondering
just because I know how I'm gonna be
building this it on the desktop but I
want to keep that into mind a little bit
on the fact that these are going next to
each other and I'm gonna make this a
grid to do the layer on so I think I'll
just use classes to be able to pull it
off properly so on here if I say we'll
do a label the class name of name for
name does that make sense and this will
say name and then we'll have our input
input type text yeah type text we can't
forget that the the ID should be name on
this one cool then we'll have our label
label for email this will say mail
so I do I don't need to class on this do
I
and I'm wondering is this going to make
it harder for me I'm gonna need more
markup on this or I could do it this way
and if you put an input inside your
label whoops that also makes it work
properly
so let's save that and come back to here
the nice thing if I click on the word
name it you can see it's it's putting it
in there because it knows these are
related so if I do a label I'm just
going to a label class equals name label
email and we're knew the same thing in
put this is a mean email input and we'll
add for I wanted this to actually just
be my class of email so name email you
can see that they're working the way a
label should and this is just gonna let
me do it mean let me work with a lot
less markup because I need these to be
grouped together to be able to control
them the way that I want to be able to
control them so if I did this I could
put a div around both of them to make
like a contact group our form group and
then have my label and then have my
input but I think this will let me do
everything I want to do with a lot less
markup hopefully I'm crossing my fingers
that it makes sense
fingers crossed let's see what how we
might be coming back and revisiting this
I don't do a lot of contact forms so we
need label a little message I guess
let's go back to here yeah message and
this will just be our text area I'm
gonna control all of that I'm still
gonna give these IDs actually I think ID
is equal to email and ID is equips don't
forget to close things and this is equal
to message cool cool cool I'm not using
placeholders it is a little bit better
practice to have labels than to use
placeholders oops this should have the
message just for screen readers and
stuff like that but I'm not super big on
the accessibility scene but it's one
thing I do know um when possible even
though they don't look as good try to
use them whoops
okay that's fine perfect and last but
not least here and I actually designed
or designed I got some icons I didn't
design any icons I could have designed
them but why would I want to if I don't
have to pee Twitter social though I need
that no I'm just gonna put that as a
paragraph paragraph follow me on social
media here we will will have a div class
of social icons image image SV oops
image folder and it's will do Twitter
first Twitter SVG or use some SVG's for
this alt is Twitter so of Twitter
I forget once I did Instagram Instagram
and last but not least github and all
these should have a class class equals
social icon so I have my paragraph right
there
then I have these three they're all in a
div called social icons just I can use
that to space and maneuver things or
maybe add this little line then I have
the social icon just be able to make
sure I can control the individual ones
properly so this is sort of like how I
can control all of them together how i
can control the individual icons and
then i have my three icons and we're not
gonna see anything is there they're all
white and hit there you go you can see
that there are some icons there they do
exist but they're all white so we can't
actually see them here just to show you
style is equal to background black yeah
that works there we go so there's the my
three social icons but we're not going
to keep that because that does not look
so nice save so after that div we need
another paragraph with a style of
copyright copyright there we go I'll
just copy and paste this select all copy
paste save and we're done so just a nice
simple paragraph there now depending on
where you are in your your coding
development and everything like that not
everyone uses many classes as I do and
you can see I was trying to social icons
social icon and my P class copyright
well this one's obvious because it does
look different but even here on my
portfolio just to have portfolio item on
as much stuff as I can possibly have and
I have my portfolio title portfolio
description portfolio link it just makes
it so I can select things easier in my
CSS so I don't have to have like figure
and then figure image and then figure if
Inc captioning to or whatever it is and
it also makes it when I'm looking at my
code later on I'm going back through my
CSS it's a lot easier to
what the rules are doing my portfolio
title my portfolio description my
portfolio link those all make a lot of
sense they're they're very clear and
straightforward my about image like a
section of about me this has an about
image and about title and about subtitle
and an about text so it makes it easy to
know when you're looking at the CSS
exactly what your styling instead of
having about me image about me h1 h2 and
peas you know like you can you can
probably figure it out but just I find
having all of this makes my life a lot
easier so that's it for the markup that
actually went a lot faster than I
thought it would so that's really cool
and then we have it the mark-up is done
it's really nice and simple I think
everything should work pretty good I
might have to go back and fix up a few
little things in there but I think for
the most part it looks pretty good you
have any questions about what I've done
