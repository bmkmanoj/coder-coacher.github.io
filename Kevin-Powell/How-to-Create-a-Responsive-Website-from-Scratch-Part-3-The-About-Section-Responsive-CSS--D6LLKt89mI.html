today we're looking at the who we are
section I got on the screen right now
and the more fun thing I think will be
this the desktop version instead of the
mobile one and let's jump right into it
so I already wrote the HTML for this
back in part 1 in this video I'm
focusing on the CSS and how we're
actually going to be creating all this
and making it nice and responsive for
little screens and big screens already
so let's jump down here and put in our
home hero and let's go and look at our
HTML a little bit for this one and see
how I did this so I had a home about so
it's my About section on my home page
and in there I have my text box so I'm
going to be treating this as my main
area and we're going to sort of take
this out of the flow a little bit to get
that to be positioned up of there but
we're only going to get there once we do
the mobile view so we're just going to
make it look like that to start with so
we have our home about and home about
text box so my home about for now I
don't think I need to do anything with
we're just going to start with our home
about text box and let's pull up the
browser so we can see this happening
live so there's a few different things
we need to do right off the bat and one
problem actually before we even get to
here is to go back up to our typography
and start styling things a little bit
better so in my typography these are H
ones so my h1 needs to be a font weight
of 300 there needs to be bigger font
size of let's do a 3 R M that's too big
a 2.5 rim is that too big that looks ok
I'm happy with that I think that's all I
really need for there actually and let's
come down do I need to worry about my
spacing I'm probably going to add a
little bit oh and I did forget to put a
container
I'm going to need a container out here
and the reason I need a container out
there as if I look over here
the whole thing should be in a container
because the background is being held
this is my mean my home about will be
with this background picture and that's
being held in the middle of the screen
so all of this should be inside a
container closed section closed
container and let's just save that so
that should update it a little bit and
we're gonna have to get around that at
the mobile view actually we do okay
that's going to make it a bit more
interesting I think let's see what
happens so let's just start by me giving
our background color here background
color nice and easy one to remember 23
23 23 see and now because I put that in
a container we're sort of screwed read
mm anyway that's okay let's give some
padding it needs to be pretty big 3m
that's not too bad maybe I can just do a
margin negative margins margin zero
I know my width if I just do this I just
a width of 95 percent on my container
what am I thinking now I'm trying to
think of a way I can get rid of this
without having to screw around and have
a different container or container that
only kicks in at mobile views or I just
might take that container off actually
but let's just try with learned 10% does
that make sense and margin whoops
margin left negative five you port with
just that I'm scrolling so should that
be 105 it doesn't make sense though
whoops
yeah that's too small now put one tends
to big why is 1/10 too big
what am I think 100 gives you port with
that will solve my problem and my margin
left
I do need a negative margin left
negative but 500 K I know I'm doing
negative 5 because I was thinking I'm at
95% and I'm missing 5 but it should be
half that negative 2 point 5 f okay this
is that works so pretty much what I've
done is I've said my width of this
should actually be a hundred percent of
the viewport so it's going to take up
the whole size I can't use 100% here
because I do a hundred percent it's
going to go to 100% of its parent and
then I have to figure out okay well the
width of that is 95% so I actually need
to go bigger but 95% to get it gets
complicated so the easiest thing to do
is really just do a viewport width so
100% of the viewports width and then my
margin now that it's the full screen I
can do my margin left of negative two
and a half to pull it back over because
I know my original container had two and
a half here and two and a half there so
that's cool I'm really happy that worked
but there's one small problem I'm a
little worried about how this I need
more padding basically on the left and
the right let's set up that that green
thing and the way I'm going to do the
green thing is with an outline and
outline two pixels solid so and I can't
see it all the way around but the reason
I'm using an outline and outer border is
because outlines have this awesome
offset negative 3m awesome
so that actually looks like it's
positioned pretty well how I want it
maybe I'll do a negative two point five
actually
so outlines are just like borders except
we can offset them either outwards or
inwards and so I've offset it inwards
and it gives me the box that I'm after
I should also set my font color here
color to 0 0 FF 6 C except I only want
my header to be that color one second
the header is that color mm okay it's
okay um home about textbox will have to
have its own color of 0 0 FF 6 C and
that shouldn't just be textbox that
should be my h1 yeah I'm going to do
that and change this over to FFF yep
okay and I definitely need to increase
my padding here for the margin top there
is killing me um my H ones I want to
have a margin top top zero that looks
better there but I'm worried that it's
going to throw this off a little bit
from all the work we did here on do save
reduce save on do save whoops save redo
save it's the two things it has screwed
up now my title so my title that means
back the font weight of nine hundred and
let's just do a margin top of one M yeah
there we go that should bring it back to
exactly what we had before and then we
have the who we are that actually
doesn't look terrible except my who we
are is in the complete wrong spot
I'm definitely doing some this is going
to get a whole bunch of stuff I'm not
going to make a class for this this is
really the only I could make it class
for this but let's just stick it here
I'm going to have to do some fun things
you're so position:relative basically
what I'm looking at now is how I'm going
to get this to be on top of there
instead of inside my box so I think
there's a few things I'm going to have
to do so position:relative and I'm going
to have to do a position:absolute for
sure and then top if I do a top zero top
one M should move it down 0.5 let's put
it right in the middle
hmm it's right in the middle but it's in
0.25 it's pretty much right where I want
it
point two three that looks a little
better so point three for my top I need
to give it a background background of
the same we had before two three two
three two three and let's just give it a
little bit of padding padding zero top
and bottom one M left and right oh no ah
I didn't think of that and one looks way
too big Oh point two five that looks
better and actually it's positioned
pretty good now
what if interested zero that's actually
properly centered
that doesn't look centered though it
actually looks more centered when I do
that oh because my position:absolute it
wasn't centered anymore so that's just
by happenstance starting what if I just
was aha yeah
I don't want a width of 100% if I do a
left:0 right:0 yeah I was worried about
that hmm because now my backgrounds is
covering the whole thing
mmm-hmm so instead of that what if I do
a Translate transform translate X 50% no
if I do a left 50% and then translate X
minus 50% aha super that's a nice little
trick to Center something so I'm putting
the left at 50% the problem if you just
do left 50% like that it's putting the
exact left at 50% like this part at 50%
so this is in the middle which obviously
isn't centered and that sort of sucks so
if you use after that a transform and
then you translate it - 50% this is you
know this is moving the whole thing to
the middle of its parent whereas this is
only looking at this so it's moving at
50% negative 50 percent on its self and
it perfectly centers it happy with that
there we go okay and let's just jump
back down to our iPhone and oh no why
did that happen because of my trend late
it's running out of room
okay I'm gonna cheat just a tad where's
my font size I shouldn't know I don't
want to play with my font size cuz
that's gonna that's annoying
I didn't think of that I didn't think of
that um we will I'm gonna play with the
font size um I don't know I honestly
think is me the easiest thing and I'm
hoping a 2.0 1.8 G's 75
wait one second this is do a one for fun
1.5 yeah 1.67 why is that following on
two lines because of the padding okay so
let's go back to the big font size that
I had originally Oh too many on dues
let's just I need some padding the one I
didn't even change anything that's weird
okay um actually that is going to work
one second okay and if I make my font
size smaller 1.8 I know what this is
getting way too small now though mmm
we're gonna have to have some media
queries in here yes okay we're going to
stick with this this is already more
work than I thought it would be top
we're actually going to make that a lot
more 0.75 maybe okay so that's on the
iPhone 5
we'll go up to the 6 right away I can
get bigger but locate let's just go to
our responsive here and figure out where
we want so I'm going to say at like 400
pixels right away so at media and my min
width will be 25 Ram
home about textbox h1 font size I know
this shouldn't be my just be my h1 I'll
stay here for now and then I'll move
this up to my typography after a to R M
and I even go bigger 2.5 2.25 - it is -
Ram and - I'm actually kind of happy
with we're also going to have to do my
home about textbox h1 this has a few
things we're gonna have to change the
top value to 0.5 0.5 this 0.65 it's a
little 0.6 that's not too bad so that's
that that's looking pretty good and then
when I get about that's still I like it
I like it
actually that's I'm going to keep that
font size all the way up so that's our
mice and we're not going to get that
small so we're going up that looks good
that looks good and I'm happy with the
font size that's here actually I just
want to if I will be able to padding
will become 0 and 0.25 I'm hoping in fit
now maybe even like a point 5 if I can
get away with that spacing no I can't
so point for 0.35
oh you got to be kidding me aha okay
that it work and we'll do that one all
the way up until we get to our the the
media query been using the whole long
which is 60 yeah
and then we have my 60 and at the 60
we'll change the font size again so
let's just copy that whole thing pay
tastes at 60 we want to change a bunch
of stuff so let's just make that bigger
my font will jump up to like a three at
least maybe that's a bit too big
actually a 2.5 I'll go to that that
means the top here is going to go down
four Wow okay three and my padding can
definitely be like a point six now yeah
so that looks okay and then it jumps up
to there that's perfect
I'm super happy with that so that's
working there we go so that's working
pretty well so at the 60 this is when
things get much more interesting my text
box we need to change a lot of stuff
actually now let's just copy that whole
thing um everything here is that's
staying the same my width is going to
change my padding I think will stay the
same that will change the outline stays
the same and my margin left is going to
have to change the outline will go away
the color and position:relative that
stays the same the width will definitely
be switching around and what else the
margin will definitely be changing and
what we're in here we need my home about
and we can set our background now so my
background on the home boat what we are
so it's what
oops go back image folder and I think
it's what we are dot jpg and I can't see
it of course now uh this is going to be
like a let's just jump up like forty
percent maybe
nope I'm not big enough yeah of course
that breaks the whole thing again that's
okay we'll come back and fix that after
and my background image here isn't
working oh this is positioned absolute I
don't have a height I'm not going to
hide on it let's just let's just do some
padding of five M did I screw up my
picture URL we are oh not what we are
who we are
aha there we go and a few things that
are super important here with my
background image background size will be
in this case my background size I don't
need a background size I need a
background repeat' no-repeat and I need
a to say oh that looks actually this is
too small F we'll go with like 60% ah
that's annoying
I thought that would not be a problem
anymore let's just take that off then
okay that's fine
and did you do with text-align:left my
title should be text-align:left to do
the left zero check a technic transform
translate X of zero
oh yeah left zero we'll put it there
did I did I have to think of my padding
was four left 4m 4m
except that's and going to there let's
just go look at my Photoshop design for
a second here what did I do
I had the text 10 of course it does look
a lot nicer when it's like that mmm
okay so we have our work cut out for us
right now actually this is me guess
actually at just 3.75 oh okay
three point five three point two five ah
that looks pretty spot-on I'm actually
pretty happy with that so it goes like
boom it jumps up to there I like that
but I have a few problems one I want
more of my background so my padding
should probably be bigger I'm doing
padding I want I want padding on all the
sides padding bottom of seven that's not
no I need more the padding bottom of
like 10 oops that's why I broke and the
ten actually worked out pretty good this
is already sort of good but I need to
move it up looking at the Photoshop
design it's not it's going to sort of
stay in that spot all the time okay so
let's just drag this whole thing bigger
for a second and see what happens okay
oh my containers not centered then I not
Center my containers
I did oh I know why it's the back I have
two things here we need a maximum width
there's one problem
so let's come on my container width is
good but we need a max max max width I'm
not sure how big the max width should be
though I've been using 60 a lot but I
don't think 60s big enough let's just
try 70 that's not terrible so that needs
to move up so that's okay just close
this for now so I'm going to come down
and what I want is I want the top of
that oh my I'm on this screen and we
want the sort of the top of that box
sticking out up here so um the top width
margin left and I can take this off for
now I'm going to leave that the same
actually at the top of negative 5m hey
that's pretty good actually I think that
gives a nice idea that we're coming down
to there another thing that I'd like to
put on there actually is a drop shadow
and I'm going to make a really nice shut
shuttle very nice subtle drop shadow and
I can start that one yeah we're starting
it here I only need the drop shadow once
it's all moving into position here so
we'll do a box shadow of zero zero the
blur should be pretty big of say four M
no spread and the color will be we might
as well stick with our now I'm going to
do an RGBA
because I want to be transparent so
black and let's try 25% that's super
subtle but it's sort of what I'm after
I'm going to actually make this a bit
smaller
wait five point five is anyway too heavy
though hmm let's just do like a point
three maybe bring that back up I want to
see it for sure
can I see it yep it's really really
subtle but I like my drop shadows being
super subtle so we'll keep that like
that and I just like that sort of
sticking up weird it's grabbing the
attention more than this is actually no
I think we're okay you come down there
and then the eye drops to there and when
the eye drops to there you'll scroll
down to see what it is
now that would I know it was too small
before but now it's too big we'll do it
with the 50% that looks better huh I
think I'm going to increase the padding
on all this it looked good before but
now if we look at the original design I
have a lot more padding on it I just
realized the text was capitalized
I'm not going to capitalize it yeah
we're just going to stick like that my
letting is way too tight here too geez
we have a few things to fix still but
I'm going to increase the padding to
let's say 5m or is it already at 5 m 7m
then that means I also have to change my
offset from my outline outline offset um
what was it at it was at negative two
point five we can probably make that a
lot bigger negative 5m then we're gonna
like double that's too much that's gah
of course that screws everything else up
hmm yeah that's the offsets too much now
um three I want it three point five I
want this to sort of be 3.75 I'm really
trying to get this green you know half
this is 50% and then the other 50% there
and I'm pretty happy with that but now
we have to fix this of course
let me just move that over
doot-doot-doot okay top needs to be much
bigger and the left needs to be much
bigger and my margin bottom on this no
then it's why is this space here these
paragraphs have a margin on them and
they're screwing all of it up too I
think we'll just have I mean it's we
have to fix some stuff on our paragraphs
anyway a margin top of zero yeah that
really helped a lot and our p last of
type will be margin bottom zero super so
it just means my bottom paragraphs have
no margin so it doesn't screw around
with anything for layout purposes and
that just squares that whole thing off
really nicely actually
and my paragraphs definitely need a much
better line height whoops we're up to
1.5 yeah that looks nice
and in general for my line heights I'm
doing 1.4 to 1.5 range that looks pretty
good actually that whole thing really
came together right there I'm actually
pretty happy with that so let's just
take a look quick look so I'm here I see
the top of that which is great and then
I scroll down a bit and that comes in I
have the nice big picture and that looks
really nice and then when I come here
when it gets to right around my
container width
that won't disappear doesn't look super
awesome here I think I need more padding
on the top and bottom um yeah so I think
the small version here looks okay then
we need more padding right around here
we definitely need a little bit more
padding on the top and bottom and even I
don't think I want it getting that wide
and then it jumps to there and that's
super nice at the picture we have her
looking right at us it locks and I was
actually worried that we'd lose the left
of it but the way it's working now is
actually super sweet it so sort of
locked onto the left side of the page
until like it's big enough awesome I'm
really happy with that
so we're going to leave it just like
that and I'm really really loving like
right up to here is looking fantastic so
I'm super happy actually with this my
font size is a little bit bigger to I
think what font size did I use 22
okay so let's pump let's just do that
one last change so it would be at 60 I
could even come in here and just do a
paragraphs font size 1.2 ram line height
1.6 I think is what I said so it looks
nice it good and then we get our nice
big font size there and that looks great
I'm super happy I've sorry for the I
jumped around a lot in this video a
little bit um I hope I was clear enough
with my explanations but if I skipped
over anything or you're not sure but why
I did something or how I did something
leave a comment down below and please
let me know I'm really happy with the
end result that we got out of it so I
hope you are too and in the next video
we'll be looking at this section right
here and making that have this nice
little hover effect where we can see our
projects and I look forward to seeing
you there
