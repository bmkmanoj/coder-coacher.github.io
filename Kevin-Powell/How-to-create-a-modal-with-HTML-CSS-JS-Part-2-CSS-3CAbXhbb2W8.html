short video this one it will be longer
because we're doing the CSS and there's
a lot more that's gonna have to go into
this than we had in our last one because
we wanted to look good right so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna come in here and
do a portfolio modal so we're gonna take
the whole mortal itself and let's give
it a position position I've fixed so I'm
gonna just save that we're going to see
at least now this looks back to normal
right so I have all of that now it's
around somewhere it's right behind
everything else let's just give this as
an index index of 10 because I'm
guessing it's behind everything when I
want it to be on top hmm I'm even know
where it is but that's okay I wanted to
be to give it a top of zero bottom zero
left of zero and a right of zero there
we go now we can actually see it it
probably didn't have a width there's
something weird like that so now it's
overlapping everything I have a bit of a
problem in that I can see through the
back so let's give it a background of
white there we go and now even when I'm
scrolling we're seeing just this now one
thing I didn't think of before when I
was designing it on on here I was
designing it to be full screen but I
think since it's a modal and it's
popping up over the other content I
think that it would work better if we
did it more like this 2m and 2m there we
go so we can actually see that we're on
top of the other content no it's still
not perfect by any means but I want this
where I can see that I want to keep my
other content in the back and I could
even make that a little bit bigger maybe
but I think it's gonna work better to
really show that it's a modal by making
sure that we can see the content behind
it it makes the user experience just a
little bit better because when we click
it's gonna fade in it's going to appear
but I don't want to make it really
obvious that I have to X out it's not
actually a second page or something like
that whereas if we were fullscreen it
might look like a
second page and a nice way we can darken
the background instead of actually
having to make a div for it is just use
a box shadow I mean to 0 0 0 I don't
want to blur on it and now this is 2m
the whole way around so if I just do
like a 5m for the whatever it's called
there and yeah I'll do an RGBA of black
and like 0.5 and you can see it just
darkens everything that was behind it
and obviously I have another problem
right now because they use position
fixed it's fixed my box and my content
is overflowing at the bottom and I have
more content than what I actually see on
here so what I'm also going to do here
is add in overflow Y of scroll which
gives me its own scrollbar that I can
use now that does lead to having double
scroll bars which is kind of awkward so
we will eventually turn that off but
that's only gonna happen once we get to
the JavaScript but yeah we could turn
this scrollbar off if we want to and if
it doesn't bother you having to then
then no one's the wiser I don't think
it's problematic people I think I don't
think it's problematic but I think you
could look nicer if this didn't have a
scrollbar on it ok so I think that's
pretty well set up and just I didn't
really explain this to well this is the
blur and then yeah I always forget what
it's called but it's pretty much like
how far out so if I do this is one it's
gonna make like a 1 but this is how far
do I go until I start having a blur so
if I had 1 and then 1 it would go 1 out
and then after 1 em it would start
blurring but in this case I mean 5 is
overkill if I did two it should fill up
the whole space anyway cuz the size is 2
but you know I'm gonna go a bit bigger
just to make sure there's no weird
weirdness going on and it just darkens
everything up behind it so I don't have
to create some fake and you know an
extra div just to create create that
darkening effect and it's easy enough to
change just by changing this color I can
make it darker or lighter ok so let's
keep on going there's my modal so let's
get our header looking a little bit
better so let's come up to here and you
my portfolio header
this is the one awkward point actually
is I want my background image on my
portfolio header so I think the best way
to actually do this so I don't have to
create a whole bunch of different
classes portfolio header and then I
could do and of type and say my first
one has a background background image of
URL so it should be back one step
image portfolio is 0 1 jpg so it's
starting to come in then I can do
background size cover and background
position Center so that will bring in
that one and then what I could do here
is say that my background that I could
just give it sort of my sizing here so
let's just do padding of like um that's
not say - or actually I should have a
text-align:left padding:2px
3m no let's go bigger for m2m we could
probably bigger than that 5 okay we'll
see how this looks
oh and I don't want padding here
actually let's make this 0 I only want
the padding on the top and the bottom no
yes you'll see why in a second so that's
okay then I have my portfolio text box
with 12 a background of RGB a accent
we'll see what 75 looks like or we just
won't see it at all why not
oh not text box title box title box
there we go cool so I think for this now
what I could just do is do padding of
three M I'm just guessing these numbers
that looks not too bad my font size is
too small
we'll fix that in a second though the
color can I fix the color color is white
good so that's not too bad actually I'm
just trying to think I'm trying to think
I just don't want this to go all the way
so let's just give it a whiff of like
70% let's go look at the original design
again we're not too far off and again I
wanted to keep this font here and here
we're not too far off I think all I'm
gonna change right now is the from
project name I am going to make that
bigger now I use the same class on both
so I guess I could actually have given
them different names but portfolio I'm
just gonna Ness this title will be a
font size of like 4m what about at
smaller screens what's going to happen
responsive responsive that's you
I have side-scrolling 3.5 I still have
side-scrolling why I might know why
padding let's just make it one for a
second undo undo save I'll just do
padding left then padding you know three
three on the top 0 3 M 3 M there we go
so then as it gets bigger we're good
awesome cool that looks good I need to
add in the white line so I want the
white line there so that will be on my
portfolio title will do in and
after so won't have anything inside it
it will have a height of one pixel it
will have a margin of we need to move it
down one M zero a background of white
width of 100% is there anything else I
need save a display:block I usually like
keeping that up here display a block
good except what I'm gonna do here I'm
gonna put the padding back to three and
on this I'm gonna do Baro box-sizing
border box because I think that will
stop it from doing that weird stuff it
was doing well now it's worse than it
was before
undo save okay we're gonna keep it like
that then I was wrong
we're gonna keep it like this that means
the width here should be smaller say
like 60% that's good enough maybe 70
that's really gonna depend on like
screen size I might have to give that a
max width or do something or what if I
change my portfolio title to a
display:inline-block and just made this
100% so now we'll just match the length
of my title that makes sense the spacing
here is a little off though let's make
that space a bit smaller I like that
better
that looks good the portfolio subtitle
could probably be a bit bigger so
portfolio subtitle font size of 1.5 Ram
mm one room there we go good
good good good I'm I'm happy with that I
think that looks pretty nice it should
work well for different screen sizes now
we can go down into the content here so
we have my port folio content so in my
portfolio content again my text aligns
off text-align:left and let's give it a
width of like 95% and margin:0 auto to
center it it's a little bit small I 90
85
I like having some space on the sides my
margin is also zero Auto but I should
probably have I guess on here yeah let's
come up to my header and say there's a
margin bottom of 2m I'm just using two I
have two here then I have two here so
two there I'm just trying to stay
consistent with all my spacing no that's
not - that's a CV 5% but whatever it
looks pretty consistent so I'm happy
with it good SuperDuper that looks
pretty nice
is there anything else that I need to do
for my content I do need to set a max
width on this at one point but let's
just go down and look at the all the way
down I probably have some padding on the
bottom - right padding-bottom - yeah
that will look a little bit better down
on the bottoms cool cool cool so that's
good so what I'm going to now is take a
look at this image because this is the
one that I want to be going up to full
width and to do this that's actually
let's rearrange this so we can look at
some bigger screen sizes while we're at
it and let's get out of my inspect mode
and outta here so I want this image to
be able to go full width so I realized I
made a small mistake in the code so I'm
just jumping here to fix this I just
noticed it when I was editing so I want
to
just you know when it later on in the
video you might see a little bit of
different code for the portfolio
full-width here and it's because I tried
to get too fancy because of the overall
size of here not being a hundred percent
of my screen but basically if you have
something that's smaller than the
container so you can see here I do have
it at the full size and here I'm going
to save so we can jump back to what the
image normally look like and what I'm
gonna do now is on my width I'm just
gonna say it's a hundred viewport width
and I'm gonna save that the other thing
is it didn't actually change now and
that's because I do have a max width on
my images of a hundred percent so I'm
gonna do max width and just set it to
initial so it means it can't it can
actually overflow so now you can see
it's overflowing like that and now what
I wanted to do is actually want to pull
it back within this space here that it
doesn't really belong because it's
inside a container type of thing so to
do that the easy thing is just to do a
margin so I'm going to 0 top and bottom
and then I'm gonna use calc on the left
and right so any one do for my calc is
50% - 50 viewport width so it's gonna
let's save that actually that's us do
the 50% first and you'll see what that's
going to do so a 50% it's moving at 50%
across the screen and then we're doing
minus 50 viewport width so it's going to
push the image to the 50% point of the
image so we're lining up the side right
in the middle of the screen and then
we're gonna pull it all the way back 50
viewport width so that's gonna line it
up right to the edge of the screen where
it I originally want it now the only
problem is this is giving me some side
scrolling the original problem that I
had when I did this is I tried getting
too fancy because this box is smaller
than a hundred viewport width so my
image is actually gonna be bigger than
they need it to be but only slightly so
all I'm gonna do to fix that is let's
just come all the way up to
my where is it my portfolio model and
went you far portfolio model we already
have an overflow wife scroll and it's
gonna add an overflow X of hidden so
anything overflowing out the sides is
hidden now the only problem we have left
is that this is way too tall obviously
so we can go and fix that up here on my
portfolio width or after my my margin on
my full width we can add in height so
I'm gonna have a height of 20 VH so it's
going to adapt to the screen now
obviously this doesn't look so good we
don't want to smush our image but we can
use the awesome object fit cover object
fit has really good browser support the
only thing it doesn't work in is
Internet Explorer sadly and that
includes 11 but I've cross everything
else it does work here on my margin
let's just make that so we have some
space on the top and bottom of my image
and there we go it's a nice way to break
an image out of a container so if you
have a width set on something it's a
nice way you can expand outside of that
width okay I was in at my pool left and
my pole right so for these are going to
an media query at media min width of say
like 40 Ram 40 M and my portfolio pull
right oh I think I did my left one first
pull left will have a width of how big
did I make it in my design instead about
50% a little bit bigger than 50% I'll go
with like 65% width of 65% and it's a
pull left so it will be float:left
awesome exactly what I was after
and then I'm margin yep margin left
of to em stay consistent except that
should be on the right awesome that
looks nice so we get to there and then I
have the exact same thing caught whoops
not cut we want to copy paste and this
will be a pull right except this one
will be a float right and a margin left
cool good now if I had more text it
would work but it works and then if I
get down to a small enough screen size
I'll have to check where's it going to
work at I should have it fix that at the
same point where my font size is change
except I had a mixin for this so I
should be using my mixin instead
@include media query and that should
make it all change at the same sizes
there we go when my font size is change
it also will change and it works out
pretty well good I'm just gonna add a
very small margin on the bottom it's
okay I think it's a good cool good I'm
happy with how that looks actually oh
yeah that should stay for width all the
time good good good
cool so I'm happy with how the modal
looks oh I forgot one thing I forgot my
close button so let's throw the close
button in there really fast
we're gonna steal the same close button
we used already so let's go and get that
that's on my index all the way here we
go close icon so let's just close steal
that copy that and move down into my
portfolio stuff here and I'm gonna put
that right with my modal yeah so right
here fix the spacing on this a little
bit and save that this can come back a
little save that so we should have oh I
just put the SVG we should have that
inside a button
and I'm putting it in a button because
it is a JavaScript thing save so that we
should it's there but it's not working
obviously why not I also don't want this
to be clothes icon I think this one's
gonna be well let's go a little close
and we go so we can actually see it and
we can spell all that I'm gonna bring
this up higher because it's I'm just
going any order that it is in my mark in
my markup so let's make that look a
little nicer because it looks kind of
weird right now so let's do my modal
clothes background:transparent Danna
okay close portfolio those model close
hmm why is that no one I work guys oh
did I do something silly there no I'm
okay little close oh I knew this I want
that on my button itself class equals
modal close not on the SVG save there we
go it's gone too transparent good and
then left a position:absolute left 2m
top 2m something like that that's not
horrible border:0 order zero except now
when I scroll it disappears which is
kind of awkward I this is how my
original design had it but I don't like
it because when I scroll it disappears
that means I have to scroll back up to
turn it off and that
just awkward right yeah it is just
awkward so instead of that maybe what we
could do is position fixed um background
white okay that's getting better
one and one
so it's hanging off the side that might
look a little better I give it a width
here to write with let's give it a width
and a height just so it's a square make
it a circle border radius because I
think it'll look nicer fifty percent and
now it's just not positioned properly at
all because of the way my SVG is first
let's give it a box shadow box shadow
zero zero
I don't know five pixels RGB a black and
if you're using if you're not using SAS
you can't just write black for RGB a
that's a SAS thing how can I bring that
to be more centered because I don't want
to mess with miss BG code because I'm
terrible with SVG can I just give it
some padding let's move it down first
two pixels zero Oh cuz I had some
padding on the side look at that I just
need to be a bit bigger than that I'm
using pixels that's okay five zero zero
four it's a magic number but it works
there we go
and last but not least cursor is a
pointer there we go
also I'm should I give it a hover I
don't think it needs however I think
that's pretty obvious and at least now
it comes with us so it's a modal when I
click that it will close and when I'm
not clicked on it it will open and
that's it for the CSS awesome I think
that looks awesome I hope you like what
that looks like and
join me in the next video where we're
gonna look at the JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
