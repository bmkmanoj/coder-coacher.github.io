we're gonna be looking at advanced CSS
selectors my name is Kevin in here my
channel we learned how to make the web
and how to make it look good while we're
at it and looking at this where we're
gonna be looking at advanced CSS
selectors we're gonna be looking at a
whole bunch of them so these are ones
you should hopefully know already before
you you get into this but then after
that we're gonna be looking at a
universal selector which you might
already be familiar with the direct
children selector an adjacent sibling
selector and the general sibling
selector as well as a whole bunch of
attribute selectors these can all be
used in fun and creative ways that just
make your CSS work a little bit better
and makes you have to sometimes write a
little bit less code so here we are on
code bit and as like usual you can come
into code pen add the link for this is
down below and you can play around with
this or follow along or just look at my
code the finished version of it is what
is own code pen so in my pen here at the
top I do have just some general styling
things I am but we're gonna scroll down
down down down and we get to here where
I'm gonna be talking with the universal
selector which is my this one here which
is the star symbol just like we see
right here this selects everything every
single thing except for before and after
so just as an example here if we look
here I have the ones you know and I have
Universal so if I come on to here and I
do my little universal selector and I
say background is red everything changes
to red now there's a few exceptions to
this and that's a specificity issues
going on where I was more specific on
how I styled stuff but pretty much
everything is getting red background so
my paragraphs are getting red
backgrounds my titles are getting
backgrounds my header has a red
background my list has one etc etc etc
you can see how that works in this case
I only want to be targeting this so I
could say that everything inside of that
so this is dot universe old and
everything inside my Universal is gonna
get the red background now normally
you're not doing it for things like
background a common place you might be
using something like this is to usually
it's when you're resetting things on
your site
so if you're doing a general reset it
might be your very first thing and I've
actually done that on this already so if
we come and look right at the top I
wanted to change on this entire thing my
box sizing to border-box
and my margin top to zero all the text
elements always have some margin top and
margin bottom on them being someone who
comes from a design background I find
the margin top is it's a it's redundant
because we have collapsing margins and B
it's annoying because it just gets in
that way so I always like resetting
margin top to zero on absolutely
everything some people just like doing a
general reset of margin:0 padding:0 and
everything as well I am in the Box
sizing a border box just makes life
easier with padding I do this on every
project I do but you'll also notice I
had to do here a before and after if
you're are using before and after you
have to do the star before and the star
after if you also want to select those
so it's a universal selector won't
select your before in the after so you
have to do those you know just add it
all together like that and then you've
selected pretty much everything that you
can possibly select so the universal
selector it's pretty much as good for
just general resets and selecting
everything to start yourself off on a
calming ground not it's not something
you use a lot in a single website but it
is something you'll often use it the
beginning when you start styling cool so
next is the direct children selector and
now the direct children selector is an
interesting one because there's the
child selector and the direct child
selector so you're probably already used
to writing some CSS so in here we can
just scroll down direct children so my
class name so I'm just going to be
making modifications to here so if I
have my direct children and I do direct
children Space P and they say the color
is red it changes all of the paragraphs
to red and this one's not changing
because if we look here that's a code
block it's not a paragraph but all three
of these paragraphs are getting changed
over
to read now if I change this from direct
children P to direct children like this
it's no longer selecting this one it's
selecting this paragraph and it's
selecting this paragraph so the
difference is if we look at my section
here I have my direct children and then
I have a paragraph paragraph and then
this isn't another div so if it's a
direct children this isn't a direct
child of this section this is a
grandchild of this section because we
have this div here so what this is doing
is it's only selecting things that are
direct children but not that are the
grandchildren and grand grandchildren
and all of that stuff so if I take off
that it's going to select that this
selects all paragraphs that are inside
of here and this one selects all
paragraphs that are the direct
descendant or the direct child of this
section and not things that are further
along and this can be really useful
every now and then it might not be super
useful all the time but if you're
styling a menu that has a lot of
dropdowns sometimes you might find
yourself using this it's something you
might also see if you're using something
like bootstrap they do use this on
occasion especially for their
navigations is where you see it the most
often so it can be a useful way just to
reduce the amount of markup because you
want to avoid selecting things that are
deeper into the system and deeper into
your component now these too often are
confused and I won't lie I was a little
bit confused by how these work as well
so they have the adjacent sibling and
the general sibling we'll start first
with the adjacent sibling and then we'll
move on to the general which is why
they're in this order obviously so in
here I just have a bunch of boxes that's
the boxes we can see right here so if I
do a J jacent sibling and whoops I want
to do adjacent sibling and then dot box
so that would select all my boxes right
so on this if I said that the background
is red the background of them all will
change to red now the way the adjacent
sibling works is it's looking for things
that
jacent to each other so here I'm
selecting all my boxes that are in
adjacent sibling so all my boxes that
are inside of this section if I come on
this and I do plus dot box it's
selecting them all except the first one
because when it's talking about adjacent
sibling it's looking at the sibling
that's coming before it so before this
one there's nothing so it's not
selecting this this one so its own box
is there an adjacent sibling of box yes
there is so this one changes to red then
we look at this one oh there is a box
here this changes to red and this one oh
there's a box here in this changes to
red now how we can see this really
working in action is I'm gonna come in
here and between these two boxes matter
link a href equals it doesn't have to
actually go anywhere and say not box
close a so if we see here we have box
box not a box box and box and you notice
this one is change back to gray so
what's happening is it's going we're
start from the side we go well what's
before me there's nothing I'm gonna stay
in my default style you oh look there's
a box and before it there's another box
so we're getting changed over to red
then we'll ignore this one for now we're
gonna go on this one it's gonna go
what's before me oh it's not a box
before me so I'm gonna stay on my
default style and if I look at this one
then I go before it and oh look there's
a box here I'm gonna change now the
reason I'm putting in this not a box
thing is because this is the difference
between adjacent sibling and the general
sibling so my general sibling here is
instead of this so this would be general
so those three change now if I change
this over to the Talib Tildy
it looks exactly the same but where it
does change is if I put my not a box in
here we can see that these two still
stay red so the difference between the
adjacent sibling and my general sibling
is that the adjacent sibling the one
before it has to be that selector on the
Oh sibling anything before it has to be
that selector so I could have a hundred
nada boxes as long as something before
it was that selector it's going to count
so this one here with the plus symbol
can be really useful if you want to set
margins on things because say I go on my
box plus box I can say margin left of
100 pixels and I know it's own it's not
gonna place it on the first one here
it's only gonna place it on ones that
are next to each other so the second and
if there was five it would place it on
all five of them but if something gets
in the way I won't have that margin on
it whereas if I did the same thing on
this margin left 100 pixels all of them
are gonna get it so it leaves the space
here now sometimes you're gonna want
something like this and other times you
might want something like this alright
and now for my attribute selectors so
the attribute selectors for this what
I've done is I've set up a bunch of
links and what I've done is I've given
them a whole bunch of different
attributes so we have a tres we have a
class on all of them and one of them
also has a target blank on there so it
would open up in a new tab
so with the attribute selectors we can
select things based on their attributes
and the most basic attribute selector is
just putting the square brackets and all
the attribute selectors are with the
square brackets and I can write the
attribute that I want to target or I
want to select and I've said target
because I'm going to start with the
target attribute so my one that would be
opening in an empty page let's give it a
color of dark blue and there we go you
can see this one here has changed over
to dark blue now you can also do it by
having the tag first so my link that has
an attribute of target you will often
see these used for inputs so when you
have inputs for a form they have lots of
inputs so it's always the same tag but
they have different attributes you have
a text a password and email all the
different things so if you need to style
them differently you don't have to give
them classes you can select them via
other attributes which is handy so here
I'm changing that one to dark blue now I
could all you know same idea a
Hof so all of my links that have an href
which will be all of them so they're all
gonna change over to red there we go now
one thing that's a little bit different
that we can do so this is going to
select anything that has a target I can
also this one will select anything that
as an href but I can be more specific
and I can say if the href is equal to
something so if my href is equal to
let's say about dot HTML now it's only
selecting that one right here for my
about page because that one where is it
right here so it's the href is equal to
exactly about HTML if I just put a boat
here it's not gonna work so it's not
working anymore
if you use the equal sign just like this
you have to put exactly the attribute it
has to be whatever is inside the
quotation marks and it has to be exactly
the same but there's other options as
well you can be we can do it in other
ways too so that are you know a little
bit less specific so I can do it like
this which is going to be let's go with
something different let's try a class
this time and I'm gonna do class and I'm
going to do the I don't even know what
that's called actually the straight line
down thing and another someone knows
leave a comment and let me know I should
know what that's called
um and let's give this one a color
purple and you can see my yet another
link has been selected even though I'm
not putting the whole thing I'm not
saying the whole another link I'm just
putting the beginning part there another
or I could come in here and write link
and all of them that start with link
have now been selected so all of them
have a starting with link except this
one's not being selected anymore ha
that's weird right so what this is doing
is its selecting anything that starts
with what I have it's really meant to
starting with the specific value so in
this case it's starting with link so all
of them that start with link are
changing to purple or if I change it to
another
that's switching over now one thing it's
important to know here is
this is I've been separated let's say
that it was camelcase instead we'll see
that it's no longer working so it's
looking for the string up until there's
something like a - to separate stuff so
if it's there's no breaks in the string
of characters it's not going to work
it's not looking for apart oops
it's not looking for a part of the text
it's looking for kind of like a whole
word right okay so let's move on to the
next one so the next one that we're
going to look at is a and let's go back
to href for this one and we're gonna use
the caret symbol equals and let's just
do HTTP and let's do color is orange and
now if you'll notice it's really similar
to this one except in this case it's
taking all the HTTP and all the HTTP so
if I switch this over to HTTPS instead
it's only going to take the first two
because those first two are HTTPS and
this one is an HTTP and just to show you
let's just comment this one out for a
second and let's switch this over to an
href and I'll make this HTTP and you'll
see it's not working anywhere because
all of these they're not stopping at the
HTTP it's really looking for a -
separated stuff to change things over to
purple so this isn't picking up anything
I can put HTTP it's still not picking up
anything this is really looking for sort
of separate separated words out when
you're using this symbol whereas the
caret is a lot more forgiving so it's
really similar but it's just a lot more
forgiving so if we keep going we have
another one which is the href and this
is going to be a star is equal to and
let's try Google and let's make the
color black
and actually it's gonna change all of
them we might as well make this just
HTTP like that so at least one of them
can stay orange so here it's gonna take
anything that has Google in there it's
not looking at the beginning it's not
looking at the end it's just looking for
the word Google I could change that for
really anything so even these are all
linked one I could just take I can put
at Ko and I could say this is the class
and it's still going to select it even
though that's dead in the middle it
doesn't care where it is it's sort of
like a universal selector look for this
anywhere in a class on a link and it's
gonna get it so let's just go back to
what we had before
so that one can be really really handy
and then when it's sort of the opposite
of this one so this is looking for the
beginning of words we can have another
one it's going to be looking at the end
and not of words of attributes so href
is dollar sign equal to and let's try a
dot CA this time and color is or go to
blue and so my Google Canada link will
change so this one is looking for the
ends of things so if I tried a say dot
HTML it will choose the one that has the
dot HTML on it it can choose anything at
the end of the attribute so whatever it
is that you might want to be doing and
you might be wondering what are some
practical uses for this and I already
mentioned that you could use this on
forms most definitely you could also do
some interesting things we looked at
here how we could get our you know
target or we could even have this as a
target is equal to blank so you're
selecting your ones that are opening up
on a separate page and instead of
changing the color on it you know you
could have that and then maybe you're
gonna do something where you're looking
at the after and you come on that after
and you want to do content and I don't
know say you did external link and now
you can see socialize automatically gets
external link now you really wanted to
take external link
probably not but I'm just saying you
could add in extra content after
something or maybe you have a little
icon that you want to use so on my
content I could actually put a URL and I
don't have one cuz I'm on code pen but I
could use something like an image just
for now on splash it I don't know let's
do a small one 30 by 30 pixels and we're
gonna then my little image will show up
so anytime I had an external link I'd be
getting my image show up or you could
definitely do that for PDF files as well
anytime there's a PDF you could have a
little icon showing up it's just linking
to something you have a little PDF icon
and that could be showing up well maybe
you don't want it glued right on there
let's just make this a
display:inline-block let's make it a
little smaller because it is a little
bit big 20 by 20 and we could do margin
left of say 5 pixels just to move it off
a little bit and then maybe a margin
right of 25 pixels to give you a little
you know maybe that's too big but you
get the idea you could bring in icons
after links you could bring in icons
pretty much anywhere you want them to
but I think this is kind of cool that on
external links you could have an icon
it's like an arrow pointing out that's
showing you you're going somewhere else
PDF files you could have a little thing
or if it's anything that would be
downloaded you could have it bring in an
icon just sort of indicating that it
might be a download or something like
that and that's it for the attribute
selector and that's it for this video I
