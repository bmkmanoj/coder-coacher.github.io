hi guys so I hope you're all doing
really well
I wanted to make a Q&amp;amp;A video as I had
mentioned before so the purpose of this
is to talk about some concepts more than
other things and it's why I'm not
sitting in front of a computer because
it's something more than you know to
talk about and so I thought I'd go for a
little walk and it would give me time to
think about my answer I won't be putting
at one of these types of videos every
week maybe once a month but it will
depend also on how often these types of
questions are coming in but I do want it
to be a semi-regular feature on my
channel and what was the other thing I
wanted to say about that
they won't interrupt the regular flow
they're going to be released during the
week but not on Wednesdays you still get
your your regular Wednesday video which
I know I think you guys are enjoying so
the question comes from Joseph Alvarez
which was how or what do I think of
bootstrap and when should we or should
we not use it and that's an awesome
question and it's an awesome question
for a few reasons
and it's why in the comment I said that
it was it could have a really long
answer and I give him a bit of a short
answer but the more I thought of it the
more I wanted to give a better answer
and I find what you know a awesome
question like that I'd like to be able
to give a thought-out answer but not
only that he'd be able to see I think it
would benefit more than than just the
one or two people who might read that
comment so yeah I thought this would be
a fun format to do for these longer
types of questions that do come up so
what do I think of bootstrap first off I
think it's amazing I love bootstrap it's
a really really cool system it's awesome
really well built so that's you know
it's a fantastic fantastic thing that
some people have made and it's
incredible really but it's also really
really overused and massively overused
and that's a problem
so the other part of Joseph's question
that was really good was that it was
when should you or should you not use it
and that's something that you should
definitely always be wondering about you
know all the time pretty much when
you're doing these types of projects
because even if it's jQuery or if it's
now react is really sort of the in thing
and I was reading an article recently on
CSS tricks but react and just how it's
because it's trendy people are just
using it they're not thinking about why
they want to use it so I think it's
important that you think about what you
want to be doing and why you're actually
using different things no matter what
they are are you just needing a grid
system then you shouldn't be using
bootstrap man there's other frameworks
out there that are just literally just a
grid you can look up skeleton or I'll
put the link to that in the description
down below which is just a bare-bones
framework it's just a grid system I
remember correctly and there's others
that are sort of a middle ground they're
a little bit more robust they have some
buttons they might have a navigation but
they don't have all they don't have the
JavaScript libraries and they don't have
you know the tons and tons of stuff that
bootstrap does have when you are going
to be making your own website it's
something you really need to be thinking
about you need to ask yourself do I need
it am I going to be using a lot of the
features that bootstrap is giving me
because bootstrap gives you tons of
stuff right but if you are going to use
it make sure you actually read the
documentation and I know that sounds
incredibly boring reading documentation
you know it's kind of dry but if you
were going to use bootstrap or any other
one there's foundation which is another
popular framework you should understand
what you're doing with it it's one thing
just to take something because it's
popular learn the basics of it and use
it it's another thing to really
understand how it's working because then
you're actually going to use it properly
and that's the most important thing too
many people don't use bootstrap properly
you know use it the way it's intended to
be used with all the bells and whistles
that it does have so you're not doing
more work than you have to be doing the
other advantage with that I know for me
when I learned how bootstrap really
worked and I finally got into the
documentation and took the time to
understand really how they were doing
things it made me a better coder for
sure I wasn't very good until I started
getting into bootstrap
and that sort of showed me a lot of the
things that people who know what they're
doing do the people who made bootstrap
are super-smart these are intelligent
people they know what they're doing
they've been doing this for a long time
they're forward-thinking and it's a lot
of best practice that's included in
there so you know it's something to
think about and when you look through it
and it might give you ideas on how you
can improve your own code I improved my
code so much so even when I'm not using
bootstrap I'm using some of the things
that they use in their code and for me
that it honestly improved my code a lot
so I strongly encourage not just using
it but thinking about how you're using
it seeing how they actually do things
and you know doing it I think it's going
to make you a better coder overall we've
got a helicopter coming by by the sounds
of it
yeah so not only will it be a great tool
for you to use and to make you know that
will help work your workflow and help
you work faster because you're using all
these pre-built things but I really do
think that if you study it properly you
will become a better developer it's one
thing to practice but not an I don't
think enough of us study and you guys
are you're here you're watching my
channel you're listening to this that
means you're interested in becoming
better developers so another part of
that can be studying and seeing you know
that studying what other people are
doing not just through video but through
things that exist out there today like
bootstrap like foundation yeah thanks
again for the question Joseph geez now
I'm being blinded by the Sun first the
helicopter and other Suns come out from
the clouds one thing I'd love for you
guys to do it down in the comments below
is if you could tell me what you think a
bootstrap how you use bootstrap if you
use bootstrap I'd love that this
conversation could continue down below
in the comments and if you have any
general other questions that you think
might be good for this type of thing -
by all means leave them down below in
the comments one last comment about
bootstrap of course a bootstrap I will
be doing a video series on bootstrap
shortly ish I know a lot of you been
asking about it so I have started
working on it I'm just not sure about
the best way to approach it and exactly
how I'm going to do it but if you have
any ideas for a type of site you'd like
to see designed with bootstrap leave it
down below because I'm thinking about
doing it as a design followed by the
code so I'll show you how I'm designing
it followed by how I'm coding it but I
just don't know what type of site to
design so if you have any ideas or input
on that also leave it in the comments
below and that would be awesome
so that is it thank you so much for
watching and until next time take it
easy guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
