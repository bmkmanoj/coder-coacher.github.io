at building out the navigation and the
hero area for our website using
bootstrap for welcome back to this
series where we're building our website
using bootstrap 4 if you've missed the
other videos in this series I strongly
recommend you start from the very
beginning in this video we are going to
be building out the the navigation and
the hero area I'm also going to be
looking at doing the typography couple
videos ago we did our variables and I
completely forgot to do the typography
so I'm going to do that then we finally
start getting into some regular CSS or s
CSS so I'll quickly set up to some basic
type styles and then just jump right
into it wait so we're doing our
navigation the hero area get in the
background image looking good and all of
that fun jazz so yeah let's just jump
right into it so I've already got my
type kit set up here these are the two
fonts that I'm using on the site I'm
using the book the regular and the bold
throughout my design as well as banjee
here is just there's not any choices
just the regular so if you've never used
type kit you can use it for free but
you're a little bit limited in what you
can use I do know Banshee is available
though I'm going to jump up here and
just click on the embed code and it
gives me a little bit of JavaScript so
I'm going to copy that
and this they do say make sure it goes
in the head the idea here is just you
know you want your fonts loading as soon
as possible it can slow things down it's
not a super small file size or anything
but we're going do that so we'll start
by coming up in here in my head we'll
put it right before my stylesheet so
we'll put a comment in just a be
consistent so I'm going to come here and
say what I'm going to call it fonts and
we'll paste that in there so just very
nice and simple and we'll leave that
right there I'll save that and now the
other thing I want to do is set up my
fonts as variables so I'm going to come
over to my S CSS here and I'm actually
going to
I have my vendor here where I have my
custom which is modifying how bootstrap
works so we're also going to want to set
up the rest of our s CSS properly and a
bit how I normally set it up because
right now if we look at the main all I'm
doing is importing bootstrap which is
fine but I want to import my own now I
could have done this a little bit
differently where the custom wasn't
necessarily in here but this custom is
being imported by bootstrap but I could
come and actually set up some variables
in here since I have these but I want to
leave this vendor folder to just be the
bootstrap stuff and I don't actually
want anything else in here I just want
to have bootstrap so because of that
what I'm going to do is I'm actually
going to open up here let's go to my s
CSS so in here we have my vendor so what
I'm going to do in here is I'm going to
come and make in abstracts folder I'm
also going to make a base folder and
we're going to make all of them right
now we have components layout I I don't
really have a pages one but we're only
doing one page so I don't need that and
we already have our vendor which has our
bootstrap in there so now over here I
can make a new file let's save this file
in abstracts and it will be called
variables s CSS awesome and now what I'm
going to do before anything else is just
make sure I'm importing this now I'm
actually going to import no I'm not we
can import our variables right in the
top in general the abstracts folder is
things that don't we're not in generally
the abstracts folder has nothing that
actually outputs CSS it's things like
our mix-ins our variables if you have
any functions your functions would also
go in there so what I'm going to do is
just do my add import and this one is
abstract abstracts and very bulls so
I'll save that so it should be working
and being
move this down and I just want to create
a couple of variables here for my fonts
right now so we'll just call this fonts
and I'm going to do a nice big now I'm
just going to call it serif no it's not
really a serif the way we'll do saw saws
for my saw serif and that one let's go
back over to type kit here just to get
the proper name of it um I know it's
this one they give us a little thing
here a font family is that so
drew drew comma saw serif and I'm going
to call it um hmm it's not really a
serif font right it's more of a
decorative font um me call it header fun
header header font and that one again I
don't remember the name at all it's been
chi I guess um so let's X over there
select Benjy and Benjy STD see how I got
that wrong so it's good thing I'm
checking and I'll do that I guess is
cursive even though that's not at all
really what it is but that I have to do
so my saw serif is there we go so I
think that's I want to get my font
weights too right and so I'm going to
have light which G's normally it's if
I'm using a Google font this would be
nice and easy that's okay I should have
checked this before light book a book is
300 and see they have book light and
then thin but I used book his book looks
really light so it ends up being normal
and bold this so it's the normal ones
that I'm used to using so light is 300
normal is 400 and bold is 500 and you
know what I'm actually going to do
something here I'm going to do
decorative and this sort of is more of a
decorative font and then my header font
will just happen to be a decorative I
like doing something like that a little
bit more just because I don't like
actually using header City and I know I
don't have any examples of this but
let's say that lead guitar here was
supposed to be using a deck that banjee
style or the banjee font I don't want to
call that it's a paragraph text and it's
a little paragraph text I don't want to
be calling a header font that I'm using
so I'm just going to call it decorative
so anytime I need to use it but I can
also have my header font and this way
also if I ever need to change all my
headers in one shot but not screw
everything up in my site this could also
be changed it just gives me a little bit
more openness you don't need to do
something like that on a small project
like this it's probably overkill but on
larger projects this could tend to be
useful and I'm going to save that so I
think that's all we need to do in our
variables for now so I think that's all
we need right now what I'm going to do
now is jump right into components so
let's make a new file I can close my
variables I like keeping my variables
open because I usually forget what I
want to do actually and let's save
inside of components and we want a
navigation SCSS go back to my main and
this I definitely want to bring in
whoops I forgot my I might have screwed
some stuff up actually yeah if you're
compiling your sass through the command
line and doing some other you know this
won't happen but pre pros if it's not
being imported into the main and when
you save a file will actually export it
even if it's using the underscore I wish
I wouldn't do this but I'm going to have
to delete that now you've probably seen
me do this before
now that my Mane is saved properly
because I didn't forget my semicolon at
the end it and it knows it's importing
the variables into mein that problem
won't happen and this is really just a I
don't know if code kit does that but I
do know that pre prose does so there's
my vendor so I don't really need to say
bring in bootstrap right I can just do
that at import components slash
navigation navigation save okay so in my
navigation what do I want to do let's
just actually split down
let's this go look really fast here
hopefully my fonts actually ended up
working in a second where's my brand
it's okay so we're just going to go with
a nav bar brand font family is my see
this is a good place where I can use
decorative and yeah awesome it's working
cool good so that's a nice little test
to to make sure was working my color is
brand primary or not so this is one of
those annoying things with bootstrap
that drives me a little bit bad II and
with four they've improved it a million
times because now I actually at least
have like my nav links so I can change
colors a bit easier but this navbar
brand isn't working because they
actually want it nested inside of nav
bar invar in verse and there we go now
the color has updated so that's kind of
annoying and next
let's go and change my font size here -
I don't know what I need to be honest
and actually I'm going to leave my font
size here everything's working so let's
save that my navigation is good it's you
know we're not done yet but we have some
stuff done I need to make my base file
here for just my general settings um and
some typography settings so let's do
that so I'm going to make a new file
save in my CSS base and we're going to
call this one underscore typography dot
s CSS I probably should've done this
before but c'est la vie go to main drew
base we'll come in here
so at import base slash typography the
way I generally work it's going to be
abstracts because you need these for
everything then my vendor is going to
come in and then my base and then my
components and then my layout and then
of other stuff if I needed it and the
vendor is including like normalized and
other stuff with bootstrap now includes
all of that so I don't have to bring all
that in so it just goes sort of in a
logical order so let's save that in my
typography I'm going to do my body
because I like having a lot of stuff on
here right and most of it is type
related such as my font family is my
sauce then I call it sauce variables I
thought I did I did
so why does that not want to work I'm
getting a undefined variable why am I
getting an undefined variable but my
navigation is working fine that's there
if I go look at my variables saw's is
right there I spelt it the same let's go
check here now I'm doing it the right
order my variables are coming in first
hmm let's go open up repros here for a
second
where is proposed log undefined variable
size but saws is I forgot my semicolon
again guys I've been writing a lot of
regular sass the original South the
old-school sass where I didn't need
semicolons so there we go
it worked my fonts just updated look at
that okay back to typography font family
is size font size my font size was
twenty one or twenty four twenty one or
twenty four I think I use 20 for a lot
so what's twenty four is like 1.5 REMS I
guess does that make sense
that looks a little bit too big this is
my lead hmm
that looks better I like that better
okay so the font size is fine and my
font weight is going to be light that
looks better I'm going to probably have
to modify this this is lead yeah okay
well we'll get there in a second we want
to deal with my navigation first so we
can go back into my navigation now just
because I want to make sure my fonts are
working in my navigation let's go look
at my design file here so these are pure
white and a pure white they're actually
I like that with I like this better but
I want them to be all caps the font size
is a little bit smaller and obviously
the spacing is quite a bit bigger and
this needs to be a lot bigger let's see
what font size this actually is well
51.7 okay let's just say it's 50 so um
here we'll do font size font size of 50
50 50 what's that
16 32 so I got 3.5 RAM now one thing you
might have noticed there is this got
bigger that's too big that's try three
the old navbar brand was one of the most
frustrating things for me in bootstrap 3
because it set the height of everything
it locked it was max it set the height
to 50 and then you had to overwrite the
height and it was really knowing because
I'm using the Flex box version let's
just make this 6 for fun to make it a
really big logo look at that it's lined
up in the center automatically ah isn't
that beautiful guys so beautiful I love
it I love it I love it I love it awesome
um so that's good now we can jump into
my links so those I have lots of school
look here we have nav items so my nav
items I want to space out um so nav item
let's see if this works margin left
of like 2m yeah that looks pretty good
actually
mitem scan also be a text transform of
uppercase sweet and my font size is
something like 0.8 remm well it's way
too small not REMS actually it's close
to 1 Ram it would be about 16 1.2 there
we go
I'm happy with that that looks pretty
good sweet good I'm really happy with
that actually that looks I'm pretty much
done there's the navigation done so we
can actually close you that's nice when
we can close something I love when we
can close something okay
so let's jump into this next section
which is going to be more interesting so
let's make a new file so I'm going to
save my new file and this is where does
it go under layout because it's this is
actually pretty specific to the home
page this should prolly
technically speaking this is a four-page
site so I actually think that this
should go in the pages one you know I'm
going to this is theoretically a real
layout so I would have pages here and
this would be my home F CSS and each one
of these would probably have some unique
Styles so in my home dot s CSS I have my
hero and before I save anything let's
import it base components I bring this
in right here import pages know I'm
doing pages I took a help right here
pages slash home I was going to put it
here but I'm not going to put it here
pages for me come after my components um
yeah and normally I wouldn't be double
spacing everything but it's all just
separate folders right now if it's in
the same folder I keep my spacing normal
yeah okay so Paige's home don't forget
the semicolon save and let's get this
done so Hiro has first a
background-image:url image slash home
hero hero hero BG JPEG awesome we're
going to give this some padding did I
make that a fix top I did I'm not like
doing it I mean I'm in typography but
padding top magic number time guys I'm
just trying to get the height of my nav
bar height 80 plus 8/8 like 96 and the
reason I'm getting that is because it's
a fixed top you've seen 96 pixels look I
don't like magic numbers but 96 pixels
just to slide it written down properly
now if ever you need to use a magic
number the height of my navbar
leave a comment about why you're putting
that magic number there so if ever it
does get changed people know how to
change it yeah so just yeah if magic
numbers are bad by magic number I just
mean it's a number that is an exact
pixel amount only because it works
perfectly with this exact layout and
there's not really you know it's it
works perfectly because it's the exact
height of this so if anything in here
changes this changes and yeah so just so
you know magic numbers let people know
why you're using that magic number and
avoid them at all costs if you know a
better way of doing that please let me
know but we'll get a typographer going
up um hero background image padding
let's just do something
with this look good if it was just like
fullscreen let's go take a look
that was just taking up like the whole
thing should we try that if I do a
height of 100 viewport height minus 96
pixels oh geez
just yeah it would be a background we
also want to do a background size of
cover do we like that do we like that
where it takes up the whole space now
I'm just going to go with some padding
padding top of say like 25 viewport
height that's probably even too big 20
and padding-bottom 20 viewport height
that looks ok make that one a little
bigger maybe that looks alright right
guys that look all right I think that
looks pretty good we are rock I just
closed typography we're going to do my
you know we could do should I do this
should I use a placeholder and no I'm
not gonna use replace it
okay so I'm gonna say my h1 h2 I think I
don't know how far down I went
let's just do a 22 h3 whatever we'll
just set them all up I didn't use them
all but it's a theoretical project where
we would be h5 h6 font-family heading
hot
Oh what did I call it header font whoops
cool did I give this a special class I
did display one what did that a so I'm
actually going to come into my custom
file here because there's a few things
so this is the bootstrap let's just
organize this a little better actually
this is the bootstrap things that I'm
customizing and I want to just as much
as possible if I can just modify
bootstraps variables and things are
going to work so I can write less CSS I
tend to find that to be a good idea so
let's for a second here jump into
bootstraps variables file like we did in
the previous video and I want to see
fonts find we can get out of there um so
my font sizes are here font size large
font weights font font font font size I
don't want to necessarily change these
right now
I'm happy with that line height base is
fine I'm actually pretty happy with the
line height there we go that's what I'm
looking for display one I think is the
only one that I'm using so we can copy
you I go to my custom file and just go
down one step six it needs to be bigger
than that um I'm actually make this not
in RAM let's do something like a five
viewport width whoa way too small
ten
still too small 1215 15 let's go way too
big now right that's not terrible it's a
little too big hit big screens low I and
whatever when we go small small small
small actually it works pretty decently
let's go with 12 though or actually
let's do 15 V min yeah that's better
the V mins cool because it's taking the
smaller of the two so it's sort of it
locks in when you get to the giant
screen sizes but when you're on the
small ones it's looking at the smaller
ones so to keep shrinking it but once
you get it as long as your portrait
landscape I mean but yep that works well
super so that is good the only thing is
I want to change the color of that so my
just look h1 did I use h1 plus h2 s
after seems to be okay so we're just
going to say h1 font enough font color
is brand primary we are rock alright and
while we're in the variables here
display one was good but what I want to
change in here now is my small font
should be fine I'm looking at my lead
hmm did I miss it lead lead font size
copy and back over to custom and we can
put these two together my lead font size
should be um what was my font size
typography my regular font size is 1.4
so this should be like at least at one
point six five
there we go it's kind of hard to see
with that bright thing in the back a hmm
I don't want to put a drop shadow on
that though
why is my button look like that I did a
div class whoops
quote that was silly of me there we go
it's actually a button now good cool um
so that's actually looking pretty nice
let's go look at my original file my
buttons a lot bigger is one of the main
things my image is aligned quite a bit
differently too and I have a little bit
more spacing so let's just tackle those
things really fast home so I said
background sighs let's do a background
position of bottom center cool so that
should keep the text on top of this
darker area instead of on top of that
who knows at yeah it should more or less
work out better that way okay good so
that looks better now the button is my
next issue so I'm going to go back to
the bootstrap here I made a whole video
on variables and I clearly didn't set
them all up they probably have a whole
buttons thing
um so the the padding will be fine
whether is the font size coming from
font weight font focus drew drew drew is
the response size in here or is the font
size in my fonts and I didn't see it
before
it's for my colors colors colors colors
padding again let's go look in there
buttons thing here for a second really
fast are they doing it include font size
base I made a mistake
I should have updated my font size base
instead of what did I update I did on my
body did my font size where did it would
it be a typography today for my font
size here hmm 1.4 M let's take my font
size off of there and go back to my go
back to their variable file for a second
font size base is probably what I should
have assumes browser default to 16 yeah
I really should have just done it this
way that was kind of silly of me
actually so this one point so one point
six that I went with it was but look at
that my button gets gigantic nice good
that's what I was after their button
really doesn't look like what I want it
to he only just look at their buttons
again here for a second uh inline that's
good that's good yeah cuz they're
actually I could just modify my padding
Y and my padding X right yeah that would
make more sense than just customizing
everything completely font size base so
my button stuff can go right here
and I like doing why watch ways why I
like doing like 2.5 m that's giving me
an error why is that give me an error oh
because I left this alone let's do one
RAM whoops wrong way around I have one
and 2.5 that's too big
uh - I'm doing Ram there that's gonna be
even worse I it's what I'm after but
it's just too big okay
um so let's do like a point seven and a
- okay that's more of what I'm after
super okay good I'm happy with that
why is that so small Oh cuz this it's my
V min that's mm-hmm maybe V min isn't
going to work for my font size we'll
explore that in a second now let's get
our button working and my lead they're
working um I'm going to go to my
typography and just say that for the
lead has a margin bottom of 1m 1.5 see I
don't know if I want to do that though
yeah that's fine okay we'll do that
awesome
so that's good there's that problem with
my font size though um display one font
size the V min I love using it but okay
let's just try it again the reason that
I'm looking at this is just if
somebody's on I mean that doesn't look
too bad though like if someone it's kind
of tiny the way do twelve vertical width
we could always build a media query into
this but let's just see it the big yeah
there we go that's so much nicer so it's
nice and huge and it just shrinks down
with my screen and this now won't affect
it cool good okay I'm happy with that
perfection guys that's exactly what I
was after so I think we're pretty much
done for this I'm actually going to
change this this is a six let students
accept it like an eight it's a little
bit too narrow that looks a lot better
