where we left off before we're gonna be
making this into we're gonna be adding
the JavaScript in this so it actually
works now so it's nice and not too
difficult to do and the first thing I'm
gonna do is on my portfolio modal itself
here I need this whole thing to
disappear right so the nice easy way to
do that is just do a display of none so
we can make it disappear and now it's
gone super so what I want to do is I
want to make it so whoops I went too far
when I click on this link it's going to
appear and then when I click my little
close button it's going to disappear so
we're gonna start off the nice simple
way and then we're gonna add in the
animation to actually make it work um so
for this I'm going to make a new
JavaScript file so a new file in here
we're going to call this one modal Jes
I'm gonna go to my index and I'm gonna
let's just copy that one and modal Jes
and let's jump right over into the modal
j/s okay so for this to work there's a
lot of stuff we need to do but I don't
think it's me too complicated so the
first thing I need to do is I want to
make a variable from my portfolio
container which in this case is my
document dot query select the select
door and it's my portfolio whoops
portfolio items so let's save that
I think whoops there we go I just turned
off alright let's for now let's work on
a big screen so you can see more of what
I'm doing so I have my portfolio
container is my portfolio items and if I
go back to my index dot HTML here just
so we can remember because it's been a
long time my portfolio items is this div
which has all of everything in it this
is holding everything there is so if I
shrink that down all of my portfolio
stuff is inside of there so the reason
I'm doing that
is it's going to make it a lot easier to
work in a lot less intensive in general
because what I what this will let me do
is I can make one event listener instead
of having to make a separate event
listener for all of them because we
could definitely do a query selector all
and look at all of them or even just do
a query selector for for all my little
buttons here but then that would be five
event listeners just for something like
this and if you had a bigger one that
maybe you have twenty pieces on it then
you have twenty event listeners which
you want to avoid in general you want to
keep your event listeners to a minimum
so what I'm gonna do is portfolio port
port full the old container I'm gonna
add my event listener to there and so
we're gonna listen for a click and we're
also going to record the event so we
want to see what the event is when we
click so let's do a little console log
console log of the event itself so we
can see what's actually happening so I'm
gonna save that without the the thing
the semicolon at the end there and let's
go over to my console so
little dot J s line three one two three
whoops save okay so if I click anywhere
nothing's happening because the event
listener is on this so now I'm going to
click on this and you're gonna see it
registered the click and I'll click here
and I'll click here and everywhere I
click it's registering where I'm
clicking so you can see that if I click
in the middle here its target is the
figcaption itself if I click on the name
the target is the h2 portfolio title if
I click on this it's the port for the
description and if I click on the link
while we're jumping up so let's also do
a we want to do a e prevent default
right because we don't want the link to
actually work like a link so let's try
that again
so now when I click on that it's
registering that the link the target is
a dot portfolio link so what I want to
do is I want to I want to make a new
variable out of that so what I'm going
to say is that my modal toggle so what's
gonna turn my modal on alright I'm it's
not really a toggle because it's only
opening it so we have to say calm Const
modal toggle is going to be equal to e
target so whenever I'm clicking on
something I'm getting a target so when
the target is the closest or we're going
to take the closest port port portfolio
link so when I click on this it's my
modal toggle is literally just this one
link here so if I save that let's do
another console log console log modal
toggle and I'm also going to turn whoops
I made a mistake here I'm gonna keep
this one and turn off my console log so
when I click on this now
we're getting this specific link and if
I click on this one
it's giving me this specific link they
all look the same because it's the same
markup in all of them but whenever I
click on one it's gonna select it's
gonna I'm taking that as my thing as my
modal toggle and use your console log a
lot so you understand what's actually
going on it's going to help you up right
so now what we can do is if we're if the
person clicks on something that's not a
portfolio link we we don't want this
script to keep running we want to get
out of here so what I'm also gonna do is
just say if not modal toggle so if we
don't have a modal toggle we're gonna
return and that just means the script
will end here so if we click on
something we don't have anything we
don't want we're gonna have a whole
bunch of stuff in the script we don't
want it to start reading through
everything and trying to see if it
should keep going we want it just to end
so if I click on something and it's not
there and so we can save some processing
power and if there is a button what do
we want to do so if there is a button
and this is the part that might be kind
of weird I want to select the right
modal right so I have to select I want
to select the modal that's inside of in
this case we've only built this one out
so when I click on this I want to make
sure that I'm selecting the modal that's
inside of this figure so it's not hard
to do we'd have to do a bit of traversal
so what I'm going to say is that my
modal is equal to my modal toggle parent
node next element sibling so let's go
look at my HTML quickly for this so when
I click on my link I want to go to my
parent node so the parent node is the
figcaption itself so we're going from
here to here so we're going to my
figcaption and then from the figcaption
we're going to the next element sibling
so what's the next the sibling to this
the next one is this right here my div
portfolio modal
my selection is changing from we're
going from here to here and then
selecting its next sibling which is
right here so that's what this is where
the modal itself is the next element
sibling to the parent of my modal toggle
I hope that's clear and so let's do
another console.log to make sure that's
working because things don't work when
you don't console.log because you don't
know why and they just they don't work
so let's just make sure this is working
so this one if I click on it should give
me portfolio modal now this one
shouldn't work because I don't have a
modal in here so this should be meaner
there we go no there isn't one it can't
find anything because there is no next
element inside of that one whereas this
one has it so if I click it gets
portfolio model just to show you it will
get anything so say this was called
portfolio or actually I'll leave that
one like that lets go to my portfolio
item two and just after my fig caption
here does this make a div called test
and i'll save that so when i click on
this one i get my portfolio modal but
now when i click on this one it should
get test or is it this one there we go
there's my test so this one's giving me
more modal and this one's giving me med
test because this is the next thing
after here and then we're jumping down
to there so that's working so we can
comment that out and keep going okay so
we're getting there um the other thing
that we want so we want to be able to
open our box yes so pretty much when
somebody clicks on this we want to open
our modal right so we could just do
modal class list ad and we'll just call
it is open I'm going to save that and
let's go to my here and I just have to
add in here
if we have a portfolio modal which is
open its display will be block so if I
come here now and I click on this it
should work and of course it's not
working oh why not
let's go to my inspect mode and let's go
find what I'm looking for so section
portfolio items portfolio item one
figcaption oh here it is it is open so
it is working so let's just do a refresh
on there so I have my portfolio modal
and when I click on this is open is
getting added to it but obviously it's
not working so I screwed up something in
my CSS and you have to spell things
properly display:block yeah there we go
and now it's open
cool good it's open but now we have no
way of closing it so we need to add a
way to close it in here too so what I'm
going to do let's get rid of this whole
things we really don't need it we want
to have my modal close button so we do
what should we call it let's just call
it modal closed no let's call it closed
button close button I think that makes
more sense
so my close button in this case is nice
and easy I can just say modal query
selector and inside of there we just
want to look for my close button which I
think I called clothes clothes modal I
think let's go look modal closed
okay so in this case when I run this
modal it's it's taking the one we've
already opened so I'm looking at this
one that we've already selected so I'm
gonna look inside of that and find modal
clothes I don't want to run a document
query selector because that's gonna look
for all of them and it's always gonna
stop at the first one or I could do a
query selector all but in this case
we're already inside of this we have a
modal so inside of that modal we want to
select the close button so it's only
gonna be the close button for the modal
that's open and then when we click on
that we want to close it so if not if we
need to have a close button add the
event listener click and when somebody
clicks on it we want to do something yes
forgot my underscore so we want to do
something so what do we want to do we
want to modal class list remove is open
save so let's make sure this works
fingers crossed on this one click it
should open and when I click this at
your close
awesome hey it worked really happy it's
all good let's scroll down and try
closing and it closes there's that thing
but because this is open we're hovering
over the modal all the time so that will
only slide down after that's just we're
gonna have to live with that cool so I'm
pretty happy with how that's working if
you're happy with that that's great and
you can stop right here but if you want
to know how you can animate it and make
it fade in and fade out head over to the
next video because we're gonna it is a
bit more complicated to get that to work
and I want to devote it its own video to
doing that so I'll see you over in that
video where we'll make it fade in in it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
