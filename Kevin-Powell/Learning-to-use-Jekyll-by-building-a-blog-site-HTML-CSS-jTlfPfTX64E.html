let's get this going
can you guys hear me by any chance I
don't know if my audio is working in the
chat can you guys just let me know if if
you can hear me
let me awesome thank you guys
let me get alright
hi let me just switch a couple things
around over here there we go okay
awesome I'm ready to go so this should
be a lot of fun and just I want to give
a bit of a word of warning I've never
used Jekyll before so don't use this as
like a best practice or anything like
that please I don't know how this is
going to go so let's just jump over to
what we're going to actually be doing um
so here I have a bunch of stuff
I lost my mouse there it is
and okay so what we're gonna be doing
the first thing I want to do is just
learn an experiment a little bit with
Jekyll we're gonna be looking at and
what I just want to make sure I can get
the very basics of it down and then
we'll get into actually building like a
blog site with it where I want to
experiment with the grid as well I have
a few ideas for stuff that I want to do
with grid
so just experiments and stuff so I'm
gonna take the chance to do that at the
same time we'll be using sass to do it
all sass is built in with Jekyll so you
don't actually have to in do anything
extra should compile by itself and I'm
gonna be also using markdown which I
don't have a lot of experience with but
Jekyll supports that so I figured why
not sorry for this lucky video I know
I'm getting a war YouTube's telling me
that my stream is not very good right
now I'm gonna see if I can't do anything
about that according to my thing anyway
we'll keep going and hopefully the the
stream connect fixes itself a little bit
um as we go so let me get rid of that
because I don't really
now and thanks everybody for joining by
the way I think this would be a lot of
fun I hope it's a lot of fun yeah and
again if you have any questions while
I'm doing this feel free in the chat to
ask away it can be off topic too I don't
mind with this I'm gonna be here for a
while a few hours probably so you know I
don't win going off-topic a little bit
along the way as well and I'm sorry for
the lag evideo it still says that it
might be having some issues hopefully
that fixes itself my internet connection
should be able to handle it fine we'll
see how that goes
well let's a seadoo to do
pratik is asking how what language to
focus on you already know JavaScript you
have a Python HTML CSS No you know a lot
of stuff it depends what you want to be
doing focus on the language that will
let you do what you want to be able to
do do you have a project in mind you'd
like to do I can't really say anything
beyond that you know more languages than
I do already so I don't want to give you
any bad advice does troubleshooting take
hours for me it can sometimes it depends
I've spent like 40 minutes looking for a
typo before so you never know but I've
gotten a lot better at it I also teach
in the classroom and when you're
teaching beginners you see a lot of
mistakes so I've gotten really good at
troubleshooting just because of that
really oh yeah good question why do I
wanted you to use Jekyll so here I have
Jekyll's website it's a static site
thank you for asking man um it's a
static site generator which means it
generates things on the fly pretty much
so you're writing it's outputting static
HTML and CSS files you have some
JavaScript in there too but it's
outputting static files but it lets you
you write in with dynamic content so you
can have like a blog excuse me a blog
and other stuff it you know blog aware
right here on their website so it lets
us be able to use them some cool dynamic
things that you might normally only find
on like PHP and other stuff which also
means you
host it on github pages which it means
you can get free hosting on that I use
net low fly net lfi to host my website
which is static files only so I could
run a blog through that using Jekyll mg
Tao I don't know what that is
have mgt o w i don't know what that is
sorry so one thing with this Ivar I'm on
a Windows computer so I'm PC if you are
- it is a little bit annoying to install
Jekyll cuz you need Ruby and it can be a
bit of a pain in the butt
I've already pre-installed it it's the
only thing I've done um so I've put a
link in the description below if you're
on a PC if you're on a Mac it's a lot
easier and the other thing I have done
is I've read a lot of documentation
already so the documentation I just want
to make sure I knew sort of the
direction I was going in and roughly how
it worked so what I'm gonna do instead
of going into the documentation though
well this is for transforming an HTML
site into a Jekyll file I'm gonna use
this to create my own because if not it
comes sort of with a pre generated theme
and I don't want to be fighting against
the theme I want to be doing something
from scratch and this seems like the
easiest way to do it but I might be
wrong on that and so that's under the
tutorial section if you're looking for
it and convert an HTML site to Jekyll
I'm gonna be following these steps
alena github does not host PHP files we
can't have any sort of dynamic things or
anything that works with the server oh
man you're saying it does I'm curious
how that would work
my understanding of get hub pages is it
has to be static files only so I'd be
curious to know maybe I have to look
into it a little more but that's why
something like Jekyll is really awesome
because it lets you have a blog or other
things with dynamic content even though
it's in the end generating static files
that you can host in a few different
places so I've already installed Jekyll
like I've said so if I bring up my
terminal here just just make sure we're
on the right version I'm gonna write in
Jack Cole - be sorry I hear a weird
noise but I thought it was my computer
but it seems to be coming from somewhere
else there we go and I'm on Jekyll 3
point 7 point 2 which is the newest
version of Jekyll so it says what should
I do I'm going to create up some
different files here so I'm just gonna
I'm in BS code but you can use whatever
editor you want and I'm gonna start by
making a new folder here do I need a
folder no I will yes I'll start with the
folder underscore layouts and I need a
few different files so I'm gonna make a
new file
the first one is underscore config dot
yml I'm gonna make a another new file
called index MD and I'll make one last
file called default dot HTML and I'm
gonna bring that over into my layouts
and this shouldn't be in my layouts
default should be in the real what's
going on I'm moving too much stuff
config should be out here there we go I
think that is properly set up now man
can we name it without the underscores
I'm guessing here scores are important
so that's why I'm gonna put them there
if they're telling me that's what I
should do for now I'm gonna do it I
don't know enough to me it's letting it
know that because it's generating
content and stuff like that to me the
underscores are probably important and
telling it something that it needs to
know probably a little bit like when
you're using sass you can the
underscores let things know that it's
partial files and not things that should
be compiled
oh and you can do all that like this if
you're on a Mac by the way fire up your
favorite editor and populate the area of
default at HTML and index as follows so
we'll start with the config and this
should just be named my check whoops
check now this name obviously could be
something else but we'll start just with
the really basics I'll save that layouts
default dot HTML I'm gonna do the whole
thing here that's with Emmet exclamation
mark tab will populate at all if you're
using vs code Emmet comes pre-installed
Jekyll website I have a lot of trouble
spelling Jekyll and last but not least
default I need inside the body I want to
do content there we go
cool oh that's gonna get annoying a
little bit with these color coding oh
well I have a extension installed that
color coats the color coats color codes
parentheses and of any type as they go
farther inside just so you can keep
track of what's opening and closing
where don't really need it on right now
but I don't feel like digging through
and finding it okay so let's keep going
and the index dot MD and very soon we're
gonna see the real power of this and how
it's working so this thing at the top of
up here this is for the liquid called
liquid layout something like that
where the things that are up here are
the information that tell sort of the
different things so that I can set the
title of I'm gonna call it like my home
page and layout will be default so what
that means is this page should use this
file for its layout purposes so default
there and we'll come down and we'll
write some markdown so I'm going to put
in these and I'm a write page title so
what that means is it's going to use my
home page to populate the h1 on my page
this is markdown so the one hash tag
is so I you know I could just write each
one my page title close each one and
this will be taking this information and
putting it inside the h1 over here I'm
sorry just reading a few comments here
um there's PHP static site generators
jigsaw can data that compiled the plain
HTML I don't know if you can use PHP oh
yeah there you go so yeah you'd need to
use some a static site generator with
however it's working
and yeah row head I'd love to change the
time I can't sadly I can't do live
videos very often just because I have my
family my kids everything else this is
just the time I'll try and do different
ones at different times but I don't know
when my next one will actually be either
yeah sorry for sorry for you guys were
it's the middle of the night it's a 1
p.m. here so there's like a 12 hour time
difference to you Rudy sorry about that
so here let's just write some other
stuff so here is some normal content
this would just be a paragraph and just
to show you let's do this this is an h2
just for fun okay and I'm gonna save
that everything should be saved
and now I need to open up my terminal
and what do I need to do go to there I'm
already in the right spot um let's see
if this works Jekyll serve and we'll see
what happens if this worked I should be
able to go to here generating a it looks
like it actually worked so let's go and
see if it worked back and forth back and
forth it's loading and it worked that's
awesome so cool now I'm getting some
errors here cuz I didn't put it in a
favicon and there's some other problems
going on and all of that but that's
pretty cool
that's working so you can see here my h1
is actually the page title so just for
fun just to show you again how this is
work
or even I'll go to my default HTML now
and let's change something here just all
this style background it's blue body I'm
not used to writing inline styles body
background is blue this do I have to
refresh yeah there we go and you can see
that so this site is controlling what
everything looks like and it's pulling
in it's taking this content and
injecting it inside the body right there
so cool that's actually working mm David
5 a.m. but it helps to have young kids
that keep you up all night yeah and my
youngest ones sick right now so last
night wasn't too bad he woke up at like
4:30 or something but with his nose all
blocked but most of the time most of the
time they're they're not too bad
actually but they get up at like 6 a.m.
but I get up at weekdays I get up at
5:30 for work and stuff so yeah not too
terribly fun there don't really get to
sleep in what am I doing here we go um
so that worked is that it is that
everything that's in here create a
template
yeah I'm skipping a bunch of stuff yeah
here it's just talking about the
frontmatter that's what it was I was
thinking liquid for some reason it's
called frontmatter
this stuff so this is it is important
for putting some stuff in choosing your
title your layout and some other stuff
there's more things we can do with this
but I forget what they are yeah I got
all that the process files get written
as an HTML file in the site directory so
if we look here that means there's
probably it generated a site directory
and there it is that's everything that
got generated oh it's also copied my
plan over to there but that's fine and
my images but that's good because I'm
gonna need those images after anyway I
don't know if I should have these images
just floating out around here and
actually just to give you guys a sneak
peek on what we will eventually be doing
here we go this is what I want to
eventually do so this would be the home
page my awesome blog
oh I didn't mean I shouldn't
that is an image too but I need this
then we'd have the most recent blog post
we get put here and some older blog
posts here my button is in the wrong
spot
and then of really flashy footer and
then a individual blog post is gonna
look something like this
and then what I'm hoping for I'm gonna
be using grid so it should be easy to
sort of make these things that breakout
we could even maybe make a class that
would come all the way out so I want to
experiment a bit with how well we can do
this I have an idea that I want to try
and I don't think it's best practice but
for a layout like this that's really
simple I think it's gonna work well and
I'm basing this on a six column grid
type thingy like this so this is sort of
on a four this breaks out on the sides
and over on here we actually use all six
so yeah that's the the eventual goal is
to get this working as a Jekyll thing so
my blog posts would automatically be
filled in on the home page and I
shouldn't have to do any work on the
home page whatsoever fingers crossed
this would come in as a description yeah
so that should be interesting I'm not
quite ready to do that just yet though
because I've got this working but a few
other things that I want to do you can
sleep all day after this good Rudi glad
to hear that yeah David liquid is the O
liquid is the template language okay
thank you
I knew that I was getting liquid from
somewhere okay so create a default
template for blah blah blah so yeah the
default is our default layout copy and
paste the source code into a file called
default so this is saying if we have a
layout that we already have that we're
converting because I'm on the convert a
website from HTML into Jekyll so I don't
actually have a layout that I have yet
we also have filters I'm gonna keep this
open because I think it is going to be
important so let's just try something
really simple here I'm gonna take this
inline style out and so it's saying
for example I think I'm going to screw
things up here but that's okay right
this is all about experimentation so
here I think what I'm gonna do is put in
a container do class container is the
stream really laggy still guys just
curious how things are going cuz I could
always make a few changes
it seemed YouTube's telling me it's
going well now but I just want to make
sure that it is and also I know you guys
said you can hear me I just wanna make
sure the audio levels are okay cuz I
hear myself talking but it always sounds
good on this end and I'm yeah so I'm
gonna make a container there and let's
see if I can get my CSS hooked up with
an external CSS file now the one thing
and everything needs to go in an assets
folder if I remember correctly so I'm
gonna make a new folder called assets
inside my assets now this is where I'm
gonna screw things up
does this tell me here we're gonna get
to this stuff a little bit later I see I
was hoping this would be here too
because it's talking about setting up
our files but it's not it will compile
sass for us and I know it goes in an
assets folder and I'm pretty sure it has
to go in an S CSS folder all right no
just a CSS folder let's rename that I
think it goes in like that and then in
here let's make a new file mean dot s
CSS I think it's gonna compile it for us
hi bummin I'm in second just a few
questions
Yussef what is Jekyll and do I have to
use it you don't have to use Jekyll it's
just a cool language I think I'm and so
this will answer your question to Batman
so anyone who's just joining us we're
building a website with Jekyll
eventually I want to build this out and
I saw another question from Malena maybe
about what software I'm using this is
Adobe XD sketch is a bit more popular
but I'm on a PC so I don't have sketch
and there's a lot of other software out
there too
I used to use Photoshop all the time but
now I've moved on to it will be XD
there's still some problems with it but
it works I like it so basically what
Jekyll is is it's taking files so I have
this it just says content here and it's
going to take files and insert the
content I'm creating into there
automatically and the idea is to be able
to build something with a static site
with out servers and all of that stuff
needed or not servers but databases and
all of that but be able to have a blog
or other things that required it would
normally require dynamic content so
let's see if this CSS folder will
compile on its own so let's just write
some sass here so I'll make a variable
BG is no 4 4 4 text will be ffff and
I'll save that and I need to link it
here obviously so I think if I go back
to where we were before dude you do I
probably need something really similar
to that right so I'm gonna have my style
link but the H Rev I'm gonna actually
follow through on this I want to make
sure I write this properly no it's not
gonna yeah okay so my href will just be
oh I guess I want to do mmm dude you do
I don't want to mess this up so it
should just be like this maybe and then
it would be assets slash main dot CSS
and then it's a relative URL
and I have no idea if this actually
worked or not let's go back over here
and refresh ah doesn't seem actually I
should have also put something but it's
obviously oh I made variables by didn't
use them that's not too smart so here I
have a say body color is BG background
whoops
is BG this should be text and my
container just give it a width of like
600 pixels margin:0 auto save refresh
and it's not working I didn't think so
let's go see um have I looked at any
other static site generators yeah I know
Ruby's required I haven't looked at any
other ones to be honest
I've sort of this is one I've wanted to
learn for a while so that's just the
reason I'm doing it I know there's
there's a ton of them out there so and I
can't really I don't want to UM asset
CSS oh it's not compiling my sass I
thought Jekyll automatically compiled
sass but apparently not or let's just
see then maybe let's rename this you
think if I do that save no okay uh being
too smart rename I was under the
impression that it would automatically
compile this for me so what I'm gonna do
let's just get rid of that and color
will be ffff background will be three
three three
let's rename this whole thing as a
regular CSS file for now and see if that
works
index stylesheet
oh that shouldn't be like that that
should be oops
getting a phone call sorry guys I had it
on do not disturbing it came through
anyway save why not okay let's just take
all this off then and see what happens
and not all that let's just make it not
this dynamic thing it's not working
right now I'll figure that out in a
minute I just want to get a little bit
of things working here properly it's
still not working
index assets / main assets oh that would
okay undo maybe this kid work assets I'm
not used to going so deep into files
assets CSS mean hey there we go okay
that was just me being silly then cool
good so we got something working that's
a good sign right the top of my screen
isn't seen that's weird one second
did you do it according to my streaming
software it seemed let me just check my
YouTube thing here oh I can't scroll all
the way up hmm I can see the top of my
screen on my little preview here of my
stream so I don't know why you're not
getting it
sorry and what can you not see that's a
bad question isn't it you don't know
what you can't see
okay anyway I'll have to keep going cuz
I don't really know what I can fix there
oh you can see it Daniel and Suraj well
okay I'm glad to meet you can okay let's
keep going and start trying to make this
look a little bit nicer oh I was
supposed to post a thing yeah I'm gonna
try this ass out again and I just want
to quickly check out the documentation
let's go see yeah let's see what happens
actually I told someone I was gonna let
them know that I was going live and I
completely forgot so let me just post
that right now sorry I'm live sorry for
the late Jim there we go okay sorry
about that um
anything about sass just really fast
here no okay let's just see what happens
then let me shrink this down we'll keep
both of these open at the same time and
let's rename this a CSS save it's coming
through there so that means I lost it
hmm anyone here use Jekyll before whoops
that's not what I want I was sure it
compiled it for me automatically but
maybe I'm missing a little I might have
to stop compiling it and actually
we'll probably have to be set up in my
configuration file
I might have to mention that I want some
sass let's see if it's in your s CSS
find on site not found on here configure
site variables
no that's okay did a - of posts on page
we're eventually gonna do stuff like
that we're gonna get to that for loops
we're gonna get to that eventually
navigation maybe I would have thought
sass would have been on this part but I
have a feeling okay I went too far
sorry for all the scrolling I feel weird
usually I have an idea of what I'm doing
already and I really have no idea what
I'm doing this time which is a little
bit nerve-wracking for me it should get
compiled into the site folder which you
should never touch I agree
I'm just looking in my site folder to
see what's going on in here but in my
site folder my CSS folder it's not
getting compiled automatically I'm on
the newest version of Jekyll so
obviously there's something weird going
on so I'm just wondering if
configuration file it's not mentioned
here because in my config I don't have I
just have my name right now um I'm
wondering that's for Chrome down also
I'm gonna actually let's just I'm gonna
do one thing because this is gonna drive
me nuts ctrl C will stop this from going
I'm gonna do the same thing again
so Jekyll serve but if I add live reload
it means I don't have to refresh I'm
happy I stumbled upon that and I wish it
was more obvious in their documentation
just as refreshing is annoying
generating and it's done okay and I
should get some errors now which are
fine oh wait it's saying you can't find
some do I not have the sass gem file for
some reason
did you juice source destination
increment enabled I don't want to do
that done please add the following gem
file to avoid polling changes I thought
it was automatic but anyway let's see if
this works I just want to make a change
here page and some more content and I'm
gonna save that's not out a refreshing I
thought hmm anyway okay yeah but it
doesn't see me working I just stumbled
across that live reload flag when I was
going through and it was really deep
into stuff and I wish I'd know yeah well
I've found it now but it's not even save
you can see it's oh it is working let's
just delete some content there we go it
is working awesome I am getting errors
though because of I was not finding my
CSS file so let's find out how I can get
my sass going and I think you know what
I'm I'm gonna get my sauce going and
then we're just gonna build that website
out screw it I don't want you know I
think I yeah I think that's what we're
gonna do so let's do did you get my sass
file going here I'm going back and forth
between Chrome and Safari just a crime
safari geez Chrome and Firefox because I
wanna I'm gonna be using grid I
definitely want to be using Firefox for
the dev tools so it's got my docks and
search the docks I'm just going to
search did you I'll start here and see
what happens oh there we go
so one mistake I might have made is
Jekyll allows you to do do place all of
your partials in your sass tier which
will default to underscore sass aha
so this should be renamed underscore
sass save
it still didn't work what's in my sight
now
assets underscore sass mmm obsess you
source slash underscore staffs place all
of your SES s or sass files in here for
example take a look at this example I'll
go look at that in another tab I'm not
putting them in a different directory I
could tell it that I am the disaster is
only used by sass note that the sauce
imports nothing more this means the
Jekyll does not know about these files
directly if you're using imports them
and you'll need to ensure that your sass
tier is set to the base directory that
contains your sass files Oh does that
mean it's not supposed to be in my
assets let's just see what happens
save
no that didn't work either uh-uh okay
let's go look at that example no it is
it's just supposed to be here and then
my main there okay so I shouldn't have
had that inside my assets folder I
thought I had to do that and let's go
look at their config file then I knew I
can do that sass ISO to tip top tip yeah
sorry for all the stumbling around once
I gets the sass going I think it'll be a
lot more interesting of a video save and
it's not doing anything so maybe
underscore sass main dot a CSS juju and
let's go back to here for a second
da da da so underscore sass da da da
they have those where's their mean oh
okay I am messing things up so the main
scss not in my site folder in my assets
folder I should have a CSS folder so I
was right there CSS and in that folder I
should have a main dot s CSS
mmm-hmm assets where did I'm I'm
screwing everything up that's okay I'll
make anyone CSS and this should be
inside there okay and then my partials I
think would have to be inside there and
early on someone was asking if we need
the underscores it looks like what
happens is delete the s CSS from the
assets from assets I don't I don't have
one there now oh wait maybe I should
save this file again no if you have the
underscore it's an ignored folder so it
means it's not actually doing it it
might be pulling stuff in from that but
it's not actually using anything in
those to do anything important so if I
look at my site folder it's doing assets
it's just making keeping everything
going like that this is a little bit
frustrating I don't want to be writing
this without sass because I'm lazy
bah-bah-bah I thought this would be a
lot easier I read that it was automatic
and I didn't have to do anything and I
got all excited so in here they have
that so you know what just for fun at
import test or yeah add import
what should I call it I just want to see
one thing actually I looked at the
config this is just the readme file
Jekel SAS converter requires two point
view or greater I am so you don't need
to install it if you're already using
Jekyll Oh see silly me I need gem hello
I was missing a gem I thought it came
automatically there we go
let's see command seed to end that let's
see if this works
gem install Jack kill SAS converter I
read that this was automatically
installed so I'm a little but oops
didn't Jim install so I can't see
everything I'm writing Jack kill SAS
converter that would that would solve a
pretty big problem right there so we'll
let that go and let's pull up my layout
now just to get a few things
Oh successfully installed let's just see
what happens now oh whoops we need to
Jekyll Jekyll serve I'm zoomed in so the
font sizes are bigger but it means I
can't see everything I'm seeing it's
kind of annoying um so yeah let's go and
check out the layout so we can start
generating I keep getting distracted
here because right isn't hope to do
something else
yeah it's still not working assets come
on I'm gonna delete my whole site let's
stop I want to stop serving I'm gonna
delete the whole site folder if not I'm
just going to write this without sass
I'm getting way too frustrated and maybe
we'll figure it out after because I want
to make this interesting for you guys
and seeing me troubleshoot something I'm
not too comfortable with is not going to
be too interesting so assets is set up
properly let's I can't spell Jekyll
Jekyll serve so the layout is this I've
already gotten my images so I just need
to link to the Google Fonts that I'm
using I have all of that information
right here so I'm using cardo and
pathway gothic 1 so I just need to get
those from Google I have all my font
sizes I have my colors as I mentioned
the grid is a six column grid so let's
see what we can do with this um I'm just
gonna also export this actually as an
icon drew drew symbol one can I rename
this rename logo not a very good logo
that's I don't want to batch export I
just want to export export selection PNG
layout to build no change desktop
Desktop chuckle blog I'm gonna throw it
in here now I don't think it should be
in that folder but for now we're gonna
throw it in there and we'll figure out
where my images should be after so I
let's just see here in my site folder
assets yeah it's still not converting it
is it only you who's lagging incorrect
I'm not sure that's sorry just check
this out for one second yeah no the
stream health seems to be going up and
down I don't know if my internet is not
doing so hot today or what and I really
apologize for any lagging and stuff that
might be going on okay so let's see what
do I want to do I want to let's just
come back to this for one second so I
did that it's installed usage juju see
it comes but I was right it came already
I didn't need to do that I wasn't crazy
I installed it for nothing um the main
one the partial the partials are fine
the main one the main files are like
pages they go where you want them to
output and they contain oh I need
frontmatter lines at the top
no where's their main one did they do
that
and I just didn't realize it oh man
okay this was to actually have Jekyll no
to actually have Jekyll know that
something is should be compiled or it
should do something with it instead of
just taking it as is you need to put the
frontmatter stuff at the top I literally
don't need any of this I just need to
have these lines up here at the top if I
save that site assets it didn't do it
anyway
four check that might be my problem that
was my problem oh my goodness guys I
don't know why this is in red it's given
me an error on a bunch of stuff it
doesn't like that I'm using that in an
SCSS foil ah that's frustrating I know I
could use other stuff but I just yeah
actually I should have just used
something else for my sass but I knew
that Jekyll could do sass I knew it and
I just needed to put this bloody thing
at the top oh that's so stupid but it
makes sense
it means that if you don't put the
frontmatter at the top Jekyll will just
take the file and move it to where it
thinks that should go inside your site
folder if you do include the frontmatter
it knows it needs to do something so it
knows it needs to actually compile that
file somehow so that's why it's also
going to take my index MD it can take
this if I don't have this at the top
it's just gonna take in a markdown file
and export it as a markdown file but if
I have it like this and you can also
have HTML files there's no problem at
all an HTML file will work and there's
no issue with it as long as you have
this at the top then you can use the
dynamic content stuff but yeah now I
just get this annoying error because it
thinks I shouldn't have these lines up
here but so be it I'll live with that
because it's working thank goodness I
just don't think I put the live reload
on but I'll live with it for the moment
cool so let's get to building our site
and making it look a little bit better
so I'm going to come to the default HTML
first because we need to change some
stuff so let's go over to my design and
let's just pluck this over on the side
here close this down for a second I'm
actually going to start with this layout
and then do this one just because I this
I need the content to actually be
generated in so I'm gonna make my post
first and then we'll we'll figure out
whoops sorry then we'll figure out how
we can turn that post
we'll make that Christ this dark line at
the top for Firefox is driving me nuts
there we go
okay and make this a bit bigger
so we can actually get started now and
actually I need this to be opened so I
can get my colors and font sizes um
we'll do that after it let's just worry
about the layout for now okay so at the
top I don't want a container
I want my we'll call it title title area
title area in my title area I need to
have my logo so my logo see this images
probably shouldn't be like that my
images should probably be something that
gets ignored no it should be in my
assets let's bring that up into my
assets yeah
that should just be in there like that
images and then I my images I think that
makes sense so what I can do now is I
can say that inside my title area we
should have whoops
an image SRC I'm gonna do this part in
one second and then class is equal to
logo so the reason I'm we might have
like sub pages and everything and we
always want the source to work so this
is again we're having dynamic content is
a good thing because if my source was
always coming in as like the Pat the
actual path I need to modify it if it's
a sub page and it's in another folder or
something like that or if it's deeper in
where is this I can just specify that it
should be coming from the root folder
right and I already just like I did here
yeah so just like this so it should be
images assets whoops
assets slash images slash logo dot PNG
and then I also need to say that it this
is a relative path I think that a
relative URL whoops
URL and save that now I just one thing
that might actually have been broken if
I go
my assets and in my images oh it's there
okay sometimes things happen a little
differently so if I go and look I should
have my logo awesome good
so my logo will come in and this doesn't
matter where what how deep of a folder
I'm in my logo will always appear
because it's always getting it from the
right location after my logo
I need my title of the post so that will
just be du du jeu or we can do this oh
no what am i doing okay this is okay
this is okay I just realized I'm on my
default HTML so I should that's okay I
mean logo will always be here I don't
want just content here though I have two
different pieces I have some content
that's up here and I have other content
that's here this one will always be the
page title so I just write page I
already forgot yeah this page title hey
John glad you could make it sorry about
posting late over on slack and so page
title and page title and then I'm just
going to call this page description I
think I can just make stuff up pretty
much as I go so I'm gonna do that and
see if that works
and then what we're gonna do is we'll
come down so the title area is this big
area on the top I have my image that
will be coming in I have my title oh I
shouldn't be specifying see does this
make sense though yeah this would be my
h1 page title as far as I know maybe
with cramdown you can which is a type of
markdown but I don't know how to do it
so I'm just going to do this as a
paragraph class equals oh I can't this
is an HTML file this has to be page one
and the reason actually this is gonna
work for my default anyway right anyway
we're gonna do it like this and we'll
modify things a little bit later class
is um we'll call it
subtitle so subtitle and this could be a
class title so my total area title of
subtitle and I'm missing something I'm
missing my close that and then I can
close my paragraph over here save
hopefully that's making some sense then
I can come down and do this area here so
for this now I'm gonna be using the grid
to do it but this is what I want to
experiment with is doing the grid
without any dibs I don't know if this is
gonna work
this is the experiment that I want to
try for this I'm literally just gonna
have let's just do of h2 of most recent
posts because most recent post Oh I
copied that from my last page blog title
would go here copy no I don't even need
that delete some content here title of
the post is all the way up there this
could be like I don't need this this is
just my content then content and content
so I have all my content coming in and
then I need a footer at the bottom
footer and then inside my footer I'm
just gonna put for now some set text
that eventually we might change to
something better
P
okay so sorry Yusef is that okay to use
a div instead of a section in HTML yes
divs you can use for pretty much
anything we're a section you have to be
a bit more technically if you're using a
section correctly and you'd want it to
be a bit more specific this could be
definitely could be a div the section I
mean that could definitely be a section
but um yeah I've just been teaching
intro classes a hole for the last three
weeks where people don't like sections
and headers and footers because they get
confused so they've put divs everywhere
so I'm in the habit of doing that right
now as well but you're right this could
definitely be section class title area
for sure so let's go and make an actual
blog post and then for now I'm using my
index and then we're gonna fix this up
to actually work properly it's just I
want to be able to sort of see what's
happening on the fly so page I'll see I
already screwed up did I if I take this
out because I'm using my page title over
here not here so if I delete this from
here I'm just curious let's save this
and go and see what we have
refresh okay so that did work my home
page because that's the title coming
from here the normal content that's this
the h2 and my footer so it is working it
is working know the video lag seems to
be coming from my side sorry about that
John I don't know what's I what's
causing it to be honest my stream health
keeps jumping from low to high and low
to high and I don't know why I wish I
could tell you why um yeah I thought my
settings were okay YouTube told me
everything was good to go and now it's
going up and down I have nothing else
using the internet so I don't know
what's causing it so I'm gonna delete
this content and let's just bring in for
here let's go and grab what I did
title of the post so I wanted to the
description so let's see if this works
description I don't know if I can make
stuff up here or not copy that and paste
it here let's see what happens I didn't
get any errors here what was generating
my file hey and it worked there's the
description coming in right there except
perhaps yeah yeah and there's my footer
cool so that worked and then the content
for this itself will go so let's go and
find my XD here and I'll just copy or I
can't copy all that basically just some
lorem ipsum paste and it's in markdown
so I don't need to put any tags or
annoying stuff like that
copy paste now I don't know how to do
images in markdown so we'll come back to
that in a second or links so we'll put
those in in one second if it's going to
add a couple more paragraphs there we go
so what are we gonna do um what I want
to do I'm gonna see if I can do one
thing actually here for the video lag
cuz some might be driving some people
crazy I'm wondering I don't know if this
actually change anything probably not
it's I'm just gonna go in my settings I
don't know if I can make a change right
now stream no that's not here anyway
that I'm controlling it
sorry I'm looking at my I'm using a
tablet is my second screen and it's
really tiny let's see if that fixes
anything though uh yeah this eventually
will be a full video and if it really
doesn't work out I'll make a a new one
if the recording on my computer is just
as bad so if I save that now we should
be getting I need to put my live reload
on so all my text is coming in sweet so
this one wouldn't be my homepage this
title would actually be my blog post
let's just say I know it's my index now
I'm gonna change that eventually I want
to actually style stuff right now yes
okay so we can start styling so I'm
gonna come into here and get rid of this
I don't know how I'm gonna do like a
proper yeah we might as well just come
into here in my actually have to go back
to that this for one second okay so it
knows to import it from here cool so in
my sass folder I'm going to create a
underscore typography dot s CSS and I'm
gonna make a another new file underscore
colors dot s CSS and I will eventually
do a bit more in there but that's for
the moment bring that stuff in and
actually let's go to here and we'll
start by import colors and at import
type typography I'm not going with a
proper file structure and all of that
but we'll use our partials at the very
least so form whoops don't need that for
my colors I have them all here
to juju so let's go to my colors and
white is a nice simple white
let's call actually I'm trying to get
used to doing like this color white
color blue copy paste color let's just
call it pink usually I go with accent
but pink we'll have to do copy it's
really quiet over in the livestream oh
hi Balaji it's really quiet over in the
livestream though guys don't be scared
with asking questions even if it's off
topic or anything else whatsoever I'm
happy to chat and copy this it's not
black but we're gonna call it black
color.black
whoops that's not my color black save
okay there we go so my colors are good
to go typography did you is it still
freezing
you know it does look in frozen there a
hmm actually one thing that might help
one second
just let you know what's going on it's
not receiving enough video to smooth
stream as such Gruder drew that's
annoying because I don't know I don't
want it oh did you do this is annoying
I'm actually wondering if this is
causing it no that shouldn't be causing
it the audio is working perfectly but
not the stream which sucks that makes it
kind of awkward I'm going to try one
more thing out not now
juju sorry
okay I'm gonna try one thing here let's
just see what this does
don't want that oh my goodness don't
want that I'm just checking my stream
settings here to see what's going on why
is it so all over the place
holy moly it's jumping all over for my
speeds just keep me up-to-date in the
chat mm-hmm you know okay let me know if
it improves in a few minutes it's not
restarting the stream yeah okay
so hopefully the audio is still working
okay as markdown goes I don't have much
experience with it either but you'll see
it a little bit more as I write in here
it's not I don't know if it's something
I'm gonna really grab a hold of but I
definitely see some of the good things
with it
well the stream may or may not be
working I'm gonna do some boring stuff
like getting my Google Fonts set up
which hopefully you guys have an idea of
how to do and while I do that
yeah I'll do that I don't remember what
weights I need I think I need all of
them so I have pathway that only has one
weight and I need card oh I think
there's only three in here anyway
customized doodoo yeah that's fine and
import copy that
and I'll just plug this right at the top
of here save uh no I never know if I can
put it there but I'm gonna put it right
at the top of typography just to make
sure they actually get brought in it's
working better now now it works okay I
might know I might have been screwing
stuff up there I was trying to get fancy
with something so I might have hopefully
that fixed it and we don't have any more
issues makes it a little harder for me
to keep track of things but that's okay
so the google fonts are there now I just
have to actually use them so let's do
font family saw serif is pathway it's a
long one so I'm going to copy it here
oops let's just and my font family serif
is this one okay there we go
so save and whoops I do that way too
often save mean let's just come on my
main here and I'm gonna be not doing
best practices for my CSS my CSS because
I'm not gonna be making all the folders
and files that I normally would but
let's just say a body font family is fun
families serif know serif awesome good
so I'm gonna actually stop this and Jack
goal serve live reload cuz I hate
refreshing my browser and I don't know
why I didn't leave that on from the
beginning when I showed it to you guys
my internet connection seems to be
having some major issues
let me just yeah like if you can see
here this is the kilobytes per second up
and down and it's like huge swings and
there's nothing using the internet right
now so I don't get why the swings are so
massive and I don't know why it's even
capping there let me
check one more thing output I don't care
if it uses all my internet hopefully
that makes it work a little better
Yousef yeah railway is a nice font
I like railway a lot too ok so that's ok
so let's go and look at my design again
so I have my title of the post and I
want to be using the grid and I'm
actually going to put the grid on my
body
and this is where I was saying I want to
try something a little bit different
with the CSS grid so I'm gonna have this
is gonna be grid template columns and
I'm gonna want to name these probably so
it's gonna be one fr just for the it's
gonna use up all the empty space so
there's all the empty space then let's
give this a name so this one will be
called um so I have to put them I think
so let's call this one container start
then I'm gonna have repeat 6 because I
have 1 2 3 4 5 6 but I wanted to name
this one too I think okay let's just do
repeat 6 for now and if I need to name
more stuff we will repeat 6 I'm gonna
give them min max I don't know if this
in your responsive site right away I'm
focusing on big screens for the moment
because I do want to be looking at Jack
a little bit more and have already spent
an hour not really done much so min max
is I don't know I've made these like 260
here so let's just say like 100 pixels
250 pixels we'll see what this does
so that should give me my 6 then will
have my in container end and then 1fr so
hopefully let's just break that up a
little bit hopefully that makes sense
so it's 1fr my grid and then when I far
over there so if this works my
layout should be broken right now oh I
forgot display grid so you can see the
spacing did get kind of weird
just cuz clap when you're doing news
when you're using display grid you're
spacing on your paragraphs the margins
stop collapsing so they double-spaced
themselves and I might have screwed up
stuff here I just want to look at my
grid in proper it was I'm not supposed
to put quotation marks on these things
yeah there we go okay no quotation marks
whoops so there's my grid so what I want
to do now and is this gonna work
thanks El Chico John you don't fancy
doing my counseling course am doing
whilst watching no no thanks there John
so I had my title area let's give it up
the background of back color blue okay
now what I want my title area to do
obody margin:0 so I want my title area
to take the whole thing so I'm just
going to do grid template columns 1 over
7 and grid columns
grid column
does that make sense or is it one second
we have one two three four five six
seven eight maybe nine I thought we had
there we go okay so it's just pretty
much telling it take up the whole space
and then inside of there so you know hmm
I'm not sure if I will this will work
properly let's just do a text align
Center for an out text align Center
color is color white my dot title can be
a different color cut a nut color of
font family font family saw serif text
transform upper case and we'll just make
the font size for I don't know six RAM
make it nice and big I'm not gonna be
worried about so much the styling there
we go and margin zero for now margin
zero high ends in Andes so a man you
guys names are hard for me already sorry
if I mispronounced your name okay so I'm
gonna just leave this let's just add
some padding and then move on
padding three M 0 whoops that's not on
here I want that on here padding 3 &amp;amp; 0
okay so that's starting to look a little
bit more like what I wanted
now I actually I'm gonna make these be
able to be a bit smaller
okay so what my plan is and this is
where it's a little weird where my
experimentations with the grid come in
paragraphs are going to be and actually
one second yeah let's just say
paragraphs for now I'm hopefully the
recording on my computer doesn't
massively lag but I will be putting this
whole thing up on the YouTube channel oh
yes
the whole thing will be up on the
YouTube channel not immediately after
because I might if I have time I might
edit it but we'll see maybe take a bunch
of the junk out or I might just do like
a condensed version where I actually
know what I'm doing that might be a
better idea
well not it won't be exactly the same
thing but just focused on Jekyll maybe
with the CSS stuff already done ma'am so
paragraphs let's see if this works grid
template a great grid column of I don't
want to take the whole thing I want it
to go from one two three three over what
I can't I turn the numbers on here
somehow I'm sure there's a way and
layout display line numbers that will
make my life easier where are they
though you're supposed to be on area
names I don't have any area name so
where's my numbers hmm oh there there
awesome so I wanted to stop here six
three over six this is in Firefox you
can put the grid line numbers and names
and grid areas and all of that stuff on
so that's super super handy if ever you
need to you know that's my footer and so
my footer should get the same thing as
my title area background background the
color pink color color was it white I
went with let's try that text a line
Center padding 2m 0 okay there we go
we'll do a margin top on this of 4m my
title area margin bottom for M okay cool
so it's sort of working the only problem
is the spacing on everything so
paragraphs will get a margin of zero on
them and my oops yeah it should be grid
gap so I do want gaps on my grids on my
columns I want them to be 2m and on my
rows I want them to be one in and
hopefully I didn't get that backwards I
did 1 &amp;amp; 2 so the space here is in me 16
pixels and my space here be 32 pixels
and that's sort of what I wanted to do
so I don't think this is best practice I
really don't think that we should be
using oh I didn't do it properly either
something's wrong with the positioning
of this I want it moved over 1 4 to 6 is
it four to six oh two three one two do
they not have enough room still actually
I need it to go one more and I need this
the max here is way too big probably so
this should be from 3 to 7 I think is
what I want yeah that's more to 1 so
let's turn off my grid now rules
whoops layout I want to turn off my grid
now refresh no good line numbers off
body off there we go okay yeah so I
think that looks decent it's not amazing
by any means my font size on here should
be bigger - font
is one point to ramp I don't know I'm
just throwing at random numbers right
now
I'm pretty happy with that though so
that's kind of cool we can use
paragraphs and I mean when I eventually
get my images in they'll be a little bit
bigger so markdown now I'm gonna use a
markdown cheat sheet and I should have
prepped one of these ahead of time but I
didn't because I want to put my images
in so let's go back to my file so let's
just close these I don't need my sass
and stuff anymore markdown so I want to
throw in a link so let's just find links
so we just wrap the text that we want in
this like that and then we just put this
and do where we want it to go so let's
just say it's going to google.ca I'm in
Canada so I'm used to google.ca and that
should give me a link in my text good
more important though is my images so my
image image is inline style reference
style I'll use the inline style so right
here I want it to be do I need the
exclamation mark I guess so alt text
yeah because that's what's going to make
it an image and said alt text will be an
image because I don't know what it is
and then this I guess I can use my I'm
just going to think I can do that now is
this gonna work if I use this because I
want it to be assets / images / I think
once called mountain let's just bring in
you know what I can't do it this way
anyway because I need to give it a class
image so I'll do it the way I know
so SRC is equal to and then I'll bring
in so the source is equal to did you do
it'll be assets
images slash mountain JPEG and that's a
relative URL I think that's how we do it
yeah good I'm remembering some stuff so
if I save that oh whoops
save that no why not at least I have the
right thing here I thought in markdown
you could write HTML hi bench bench OD
bench OD Yousef why didn't I use height
for my text area and use my padding
instead so that way if I used height on
here and then I added my image it
wouldn't be high enough anymore or if I
change the content that's inside I
wouldn't be doing it or in the dude I
just wanted to make sure the text area
yeah I just like using padding or even
here I put margin bottom to make this
space but even in here with the padding
by having padding if this becomes two
lines it doesn't screw up the height of
the whole area it's still gonna work
fine over here or if I'm working up here
it's still going to look okay even if
this which is on one line of text
becomes too so if this got smaller now
it's on to this distanced is still the
same so that's why I would use padding
as much as possible that's interesting
that the right thing is coming in here
hmm so see this is where I need a bit
more work with so what if I did this
without I didn't put my clasp on it
anyway so I'll leave all of that there
one second let me just see what happens
if I take all of this off and just do it
broken but at least it's coming in as an
image now and just for fun if I change
this to absolute because you can make
links to absolute links this way too I
just want to see so this is where my the
liquid thing here is working but it's
not bringing it in as an image it's
bringing it as a paragraph our markdown
is bringing it in as a paragraph what if
I just did this it's because it's in
markdown but I thought it marked down
you could write HTML like if I did h2
hello clothes age - I always thought
HTML was valid Oh does it want like
something like that no
hello so my hello is working but my
image isn't coming through it's coming
through as a paragraph instead so if
anyone knows why I'd love to know but
we're gonna keep going and if I figure
that out I'll come back to that at a
later time because I want to actually
make this blog work now okay so right
now it's working in the sense that I can
create my posts so let's come and back
down actually to Jekyll's website and
actually here's my assets does this have
images static files oh that's my content
I don't want let's go back I'm worried
about my image after did you do back
back back
creating converting in HTML site to
Jekyll so I've done a bunch of this
stuff already so create your default
layout so I've done that and then for
example this paths were relative on your
site that's okay this is all good that's
okay identify the content part so we've
done some of that create a couple of
files with frontmatter tags so let's
make a I have my index already let's
make a I don't want even have blog post
so this wouldn't really be my home page
but I'm gonna leave that as my home page
for the moment let's make a new file
five dueduedue in I guess I just make it
right here I should have a blog folder
probably write whatever I'm gonna do it
here for now
we'll call it a blog post blog post one
oh no a blog post through different I
just remembered something
blog post they give you very specific
formatting for this I'm okay with show
posts on a page okay so here we need a
posts folder so I'm gonna make a new
folder underscore posts and inside the
posts folder we're going to make a post
and you have to do it like this you have
to
order name them your month day title it
has to be done that way
so in my posts folder we'll make a new
file so 20 1802 and 17 and my first post
dot MD I'm pretty sure it could also be
HTML it's gonna bring either of them in
now I need my frontmatter stuff so it's
I need those this is gonna be my title
is going to be my first blog post page
test I just want to put a long title and
my description this is a dis description
and man I already forgot is it template
layout my layout is default if you don't
put the layout default I'm pretty sure
it defaults to default so now actually
let's now let's create a layout that
will display the posts create a new file
in layout it's called home HTML and add
the following logic really okay we'll do
that let's see I'll do what it says to
do Oh No let's leave this um this is my
very first post and this will be my this
being h2 so the nice thing with this is
like this is an h1 this is an h2 you get
the idea right this is an h3 the one
problem was writing in markdown is
adding class names but if you're writing
blog posts hopefully you don't actually
need to using too many class names here
is some generic content okay
so let's save that and then it says we
need to make a new layout that will
display the posts create a new file
inside of layouts drew drew drew let's
go and do this layouts layouts called
home HTML
new folder' home.html
now one thing is I'm looking at this I'm
not gonna copy and paste even though I
could copy and paste because I'm trying
to learn what this is showing me if I'm
copying and pasting this I'm not
learning anything I'm not getting used
to writing it so if ever you're trying
to learn a new language make sure you're
writing things out even if you're just
copying what you're seeing on the side
of the screen I find it a lot better oh
yeah
I think you two blocks links okay so my
home so my layout layout will be default
and what do I need to do I want some
content whoops some content and then
we're gonna do this as a ul so I'm gonna
this is going to work for that my home
page anyway my posts so we're gonna do
this as a unordered list okay so now we
get to use a little bit of logic here so
for post in site posts so this is gonna
loop through let's go so going look it's
gonna go into my posts folder so site
post it's gonna go into post it's gonna
loop through them and for every post
that it finds it should be creating
something that looks like that so for
every time for every post that it finds
list item a ref is equal to oh maybe
that's why my image wasn't working I'll
try that after so the href should be the
post URL right and then the post title
will actually go here which makes sense
post title so whenever it's going to
automatically get the URL for it and put
it as the link here and it's
automatically getting it the title for
it and be what I can click on
now this is having me also bringing the
dates but I don't actually want to ring
the dates I want to bring in the
description and I don't know if this is
gonna work but I'm gonna try it out so
they do that still inside the Li so
let's do it like this so I can really
see what's going on they do it as ass
pants will do span span class equals
post description let's do the script
like that and in here I'm gonna do so
again I don't know if this is gonna work
but I'm post description and I'm
assuming it's gonna pull in this here
that's my guess and that's what I want
it to do hi Ravi I'm doing good I hope
you're doing good - how you doing um Oh
vote compiling images with paragraph
tags Thank You Youssef hopefully it
works I'll check that in a second so
that should do and I'd have to end so
spam Li and after that I have to end my
for loop so I'm gonna open this up and
percentage symbol so let's just do that
again
and so then n4 so start the loop here
and then we're ending the loop here so
for every post that it finds that I've
created it will link to the post it will
do that um I also need a blog dat
markdown and specify the home layout Oh
cuz I have my home layout okay so this
isn't exactly what I want but we're
gonna follow this for the moment and
then I'll modify it to fit how I want
everything to work so let's come in and
make a new where am I putting this in
the home layout oh create a file called
blog MD in the root directory Oh in the
root directory so it doesn't go anywhere
new file blog markdown and it needs so
I'm going to be changing this title blog
and layout is home
and do I need in this case contents of
the blog we pushed into the content
let's just put this is some generic
content and actually I'm gonna copy this
and on my index okay
let's take all of this is that the blog
post I already created so I'm gonna copy
this copy this into here let's make a
new one a new file 20 18 0 to 17 my
second post MD post that in here because
I don't want to lose it then copy this
paste it in here save and ok so we got
the blog here I don't have a description
so I'd have to bring my description
underneath you can see that the list is
this is some generic content is working
we can see that the content is coming
here which I wouldn't actually want any
of this good or actually no I do I want
this to be a late no I want let's just
say a recent blog posts so that there we
go so recent blog posts and then my ul
is coming here it's not styled the way I
wanted to and the grid is breaking
everything but at least it's working so
if I click on this it will bring me to
my second post which is having nothing
right now
oddly my first post my first post is
working so that's good and this is my
very first post
why is my second post not working that's
interesting
the layout of default should work right
the layout is default this is okay oh
there we go it is working that was weird
I just saved it and refreshed and there
we go so good this is more of what we
want things to look like right so it's
getting there
so let's go back to my index page now I
don't need you I'll leave that there for
now so home this is my home now why does
home need a layout is what I don't get
because this is a layout that's kind of
what if I take this off what happens
let's go back to my well that's what
happens it breaks everything oh I get it
I get it so what's happening is it's
this is just placing the content in and
then it's using the default for the
layout aha okay that's good because I
want to use default as my layout sort of
but I just want to make a change to this
to yeah okay good good that's gonna make
my life easier because I want to keep
everything the same I just want to add
something different in the middle so
there's two different things I'm gonna
make I'm just gonna duplicate this one
can i duplicate i can just duplicate can
i duplicate up here collapse no copy
paste okay good so let's just change the
rename this one this is my third third
let's change the date on this one
to the 18th and I want one more so we'll
copy you paste you and the reason I'm
doing this is because I only want the
home page to display three of them this
is my four that's fun
save that okay and let's go back to my
blog where on my blog okay so you can
see the descriptions are also they are
coming in here which is perfect that's
what I want them to be doing so what I
want to be happening if we come and look
back at my design is I want my homepage
to have this at the top which we have so
I just have to it let's go back to the
index so this title shouldn't be blocked
this should be my awesome blog and this
should be my description just grip the
shin like that oops
space space okay so then I get my
description then what I want is recent
my most recent so I want first to be the
most recent post and I only want the
most recent post to appear here so I'm
not sure no so I think that should
actually come to here and this yeah so
my home is so I have my content there so
what I'm gonna do first is here I'm
going to do h2 my most recent not my
mode most recent post now I want to use
this so I'm going to leave that there
then we're gonna come down here and have
a we want this area down at the bottom
so what we're gonna do for that is it's
quiet again the the the chat let's if
you have any questions please don't be
shy and let me know if the stream is
working better now hopefully it is so
down over here we want this area so
that's going to get its own div so
that's me
you know what that would be more of a
section section older posts and in there
we're gonna have who this might be
trickier than I thought I'm gonna start
just with this do I even need I don't
need any content to be brought in all I
need is this and this because I don't
have any like content that I'm writing
the homepage should just be populated
with all of that stuff automatically so
it's in the same most recent post I want
only the most recent one then I want
some older ones here and this I don't
need that three times that should just
be once so section so it's not as hard
as I thought H 2 older posts will call
it now I just need to figure out how to
actually do that refresh ok and the
layout will fix up in a second so what I
want now is let's go back to here so all
this I'm gonna skip the roof for loops
this is what I want
so for posts in site and you can also do
like by category which is cool and I
don't think I'm gonna have time but I
might look at this and if I get really
into Jekyll I'll I'll do some more stuff
on it at one point so what we could do
is for posts in posts space limit one so
that means on my home page we should we
get one so only one of them is coming
through so only the most recent one is
here and then in my older posts right
now it's just listing everything oh one
two three
why do I leave is it automatically let's
just make a couple more posts and my
first so my fourth post should be that
one so let's just change number four
whoops four four four and I'm gonna make
one more copy paste rename and five and
we'll just call this five so I can keep
track of what's going on so it's not
really working is it oh five my first
five four see this shouldn't this isn't
my most recent oh the dates are all this
my third let's change the date on these
to rename it is probably coming in let's
do this one as if it's on the 20th and
we'll rename number four to be on the
19th save all of that I just hmm oh
because those dates haven't come so it's
not using them yet interesting okay
today's the 17th rename whoops cancel
there might be a better way to rename
stuff seventeenth let's just do this one
that should be zero one seventeen the
second post can be from the 10th the
third post rename the eleventh and the
fourth post the fourth post rename the
fourth post rename the fifteenth
five five four yeah so they're going in
order that they've been created so I
want to limit I thought I'd limited that
one already close close close close
they're not oh I didn't limit this so
this one for posting posts I want to do
a limit three on that one now the only
problem is I have 5 here and 5 here so
I'd rather it's 5 and then 4 3 2 over
there right yeah it's the thanks Simon
for mentioning that I didn't see it
until just after but yeah I thought it
always compiled them and you actually
had to do like I thought there's like a
flag or something you could add to the
file name or to the this thing up here
to say that it shouldn't be published
yet or maybe that's just for drafts but
it's pretty smart that that means you
can just like post date all your stuff
and have them automatically show up I
guess you probably have to recompile
though but that's still pretty cool ok
so now let's go see how I can does this
talk about how I can do it um for loops
and liquid certain properties are
available first or last iteration let's
see let's go look at this this looks
like what I want so I get the first the
last index oh so maybe the index would
it be able for in collection front page
products for loop index new products oh
no that's not what I want that's not
what I want returns the current index of
the loop no
if collection frontpage products
contains four products this collection
has yeah that's okay hmm yeah for loop
object can only be used with four tags
for first four index last lymph returns
true if the first iteration if it's the
first iteration loop false if not that's
not what I want I have a feeling the
logic on this is a little bit it's
probably in here and I'm just returns
the current index of the for loop
starting at one
whatever people do use that no because I
don't want it's not quite what I want
not quite what I'm after maybe it is but
I don't think that's what I'm after
there must be a way to do what I want
let's fix my layout and I'll come back
to the Jekyll stuff in a second
so I think this gives you a good idea of
what Jekyll can actually be used for so
I can see here that you know we're
bringing in what would normally be
dynamic content things we'd want to be
using PHP for I've been a little bit all
over the place in creating it so I will
do a bit of a rundown on how it's all
working after let's save this save save
I don't want to break anything yet and
let's go back to my site because I want
to actually make it look good for loop -
lost can I do - last I'll look that up
in a second let's go look at that now
oops that's not what I wanted sorry did
you do I wanted this was that mentioned
in this thing - lost limit I just do
that here for loop see even the limit
thing like they mention the the limit
property let's go look here this might
be what I actually wanted to look at I
can create breaks cause the loop to stop
ordering when it encounters the break
tag oh I could start I could do for I in
so I could do for the post in site posts
that's sort of what I'm doing
oh the index - for loop last
oh we can offset haha I think that would
ya I think you've got the right idea
there assignment but here let's offset
to so if I do limit three offset one or
we can even do a range
oh cool we can do a range so at the
range I just take this all into a range
then in for post insight posts for I in
three to five oh no that won't work
we'll try the offset if ever a one two
three four five six
dah-dah-dah in array offset to so if I
just do offset one five four yeah that
worked cool so we can just off that
makes it easier we can just offset it by
one super so that worked and now we can
actually make this look a little bit
better so let's go and open up my sass
file again not in the site one I want my
assets okay so how can I actually get
this to look the way I want it to so
I've done this for my paragraphs and I'm
gonna have to do this also for paragraph
each one eighty two that's working why
isn't that one working and my UL I
probably should have given why are these
going over here oh that has its own div
that's right so this is working and then
my div over there so that was a what do
they call it older posts not very
original older posts so my section older
posts will get background of color black
and then the grid column one over nine
so it goes from one side of the page to
the other let's give that a bit of
padding padding what did I use on the
other ones to M zero we'll stick with
the same one for now
color on all of it should be white color
wait I'll fix those links up and
everything in a second my h2 actually
title or whatever my CSS here is really
messy font family should be a fun family
serif sauce serif save okay so what I'm
gonna do down here which is I think the
most interesting part of what I'm doing
with the grid maybe is I'm gonna say
that older posts is display grid and I
wanted to use the same grid I'm using
everywhere else so what I can do
actually let's take this margin top off
here and the margin I'm gonna leave it
like that for now the grid gap that
stinks
mmm I might have to change things up a
little then I how I'd find it but older
posts
I'll give this the margin top though for
now margin top of for M and I just
realized because of the layout anyway
we'll see what happens so what I want to
do here is display grid and I'm gonna do
grid template columns inherit we don't
have sub grids and sub grids would be
the best part I'd want to use sub grids
but I can't use sub grids because of and
actually I don't need this to be on here
I can't use the sub grids because the
they don't they don't work yet they
don't exist oh I didn't eat that up
there whoops
hopefully they're gonna come with the
second specification of CSS grid but
right now we don't have the second
specification yet so what I want to do
is on my older posts all right H - let's
just do text transform upper case and
this is like super messy it's
embarrassing my organization here so
please don't copy the organization that
I'm doing and actually let's turn my
inspect back on because I want to turn
my grid
on so because I'm using the inherit grid
template columns it's the exact same
ones that are coming into here except it
doesn't seem to be exactly the same
older posts if I turn this grid the two
grids should overlap Oh cuz I don't have
my grid gap grid gap inherit there we go
okay so oh my line numbers where else
yeah whoops back so what this is doing
is its inheriting the template from the
body and it's inheriting the gap from
the body so the grid in here is exactly
the same as the grid I was using there
so I can use all the same numbers and
lay things out on the same grid the only
problem is my older posts are not really
set up properly here because they're all
lining up based on this and I don't want
to be doing that so I don't know this is
best practice either and maybe they
should get their own classes and stuff
like that might be a better way of doing
it but I'm gonna do it like this so the
h2 will get a grid column I'm just gonna
make it bigger to over eight because I
want it to start quote here instead my
UL will actually get the same thing so
the UL inside of older posts will be
starting over here my UL also needs
actually all that you else will get this
so let's come out to here all my you
ELLs will get margin:0 padding:0
list-style:none because I don't want to
have any of those dots on them
hi the 4-minute process hope things are
going well how you doing
yeah the sub grids I don't know keep
hearing what sub grids I don't know when
they're actually gonna be implemented
I think everyone actually wanted them
the browser people said it's hard from
what I understood of the whole thing
because there's some things that would
be nice to have but
you know the browser people who do it
have limited resources and can only
implement certain things at a certain
pace and all of that so I don't blame
them either I mean this works
you just have to inherit some stuff now
it doesn't 100% work if it was like a
smaller grid inside but because it's
taking up the full width of the screen
so it's the same width as my body the
columns will line up perfectly if it
wasn't the same width I don't know if it
would work the same as the Sun grid
excuse me um shouldn't be drinking
bubbly water while I'm doing this um
okay so now I want each of these so I'm
gonna say my actually I want my my you
ELLs aren't to overrate
just my h2 and I want my UL to be grid
column span - does that work sort of or
not quite what I want to do um I want
them just oh wait no it's I was right
sorry
you will that's fine save that and my
list item is grid grid column oh is this
you mean all this won't work oh no I
didn't think of that I wasn't actually
planning on making these with you ELLs
either right I was planning on doing
them do they have to be you else cuz
they're nested inside do I give my ah
come on I was following this and it is
it doesn't make sense that is sort of a
list of blog posts so it's not a
terrible idea
the only hmm I'm not sure if I'm going
to do it like that what if I did instead
of this if I didn't have the UL here and
I just did this as a div class equals
blog post
clothes blog post and I say that that
just broke everything but that's okay so
I don't need this ul here anymore this
one I could even take her to vul
probably too so then my blog post
jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù see it's still not
really gonna work maybe it will work
let's just see what happens blog post
see because they want to start there but
what if I just did grid column span -
it's gonna screw things up a little bit
I'm still getting that one second
inspect
that's interesting that it's giving me
it's not doing what I thought it would
do one second blog post because
everything's in one blog post huh why is
everything in one block oh my goodness
yeah it's a little better so then other
spanning two now this again I was
copying what Jekyll was suggesting that
I do for my blog posts so I had the link
from my title and then a spam but what
if I change the span to a paragraph that
just makes my life easier right okay
the only thing is I don't want anything
in that first one I didn't want to have
to make a container the whole idea with
this is I wouldn't have to do a
container and now I think or I could
okay maybe we could still do this blog
post and then blog post first of type
grid column to start to did that work
add two grid column is it not grid
if I do it like that so I have to do a
grade column to and just do to spend to
can't die I haven't done the grid in a
while guys that didn't work grid to over
four not three four there is even five
no two before so there we go cool that
does work so I can't do it without it
cool cool cool the only problem is this
gap and that's coming cuz I have that
this space is because I used grid gaps
on my rows as well as my columns to try
something but it didn't really work the
way I wanted it to only because of this
this is the only thing that wood is
really causing an issue a blog post
should I change the color of these links
probably how did I do it in my layout I
the title is big like that okay I'm
gonna had to read more button will add
the read more button as well yeah I
could have the UL display as grid and
that would work as well but then I'd
have to give it its own it I'd have to
give the UL its own grid that's
different from everything else and just
and that really make a lot more sense
than what I'm doing right now to be
honest I'm just seeing how much I can
push it with using one grid and just
inheriting it everywhere and that's why
I really wanted you know if I could just
turn off my margins on everything and
have the grid gap be my margins it would
sort of create a nice vertical rhythm on
stuff too
but that didn't really work the way I
hoped it would because of this silly
thing and I could put a you know I could
be really lazy and to say margin-top
negative one and would that work yeah
but then well now I have a space on the
bottom so maybe that wouldn't work
the margin for my good gap my grid cap
is set whereas my grid gap all the way
on the body so I did one m4 let's turn
my grid on so it's one M this way so
it's just creating the spacing between
everything that way as one m and my
spacing between columns is 2 and the
main reason it's 2 is because I wanted
to make sure there was enough room
between these ones here so let's go and
style my blog title which would be this
one class equals blog title and let's
add in a button at the bottom a class
equals blog link this should be blog
title the link will be read more and the
href for it will be the same as this
copy that paste that here save let's
just see how that looks read more read
more read more good so if I come back to
here I don't need to be in older posts I
want this to be everywhere oh man I'm so
ashamed if this file let's keep going
for time sake uh whatever
I said what time did I start this ed has
it been 2 hours holy moly got one more
hour and me at the most I have a bunch
of other stuff that I want to be doing
today too
so what can we do here my blah oh I have
my blog post there oh that's all an
older post though ok so let's just do
blog post no it's just okay blog title
font family is a fun family font family
serif saw serif font size should be
bigger
I don't know to em I have all this in my
Styles but we'll just I'm not that looks
pretty good color should be color white
the text declaration should be none the
colors white text decoration is none
text transform upper upper case text
declaration declaration none and line
height of like a one ish
I guess because that distance looks
really big that looks pretty good
these should definitely have a hover on
them so we'll do in and hover and what
do we do for my hover I didn't really
think of that let's just change the
opacity opacity of like 0.8 and here
we'll do a transition of opacity these
out 200 milliseconds make that a little
bit more obvious point 6 I guess and
that should be good that's turn off the
grid cuz it yeah I think that makes it
pretty obvious that you can click on
them and now my buttons so my blog they
call the blog button blog link that
makes a lot of sense
display:inline-block padding
mine I could I should have made a mix in
I'm not making a mix in now though font
family font size line height color text
decoration I need a lot of this stuff
pasted all that in there I don't need
the line height necessarily this is
going to be probably not changed font
family is we need to background on their
background of color pink
let's see how that looks way too big
point seven two point four I have a
tendency with my buttons if ever you're
curious about styling of using about
this ratio all the time yeah with the
top looks bigger than the bottom because
this font isn't it yeah why is it that's
weird I didn't know I could do that it's
text why is it taking it like that's so
weird
okay is that a Firefox thing maybe it's
a Firefox thing it's interesting okay
anyway so read more that's ok let's just
give it a margin top on it and we'll
leave it like that margin top 1m and we
should give it a hover and hover
background let's just change the opacity
to opacity 0.6 it's not I wouldn't
necessarily want to actually change the
opacity but it's dimming out instead of
getting brighter
so I find it for the this it doesn't
bother me for the button it's kind of
weird but just for the sake of brevity
I'm gonna keep it like that
yeah let me just check one they hope
snot what I wanted to be doing again but
that's okay what else
see now I did that for here so let's
come back to my home and each to my
recent posts I'm gonna just copy that
and paste
oh that shouldn't be white did I say
that the color should be white on those
a linear gradient on my buttons Yusef we
could put a linear gradient on them I
don't have another variable that might
work too well um you try it out though
why not
we're here to play around color pink so
background that's on my link so we could
do a background is a linear gradient
will do my color pink actually one thing
that you can definitely do with these in
general I find linear gradients work
really well when there are subtle
changes so I could do then like an RGBA
of or not even RGB 8 let's do it mix it
is mix so I can do like mix color pink
with a little I don't know oh man I
forgot how this works actually I'm gonna
be making a video on it really soon I
don't use it often enough mix this is a
SAS thing all the weight okay yeah I had
ripped this wrote the script for this
not long ago I think me something I'm
filming today later on for my SAS course
if you're curious there's no link down
below in the description so I want my
color pink and I want to mix it with
some this color which was my color black
so my second color will be a 50% mix of
those two except it's not working did I
get I should be able to do that I'm
getting an error it doesn't like
something I'm doing oh come on that's
about or is it I'm pretty sure they're
comma-separated when you mix yeah let's
just take the mix off for a second and
just put black here whoops just to make
sure okay so that's working so why can't
I mix yeah see color color and weight
and the weight is optional so let's just
undo undo undo undo undo undo
do I not have a yeah I have a color
black what if I just put black here I
just want to see if this is sad is that
Jekyll's let me just make this bigger
this because my font size on its big I
don't line 69 969 it's not line 16 oh I
am missing oh that was me I was just
missing a thing so there I can mix my
color pink with the black but I want to
mix it with my color black so that will
give me something like that so it's
mixing my pink color with this color so
it's a bit more subtle and then if I
want I could do like 70 percent if I
remember right it's gonna be 70 percent
pink and 20 or 30% black so if I'd made
this 10 it would be 10 percent pink and
90 percent black and if I make it 70
it's more pink you know it's mixing 70
percent pink 30 percent of this black
color together and let's just do this at
90 degrees because I think it'll look
nicer
oh whoops that doesn't go here though
that goes all the way here there we go
so it it goes sideways instead of up and
down
oh not sure I like that actually I'll do
it 45 mm I'll leave it the original way
we'll leave it like that I think that
actually looks better so yeah cool a
little sass trick there if you didn't
know you can mix colors together it's
always two colors though I don't think
you can do more than two but you could I
guess mix and mix inside a mix that
would work so this is white and it
shouldn't be white
that was my blog title that just means I
need to come into older posts come
wonder if I should just use blog title
has a color of inherit actually so it
inherits the color from whatever it's
inside of there we go that worked so if
it's here and the color is set to black
there to inherit that color and over
here it will inherit the color of
whatever it has here perfect good good
good I'm happy with that and actually
that means here instead of doing opacity
I'll do my background instead and the
background will just change to color
pink I don't know if that'll be too
subtle though yeah you can definitely
see it oh it's flashing Oh cuz you go
for my linear gradient to not a linear
gradient no never mind or actually what
if I did
color pink to color think so it's still
linear gradient yeah that works we could
do that for my buttons so they sort of
pop a little bit when you hover on them
cool I think that worked good good good
I'm happy with that so I'm actually kind
of happy with how this is working out
right now it should be somewhat
responsive it's gonna break it really
small sizes but it should be somewhat
responsive the min/max that I said on it
we can get down pretty small it'll work
at large sizes so that's pretty good now
the one thing we need to fix is that
image that wasn't working that was on my
first post that I did
here when my image wasn't coming in and
yousuf you'd shared a link so let's go
check that out let's see what happens
here
stack overflow our good friend image
yeah that will work
oh I just have to wrap it in a name
paragraph tag that seriously what I was
doing like well okay
my that's probably this one second let's
try this one so here if I put this in a
paragraph save that and then we have to
go find that page whoops that wasn't
this one that's my second
that was my second I didn't really read
this I'm really skimming oh I should
have looked at the answer not the
question a here's an example ba ba bla I
hope
although I hope I don't have to do that
for I have a simple solution it's just
not to use markdown then
no it's still screwing things up here
for me um except I don't want this to I
can put this back to a relative path
okay so let me just check this out again
inspect but how's that even doing like
how was marked down even getting this to
show up like this
tada
the main reason I'm worrying about this
at all is because I need a class so one
thing let's just try doing this as a
markdown image so I'm gonna keep this
here let's just see if I can get it to
work as a markdown image before I worry
about anything else so a markdown images
exclamation mark alt text here and then
I just wrap this in like that
I believe so if I save that I see my alt
text I don't get my image assets images
Mountain jpg is it not Mountain jpg site
assets oh I don't have my images really
how come it's not taking that file
folder I didn't look at this but what if
I just call it IMG and what if I rename
it now rename images but see I'm seeing
all alt text here but it doesn't even
look like a broken image but no it is
pop it see it's still wrapping it in a
paragraph which I don't want it cannot
load the image images Oh mountains that
would help this is actually in a load my
image okay so it is loading my image in
which is good the problem with all of
this is it's wrapped in a paragraph tag
and that's gonna screw me up because I
wanted to be able to break out of the
container by changing how my image is
laying out markdown why are you doing
this to me
what if I just no because if I even if I
took this space out it would put it as
inside of the previous paragraph right
yeah we just then it's like part of my
previous paragraph yeah then it's in
that block is it not possible to images
here's our inline reference that's fine
images here's our logo so inline style
that's fine
see now the one thing with this is I'm
gonna take this post let's just rename
this file dot HTML oh whoops
oh no okay I thought I broke everything
now the problem with that is I don't
have like everything I need to put
everything inside of paragraph tags
right but I'm pretty sure IMG SRC is
equal to my mountains how do I do text
wrap on here again
I forgot the shortcut for my text wrap
did add uh that's all okay there's my
image I am Canadian Simon good guess and
I just want to see okay so I think
that's gonna work so if I do just like
so you don't have to use markdown to use
Jekyll which is good because some of us
are more comfortable with with our HTML
and I wanted to do this as a bit of an
experiment in markdown because I do
think writing blog posts and markdown to
be easier so you don't have to worry
about putting your P tags and stuff but
if I can't add classes to images or
easily of images that aren't inside a
paragraph for the layout that I'm trying
to do now it wouldn't work which doesn't
mean anything for anything else okay so
my image isn't working but at least it's
there how many of this a class is equal
to and the class is equal to
and one cool thing I think I could
actually do source I'm wondering No
I'm gonna try in a minute but my let's
describe this like image wide so my
whole idea here was that I just go to
the bottom it's a big mess here anyway
image wide could be grid column to over
eight and I could have nice images that
are wider now with let's say max with
note width would have to be a hundred
percent because I don't want it to go
too far so there we go
so we get this sort of nice image that's
wider than the text now the one problem
with it is way too high so I'm actually
gonna give it a height height of say
thirty viewport height now as you all
know that will smoosh my image and it
will look like poop which I don't want
happening so we can use the awesome
object fit don't use object fit in
production it has pretty crappy browser
support but we lets us set the width and
height on the image itself and then just
like background image cover you can do
that and it it works really well I wish
I could cook dinner in ten minutes my
dinners are usually actually tonight's
will be nice and easy because there's no
kids at home my dinners can be quite
long I think you can rewind actually I'm
pretty sure the settings for the thing
we're DVR or whatever so you can rewind
stuff so I can have a wide image like
that and yeah I like this to John with
without having the container I just
don't know if I'd make a full site like
this this the whole idea here is let's
experiment with the grid and see if I
can make it work without a container and
all of that and the fact that I can is
pretty cool I'm just using one fr so
it's automatically just going to adjust
right like
I don't even have to really worry I
could make it like a min/max of like 10
pixels 1fr maybe on the two sides just
so like there is a minimum so it
wouldn't make if this gets smaller
smaller smaller at one point you know
what it's just working that's great I'm
pretty happy with that so yeah there's
no container here it's all just set on
the body this is one of the first things
I thought of but I never actually tried
playing around or even here you can see
it is actually touching I don't have it
Blee great up there yeah sounds better
than when I'm gonna be having tonight
I don't know I'm having leftovers
tonight actually probably whatever is in
the fridge yeah this video will be
available in the future Simon I'm I was
thinking of editing it but it's gonna be
so long I don't know if I'll edit it and
I know the stream was really bad at the
beginning so I'm hoping the recording on
my computer isn't as bad but it might be
that you have to deal with a crappy
stream at the beginning it won't be
available immediately because I've set
it to private when it saves the file but
it'll be available eventually probably
within a week John the only reason you
cannot use it is the grid support and
therefore flex fallback wouldn't be as
good yeah if I was doing a personal site
I'm thinking of redoing my own site just
using grid because anyone who's visiting
my site right now since the only really
coming from his YouTube they're probably
on up-to-date they're probably on
up-to-date browsers so you know they
would be up-to-date and it would work so
I'm not too worried about it but for a
client I wouldn't use it and yeah
because then you'd need the extra markup
anyway for the Flex box because you need
your containers and everything so yeah
but eventually yes sadly I wish object
fit you can maybe a background image
actually that's good can I use and I use
com it used to not be good but that was
like a few months ago you never know I
remember it not being the best though
object
and I'm it's not terrible actually
well 92% that's pretty good globally on
and that's just partial support an edge
refers to object that only supporting
image working I've only ever used it in
an image so as long as you don't need
Internet Explorer 11 you're good
yeah that sucks I don't know why
actually edge support is growing it's at
one point one compared to 2% for IE so
that's a good sign so almost almost both
of them are so miniscule but everything
else is supporting it and it's only on
images but for us that's fine all right
so I don't know what else I want to do
with this I probably make that a link to
the top so I'm gonna go back all right
here I actually one more thing I wanted
to do I did want to be able to put a
small image in as well so here at the
end I did want to be able to do an image
class equals this image it's small or
normal we call it small Searcy and I'm
just gonna copy this and oh I'm gonna
try another thing with markdown here in
a second I'm not with markdown with
Jekyll because I think it could be cool
assets images I forget what my other
image was called Road default domain so
here the idea would be I could have the
exact same thing for my image small
but this would just be like a three over
seven then anyway you see where the
image would be what did I do wrong there
didn't I just look at it and see that it
was called Road JPEG this is in sight
images Road JPEG I can't
I have no source I mean I have no source
oh can I have to rest are sees there we
go okay so there we go and then I could
have my smaller images as well so you do
wide images and ones that fit so I think
that's that's kind of neat and fun and
cool yeah so I think that would be good
and
Yussef does which work outside of a PITA
the image can't be in a P tag which is
why I'm not in markdown anymore just
because in the markdown and it was
causing more of a trouble it was placing
it in a paragraph and because I wanted
on the grid if it's in the paragraph
it's not on the grid anymore yeah kind
of annoying and I keep forgetting I can
look here and you guys can see me I'm
not used to that so okay so that's good
so one thing I want to see if I can do
is actually up here right my images so
say I said like image mountain with this
I could I'd then just like take this I
would have here and write it up here and
then here right image no Tim now would
that work oh that's so cool oh no it
didn't work
image small I got it it just didn't get
why is there a before on my image what
image class image small and then what I
have to do SRC is equal to can I do I'm
just stick whoops no space I'm just
experimenting here I want to see if I
can do stuff like this with markdown
inspect so there's my image SRC is
nothing
so then could I just do this and no it
doesn't work I was hoping I could just
like invent something here and use it
down here
oh wait I'd have to do page right page
dot how cool that worked so if I go back
to how it was before can I still do page
dot ah damn why not
no cuz it's bringing in this is our C
it's bringing in whatever I had up there
okay so I can't do that
mmm maybe not as useful but it means I
can I on did it I can put things up here
and then use them down below in other
ways
so that is good to know that's kind of
cool but it's not working the way I want
it to just because the relative URL just
does makes us so much easier because
again right now because it's the
relative URL this is my second blog post
but my blog post is in a posts folder
you know so you're 2018 so it's getting
put inside of 2018 and then in 2018 it's
getting put in a month folder and then
in the month folder it's getting placed
in the day folder and so like the the
final actual thing to make this work if
we inspect element on this oh well it's
just showing it me like oh right just
never mind it's just going to the root
folder anyway mm-hmm anyway it's fine
maybe I don't really need that relative
link then if I did it like this it would
break things right and I in the wrong
file
I hope not anyway no maybe what I was
saying was completely wrong let me just
see here John I use graded recent
project oh yeah I'm not sure
yeah John the only way I could get the
images to work was by changing this over
to an HTML document instead of a
markdown document I got the images
working in the markdown document but
they're placed inside of it would be
like key and then close be here so it's
wrapping the image in a paragraph and
then if I save that it won't let me
escape my boundaries of the paragraph
because the paragraph is on the grid
there's probably ways that I could
actually get it to break out there are
ways I can get it to break out actually
but I like this for simplicity sake yeah
so that's that I want to link my logo at
the top so for that I'm gonna go over to
my default and where was my logo so
here's my logo all the way at the top so
that should be wrapped in an a href and
I don't know where I want that to go yet
so I have to think about this a little
bit and then after I do this I'm gonna
sort of figure out and explain Jekyll a
little more now that I've played around
with it for two and half hours and I
think I understand it a bit more than I
did before even though I'm far from an
expert so this should just link to is
there a way just to like choose home I
mean it's my home so this should just be
like index right like that probably so
if I click on this it should always on
all my pages now there we go
good so it isn't working and it's doing
it on all my pages so again the
advantage of Jekyll over just writing
and the Jekyll is not the only one
there's lots of static site generators
but it's all about just being able to
make the change once and it's going
everywhere so my footer down here you
know this is a pretty crappy footer that
I put in so if I go and find my default
layout where I have my footer you know
you come in here
cop whoops copy this paste paste save I
have my three there but my three lines
are on all my pages already so a lot
like using PHP on something but without
the need of a database or anything like
that and server-side stuff going on it's
all static sites that this is generating
on the fly so when you look in your site
folder all of the folders and files and
everything have been automatically
created for you which is really really
cool and here the plan I'm going to
delete this and I'm gonna rename it to
have an underscore in the front so any
underscore thing in your main folder is
ignored
so layouts posts SAS site all these
things are automatically ignored my SAS
is being automatically done once I
finally set it up properly it was
automatically being compiled so that's
nice you don't have to set up anything
the live reloading is also automatic
which is really really cool and handy
yeah I am I wish the markdown the images
again the images are fine and I probably
I don't know if I'd actually have a
layout like this in the real world but
just with what I'm doing now I think
that I'm wondering I think markdown
would be fine for most people most of
the time even just to bring in the
images and once you get used to how
markdown works
I think it's adding class names and
markdowns a bit of a pain to though if
you need to use class names on a lot of
stuff markdown you but with Jack ability
to save it as an HTML file you can work
on that too it uses both of them
okay so um I think I've done everything
I want to do and hi-tech knob welcome to
the live stream I'm trying to think of
what else I'd want to do hmm
for this does anyone have any
suggestions any questions on things
you'd like me to see and try to do and
figure out I'd be glad to try them cuz
let me just go look at my design you're
more or less I need it I guess my link
colors could be fixed and I'm not I'm
not refractory all this code I think
what I will do though is eventually do a
video series on the very basics of
Jekyll I don't know Jacko well enough to
do an in-depth series on it because you
can see my configuration file has one
little thing in here and normally you
have you can do a lot more with your
configuration file yeah the
configuration not yeah Mel's not doing
very much right now as well as my what
else can we do here it's the only one I
think would need more attention I can go
back and actually let's go look here I
didn't set up a navigation but that I'm
not going to do now the includes you've
been doing so again you can include
sidebars we can include other stuff
added uh site map I'm not worried about
yeah so if you do have a thing just
watch out if you're installing Jekyll
it's gonna want to install with like a
predefined theme and everything if you
just follow the the normal home stuff
here install issues what are the issue
what are the issues with Jekyll
installations on most toasts there
shouldn't be any I think get hot wait I
guess the only one I've never actually
done it but I know with github pages
it's it's all done you can you can
easily do it and it's free which is
pretty awesome
if you've used github pages another one
that it would work really well with is
natalja fly and that love fly is what I
use for my website very similar to
github pages the only difference is you
don't actually need to have a github
account I'm not logged in I don't know
second-degree me right in you do I think
it is so this it automatically generate
things so if you have it linked in the
same with github if you push a change it
automatically generates it on the fly
and it's done same thing here if I
update my github so you can see this is
a deploys from github so if I push a new
change my master branch that is pushed
live and if I was using Jekyll it would
work from what I understand without any
issues because it's all static files
it's just HTML CSS files there's no
there's nothing else going on it's
generating the pages and then it's
getting uploaded is the way I understand
it so it doesn't actually cause any
issues along the way
yeah it's relatively easy to set up for
both of them alright that look like
super easy but they're both pretty easy
to set up yes I mean I'll definitely do
one at one point I do have a lot of
other videos to be doing but now that
Jekyll is a lot easier than I thought it
would be the hardest thing is if you're
on a PC is getting it running since
that run it uses Ruby so the
installation of it's a bit of a pain in
the butt sucks
it took me a while to do and sorry
missing open a drink really thirsty John
I have a question if there was for
personal reasons how would you push the
website to your host yeah I mean I just
would be saving the file here and
actually because I'm using a BS code it
has the built-in github integration
I literally just here there's nothing
but if I had my if it was set up with it
I push a little thing here push and it
pushes the changes to the branch that
I'm on and if it was the master branch
then my home website would be updated I
wouldn't have to do anything else it's
just done anytime I'd make a change from
a master branch either if you're using
github pages net laughs I and I think
there's a few others that do it as well
static site hosts and they're all free
they have paid I know net Liffe I as
paid stuff for the more advanced stuff
but yeah I pushed him a master and and
the changes are live which is really
cool and it's scary how fast it is like
I literally I push I go to my website
and it's it's there so it's it's really
really handy and nice I'm the only thing
I have to pay for is my domain name it's
free to link if you have your URL you
can link to your URL set up by my email
has to go through so there's a few
configuration things I had to do but
overall pretty easy to do
Yussef oh that's not a dumb question um
I don't think you can use a radio
radiant as a drop down but as a drop
shadow type of thing sorry but you know
what all my buttons I like doing stuff
like this where's my website let's add a
little gradient on this you can see
something and I might have actually been
on dev tips when I first learned this
but maybe somewhere else it was on a
youtube channel somewhere a few years
ago probably let's go find my button
button button button button blog link
right yes okay so on my blog link let's
add a box shadow of say zero zero 10
pixel blur zero spread and our GBA I'll
use my color black at like 0.5 just to
make sure we can see it let's see how
this looks so actually let's just make
this one so we can really see what's
going on so we can see that the shadow
is showing up there and right now it's
at a 10 pixel so it's a spread let's
make that a little bigger again I'm
exaggerating this then what I would
really do and I'm gonna move it down so
I'm gonna do say 20 pixels here so it's
underneath but I'm gonna change the
spread so spread if I made this 20
pixels it means whoops it means it's
gonna go 20 pixels and then start the
blur but instead of doing 20 there I'll
do negative 20 to pull it inwards a
little bit maybe it will do a bit less
so it's not perfect but it does give
sort of like a shape there it makes it
look like the buttons floating a little
bit more so it's not a circular gradient
but it may be even more realistic
because it sort of looks like it's
coming this way like the light is behind
it or something and then even on the
blur on that blur on the hover we could
take my box shadow
and say that this changes to minus five
I'll just make it like I'm gonna make it
bigger of course it's not working I'm
missing this which is why it's not
working so minus five here it'd probably
be enough way too much minus 10 my
transition I'll just transition all so
oh why do I put my transition there
sorry guys and you can see it sort of
moves in and out and you could also do a
trend transform translate why negative
ten pixels let's say and just to make
sure it transitions properly this would
just be at zero so it moves up and
that's probably too much negative five
so it looks like it's moving up in the
shadows you'd have to play with the
numbers a little bit but the shadow sort
of grows as it moves up or you could
have the shadow shrink whatever makes
more sense negative 30 what's that make
more sense that's too much I don't know
yeah I don't know whatever makes more
sense something's not looking right to
me right now but you could use you could
sort of do that to get like different
it's not really a different shape but
it's the shadow is hiding underneath a
little bit Tecna
what advice will you give to a beginner
web dev I some time of issue deciding
what framework to use frameworks don't
use a framework if you're just learning
try not to use them once you're really
comfortable with what you're doing then
pick a framework it depends so much this
different frameworks have different
benefits to them bootstrap has the
benefit of
everybody's using it already apparently
it's just really popular foundation has
the advantage of having amazing
documentation and then a lot of the
smaller ones have the advantage of just
being smaller and lighter weight and
sometimes a little bit simpler to use I
don't know if there's a right or wrong
answer to which framework you might want
to use they can speed things up but they
can also slow you down and they can
prevent you from becoming better if
you're using them as a crutch because
you're not super comfortable with how to
do it without the framework sometimes
they you know they they limit what you
can actually do whereas if you know it
really well and you're using the
framework just to speed you up then it's
a completely different story because you
can make the framework really do what
you want it to Tyler yeah it was from
dev tips a it was a yeah I don't
remember exactly how the way like he had
the button moving around but yeah it was
it was a good one
so not really a gradient linear or
radial gradient but hopefully that gives
you a bit of an idea of something you
could play around with there Yusef Peter
what about sass what about what about
what about fast about learning sass and
videos on sass I will be having some
videos on it I will be having videos on
sass at one point but I'm currently
making a premium course there's a oh
there won't be a link to it in the
description of this video but all my
other videos have a link to it it's not
ready yet it's in development today this
afternoon I will be making recording a
whole bunch for that actually once I'm
finished with this and yeah that's going
to be there but when it's released I'm
also going to have some a bunch of free
videos as well on at least the basics of
sass and then the course itself will be
more about the in depth crazy fun things
you can do with it and workflows and all
of that stuff if that's what you're
asking about if you have any other
questions what's ask feel free though
yeah the chat is picking up just as I
was planning on logging off so I'm gonna
stay on just for a little bit longer but
not for too much longer
because I do have all those videos to be
making and I need to stop talking at one
point my voices
how do those guys who stream all day do
it I talk in the classroom all day too
but I could get breaks there yeah Tyler
Travis from dev tips is working at at
Google and I don't know if it's because
of that that he stopped or not I know
that in his hiatus I don't think was
supposed to be this long based on the
videos that are coming out on his
channel now I think he plans on coming
back which would be amazing he's a big
part of why I started doing these and
how I a lot of what I learned and and
stuff so I'd really be cool if he if he
got back onto YouTube but I completely
understand if he doesn't it is a lot of
work just a weekly video is a surprising
amount of work yeah and with I know he
has a family and a probably very job
that takes a lot of energy from him so
but I would be very much looking forward
to seeing if he got back on YouTube
Tyler for the BIM I love the BIM naming
convention now that I'm using it more
I don't default to his you can see with
some of these names but in general I've
been trying to use it more scuse me I
have been trying to use it more and for
me it makes sense I think any naming
convention is probably a good idea and I
find bem strikes a really nice balance
of not being over the top but just being
like logical and easy to use if some
random person just picked up my file
they could probably figure it out
whereas when you get into the atomic
stuff that's so broken down as something
in like bootstrap that uses it where
they're breaking it down they have like
you know and
0 &amp;amp; B 1 and B 2 and B 3 for their
margin-bottom spacing on a framework I
think that makes a lot of sense for a
site that people are working on if
you're building it from scratch I don't
know it it seems may be over the top I'd
prefer personally having my sass
variables for spacers and just playing
with those and applying them where I
need them instead of everything being a
class frameworks that make sense but for
so you know atomic going really far one
way personally I'm not a huge fan of it
BAM I find just strikes a nice balance
in names that make sense and and all of
that Allen had to get a job as a friend
in developer what do I need to know
minimum to get a job I've never worked
in the field I'm new in general HTML CSS
JavaScript I guess I've been teaching
for a while now and so maybe I'm out of
touch personally if I was hiring it'd be
a little different I'd rather someone's
really good at stuff there's a lot of
emphasis put on JavaScript these days
just because you know there's all the
frameworks or JavaScript with reactant
view and and angular and just being good
with JavaScript has a lot of benefits
but especially if you're new you
probably know CSS is an easy language to
understand and a hard language to master
and there's not enough people who really
know it's super well I'm always learning
new things about it and the depth of it
and sometimes the stupidity of it you
know is something that people take for
granted that oh it's easy to write so
the but you get a lot of people who
aren't super good at CSS that are better
at the other languages but I think a
base basic understanding at least of
JavaScript would really help you out
because I think most employers will be
looking for at least a general knowledge
of the three of them and then if you can
specialize in something you're gonna you
know from there
it probably would benefit even more and
by John take it easy I'm gonna be
logging off soon to you guys so if you
have any more questions hit me up soon
because if not I'm gonna have to get out
of here and take care of some other
stuff um looking at this let's just see
if there's any last things I can do I
wanted to check one thing too you can
always can have some questions I want to
look at but one thing here quickly on
the configuration file and some other
stuff I can do in here so I can include
stuff I can do my set destinations time
zones encoding is that it and my build
options build options so Auto
regeneration when files are modified so
we can turn off watching I don't want to
do that stuff with drafts unpublished
render posts that were marked as
unpublished so yeah you can mark things
is unpublished and they won't get
published so that's kind of cool limit
the amount of posts well that make sense
if you have tons of posts you don't want
it to be generating them every time I
guess no it's not too much stuff I
thought there'd be more stuff in here
and then the serve command options is
this where I saw the no that's not yeah
I thought there was more stuff I can do
in here so you don't really need a ton
of stuff in there that's interesting
oh yeah here you can modify some other
stuff but I'm not gonna get into that
right now
but yeah there's a bunch of stuff we can
modify I'm gonna have to learn more
about all of this where things are
getting handled I don't mind their their
default breakdown of everything though I
think it makes sense where how their
their layouts director either you can
get plugins there are plugins for a
Jekyll which is cool which I haven't
looked at at all yet but the fact that
they have them is cool it's using cram
down as the markdown that you can
actually change it to other ones which
is neat so we can always maybe I could
find a solution to my image problem by
changing what's using the the markdown
conversion
Gangu do I have plans or would bill
making a wordpress theme it's something
I haven't done in so long and I think if
I end up doing it what I'm going to do
is wait for Gutenberg to get fully
implemented with the WordPress 5 update
and then take a look at it because I
think that would be worthwhile to
experiment with the problem is my PHP is
terrible so custom themes and all of
that I'm not very comfortable with it so
I'd have to read I've into it it's been
a long time since I've played with
WordPress in a substantial way have done
superficial stuff with it but in a real
substantial way so at one point it may
happen just not in the near future and
like the next six months I don't see it
happening
Tylar another one to get a job realistic
HTML CSS JavaScript yeah and at least
knowledge react angular c-sharp and
experience with dotnet yeah you need I
mean it really depends where you're
going what type of thing you're really
after if you if you're looking to build
art for a decent salary anyway the more
you know the better
sadly it's not so much about expertise
on singular things mind you that's why I
find one of the problems with web these
days is we went from it being really
like the Wild West to being really
simplified and now it's just like
exploding again with a lot of crap and
Here I am playing with Jekyll which is
more crap that we can play around with
right but yeah you get the idea if you
are looking into react or angular or
view or any of those other ones illinit
just be careful make sure you understand
JavaScript really well I think it's the
reason my goal for this year I'm okay
with JavaScript my goal for this year is
to really be good with JavaScript
because I won't I felt when I started
looking into those languages I could you
get around but I think a solid
understanding of JavaScript means you're
not learning
react and stuck with react you're
learning JavaScript which then you can
learn react and then move on to the
other ones maybe a little bit easier and
be more open to moving around it's sort
of like you could get stuck on jQuery
and how to use jQuery but never be able
to do anything else you don't want to
learn just react personally I think it's
a more useful skill to know vanilla
jeaious and then I think it would make
you more versatile maybe other people
have different opinions on that and
disagree with me but I think it could be
beneficial to really understand j/s
really well and yeah
yeah so that's it I think thanks Simon
and thanks game doing things all of you
guys for being here and that was a lot
of fun sorry for the beginning I know
there was for anyone who stuck around
through the the lagging issues and all
that I apologize for that I think I know
what caused it so next time it shouldn't
be an issue and I guess that's it I yeah
thanks a ton for being here and until
next time don't forget to make your
corner the internet just a little bit
