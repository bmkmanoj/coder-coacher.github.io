implicit and explicit grid now what is
the implicit and explicit grid well we
can define exactly what our grid is but
say you make a container and you tell it
that it's a grid and you put a bunch of
stuff in there it's gonna make rows
automatically it's gonna place those
things on the grid even though you
haven't told it how to treat those rows
yet and we can also tell it that don't
place them on rows you can have it
automatically create columns instead and
sometimes you'll have a grid that you've
defined but then you're adding more
stuff to it and those things are falling
into the automatically created parts of
the grid so the explicit grid of the
parts that we've defined whereas the
implicit parts or the automatically
created ones and we can control all of
this so this video is all about taking a
look at how the whole implicit and
explicit grid even works and then also
how we can control it to take advantage
of it because it's a little bit weird
and it can be confusing sometimes when
things aren't going where you think they
are and all of that you can definitely
leverage the auto thing and you can
control these auto columns and auto rows
really easily actually and you can make
it so you have a lot less markup in the
long run so it's really cool for that
and we won't be doing a really cool
looking site for this just because I
thought it'd be easier with a sort of a
theoretical example instead to really
nail down exactly how this is happening
and let's go take a look all right guys
so here we are in code pen once again so
as usual the link is down in the
description below right now I haven't
done very much I've just set up in each
one and a little paragraph there I have
a div grid container and in there I have
nine boxes the first one is a different
color onyx we're gonna play around with
that one a little bit later so that just
has its own background color and these
have their color and they all have a bit
of padding on them and otherwise there's
nothing much going on with this at all
so what we want to be doing is well I
have my grid container here so we will
as usual start off by doing oops not a
grid we have to say display grid and
well nothing changed hmm we have a grid
and it's there but it's not doing
anything yet so let's go take a look at
it I mean use
inspect element and I am in Firefox for
this chrome doesn't offer this so I'm
gonna go on the grid container and you
can see it is a grid and I'm gonna turn
on my grid so we can get some lines on
there that we can see now I'm not going
to be using my inspect element very much
but I do need to leave it open for this
to work so I'm just gonna hide it down
if I'm not used to it there it is not
used to Firefox that the colors are all
too similar for me so very very subtle
but we can see some lines on there so
the first thing I'm going to do just to
help make it a bit easier to see things
is I'm also going to do a grid gap on
this so good gap and let's just do to em
to make a nice big gap so now we can
release them let's do one point five
maybe that's a little too big but I just
want to make it super easy to be able to
see our grid so when I do a display grid
it's making a grid but I haven't told it
what to do yet so it makes it written it
hasn't done pretty much anything yet
so the very first thing I'm going to do
is I am going to come here and say grid
template columns so we're gonna make
some columns so just so we understand
and make sure you all understand if I do
300 it's gonna make one column 300
pixels and it's automatically making a
bunch of rows right now now I haven't
told it to make any rows but just
automatically it's decided to make some
rows to fill that space if you don't
want it to automatically create rows you
can also tell it to automatically create
columns instead so that's one of the
things you can do with the grid Auto
flow the default on that is row and I
can change that to column like so so now
instead of making rows it's making
columns and those columns are going
across that way so it does give me some
horizontal scrolling because it's not
automatically making rows it's
automatically making columns so it's
just going along and it will keep making
more columns as long as it needs to now
one thing you'll also notice is this
first column is bigger than all the
other ones and this is where we get into
the explicit in implicit grid the only
column I've explicitly stated is this
one here I've told that there's one
column of 300 pixels so we have 300
pixels
and I haven't told that what else to do
so it doesn't know what to do so it just
puts it as small as possible so if I go
and look at those that are all as small
as possible
the only thing controlling that size is
the pattern here if I made the padding
smaller they're gonna get smaller make
the padding back bigger and they get
bigger so it's just the content that's
inside of them that is dictating the
size of them and that's the same thing
if I turn this off or if I switch to
this again the default on that is row so
that goes back to the default behavior
where they're going one on top of each
other so on all in case of all of these
the the height of each one of these rows
is being just automatically decided by
the height of the content inside of it
so if we go and look we sing grid
template row and let's go with 300
pixels too so we get a square rows not
real so this first one here is 300 300
and all these other ones are just
fitting the content because I've only
told it to have one row of 300 pixels so
I've explicitly stated this column in
this row this is defined by me all of
this other stuff is automatically
created and when it's automatically
creating things that's what we call the
implicit grid I'm gonna get more detail
and see some of the other things that
happen with this as this video goes on
so hopefully if you're a little bit
confused right now hopefully it starts
to make a bit more sense now I think
it's gonna help illustrate my point a
little more if we're not using one
column and one row
so for now I'm gonna turn off my
template rows and we can't rid of this
because that is the default and let's
switch this over I'm gonna make four
columns so I could do one fr one fr one
F alright with them all the same size so
I could do something like that now I
could do this exact same thing instead
just by repeating but by repeating it so
repeat four comma one fr so it's
repeating that four times and I get my
four columns so these first four columns
are part of my explicit grid I've
explicitly stated there should be four
columns but it's implying that there
should be multiple rows because my
content can't fit in that space so it
has to invent the space
for these to exist on to help illustrate
this even more is the autofill and the
autofit so when I do my repeat here I
can actually change this to autofill and
autofit now to really illustrate this
point I'm actually going to give
ourselves only two boxes I will have to
do my inspect element again on there now
so you can see right now I've told it
that we should have four columns of 1fr
so one two three four columns there one
fr each and it's explicitly stated so it
knows that it should have that um so you
know and when fr it's just it's
splitting the screen up into four bits
so let's just say I made this 200 pixels
each one of those boxes is 200 pixels so
there's my defined grid
you'll also notice right now if I do my
grid template Row 1 if our rows Firefox
shows you the implicit and explicit grid
so right now you can see if you can tell
if the your screen is picking up I have
a nice solid border going all the way
around there if I take off my grid
template rows this turns into a dotted
line so the dotted line means it's the
implicit grid so it it's just making a
row here for this content to fit on so
my grid template columns so I have four
but what if I don't need four well I
could do repeat and there's two options
there's auto fill and auto fills gonna
take the size of my grid it's gonna see
that I want each column to be 200 pixels
and it's gonna make as many rows as can
fit in that space so it's filling the
space with columns so you can see as I'm
doing this they're disappearing and even
now they'll stack because I don't have
room for two to go next to each other
this could be super useful for not
needing some breakpoints on fixing
designs so you can see that as I'm doing
that it's creating more and more rows
automatically which is pretty cool
there's autofit and there's autofill and
there's also auto fit now the difference
with auto fit is is it's going to take
my two
but it's not gonna create anymore it's
just repeating for whatever is in there
so if I add a new box in here copy paste
let's put that as a three you can see
now I have three of course I have to
pull up my inspector again because I'm
changing the mark-up there there you go
so now it's automatically fitting so the
auto fit means fit how much content I
have whereas the auto fill means fill
the container or take this container and
put as many columns in there even if
they're not being used this is very
small and very subtle difference so it's
a really subtle difference between the
two of them but there is a difference
there and I do think it is important to
know about that difference another thing
okay so we have this let's go and bring
back my nine boxes now and if you nine
so three six nine fix okay great so now
that I'm back to my nine boxes what I'm
gonna let sit we can get rid of this I
think let's go back to repeat for 1fr
because that's gonna work well for what
we want to do I mentioned that the auto
fill before when we started with this
we'll keep making new rows or new
columns and as we can see here so before
I did that so we did a whoops grid Auto
flow and when I changed that to column
it just makes a whole ton of columns and
it's are gonna like spill out that way
because I haven't stated that I want any
rows so my grid doesn't have any rows in
it so it's gonna say okay I'm not
automatically creating rows anymore I'm
only automatically creating columns so
this is where it's implying that
there'll be a lot of columns but it's
not gonna implicitly create any rows but
if I have existing rows so if I do grid
template rows and let's say I have two
whoops repeat two 1fr
what it's doing now is it's I've told it
it has to have two rows so no matter
what happens you're gonna have two rows
but it's changing the flow of things so
it's making everything going columns
instead of making things go in row so
you can say have one two three four five
six seven eight nine and nine is stuck
over there if I put this back to row one
two three four five six seven eight not
in that way instead so that is important
to know oh and yeah sorry that was well
why is this one smaller and it's because
it can fit that one in and you know it's
one two three four five six seven eight
so when I get to eight here that's yeah
I've used up all of my rows we have one
two then okay we're not starting a new
row so we're gonna start a new column
three four okay we have to start a new
column 5 6 K we got to start a new
column 7 8 start a new column but this
column I haven't explicitly said what it
is so that's why this one is smaller
than the rest and even if I make you
know no matter what I do
these ones are growing and shrinking a
little bit because they're 1fr and this
is just as small as it could possibly be
because we haven't told it how big that
should be so that is important to know 1
if I if I switch this over to 3 well now
all the content can actually fit here
and we have an extra empty one on the
side because I don't have enough content
to fill up that space so again if I do
row it's gonna put everything across and
then loop down that way and if I switch
it to column it fills my columns up in
instead of filling the rows first so
understanding of the auto row the auto
flow works is really important you can
do some cool stuff with your layouts
with that ok next let's put this to a
three and a three just we have a nice
even layout now a few more things with
how they implicit and grid being
implicit and explicit grid work so I
have my box 1 and we can tell this box
where to go so if I do grid call so we
can tell number 1 here not to start on
the first line but to start on the
second line so a grid column 2
and it's gonna push over and it pushes
everything over with it I could say
start on line three
and it's gonna push over to line three
because I have line 1 line 2 and line 3
so it's starting at line 3 and it's
using that space or I could say go from
2 to 4 so start on line 2 and end on
line 4 now what happens if I tell it to
end on a line that I've never created
such as line number 6 I don't have 6 but
it creates 6 the grid will adapt to what
you're doing so if you tell it to put 6
it's not gonna go no there's no 6 line
this doesn't work it's going to create
extra ones so we can see here it's
creating some extra so I have my
explicit grid and if you can see on your
screen there is a darker line here like
a solid line there and then over here
this line here is a dotted line because
this area over here well the bottom line
is still solid because that's part of
the row that's existing but this whole
area over here these two columns are
being implied by me telling it that it
should go that far
and I could even tell it you're actually
starting on the 6 line start over on 6
so it's gonna go all the way to 6 even
though I didn't tell it there 6 I only
explicitly told it that there's 3
columns it's gonna move all the way over
to the 6th column because I'm telling it
there should be 6 so it's kind of weird
and you make unexpected results because
of this sometimes and one thing that's
really important let's make this one a
little bit smaller let's just do line 4
we can control these autos that it's
making so it's really important to know
that you can control the auto things
that it's making so back on the parent I
can do grid Auto columns and I can also
do the same with grid Auto rows and so
you can tell it that the ones that are
automatically being created how big are
they so if I did one fr well now they're
all the same because my columns are all
one fr and now my auto columns are that
as well
or I could say this is actually two and
it's gonna get bigger than the rest of
them so I could do let's say I do before
for six so these I have two columns now
that are being created I haven't
outlined them there these are being
created by the browser because I'm
telling it that there should be six
columns so it's going okay well I need
two extra columns and those Auto columns
I'm going to be putting them as 2fr or
you can obviously give this a pixel
value so I did 10 pixels they're gonna
be nice and tiny
I'll stick with 100 now just for this
demo right here
you can see these things are also
flowing into these Auto ones that are
being created so it's implying that the
grid is there so then it everything is
going to use the grid it's not only this
special thing that I'm telling it to
pull out of the grid cool so I hope
that's nice anchor that we can do that
so what I'm doing now is I'm saying
there's only two real rows I'm you
there's two rows here but because my
content needs more space it's creating a
third row to put this stuff on so I can
do the exact same thing I can have my
grid Auto rows and say 100 pixels and
you can see that one just changed a
little bit let's just make that like 300
so it's a bit more clear to get bigger
so this isn't automatically created row
so it's just going to grow in size now
this can be really really useful because
if you have something that you just want
it to be equally spaced out you don't
even have to give any template rows you
could just say all my rows are going to
be automatically created as my content
fills in them and they're all gonna be
equal in height so I'm putting them all
at one fr or they're all going to be I
don't know 10 MS tall and you can
explicitly say that all right you can
say that all my grids are just
automatically created so as they add
more content it's just going to keep
adding more and more rows by itself and
all of those rows will automatically be
the same height so that is something
cool you can do with that
so for now I'm actually going to bring
this back up to here and we're going to
delete that cool so we're getting there
guys we're getting there
and just to show you actually we can do
this grid row say I do 10 it's gonna
shoot down and make a whole bunch of
empty ones so here you know I got a
whole ton of empty ones there's no
content inside of these so these 3 here
1 2 3 are being defined by my repeat 3 1
fr so they're all the same height even
though these ones are empty cuz I'm
telling that this third row has to have
a height of 1 fr these ones don't have a
height on them so they're collapsing
down to 0 and then but this is where I
get just to reiterate I can use my grid
Auto rows and say it's I don't know 10
pixels and now they're 10 pixels tall
each now 10 pixels a bit weird maybe we
do 150 pixels I don't know why we do
even that but now all of these
automatically created rows they're all
empty cuz there's nothing on them but
they're all the same height and then I
finally get down to my tenth row down
here where this number 1 is living so
just to show that you can do it the same
with your rows and with your columns now
let's put this back to 3 let's get them
living in the third one so we're back to
our original grid sort of and you'll
notice I have this empty space so with
the auto flow here we can actually tell
it to fill in these empty spaces that
happen just as a quick thing that you
I'm gonna put this actually do a grid
row of 3 as well and now it's gonna fill
in that empty space because let's just
backspace that um this is gonna push
over and then push over so this is
falling down to the next line but as
soon as I pull this off so I'm telling
it like come from here and go down to
this empty space here it's gonna go down
to that empty space and that means you
know it's not gonna push everything into
all these implied things it just sort of
fills we deleted that whole empty one on
the top and this is just falling down to
the bottom so that's cool but say you
don't want to bother with that you want
this on the third row but you don't want
these empty and it sort of would suck to
have to take this until it you have to
live here and to take this and to say
you have to live here so on here on my
grid Auto flow I can say row dense
and it just means if there's an empty
space fill that up if you can fit so row
dense you can also have column dense so
two three four five six seven buy one
because that's where I told it to be
eight nine so column dense will do it
that way
row dense will go across or you can of
course just write dense by itself the
default on the grid Auto flow is row so
if you just write dense it's the same as
writing row dense and it will just fill
in those empty spaces so if I take this
one here and I actually tell it that my
grid Row is a span to I don't have to
worry about some well and maybe you're
on to I don't have to worry about these
weird empty spaces that could come up
you can see I get my empty space there
again I don't want that to happen so
something like this for your layout or
let's say two over span to you want to
move it down you can control one element
on your grid but have everything else
fill in to those empty spots that are
around it so the grid auto float dense
can be super super handy I'm also a
little bit surprised it's not the
default behavior but maybe that's just
me and sort of how I expected it to work
when I first started playing with it to
be honest so there you have it I hope
the implicit and explicit grid makes a
little bit more sense I hope you like
