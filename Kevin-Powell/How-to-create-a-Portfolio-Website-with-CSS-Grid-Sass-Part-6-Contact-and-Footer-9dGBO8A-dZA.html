on building out a portfolio website
using the CSS grid in this video we're
gonna be tackling the contact form
there's not a lot to do so we're
probably in either under the footer to
so this is what we want it to look like
and right now it looks nothing like that
let's go and take a look right now it
looks something like this which isn't so
nice
so let's actually pull XD back up and
see what we need to do on this and just
talk through it so we need the name to
be on top and then this underneath
contact me should be centered in the
space we need to style what these look
like a little bit so there's a little
border color on that's a little dark and
just each one is on its own line and of
course my send button needs to stand out
and it looks like I forgot to make a
send button so let's get rid of you and
let's make a new file so a new file
right in here in my s CSS inside my
partials right there contact CSS and in
my all let's make sure we remember to
import that contact so let's save that
and let's bring this up and launch my
gulp process of course we'll open that
up in a new window
alright tab I should say and we'll
scroll back down and let's just check if
this is working body background of red
awesome so it's working get rid of all
that close mail and we can get to work
so over the first thing I'm gonna do for
my contact is we're going to add include
my container just to keep it off the
sides and give myself a little space and
we'll do a text-align:center no I'm not
going to do a text-align:center because
I don't want everything to be centered
let's give it the padding I think I used
5m everywhere else so I'm gonna do 5 m0
just to give myself that space I'm
pretty sure that's what I used
everywhere else not even a double check
I'm pretty confident with that one and I
want only the title to be centered so I
think it'd be easier let's just go and
double-check on my index file here
contact MH one in the my form okay I'll
just do my h1 here each one
text-align:center and we're good to go
save should i call give this a class now
I'm just getting work on my form itself
now the form itself I don't really have
anything to do I'm just gonna look at my
labels oh I just realized I might have
made a mistake we'll find out in a
second let's just do it
input display:block okay good I can do
that it didn't work there that's my
input and my text area awesome okay so
my input and text area will get that so
they can all line up just like that I
also have my labels so my labels will
have a margin top of one M these also
will need a display block there we go
they are inline elements by default so
you can't put a margin on them and I
just want to pull up my design again
that's facing okay that spacing doesn't
look too bad the color of these also
needs to be changed color dark gray that
looks much better and now I just want to
format sort of this what these boxes
look like right so that's on these both
so we already have my selector there
let's give it a little bit of padding
will do a padding of like point to 5m
and maybe a little bigger 0.5 M good
with of I'm gonna do a width of 100% but
I'm a little scared with of 100% yeah
we'll leave it like that for now
background of light great
that's way too dark border of gray of
dark gray border color I'll just do
border one pixel solid gray my late gray
do I have a different color that's light
no I only have my light gray it's that
light gray that looks darker than that
doesn't it I have my white which is just
pure white light gray that's all I got
okay so is that using light gray it is
so what if I did a light tin light gray
by say 20% 10-5 that's better
seven lightens like really finicky I
find there we go it's more I guess of
what I'm after right they need to be a
lot taller there's still wow I won't
really light on that I should really
just find that color there and this
could probably be light gray that's more
of what I was after
and I'm gonna put my padding all the way
up to 10.25 probably make my font size
in those bigger actually let's bring
this back down to like 0.75 maybe and
then my font size in this font size and
be like 1.2 rim yeah I think that looks
okay
good why the lint get to long now
because my font size my padding did I
not box-sizing border-box
I can't believe I didn't do that already
on my website cool good good good
awesome so that's looking pretty much
what I wanted to look like good good
good
I'm pretty happy with that actually we
need a submit button though of course
and I'm gonna need a new file for that
too but let's just go back to my index
so here we need another input input
except this one will be type submit' and
the value will be equal to send I think
is what I want we'll save that big send
button there and this one will also get
let's give this a class two class equals
whoops called a button and should I put
I'm gonna put that in here because it's
my only button I probably should make a
different thing for that but button
display:block alright do I want in line
block on that in line block width of
like 30% margin top 1m should this be
block or inline block I guess it doesn't
matter actually float:right should I do
that so just use a float does that make
sense
should I not use a float is the question
we just want to send to the right side
Oh would this work instead
margin-left:auto would also get me the
same result but I don't have to use a
float and get the annoying issues with
that that's the whole idea with margin
Auto the whole reason a margin Auto left
and right center something is because
it's trying to an argent a margin auto
left or right is just going to take all
the available space so in the left and
the right or auto its equaling it out on
the two sides so that works background
is accent border is none color is white
and I want to be my saw serif so it's
mixing saw serif do I need to give it
anything but default font size I need to
give it a font size so that's at mix in
serif font size is going to let's start
with one Ram and see what that looks
like
not at mixing add include yeah that's
really small too and I think I put color
in here didn't I color it yeah color
white I can't push the right key weight
to 0.5 that looks like crap why is this
look so much nicer I have to fix the
padding and stuff on it too
let's do that padding is going to be
like point 5m top and bottom and two
left and right 1.5 left and right
what did why how is that this silly font
problem inspector
oh I just made it way too much
because I have a width oh it's grabbing
the width from here can do width with
display so I do want to inline block and
I want the width to be Auto haha okay
that works
but then my margin left doesn't work
anymore because because because because
what do I have color crow I don't need
this color white it's included in there
save okay let's find um I could I could
use a float but I really don't feel like
using a float so I'm gonna do my we're
gonna have to do this anyway right
so what's it called form display block
display flex there go next to each other
and then flex Direction column there we
go and because it's a flex item now my
auto thing works again and I want to
make it flex box anyway and I will be
using some good areas on it but not yet
because it's pretty much working how I
want it to right now I'm gonna use the
grid areas to rearrange it cuz at the
large screen sizes that will look
different but for now it looks good so
I'm gonna leave it like that and we can
go on to the social media so the social
media section and my footer here I have
my footer follow me on social media my
icons a line and then my copyright so
I'm gonna put the line
probably with the copyright there and
then that so let's close my contact file
we can close typography and I can make a
new file so in my partials a new file
called footer dot s CSS go to my all
copy/paste and I'm putting in my footer
good good good
I think let's just do a ctrl or command
C to stop that and I'll run gulp again
it should pop that open in a new tab any
second now there we go and now my footer
should be working so footer background
is dark grey that's not the right color
dark blue that's the right color padding
of 3m zero I think I had more on my
footer a mmm add more there and make a
footer one the bigger I should also put
text align Center I'm gonna put a extend
my container on here extent and that
extent include container I don't think
no I'm not because I have my dark
background nevermind I didn't think I
was gonna need it anyway but I was gonna
do it and for my social media icons
I might include the container on those
but make it really small let's go take a
look I have my social icons and so cool
let's go and do that so social
icons I'm not sure what I need to do on
these actually let's just give it yeah
I'm gonna put my container on these so
@include container and let's give it a
max width that's pretty small 15m you
cool and then I have my dot social icon
for each individual icon and this
actually display flex bootiful they're
next to each other
whit on my social icons of will do like
25 percent might be a bit small yeah
that looks pretty good actually and then
we can do a justify content space
between look at that look at that look
at that look at that super happy with
that except why do I have a giant gap on
top really why is that so tall with this
gives us a height of 25 percent as well
that that's more what I thought would
happen okay there we go so that's
looking nice so social icons we might as
well just also on here do a margin of
like through for m0 that that's screwing
up what I have here so we can just do
more for M Auto
okay that looks pretty good
that was a lot closer the way yeah for
EM is way too big on the top one m4m
1.25 1.75 good okay I'm happy with that
and do they call that copy right down at
the bottom it did so we can do a copy
right that's gonna have and and before
content is nada we're going to have a
display block on that height of 1 pixel
background of it's probably supposed to
be RGB a white 0.5 close enough margin
bottom of 4m I think that's roughly what
I had right like equal spacing here yeah
that looks pretty good let's dim that
out a bit more actually like 0.25 even
0.15 and a width of like 25% margin:0
auto
oh my margin is gonna screw everything
up there actually let's save that
copyright let's just do a margin then of
four on the top auto that makes sense
there we go instead of four zero for
auto that makes sense so we have four
there that looks there we go
that is done these would make more sense
if there were links right I'm not gonna
make them links now but those could
obviously become links with no problem
at all and yeah that's it guys it's done
so awesome that is the site done for
mobile displays I do have to come back
in and do my navigation obviously and I
do have to come and build in my what
happens when I click on my more info
what I'm going to be doing for the rest
of the series is the next one will be
doing the large screen sizes so I'm
going to come build all the media
queries and make things work at large
screen sizes which means if we look at
all of this this is just gonna get a
bigger font size this to the font size
changes slightly
this gets rearranged this gets a bit of
a new and more interesting layout this
is going to get a more interesting
layout and we're gonna do something cool
with that I think here we're gonna use
our grid areas just to rearrange this a
little bit and the footer will pretty
much stay the same and once that is done
I'm gonna do the navigation I'm gonna do
one video for creating the navigation
I'm gonna do another video for creating
the pop-up things and I'm not sure
exactly where will fit in the JavaScript
either I'm gonna do the javis I think
what I'm gonna do is one video for the
navigation followed by the JavaScript
for the navigation and then one video on
creating the pop-up thingy and then a
second video on making the the
JavaScript part and that is the plan
right now
so if you have any input on that or want
to you have an idea of how I should
approach that by all means and I just
realized I had a typo there so let's fix
that
we're not copywriting we're copy we have
a copyright on our site there we go okay
cool I'm happy I saw that so if you have
any questions or comments please don't
be shy to leave them down below if you
liked this video please hit the thumbs
up and of course until next time don't
forget to make your recording the
Internet just a little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
