video we are going to be looking at some
really fun stuff with some parallax
effects so whether or not you were
around when I did this website that we
see on the screen right now this was
done for my building a responsive
website from scratch video you do not
have to watch those videos to see how
this works it's a standalone video one
of my subscribers concurred j/s asked me
how we could add a parallax effect to
this site right here this hero area that
we're looking at on the screen right now
so I'm going to add it in there if you
do want to look at this site let's just
take a really quick look at it and if
you do want to follow along or build
this site or see how I built this site
you can go and check out that series
right now and when you're when you're
done with building it then you can come
back and join in and adding a parallax
effect but again this parallax effect
should work on absolutely any site that
you do so I haven't done very much I've
just done a few little things since I
finished that last one so if you are
joining me from previously watching that
series one thing I've done is I've added
this parallax BG class to my home hero
area and all the way down here at the
bottom I've added jQuery from their CDN
just Lincoln over from there and I've
added this link to Jas parallax Jas
which is my own file and I've created
that file but it has nothing in it yet
because we're doing all of this from
scratch and we will be using jQuery to
make this work but before we get into
the jQuery you may not need it and
having to do some JavaScript it's an
extra dependency you know it slows
things down just a little bit so one
thing you can do to get the most basic
style of parallax effect is just doing a
background attachment background okay
that's right here background attachment
of fixed and background attachment is
the off forgotten background property
and nobody ever uses it
except for this I think the default for
this by the way is scroll scroll is what
it is that's the default property and
fixed is what you change it if you make
it fixed it will do this where it just
locks the background picture in place so
that is definitely a parallax effect and
sort well paralyzed now I've it's the
right style it's in the parallax ID
we're real parallax is when things are
moving at different speeds but this
gives us a nice way of doing it without
having to actually add in any JavaScript
so if that's what you're after well
there you go you're done and nice and
easy but you know that makes for way too
short of a video and we want to do some
more fun things than that so I'm going
to come in now and start playing with
some JavaScript and I'm going to do it
for the background image here and I'm
also going to do an effect for this box
right here and the reason I want to do
that is this to show two different ways
of doing it they're both actually really
similar to each other but this one's
dealing with a background image and this
one's dealing with something the
positioning of a box instead of the
positioning of a background so let's
jump right into it we'll come up to my
parallax right here and we're going to
do a couple of things we're going to
check for my window and when my window
Scrolls and I always write school
instead of scroll scroll we want to do a
function so when my window Scrolls we
will do a function and that function
will be we're going to run parallax and
what is parallax you ask well parallax
will be this function that I'm creating
right here so function parallax and now
there's a couple of things going to do
the first thing I need to do is need to
track my screen as it's scrolling so
we're going to create a variable
variable I'm going to call this one W
scroll roll window scroll and this is
equal to my window scroll top
and just to show you what this is
actually doing what this variable is
storing and to just make sure that
everything is actually working let's do
a little console log so cons so on so
log and for now let's just do a nice
little console log of hello to see if
things are working inspect jump over to
the console and when I scroll hello
should just start going up there there
we go and the farther down I scroll the
more hellos are coming so every time the
window Scrolls a little bit we get more
hellos super now that's kind of useless
though so to show you what this W school
variable is storing in it let's have
this show us W scroll instead so I'm
going to save that and now when I scroll
you can see that it's pumping out some
numbers and what that is is how far down
I've scrolled so if I start moving back
up it should start going back towards
zero there we go so if I go down or up
its keeping track and storing in it how
far away from the top of the window I am
which is really good because we're going
to use that information to modify how
things are moving so I don't need that
console log anymore everything is
working nicely and we're going to still
want this let's close it for now but
we'll jump back in there after and what
I want to do now is I want to select my
parallax I relax BG so if you remember I
mentioned that in here I'd added
parallax BG to my home hero I could just
select my home hero but this could be an
effect that I want to use everywhere in
the site and I think it's more
interesting if I you you know it's not
more interesting it's more useful having
something that can be reused anywhere I
need it instead of being locked into one
class or one part of my site so pile xbg
it lets me just apply it anywhere I need
you know anywhere I have a background
that I want to have this parallax effect
with and the reason I'm not just calling
it parallax like this is because as I
mentioned I do want to have two
different parallax effects if I was just
having
one I would probably just call it
parallax but I'm going to have a
background parallax and a not background
parallax will figure out the name for
that one once we get there so I'm
selecting my parallax background and
then what I want to do is I want to
modify my CSS properties and the CSS
property that I want to select is my
background position and with background
position selected I want to chain it so
what do I want to change it to I want to
change it to and let's just go and look
at what my background position already
is on their background position is
currently Center so it's just perfectly
centered on the screen I want to keep it
centered this way so I want this to
always be in the middle it's the up and
down position that I want to change so
to do that I'm going to write center
space plus and I'll explain this in a
bit more detail in a second
w scroll and I'm going to change that
after but we'll just do let's just make
sure this is working
so my background position property is
going to be changed and it's going to be
Center and I'm putting this space here
because you know say we come to here
divided you know I can do Center top or
so if your left is more appropriate in
this case so center left
now it won't be left it's me a pixel
value but we just separate them with a
space so I just if you are putting in
two properties so here I'm just making
sure I'm including that space or it
would cause us some issues so it's going
to stay centered this way but this is
going to change up and down so let's
save this and then scroll and see what
happens
well we can see my background is moving
but that's not what I thought would
happen
what that's really strange it should not
jump it should just sort of scroll why
is it doing that
let's just do it the whole thing I want
to hear is multiply it by something like
0.5 and is it it's still do ya why is it
doing that oh that's a weird one let's
see if we I think I know why it looks
like it's transitioning and it's been a
while but yeah I pretty much do this on
all my sites and in this case it's
caused a problem I just I have my
universal selector here and I've put a
transition on it so what it's doing is
it's actually causing that change in
position to transition over 250
milliseconds instead of just happening
live so we need that not to happen I
don't want to take it off here because
I'm using it for so many things I'm
using it from my button and I'm using it
for these I think I'm probably using it
for those too and the buttons that are
there it's mostly my buttons that I'm
using it for but I don't want to
overwrite it just because if I / if I
take this off I'd have to go back
through my code and fix it everywhere so
it's much easier to just fix it on my
home here oh um or should I fix it on my
parallax I should fix it on my parallax
because I'm gonna have two different
parallax's and then this is going to
affect both of them
where does parallax get put in it's kind
of a generic ax one so I'm going to put
that just after my buttons
parallax okay so we have power lacks BG
and I want this to I want to change my
transition transition I don't know if
none would work
probably but let's do not inherit the
other one that goes with an i initial
initial this should just reset it back
to the initial property which I'm
guessing is none anyway let's just see
there we go yeah so that works it's not
doing that weird jumpy thing anymore
it's just working so the reason that
right now it's sort of it's kind of
useless what I've done now I've added a
whole bunch of JavaScript just to do
something I could do with CSS because
it's not actually moving it's locked in
position and if we go and we look at
what's actually happening here let's
move this up a little bit and move this
down because we can't move that down so
we see here my section and background
position Center zero pixels so it's
staying centered this way and what it's
doing is zero pixels and as I go the
position of it is moving because this
number is equal to my W scroll which is
equal to how far down I've scrolled so
it's keeping the top of the picture
exactly in the same place relative to my
window so right now that's kind of
useless this isn't really what I want
but we can do some math on this so
multiply that by zero point sorry point
five to start with so now when I scroll
down it should move at half the speed so
when I scroll down it should move it
there we go so you can see it is moving
but it's not moving at the same speed as
the rest of my you know evers everything
else and you can of course play around
with this this could be 0.75 so it
should move just a little bit it should
actually that will slow it down even
more so now it's moving a lot slower
it's a bit more subtle actually that's
probably more of what I want but we
could also make this point too
five and save that and now it's really
settled so it's moving it almost the
same speed that I'm scrolling down but
it's pretty obvious that it's not quite
the same
the text is sliding up over the picture
a little bit so I'm gonna stick with the
point seven five for now on there anyway
and I think that you know I think that
looks pretty good so you can see that
it's moving but it's moving at its own
speed right now and that's the basic
parallax effect but so you're going to
see on most places where you're just
you're changing the speed that it's
scrolling at and for me if it's a
background image this is the easiest way
to do it it's just pretty much one line
of jQuery with a little variable stored
in there really nice and simple it's a
really subtle effect in this case but I
think it looks pretty nice I'm going to
stick with that now I did mention that
we want to do it with a second box so
I'm going to take a look at this and
instead of doing it with a background
image I'm going to do it with an actual
div pretty much so let's jump over here
and that was my home about now is it my
home about or my home about text box
let's do an inspect I haven't worked on
the site and quite some time home about
its my text box that I want to move okay
so home about text box will get my
parallax which we call this one parallax
box I'm not very original so we'll just
add a little parallax box on there
we'll jump over to my styles and just
add that in here dot power
laughs box did I do it with one or two
hyphens too good
and so let's come in here and add in
what I need so that will work now I also
want to select my parallax box
and just like before we want to play
with the CSS a little bit and what we're
going to select in our CSS this time is
the top property top and this is where
it's going to get a little bit
complicated in this case only because
mind-reader true here we go this is what
I'm looking for top top top oh man I've
so I was playing around with this a lot
when we were doing it padding
my top is currently negative 5m so I
believe let's just put that to zero and
see what happens
yeah so I'm using that to pull that up
like that and I want to keep this in the
same position so just to show you sort
of what I'm time I want to be changing
that top property and that's what's
going to get it to scroll at a different
speed but to do this just to show you
top so we're going to take our W scroll
again and this is probably gonna screw
everything up let's do that plus pixels
just to show you sort of what it's going
to happen as soon as I start scrolling
here it should I've just lost it
completely
and yeah I sort of screwed everything up
okay so that's not going to work yet um
let's just multiply that by a small
number then times 0.5 to 5 so we can see
it but as soon as I scroll to re and
disappear are we there it is okay so we
can see that's working there we go it's
working yeah it's scrolling at its own
speed the only problem is as soon as I
scroll down a little bit it jumps off
and then it starts working so what I
need to do is I need to Reese I need to
set it up so it's always going to be at
the right spot there so my W scroll is
going to start and let's go slow look
again that was negative 5m so negative 5
is what's pulling it up so we need
started there so we're going to start
with a negative five yes negative five
plus and plus the W scroll but this will
be an app let's see let's see if this
works I think this is gonna work
let's see if this gonna work fingers
crossed guys fingers cross fingers
crossed
oh no where'd it go oh no okay it's
going farther whoa
okay now if I can well there it is oh it
just okay so just so we can see what's
happening we see we see it here there
when I start scrolling I'm gonna really
slow it's taken off it's just taking off
like a rocket
oh it's gone so you can actually see as
soon as they have to hear my scroll bar
just like it's so far down the farthest
row the longer my site becomes so 0.25
is way too much in this case and that
makes sense
because I'm doing negative 5 plus this
number and that number gets big really
fast so it's it's getting really big
really fast and so we have to make this
smaller what if I make this point 0 to 5
save and ha there we go that's better
it's not quite it's still too fast
because it's it's sort of covering some
of my text here and then hiding behind
there not quite what I wanted but it's
on the right track and it's always
starting at the same spot which is
really important so that negative 5 is
definitely working so it's negative 5
plus 0 because my W scroll and all the
way at the top is 0 M so it's just
negative 5 M so when I'm at the very top
of my page is there and then it's as I
start scrolling down it's just adding my
top is getting bigger and bigger and
bigger
and if point two five let's write a 1
you know just have take my 0.25 and make
it half again and let's try now there we
go there we go and it's still going to
cover the text probably a little bit but
you know we could slow it down even more
than that
0-5 and I know this number is getting
ridiculously small but that's just
because my W scroll number is so big
it's just what's going to have to happen
actually and there we go that's more of
what I wanted to do in this case a
really really subtle effect where that
box is just moving and in a way that's
you know with this background moving at
one speed and this moving in a different
speed and everything else it sort of
does create that layered effect that's
kind of neat where everything's moving
at its own speed depending on where it
is another nice thing I wouldn't do this
it would I want to keep this really
really subtle I don't want that really
jumping around or moving really fast
because it's going to look weird and if
someone's reading it a little bit as
they're scrolling you don't want it
moving too much kind of nice is that it
stays in the viewport just a little bit
longer than it would otherwise and I
guess you probably want someone reading
that right if it wasn't Latin you know
if that was your actual about you
section and so I think that looks really
really good and of course you can play
with that number to get something a
little bit different let's even just
make that point eight to make it a
little bit faster and see what happens
that's not too bad either
and you can see now it's just you get
this whole element that's just scrolling
let's make the page a little bit bigger
because there we go
just so it's sticking off the side a bit
and it's just this box I think that's
too fast actually right now but it's
still it definitely grabs the attention
you see that box moving in a different
speed than the rest of the content and
it creates sort of a fun little let's
move that back down to 0-5 I think that
looked better yeah I like it more when
it's this nice little subtle effect if
you're going to do it I don't want it to
be this super obvious like in-your-face
type of thing anyway there you go there
are two different ways of adding in a
parallax effect either with a background
image or with a div itself or whatever
other element you'd want to move at a
different speed and I hope you like both
of them they're both probably have their
own unique
times that you might want to use them if
you try doing this on your site and for
whatever reason it's not working where
you're just getting a little bit
confused by all these negatives and you
know the math is kind of a bit weird
until you wrap your mind around what's
going on so if you get kind of confused
or something's not working leave a
