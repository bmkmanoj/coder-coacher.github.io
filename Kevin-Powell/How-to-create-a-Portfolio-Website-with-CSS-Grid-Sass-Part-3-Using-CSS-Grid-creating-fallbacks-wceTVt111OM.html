where we're building out our portfolio
website using CSS grid as well as sass
to build this whole thing out so what
we're going to be doing in this video
now that we've set up our basic styles
and there's a couple of mistakes that I
realized I made or things that I forgot
but in the main focus of this video is
going to be these two parts here so a
couple of interesting things we're doing
this part here is really simple really
basic down here we will be using the
grid to do this but we're also gonna
have a flex box fallback for it the flex
box fallback doesn't look as nice as
what this is gonna look like especially
on larger screens but that's okay the
other thing we're gonna be doing is
having a using object fit with the I
just want to show you guys object fit
because it's really cool and I
definitely want to use it on this side
so let's get started so here in my
partials I'm just gonna create one new
file for this so let's just come in here
and do a new file I've also made the
font size a little bit bigger let me
know in the comments if the font size is
okay no one said anything but I found it
was a little small in my last videos so
I always have to remember for my videos
to make the font a little bit bigger so
I'm just gonna call this one underscore
welcome dot s CSS oh you know what we're
gonna have to so let's do underscore
welcome dot a CSS whoops and let's do
this one down here too it just makes
more sense and is a little bit better so
this one's gonna be underscore intro but
a CSS because that's sort of the intro
text it's the first stuff I couldn't
call it making it happen but you know
maybe that's gonna change
so welcome introduction and then you
know what on do we won't get down into
this this would be the next video but
then we would eventually get into our
portfolio down there so the first thing
I have to do is go into my all and do an
import and this will be first is my
welcome so import welcome and import
intro and I'll save that file I'll close
this down I'll save that and I'm gonna
do
i'm using PS code if your didn't watch
the other one so i'm just new control or
if you're on a Mac command backtick if
you're not sure where the back tick is
it's the one that's right above tab you
can use it for the til v2 so now
just rate golf in here that should lunch
that and of course it opened up in the
wrong tab here we go close that one okay
and we don't need this so a couple of
things I'm actually gonna go back into
my modules and my typography no sorry
let's go into my base file okay so let's
go to my welcome file here and and I'm
also let's go over here I'm just gonna
split that out and bring up my welcome
and let's just go quickly look at the
mark-up I wrote here so I have a welcome
oh that's
I called that hero in that welcome huh
why would I call this the welcome I'm
gonna change this through intro because
I don't like what I named it before and
and my hero will switch over to welcome
say okay it's let's just move you let's
just do that
no yeah let's just do that but move you
down and let's just move this up like
that okay so let's get started
base I don't need anymore we're on our
welcome make sure that's saved so I have
the right class names and everything so
the first thing was just dude dot
welcome
the first thing I'm new is my background
image URL and to be honest I don't
remember what I called it I probably
called it hero image let's go look fast
fast fast header BG I'm guessing it's
that one images slash header BG dot PNG
save there we go good I'm also going to
do a height of like eighty viewport
height because I want it to be pretty
big depending on the device but I don't
want it to be the whole screen because I
definitely want this the sort of people
to be able to see at least the top of
that or do I will go with 100 for now
and we'll see if we want to change that
after and we'll do a display flex on
here display
and I'm just gonna jump back over really
fast I have this side-scrolling thing
that's really bugging me right now so
one of the things I forgot so in my base
file I'm just gonna come in here and add
image max with 100% for now and close
that okay so yeah I think I'm maybe a
hundred percent would look better
we'll see it depends on the device maybe
okay so let's just see how this is gonna
look so welcome and that is good um now
what I could do and what I used to do in
the past is always give this its own
class name because this one is different
from everything else it's different from
all my other H ones right the thing is
and this yeah I don't like how I set up
my h1 span I'm gonna change that a
little bit but as I was saying I I used
to always add a class to this the thing
is this style is pretty specific to the
here it's really specific to the style
I'm doing on this so for me the way I'm
seeing this envisioned is it's not
really a title that I'd want to pull out
and use somewhere else so because of
that I'm actually just gonna nest it and
if you're not using sass and just to
make sure you can just do welcome each
one on its own line and write in the
same styles i'm with sass you can nest i
I try to avoid nesting as much as
possible and I used a hundred percent
avoided but I'm starting to come around
to the idea unless you're working on a
massive project if it's a huge project
that you know should be super come it
should just be tons of components
because you want to be able to use
things all over the place you don't know
exactly how things are gonna be used
then I completely agree you want to make
sure everything has its own class name
on something like this I'm not sure I
see the utility of it as much and I
actually think that this is a little bit
easier to maintain maybe I'm wrong but
my view on it is sort of shifting a
little bit I went from one extreme to
the other extreme
now I think I'm finding a little bit of
a middle ground or like 90% of the time
I want to use classname on everything
but there are exceptions and rule things
that I break it with a little bit so
what we're gonna do on my h1 here we
have our font size so it's off screen
for you guys right now but the font size
on this is 25 which is like a really
awkward things I'm just going to 1.5 RAM
and see what that looks like and my font
weight font weight looks like it's gonna
be a font weight font-weight:normal that
looks better the color of it is dark
blue awesome that looks pretty good
yes awesome that looks pretty much like
what I want we need to add a little bit
of line height to this I guess line
height of like 1.5 okay and it needs to
be centered so for this I'm just that's
why I have a display of flex on here
then I can just do a line items Center
justify content Center hit save and it
should pop right in the middle and I
guess I should also do a
text-align:center did I misspelled text
align yes semicolon expected ah I forgot
there aha okay good now one thing I'd
said I don't like where I put my span I
think in this case like this span is
part of my welcome thing it's not
supposed to be used elsewhere my letter
spacing is also a little big on there
but it's not terrible but I think I'll
make that a little bit smaller I'll live
with it for now it's a little bit big
but I'll live with it and see if I like
it anymore later on I'm also my colors
are a little bit off but I know I used I
did a copy from here so I almost feel
like my colors from XD you're lying to
me a little bit actually I forgot your
background image I'm all over the place
here sorry guys background size cover
and I'll do a background position of
center Center
there we go that looks a little better
and that just means as I scale up and
down it if it my screen so we can do
like we can see that the background is
growing there we see it a bit more this
way so it's gonna grow and fit my screen
and I think I do actually like this
viewport 100% we're gonna have the
little hamburger menu I know I didn't
write the mark-up for that yet I'm just
once I come and add my navigation we're
gonna do that and I think that will just
be one big big video that I'm gonna do
including the JavaScript to mark up
everything for it in one video once the
rest of the site is done that's the
current plan anyway back on track to
what I was talking about is to go back
into my base file here steal this span
save close that and pop that span in
here save and again this is just because
I think this span belongs more to all of
this and I'm actually gonna make my line
height bigger cool there we go so it
looks nice and yeah this Spencer belongs
with my welcome h1 and now I'm actually
going three deep which is something I
almost never ever ever do but it's sort
of how I'm going now what do you guys
think about this what do you what's your
opinions on just everything having a
class name versus something like what
I'm doing now where I'm nesting I'd like
to know your thoughts on that and if
yeah I'd appreciate some feedback and
what you think would be the best
approach or how you work and all of that
so the last thing I need here is my
little bar on the top in the bottom so
on this we're still going to be inside
of here so in again if you're not
following this means I have my welcome
each one I have some rules I'm gonna
have my welcome each one span is gonna
have some rules and now I'm gonna do my
welcome before and I'll have a welcome
after as well I guess I coulda just
showing you the compiled CSS instead of
writing that out but anyway so here I'm
going to do an ampersand or and
before and that just means it's h1 if
you're writing regular CSS just write
the welcomes each one before so my h1
before is going to have a content of
nothing but we need to have we need to
tell there's nothing in there we need to
give it a width I don't know let's say
80% and actually how am I going to
position this let's just hit save
let's give it a height of 1 pixel point
note we'll do height of 1 pixel and a
background of dark blue I don't see
anything
inspect let's pull this down so we can
actually see what we're doing so I'm in
my welcome my h1 should have a before it
does
width and height Oh display:block there
we go okay cool
the other thing some asked me one time
about using a position:absolute it's
either display block or
position:absolute or both
but you need at least one or the other
and in this case it's me a lot easier to
work with just a display block on it and
actually if I do this inline block will
it Center it cool with the block it
wasn't centered I'd have to do margin
autos on the side which I didn't really
want to do it's too big so I'm gonna try
we're gonna go back to block because
that's gonna cause some issues display
block and we'll just do my margin:0 auto
and that will Center it right there cool
so that looks okay welcome to my
portfolio now I just need that space
here so that's nice and easy because
that just means it's not a margin:0 auto
top will be zero Auto left and right and
my margin bottom will be like 3m um
there we go and we can do pretty much
actually before and
after remove that all of this is exactly
the same right so if I save that I have
my two lines and then I would just have
my and before we'll have this one and my
and after we'll have the same thing but
the other way around - M - M 0 cool
right
so my before and my after sharing all of
these properties they're all exactly the
same so it just makes it so I can write
a little bit less code I have the
content the display block the width the
height the background so all of those
are exactly the same for all of them
this one just has its own margin on the
top this one has its own margin on the
bottom awesome so I'm happy with that
that looks pretty good and that means
that as yeah look at that so a full page
this will I will be building some media
queries and stuff so it won't look you
know the fonts will get bigger on the
bigger screen size cuz that looks a
little bit sad at the really big size
but I'm pretty happy with how that
turned out
so now we can move on down to the next
part cuz yeah I'm happy with how that
looks
I think it's a nice little and again
this one unless you're on your phone
it's horizontal it won't really look
like that let's just go and do a little
inspect put the responsive mode on and
hit a I phone 6 for fun I can't see all
my text of course really
why not I designed this to work on that
sighs okay let's just go and fix that
pin whoops
typography my default letter spacing is
gonna be too big so that's point two why
is there a big space on the side there
and also just for fun let's drop down to
the iPhone 5 then that's annoying and
that actually looks more like the design
that I was after so I don't mind fixing
the letter spacing for that the one
thing that I'm a little bit confessedly
I'm actually gonna add another thing in
here of font weight font weight of
font-weight:normal just to make sure it
doesn't ever load in the bold version
because it was loading in a bold one I
think which I didn't want since we're in
here
I was gonna do that after but got
distracted okay so why does it not look
centered is it my letter spacing that's
actually just put that to zero it's the
letter spacing being calculated on the
right side there and it's just weird
with this font like that's sort of
annoying but I don't know if I have a
fix for that if anyone has any
suggestions or knows how to fix that
it's something I've never run into
before huh that's weird okay so if you
have any suggestions please let me know
and we can look at fixing that so now
we're gonna jump down to the next part
so I'm gonna save my typography I don't
need that anymore
I have my index open I'm not sure if I
need it let's close it for now actually
before I close it we're going to the
next one it's just intro I have an intro
left intro middle and intro right
awesome cool so I can close this one and
I can go to my intro so my intro is this
part here so I want to build this out
with the grid but the first thing I'm
going to be doing for this one is using
flexbox and then we're gonna add the
grid functionality after so what we're
gonna do is we're going to do a dot
intro
and I'm just in right display flex and
it should sort of work actually more or
less it's not quite what we're after
obviously it's way too small and doesn't
look so good but at least we have three
columns my intro whoops
intro middle is a background of dark
blue let's bring up my design here
because I don't remember exactly what it
looks like the color of this is perfect
I think it's me I use like an opacity on
that day but it's not too bad
if I just do color white well that I
gave that a color my h2s all have a
color don't they okay so let's just
I'm putting the color on this just
assuming you know I did a right left in
middle assuming we could change things
around or add text at one point and even
though that would probably never happen
color white see this is whatever h2
color white isn't that an intro h2 it is
so wide the color not change Oh
aha okay good making it happen so that
is okay
now what I mentioned about these images
and this is where I'm going to use
something called the object fit right
and so let's just I'll just show you how
that works actually dot intro left gamma
dot intro right so I'm gonna select both
of those and and so for both of these
actually so it should be the image IMG
object fit cover it so when I first do
that nothing happens but that's because
the image is allowed to be smaller so
I'm also going to do min height of 100%
and a min width of 100% yeah there we go
and now it's actually just gonna act
like a background size of cover so you
can see that I see most of them both of
those images but as this gets smaller
they just sort of hide away so that's
really cool and I really like that so
it's a super cool thing and this object
fit cover thing so that's actually
working really really well the only
thing is this obviously looks like crap
so that's my intrumental let's give you
some padding o3m let's do a
text-align:center and it's a little bit
smushed but this is where the flexbox
fallback will not be perfect and again
most you know maybe i can do like a 3m
for top and bottom or if i do back to
two so we do 2.5 maybe and here the
color actually won't be white my color
doesn't want to be why it wants to be
RGB a white and I don't know what I did
Oh point seven cool good so this is if
you don't know with sass you can put in
a variable name comma and then the color
I think I did that and one of my other
ones but it's a nice way to have
transparent etext and that again is if I
change this background color now the
text will sort of go along with it yeah
so this is just one of those places
where it's not a perfect fall back and
I'm not gonna do anything more
complicated maybe you're not super happy
with how that looks because it gets like
a little too smushed and at the really
big screen sizes what you'll see is it's
gonna sort of it doesn't look fantastic
and actually we can fix this though
right that doesn't look nice so we can
do interim it'll display flex is yep but
we're gonna do a flex direction of
column
cool and we're gonna do a line content
center cross my fingers that no not the
line content Center aligned items no
it's me justify content sorry
just defy content center should work
cross my fingers again yeah there we go
so cool and this is where this gets
really kind of stretched out and doesn't
look fantastic you'll one thing I guess
we could do just for fun to see if this
will work padding instead of being I'll
do two point I have em for top and
bottom and left and right say I'd like
to view port with let's just see that
means as my screen gets smaller the
padding will adjust and get smaller with
it and as my screen gets bigger the
padding will adjust and get bigger with
it and that's still kind of small the
way say I made that I just don't want to
make it too big
cuz it's a little bit better I guess
it's never gonna be perfect and I'm not
trying to make this perfect because this
is more about the grid and let's just
see actually that's pretty good I'm
pretty happy with that it's not ideal
but for what I'm trying to do I'm happy
with how that is looking actually for
flexbox fallback and the reason I'm
doing my fallback first is because what
I'm gonna do now is in my intro here I'm
gonna do in hat supports so supports has
actually been around a really long time
nobody seems to know about it I didn't
know about it anyway and what you can do
in here is you can add support for stuff
so it's like a media query but only if
the browser supports it now one thing
which supports is Internet Explorer
doesn't even know what supports means
but that's fine because it just means it
skips over it and pretends it's not
actually there so that's kind of cool
the one place you can run into trouble
is if I put display grid in here for
example and the browser does support the
grid but it's like the older version of
the grid a little bit like how edges
doing things and this could get it
to sort of bug out I would worry about
it a little more except in like less
than a month edge is going to be
supporting grid so I shouldn't have to
stress about it too much
we are using flexbox do use an
autoprefixer just to make sure you can
support some of the Internet Explorer
stuff and this obviously we're using
grids so we're looking at more modern
technology this won't work in IE 8 if
you want it to well it's not going to
happen
but so supports display grid so what
this means is now instead of having this
is the original but then I can in here
say that the intro will be a display of
grid and you can see it just completely
changed my layout because now it's using
the grid instead of using the Flex so
display grid and what I'm gonna do is
grid template columns and they say 1fr
so 1fr is just like use of whatever
available space we have then I'm into a
min/max because I want this thing to be
able to grow and shrink and then I'm
gonna do a 1fr here at the end so when
if I went far and then my min max in
here remember the min max can't have
like fr units but for now my new auto
and comma 30m 30m comes out to roughly
something like 480 to 500 pixels I think
so if I save that you can see that it's
it's working right I have yeah oh it's
sort of working that's yeah even that's
fine if I don't even see those side
images does it really matter
nope it doesn't and then as this gets
bigger it was gonna try and always be
30m but if my screen is smaller than 30
M you can see they actually start to
disappear and you know what I'm actually
gonna do a min max on these too because
I want to always see the min max of the
minimum let's say it's like pretty small
30 pixels let's just say 2 M comma 1 fr
and we'll copy that over and put that
one over here at the end so I'm doing
min max min max min max let's save that
and see if it works
save so now those two little side things
that's kind of small but if I made that
before I'd have to do it for both
obviously save so those two things on
the side can't get smaller than 4m so as
long as they're the screen and you're
320 is the smallest you'll ever see so
around here is what it looks like see
the one thing I like about the grid
better than flexbox is I can control the
sizes of these a lot easier and I can
give them separate minimum and maximum
widths all with this without any media
queries and that lack of media queries
is really big for me here because what's
happening is it's getting my different
sizes so these are at their minimum this
one is set to auto which just means make
sure all the content fits that's all
so as this gets smaller and smaller and
smaller as long as all the content fits
it's fine and then once we start getting
bigger you can see those two side things
they're still staying at the minimum
size until this gets to 30m and once
that hits the 30m threshold now it
doesn't get any bigger but those two
things on the side start to grow and
what's gonna happen as this gets bigger
and bigger and bigger is it's just gonna
start growing everything staying
centered and you get this nice big thing
and this doesn't the images start
getting bigger and this just keeps it's
a nice sort of focal thing right here in
the middle which I actually think looks
pretty nice and I like how that looks I
have these little weird white lines on
the bottom that's my images do I have
here display:block that's because
they're in line items I'm assuming let's
just make that really big again to make
sure that I'm right yeah there we go I
got rid of it that's like the
inline-block little buggy thing to make
sure that it works for everything so
there we go I think that looks pretty
awesome guys I'm really happy with how
that's working overall maybe I can do a
little bit more padding on the top or
adjust my my maximum size but I like my
maximum size of the really big screen
size and I like that I don't have to use
media queries in this
really really nice that I can just do
this and again this at supports is
amazing I love how this the at supports
works and how easy it is to use and you
can use this for anything you could even
have like a float fallback if flex isn't
supported you know but again that's so
so because again some browsers don't
support at supports if the browser
doesn't know what app supports means
though it's just going to skip it over
so it's not like it's something that's
gonna really get in the way of anything
it's it's not gonna cause any major
issues it can get ignored by older
browsers the only ones that can
sometimes maybe cause an issue or ones
that understands this but aren't using
you know if they're they're not they
haven't implemented things in the same
way yet one thing that is important with
this is I didn't bring in the
autoprefixer so if you are using this I
would suggest and you wanted to push
this into production I would definitely
recommend that you Auto that you prefix
stuff especially for flex box because
Microsoft likes them you know if you
actually want this to work in Internet
Explorer with the Flex box it's going to
need some some of that so maybe we'll
add that to our gulp file later on so we
can test this out properly in all the
browsers the only thing that's missing
now is my little white lion I think I
have this little little line right there
so we can add that in right now that's
my intro h2 so we'll just do my at not
at and after on here the width looked
pretty small let's do like a 20% content
was and I said I don't do things in
order
I do things as they come into my head
which is true but I always have content
at the top I sort of have my own way of
organizing these things the height
height will be one pixel the background
will be RGB a white or 0.5 and display
will be blocked and of course it's not
showing up anywhere so let's go and see
why it's not showing up
a ch2 after is over there content
display:block ah not the first time I do
that there we go okay so then we need to
do margin:1em on the top Otto left and
right zero on the bottom actually that
looks pretty good doesn't it
that's fine that breaks onto two lines
cool so I think that looks really nice I
haven't built my media query into this
but it's just because I want to go back
and do that after cuz a lot of the media
careers will all happen at the same time
I am just focusing at the small size but
I wanted to show you guys I didn't
really need to build a media query for
this to work my only media queries that
are gonna affect this area are gonna do
what the font size is changing a little
