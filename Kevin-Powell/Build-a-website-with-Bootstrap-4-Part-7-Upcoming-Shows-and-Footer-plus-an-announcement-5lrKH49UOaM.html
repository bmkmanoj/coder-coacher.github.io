up our bootstrap 4 website in this video
so that's it this is the end this is the
last video well not the last video ever
just for the last video in this series
so we're gonna be doing the upcoming
shows section as well as the footer and
in both of them I'm going to be using
pseudo elements and for in the show
section we need to be using font awesome
to bring in our icons and then use some
pseudo elements on the price and the
date and then in the footer we're using
some pseudo elements to put those slash
things in between the social links that
are down at the bottom so that's gonna
be cool
also I'm going to be using this cool
little universal selector trick that I
think is going to work pretty well in
selecting just in one of the sections I
need to get rid of margin on a bunch of
stuff so it's pretty cool and before we
go into the video I just want to say to
stick around right to the end because I
do have a bit of a special announcement
but with that out of the way now we can
get right onto the video alright guys so
we're gonna be doing the upcoming shows
and the footer in this one before I
actually get started in coding this up
and I don't think there's a whole lot of
work I'm gonna have to do but before we
get into it one thing I am going to need
to do is get font awesome because I did
use font awesome to populate these two
things here so I have the font awesome
website open if you don't have it just
coming your font awesome dot IO click
right there on download no thanks I just
need the font awesome for that's gonna
give you a zip file so I'm going to grab
that zip file that it's giving me we're
not pretty much we just need to take
this whole thing actually so I'm going
to take this whole font awesome folder
and let's move this out of the way for a
second here's my project folder and I'm
just going to make a fonts folder in
here so I'm going to do fonts and I'm
gonna drag font awesome right inside my
fonts there and just so we can go and
look there it is there's font awesome
and everything we need is right there so
I can close down this nib and I can
close that
and now I can open up my project again
okay and I also want to open up the font
awesome site actually if you've never
used it one thing you could do is click
on get started and it sort of gives you
what you need if you want to link to
their CDN instead of downloading it into
your own folder you have to provide your
email address from I think it's just a
way for them to get it but they do give
you a unique code so you can link to
their CDN with their unique link that
they will email to you in our case we're
just linking to the regular stylesheet
I'm not even going to go in through the
less or less we're using sass in our
project but I'm just gonna link to it so
I'm going to copy the link here I mean
we could do this ourselves but I'm gonna
go in my index file here all the way up
and let's put it right before my own
it's not bootstrap CSS it's my my CSS I
don't know why I called that bootstrap
CSS before and let's do link that's just
font awesome and paste that in their
path to font awesome so this I believe
will just be fonts slash font awesome /
CSS and I'm gonna save that so here I'm
leaking to my Typekit fonts here I'm
linking to my own stylesheet I have my
own font awesome and then to my own
stylesheet right there and now we can
use it so let's move this out of the way
a little bit um so what I need to do now
is I need to get the icons that i want
so i'm gonna click over to icons and
actually well we'll get there in a
second but we are gonna use this icons
page and we'll look at how we can use
that in a second
so let's just move this out of the way
and come to here and look what we've got
so the main issues we need to fix
upcoming shows we need to change the
font on these four here and we just need
to space things out a little bit
differently right now it's all sort of
equally spaced out and I want my buttons
for example should be aligned on the
bottom and we need the little icons in
there
and I think that's about all we need to
do cool so I'm gonna go to my home yeah
I want it oh I already have it open on
the top actually so I can close that
home come all the way down and we can
start with our upcoming show section
here but let's go look also at my HTML
that I already have mm-hmm here's my nav
bar let's just shrink as much of this
down as we can here oh I don't need to
be looking at my hero
about section I don't need to be looking
at parallax is empty music we don't need
that anymore here we go so my shows so I
called this shows I think the first
thing I'm gonna do is just do a class is
equal to displayed to I think is the
font size we wanted good and I think
that would probably be centered yeah
that was centered and it has a good
amount of space underneath it hmm okay
so let's upcoming shows and then I can
just do a text center on here as well to
Center it so display 2 gives me my font
size text center is centering it so
let's just remind ourselves how we did
this we have our section of shows then
we have my container here's my text and
then I have a row I called this whole
thing shows I'm gonna call this whole
thing actually upcoming whoops upcoming
show so I'm going to change the name of
the whole section so the whole section
is upcoming shows and then my row here
that has all of them in there I'm gonna
call that one shows I don't know if I
need to do this but it's like each one
of those is my shows and then if I need
to style them a bit more specifically
each individual one could be a show so
even right away I can do shows margin
margin top of let's say 2 m so that
looks pretty good now I know I changed
my fonts on those so I had I'm gonna
have to do this the same
this is the show title did you do this
is my fault for making all of my
headings be that fun but that's okay
class is actually let's do it for all of
them at the same time so h3 there I'm
going to ctrl click to put my mouse here
too
I'm going to scroll down to the next one
h3 and let's scroll down to the last one
h3 so my class on all of those will be
show title and I'll save I also already
do I did my date in price okay good
that's good
so my show title font family should be
my songs yeah that's good perfect
let's go look at the Photoshop file just
quickly again so I've that in bold and
then that in light these are actually
smaller the font size on those is
smaller a little bit than this one
the way I did it hmm okay so what would
be the best way to do this then I have
an idea
but I don't know if I like it let me
just I'm going to try something font
size of 0.9 m okay so I don't usually do
this this is something I really avoid
most of the time of putting a font size
on a div with stuff inside of it but I
really want to be able to control all of
this really easily and this works at
doing that so I'm gonna do it in this
case but it is something that I normally
try not to do okay so I want to get rid
of these spaces under all of these and I
just want to actually there's something
that's really bothering me I want to
take off the text wrap I think you
there we go okay so for now I'm gonna
leave it like this just because it's a
little bit easier for me to see what's
going on and how everything's anything
it'll be easier for you guys to so let's
go up so I have upcoming shows right
then I have my container alright so I
have my shows then I have a column and
then I have my card and then I have my
image and then I have my card image
overlay okay so what I actually want to
do here because I want to select all of
these and put them no margin on them I
want no margin bottom on any of these so
I'm actually gonna go on this this div
is the one that has all the text inside
of it
so I'm going to call this one show info
info show info show information so and
I'm going to need to do that on all of
them so that's on all my div class card
image overlay so card image overlay I'll
select there I'm going to do them these
ones all at the same time the last three
oops there we go and so that was show
info just to make sure show info show
info okay so they're all a show info now
this is something that I don't do very
often but what I'm going to do I'm
hoping it works so show info and I'm
gonna do this and I don't use my
universal selector very often but in
this case it's being pretty specific on
what it's actually doing so this is
direct descendant so I'm selecting
everything that's a direct descendant of
show info so if we look at what that is
it's the direct descendant of show info
is my h3 these paragraphs and my button
so if on that I put a margin bottom of
zero there we go yes it worked they all
get stuck together so
none of those get it this just makes it
I mean I could select my show title I
would need to give the location in class
so I could do my show title my date my
price and say my location and and my
button only button doesn't have a margin
anyway but I could eat you know select
all of those and say margin bottom zero
but this way maybe I put other content
in here another time or something like
that so anything that's anything so this
is all every absolutely everything
that's a direct descendent of show info
we'll get a margin bottom of zero so
that's good the date I actually need
this to be bold but I need to do a few
other things so I might as well just do
date font weight is bold my bolts not
really as bold as I thought it would be
anywhere I'm gonna have to go back in
later maybe to fix that so that's okay
um here I have my small so what I'm
gonna do is my price also is a font
weight of bold but my price small is a
font weight of light light I think I
called it normal so that makes starting
at the normal font and then this $19 is
the bold I could use the small to change
the font size but I'm actually happy
with what the font size is there so now
is the fun thing now is when we want to
bring in our font awesome so I'm gonna
open that up and actually I'm just going
to make this two tabs so I don't have to
go back between the two one of them is
the calendar when I think they call it
there we go calendar uh I don't remember
which one I used I'm gonna say it was
this one I think that's the cleanest one
that we can use for this so if you've
never used font awesome there's a few
different ways you can use it I could
come in and grab this and then actually
paste it inside here so this is my
so I could paste that right in there I'm
gonna save that if I set everything up
properly which I haven't because it's
not working it means I did something
wrong here with my fonts let's just go
and see that would be my link I'm not
linking it properly so let's go and
check now to be all the way at the top
fonts so it's going into fonts it's
going into ups here we go let's just
rename this actually renamed I'll take
the version off it cannot not permitted
interesting okay so we'll just rename it
here then four point seven point zero so
I'm gonna save there we go oh I put it I
thought I was working on this one but
you can see it showed up there the thing
is okay so let's go back and see what I
was doing let's go find the second one
here it is I so here's the big thing in
piston no I wouldn't want to have to
paste this every time I every time I
have a date I want this icon to
automatically be included I don't want
to have to do it manually because having
to do that manually every single time is
a pain in the butt so what I want to do
is I want to say before so before my
date okay so in my the before of my date
what I want to do is I want to give it
some content and this is one of those
times you actually we are going to give
it content I also want it to display
block so my content in this case I'm
gonna get it by coming over to here
again and you'll notice there's a
Unicode so whenever you come on to one
of these you'll be able to find the
Unicode for it and I'm just gonna copy
that Unicode number I'm gonna do a back
slash and which is an escape character
so back slash and then my Unicode and
let's save that and it should appear
there except it's not oh and I said in
line block and I put block in line block
why if you'd get a regular blocks like
that means the fonts not working it
doesn't
and what that is and that's because I
didn't tell it that the font family is
font awesome there we go
it worked cool so we have to say of
course that the font is font awesome and
then we can put the content there and
actually let's just put a space after
and that didn't work I wasn't sure if
that space would give me a space there
but it's not so this is why
display:inline-block will let me do a
margin right it's gonna be pretty small
I'm just actually an ad to a pixel value
something like that and even the font
size on this one font size 0.8 m I'm
using M for this font size because if
ever I change this font size this one
will change with it so there we go I
think that actually looks pretty good
let's go look at the Photoshop file for
one second actually my spacing isn't
quite like what I did it there I that's
okay we're gonna fix the spacing in a
second so I want a little bit more space
on the right I can probably put that
bigger again actually yeah let's bring
that back up to how it was I want it I
was happy with my Photoshop thing there
so let's save that margin right I don't
know 0.5 M maybe will be better and I'm
gonna give it a margin top no not here
actually I'm just gonna give my date a
margin top margin top of 1.5 m and
that's probably too big 1.25 M so if we
looked at my original file there was a
separation between the date so I took
all the margin bottoms off and then I'm
just creating this spacing here with a
margin top awesome so that looks good so
now I need the same thing for my price
icon so let's go back I think I've used
like a ticket I don't know if it was
actually called tickets or try cons so
what they called it it is ticket cool so
I'm gonna do exactly the same thing grab
the Unicode so then for my price I have
my small and then I have my and before
and actually the easiest thing here
might just be to copy you copy that
yep paste here and change this so this
is F 145 save that there we go awesome
that looks super nice I'm really happy
with that the last thing I want to do is
align my buy tickets down at the bottom
and this is actually really nice and
easy to do once again with flexbox
flexbox gives us opportunities to align
stuff so what I'm going to do is I'm
wondering I was going to do it the way
I've done it throughout where I was
adding the classes in here and I'm just
wondering yeah cuz I want it on the card
right no no I want it on this one so
I've already made show info because this
is the one I'd want to be display flex
so I I've already shown you guys how to
do it with with bootstrap by adding the
classes directly on to control flex box
in this case just so I don't have to
repeat the classes a whole bunch of
times here for all of my cards that I
have I think what I'm gonna do is I'm
just going to do it up here so I'm going
to do my show info is a display flex
we'll save that and see if it breaks
everything yep so then I'm gonna do my
flex direction of column and there we go
it's back to normal
okay so with that this is now flexing it
looks just like it did but now I can
come on my buttons and I can align them
up on the bottom now either way I would
prefer to make a new class for this
because I don't like nesting you know I
could do this by doing button and doing
some rules on this because then any
button that's in the show info will act
this way technically it would be a
little bit easier now this this is a
nice trick with
flexbox you can't do this if you're not
using flexbox but I'll do I'll show you
what I'm doing what this is doing if I
did nest it which I said I'm not going
to but if I did nest these margin-top
Auto I think we'll push them down to the
bottom yeah use it margin Auto stuff
works differently with Flex box and it
works in cool ways so my margin top auto
will just make it push it down all the
way to the bottom pretty much it's sort
of like just aligning align it down
you're making your margin top as big as
it needs to be so that's pretty cool so
I can also do that with a class so if
you want to nest it on yours go ahead
and nest it in my case what I'm gonna do
is we're gonna grab my button button
primary here and I can do an margin top
Auto and let's see there we go that
worked so I'll do all my other buttons
so I have my primary primary primary
space MT Auto Save and there we go
they're all lined up automatically on
the bottom now the one thing where this
layout broke was at the very small
screen sizes so again I think I did
these olives and em small three so I
think this is gonna change to an MD
three and so actually I should select
all of them at the same time small
actually let's just put it right here at
the end of the three select that one
actually I keep going back here but
let's just make our lives a lot easier
to see what we're doing by collapsing
all of that down so we can select all of
my columns I want these to all be a
medium three instead of a small three
and let's try column small six save that
and let's see what this does so at my
large screen sizes it looks good medium
it's or yeah I guess that's medium still
and then when I hit small I guess that's
the new medium so it's busted there
already and then it should
turn into four and then they go like
that and now I still have that problem I
had up top see my images are stretching
at this screen size this is an Owen bug
with this version of the Alpha from the
reading I've done so there's nothing I
can do about that and I'm actually going
to change this to an L just change all
of them at the same time LG and these
will get changed to an MD save so that
looks okay and then here that should
jump there we go
turns into the blocks of four and then
it goes and they stack one on top of
each other awesome very cool very very
nice and I'm super happy with that the
last thing we need to do now is our
footer and our footer does need a new
file is our footer like our other things
it will go in components our navigation
is something that's on every single page
our parallax was something that was
designed to be able to work on every
single page and our footer is something
that obviously can go on every single
page so I'm going to save this file go
into there my s CSS file components and
it's underscore footer got s CSS go to
my main under components add import
components slash footer and for once
I'll remember to put my semicolon at the
end and okay so for the footer there's
not a lot we need to do I'm just going
to do a margin whoops
footer we'll put a margin top on it top
of like 3m 4m so let's try four that
looks pretty good our background on it
should be black some padding on it
padding 1.5 m zero see what that looks
like I have more space on the bottom
probably because this paragraph has some
margin on it
is that let's just go look at how yeah
that's a paragraph so there's a little
bit of margin on that um what if I just
did 2m 1.5 m that looks pretty good
okay so that looks nice the color on
here is wrong so my color should be
something like gray light that looks
much better I was gonna make my name a
link or whatever let's just focus on
these links here
those I think I gave them they're in my
list items there oh they're just in line
list items this is somewhere where I
will use nesting just like I will with a
nav I do nest links that are in a footer
it doesn't bother me that much so these
will have a color of gray let's go with
light gray light as well on there
because that's just too dark okay and
let's actually make give these an
underlying text-decoration:underline so
I can see them that they're links that
we can click on and let's go look at my
Photoshop file I know I didn't underline
them here I just did it like that
actually hmm okay nevermind you know
what it's pretty obvious they're links
if you look at them so let's just leave
it like that
save I'm actually wondering I said I was
gonna leave these just like that but I
think I'm actually gonna come on all of
these and call them social links so I
changed my mind a bit um so I'm gonna
remove that
except I called it social links but it's
not on the link itself social should I
call it social links I'm actually ok
let's leave that like that let's leave
it like that it's ok the reason for this
is I want to do my social links if I did
this on the a it wouldn't really work
how I want this to work so I'm gonna
have to do it on my social that I want
to do this on the list items basically
so my social links will have a ok let's
do it I want to do first
let's do social links before and what I
want to do is I want to add those things
so my social links before I want to add
the slashes between content will be a
forward slash display:inline-block and
let's just save and see what happens
there we go so you can see that I'm
getting those slashes everywhere and
let's just add a space here it's not
gonna work it's not gonna work
that's ok ok so that's what's giving me
that line in between each I'm also going
to change the color of these color is
gonna be RGB a are no you know what
transparent eyes this is a fun one to
use so I can transparent eyes my light
and my gray light and how much do I want
to make it transparent let's make it
like point 0.5 and maybe even point 4 so
transparent eyes just turns RGB a it
turns this into like an RGB a actually I
think I can even do RGB a and just do a
gray light comma point 0.4 can I do that
yeah I can do that too so I don't really
need to do transparent eyes RGB a you
can put in the color you want with the
value and in sass it will turn that into
an RGB a value
so that's cool
and now I need I don't want this one to
have a slash so links social links for
social links not first of type there we
go so I'm selecting all my social links
except the one that's first of type so
not selecting the first of type but I'm
selecting the before so before of all of
my social links first of type and I have
text wrap on here too which is kind of
annoying you toggle soft wrap and we can
just make this bigger for a second so
before all of my social links but not
the first of type first of type is the
first one so the first one doesn't get
that slash there then I can say my
social links have margin of 0 and I
don't know 3m to space them out quite a
bit except they don't have enough room
and that's way too much space 1m oh and
even okay I want the space social links
okay I screwed this up a little bit I
want this to be part of the link know I
had that in the right spot yeah I want
that on my list item okay yeah okay no
and then I can say my social links okay
so what am i let's take this off and
take this off okay so that's good now
what I'm going to do is my social links
mice of the links that are social links
my naming on this was was very bad but
my my a tags that are social links
inside of social links
we'll have let's save the color of gray
light so this is exactly what we had
before and these will have a margin I
actually have to change my display
display of inline-block
and now I can do my margin of zero 1m
awesome so that we're getting my spacing
on both sides cool good and the reason
this is working is I'm putting the -
effectively this hole before thing is
just inserting a little like it's doing
this so it's doing it before my link on
each one of them so I have to put my
margin on the link itself to get space
on both sides of my link so if I save
that we're good except I don't have
enough room and maybe it's just because
it's in a small five I have a seven and
a five
this doesn't need to be a seven I think
the space is too much actually it's do a
zero point five first and this could
even be like a five and a seven there
that makes more sense the space is a
little bit off just because so margin
what if I just did zero and then 0.6 m
that looks more equal it's a bit of a
magic number there just didn't get
something to perfectly work but it works
so I think that looks pretty good so
yeah what I did there is I'm adding in
the social links before so whenever you
use the before it's putting it before
the content that's inside of there
so right here I'm adding a forward slash
inside of each one of those so I can't
add the margin to these because if I add
the margin to this it's would put space
on one side here but it would keep them
glued together that's the problem I ran
into so by doing this where I'm putting
the margin on my links themselves now I
can get the spacing in between them just
make sure because I use the small on
that and I just want to see where that's
gonna break at see it's doing that so
this is gonna get changed over to an MD
even an LG I think save that's fine and
then it goes like that and do we do a
text-align:center at the small screen
sizes
would that make more sense I think it
would make more sense again I do I want
this space they're not really so let's
just make this at the small screen sizes
be text-align:center so that would just
be a footer text-align:center
that looks pretty sweet and then what we
can do is @include break point break
media media break point up large because
that's where it changes we will do a
text-align:left
save so that should make it so we're
center-aligned and then when I get to
the large screen size and they're no
longer stacked on top of each other they
go like that and the text alignment
changes cool and actually I just saw
that this is not I want this one aligned
on that side that's what's that one
called I don't want it just on those I
need this whole thing I could do a on
this whole column I can do it text isn't
it text right but then it's always going
to be text right I don't think there's
media queries built into that like here
it looks good now but obviously once it
breaks it no longer it looks good we
always get to the end and run into these
silly little problems so what this is
actually in eighth held I'm going to
change the social social links and this
will be a social link that makes more
sense right
so all of my social links so this is my
social link a actually doesn't matter
they're actually social link and then
what I can do is my social links plural
is @include whoops that include media
break point up large text-align:right so
save save everything saved everything's
working
that's right aligned that's left aligned
we are laughing we're in business
let's just go all the way back up to the
top and take a look to see if there's
anything that catches our attention but
I think it's done
we are finished we have wrapped it up
let's just go look at the small screen
sighs one last time again double check
it again those stretch pictures I sadly
can't do anything about oh sweet I'm
really happy with how this project
turned out amazing
and that's it guys we're all wrapped up
the site is done I think it's looking
fantastic I hope you like it so that's
it for the website it's all wrapped up
but as I said I have a special
announcement and that special
announcement is that I've started a
patreon page now if you don't know what
patreon is it's a place where you can
financially support creators that you
really like so in this case so if you're
not sure what patreon is very quickly
it's a place where you can support
creators who make awesome stuff whether
it's YouTube videos podcasts people who
write books draw stuff and with the
support that you give them you get perks
in return so some of the perks that I'm
offering up on my patreon page are some
behind-the-scenes stuff ability to take
part in the deciding of what videos are
coming up next through some polls and
stuff like that I'm even looking at
starting up a code pen Pro which is
going to let people like a professor
mode we can follow along with me in
copÃ¡n live as I'm doing stuff in making
videos so if you want more details on
all of us go down to the link below and
you can check that out you can see how
the whole thing works I have an intro
video there that goes into more detail
as well as just more there's a lot more
information over on the site in general
if you already know what patreon is
awesome you know I hope you're already
supporting some other creators and if
you want to support me I would be so
grateful honestly it would it would make
me feel amazing that you find that much
value in what I do if you don't want to
support me you are who you are cuz
you're watching my videos hopefully
you're leaving some comments below the
community is growing you're spreading
the word that's all I can really you
know that's awesome that's amazing
already but for those who are able to
that's awesome I know some people always
get a little worried with a patreon the
thing with when creators use patreon
they're going to limit the original
content that's free and then they're
gonna start only putting stuff up on the
patreon I'm not doing that
everything here stays the same I'm not
planning on changing anything that I'm
doing here it's extra stuff
over there and that's it things here are
gonna stay the same the type of content
will stay the same I'm gonna have series
of their short videos it's on me free
there's no changes in any of that it's
optional extras that's all patreon is so
thank you so much for watching this
video thank you so much for watching
this entire series and thank you for
sitting through my whole spiel there on
patreon and I look forward to seeing you
in the next video and until next time
don't forget to make your corner to the
Internet just a little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
