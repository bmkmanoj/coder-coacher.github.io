probably need fall backs in at this
point and save do you have like 78% or
so support it's close but of course
Internet Explorer yeah so you know feels
like the old days sometimes with this
stuff but it is what it is luckily fall
backs are really easy to do so we're
gonna see that in this video
sadly it's kind of annoying to do them
so in the next video we're gonna get up
jump into some more advanced sass and
see how we can actually make it so we
can write less code and still have to
fall backs so it's just for now we're
just looking at how fall backs work and
you're gonna see it's super duper easy
let's go and check that out
alright so here we go we're in code pen
so as usual the link for this will be
shared down below um so what we're doing
with this one is we're looking at how to
create our fallback for it so I've just
coded up my thumbnail for this actually
it was kind of fun so if you want to see
how I did it you can look in here a
little bit more but basically this big
background area is in my background Dave
I have my title which is there you
didn't see in the h1 which is all of
this and then my number that's right
there so there's not too much markup
going into this if we look into here I
do have these and everything's looking
fantastic right so you're going why do
we need to worry about browser support
well this is why
here's Internet Explorer and this isn't
then this is the current Internet
Explorer I'm up to date on this um so
that sort of sucks right that it just
doesn't work here edge is now supporting
things but Internet Explorer and a few
others aren't so just to take a look at
quickly at that we can see here that
Internet Explorer no support Opera Mini
no support and the UC browser for
Android which has a really big usage at
eight point two four percent so we're
only looking at seventy-seven percent
which is kind of on the low side but
even edge it was had some issues but now
it's it's supported fully so we're
getting much much much better so
basically what we need to do is we want
to come through and and this is we're
kind of annoying but I have my light
blue here so let's just take that and
copy that value and we'll come down and
find my background where I've used it so
here I have used the variable of light
blue for
much the fallback is just to write the
initial value originally on top and
that's it so I'm saying this is my color
and then this is my color so if you know
how the Cascade works if I did color red
underneath that one's gonna win because
it's reading this one first then it's
reading this one and then it's reading
that one so this is the last one so this
one wins so the idea here is it's going
to read this one first then it's gonna
read this one if it understands what the
variable is it's going to use this if it
doesn't understand this it's going to
ignore it and it's just going to use
this one here so basically if you do
want to create fallbacks you're going
through and you're just you know putting
all of anywhere you used your variable
so I have here in my background as that
so just to show you that this is working
I'm gonna save what I've done here and
let's open up Internet Explorer again
and refresh this and you can see it's
starting to come together so my blue
color is working here and my yellow
color is working in there but you're
probably also looking at this one what's
the point in CSS variables now you know
if I have to write it without the
variable and then with the variable what
the hell is even the point in using
variables that's a good question it does
seem redundant to both and it kills the
joy of using them so they still do have
some big advantages which include making
the changes on the fly with JavaScript
really easy which we're gonna be seeing
in a couple of videos from now but to
help get rid of all the redundancy of
having to do this sass can make our life
so much easier because we can make a
little sass map and then a function and
then use a mixin it takes a little bit
of time to set up but it's not overly
complicated and I'm gonna show you how
you can do that in the next video so
yeah fall backs they're easy to do but
it sort of is really redundant and kills
almost the point of them not quite but
it takes away from the magic of the
variable in the next video and it's
already there so you can jump right into
it for me a lot more of an advanced
video we're looking at sass we're gonna
be building a function we're gonna be
using a sass map and we're gonna use
mixing a lot of fun look forward to
seeing you there if you'd like this
video please hit the thumbs up don't
forget to leave a comment if you have
any questions any comments whatsoever
and of course until next time don't
forget to make your core in the Internet
just a little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
