me today you found the second video in
my introduction to HTML and CSS if
you're just getting your feet wet within
the fabulous world of web development
well you found the right place and I
encourage you to go check out the first
video if you didn't see that one today
we're actually gonna be writing some
HTML so well what are we waiting for
let's get started in the last video we
looked at how HTML works the only thing
is as much as I'd love people to make up
my own tags like I did in that last
video we just can't do that there are
lots of tags out there but luckily there
are only a few of them that you'll need
to know to really get started as a quick
side note don't be shy about pausing or
even rewinding the videos you go do this
at your own pace and make sure you
understand as you go along instead of
just blindly following and having no
idea what you're really doing and if I
can fuse you with anything let me know
in the comments and I'll do my best to
clarify before we can get started we
need some software to write our code in
there are lots of free options out there
and the one I mean to be using for my
demos is called Adam which I have on my
screen right now it's completely free
there are other free ones out there that
are really popular like notepad we can
see right here notepad plus plus I
should say as well as brackets which you
can see right here so if you don't have
a code edit or pause the video follow
one of the links I'm gonna put links in
the description below and download one
of them and join me back here once
you're ready to go
so you've installed your code editor but
what do we do with it well the very
first step to building a website is to
create a place for it to live so I'm
gonna go and make a new folder on my
desktop so I'm just gonna right click
new folder and my first website and
there we go I got a nice little folder
there and this is where my websites
going to live it's the root directory
anything that I need for my site is
going to be in there now I want to open
this up in my code editor so I'm going
to right click and if you're using atom
or brackets I have both of them right
there I can just click on open with atom
and we wait for the program to open
and there we go so I opened up my folder
let's just bring it on the screen so you
guys can see it a little bigger there we
go great so I've got it open but there's
nothing here so we actually need to go
ahead and start working now one thing if
you are using like Adam like I am it's
possible you don't have anything along
the top here so if you want to get to
any of them if you just have to push alt
the Alt key on the keyboard brings up
this little menu so to make your first
file we just go to file and file new or
you can use them either if you're on a
Mac command N or on a PC ctrl n to make
your new file and I have a nice little
untitled file here now one thing you
have to know is code editors they can
get with lots of different types of
files just like with Microsoft Word you
can save a doc file the new docx files
PDFs and some other stuff from there as
well RTF s-- and whatnot and it's a
little bit of the same deal here except
there's no default they don't it's not
like word where the default is a doc and
then there's all these other options in
this case there's no default there's a
whole bunch of different things from
HTML CSS JavaScript PHP asp.net it just
goes on and on and on really so we need
to tell it what type of file this is
going to be and the best way to do that
are the only really way is to save our
file so I'm gonna come down to here and
hit save and it's going to ask me how I
want to save my file and I'm gonna call
it index dot HTML and I have to write
the HTML out it's not like those other
ones as I just mentioned there's no
default so I'm gonna write out dot HTML
and I'm gonna push save and we can get
going um
now there's annum there's a reason I'm
calling it index.html and it has to do
with house servers work and my index is
with a lowercase I we're always just
going to be using lowercase stuff and
just for now know that whatever you want
your home page to be that has to be your
index.html we don't use home page
EML or home dot html' or anything else
the the home page of your site is your
index dot HTML so we've got our HTML
file but well what do we need to do now
a good thing to do is actually to open
up your page so I'm gonna minimize this
for one second
I'm gonna find my folder and I'm going
to open up my index.html and let's just
bring that onto the screen so you can
see it and it's a nice blank document
right now so let's fix that up a little
bit and this is usually how I like to
work let's open atom backup okay there
we go so basically what I want is I want
my code editor on the side here and I
want my browser over here so I can see
the two of them at the same time while I
work so I can save here and then I can
update this and see what I'm actually
doing in general the way I work is I
always have my code editor on the left
and my browser on the right just because
that's how I'm used to working but you
can set this up however you want some
people put one on top one on the bottom
or you know this could be but it doesn't
it doesn't matter how you set it up but
I like having always everything set up
just so I can see both of them really
easily and now the real fun begins we
need to start writing some HTML so if
you remember everything in HTML all the
code goes inside of triangle brackets
let's give me an ER because I have
nothing in there and the first thing we
need to do is put in this line of code I
have to say doctype HTML so just like my
code editor can create a whole bunch of
different types of files my the browser
can read lots of different files it can
be a CSS file javascript file or an HTML
file PHP file there's a whole bunch so
this is a really important line it
always goes right at the top and it's
telling the browser that it's looking at
an HTML file this is sort of the
standard way of writing it where this is
always in capitals so it's exclamation
mark let's make that a little bigger so
we have our exclamation mark doctype and
then the HTML and it's all inside of my
triangle brackets now this part can seem
a little bit redundant but what I'm
gonna do now is I'm gonna come down and
I'm going to put HTML and what we want
to do next is we need to close our HTML
so I'm open triangle bracket I'm writing
out HTML closing triangle bracket and
then down here at the bottom the same
thing but with my forward slash just
like we looked at the last video so this
is seems a bit silly we're telling our
document our browser that we're looking
at an HTML file and then we're coming
here and we're telling it that starting
here will be each tml and the HTML ends
here but as redundant as it seems we do
have to do it and one thing you'll
notice is everything I put in my tags is
lower case except for this doctype in
general everything in the tags lower
case and you'll be good to go so a few
other new tags that we're gonna look at
every website has two parts to it it has
what we called a head close head and the
body close body
now let me space this out a little bit
and I'll put more space there I would
normally put all this space but I just
want to make it a bit easier for you
guys to see so here I'm opening my head
and I'm closing my head and here I'm
opening my body and I'm closing my body
the head is where the extra information
goes this stuff doesn't show up on the
screen but it's essential to getting
things to work properly plus we can add
a little bit of extra info in there too
and the body this is where all the
content goes anything we want the person
to see on their screen in their browser
here that has to go inside the body
right here and well maybe it'll be a
little bit boring I'm actually gonna
start by doing a few little things up
here in the head first so I'm gonna come
in the head and I'm going to write title
and
my first web site and I'm gonna close
title so I'm gonna save my file and then
I have to come over to my browser and
I'm gonna hit this little refresh and
I'm about to push it but what I want you
to do right now if you see this tab here
it just says index.html and when i
refresh now it says my first website so
the title isn't something that shows up
on my page because it's inside the head
it's extra information and it's being
used for the tab up here another place
where the title will be used is if
someone does a google search for your
website it's the title that shows up in
the google search it's not actually
content from your site that will be
there so there's one other little thing
that I'm gonna add in the head here
which is called meta tag so anyone who's
done a little bit of photography
probably knows what the meta or what
meta information is and it's sort of
extra information in photography when
you take a picture with the digital
camera it's gonna save the ISO it's
going to save the shutter speed probably
even the location and time and date and
all those things so all that information
is saved with the photo but if you look
at the photo you don't see it you have
to use some software to you know get
that extra information so a meta tag
like this is a little bit the same
there's a lot of different ones but the
only one that's essential is the car set
UTF and you can see this is actually
Auto filling for me so I'm going to go
right there and double click on it and
get my car set utf-8 and this seems a
little strange basically we're just
telling the browser what character set
we're using it's all about the
characters that are embedded so all
these letters that are on the screen the
computer doesn't really know it and F is
it's using this encoding system and
utf-8 is sort of the standard for most
languages these days and it just saves
all the characters that we'd ever want
to put on the screen and we have to tell
the browser that this is what we're
going to be using the other thing you'll
notice here and most of these code
editors do this by default but my head
is here and it's closing here
click there it's even underlining it to
make it more obvious and then this is
indented and this indentation is just to
make it more visually obvious that this
stuff is inside there so I could write
it like this it wouldn't make any
difference to the browser but by having
it spaced out and you can either do that
with the tab key and I'll come here and
I'll push tab and it creates just that
space other people like using the
spacebar I'll put two or some people put
four spaces and it's just to make a nice
visual representation that this stuff is
inside my head and you can even do the
same thing here with your title if you
wanted to so I have open title this is
inside my title tag and then close title
but I think it's just a little easier to
read for a nice little short thing like
that just to put it like that for my
title now we can finally put some stuff
on our page we can actually see some
things showing up here so let's just
jump right into our body tag and I'm
gonna push tab because I'm inside my
body tag and right let's just you know
my first website I'm gonna push save
refresh and look at that I have some
content on my page I've just noticed
what I'm saving most of the time here
I've been pushing ctrl s or if you're on
a Mac that would be command S which is
you know file and just save I'm so I'm
whenever you see me doing this I'm just
ctrl essing and then refreshing it's
much faster for me than having to jump
up here every time so I've been doing
that just in case you're wondering why
you don't see me saving the file and I
can still get it to work so we don't
really have much content on our page
right now but hey it took us a lot of
work just to get to this point so give
yourself the knife pat on the back for
making it this far and in the next video
we're gonna start looking at really
putting some content in here because
this this little line of text isn't very
much so we're gonna start exploring
paragraphs and headings and getting some
some content on there that looks a
little bit better but be happy with what
you have in a little pro tip I'm gonna
clean this up a little bit let's just
take out some of this extra space that I
don't need
and I don't really need this line and
you could you know every single page
you're gonna make is always gonna start
with this is the very basic so you could
save this document just like that and
use it as a bit of a template file for
every time you're starting up a new
project it's a nice starting point
especially when you're starting off this
is all you're really going to need for
your first few little things so you
might as well save it and just keep this
as a little template that you can reuse
every time so you don't necessarily have
to rewrite all of this each and every
time so I really hope you learned
something watching this I hope that it
made sense and I hope that it's nice and
clear and that you've been able to
follow along if it wasn't clear if you
have any questions whatsoever
hit me up down in the comments below I
definitely will get back to you and keep
on watching we're gonna get on and be
doing a lot of really cool stuff it
starts off really slow we have a white
page some black text on there but really
really soon you're gonna be doing
something really awesome so keep
following along subscribe to the channel
so you don't miss any of the videos that
are coming up and have yourselves a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
