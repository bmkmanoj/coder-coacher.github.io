series on HTML and CSS for beginners my
name is Kevin and today we're looking at
styling links so styling links gets its
own video because it's a bit of a weird
thing and I have to introduce something
called pseudo classes pseudo classes are
kind of weird but they're not that
complicated we can delete this this is
from our last video we're not using it
anymore now if we look at this one what
do we have I've just taken a very
similar document to what we had in the
last one but I've replaced our little
spans with some links in here and I want
to make these links look a lot nicer so
if you remember well let's just look at
one thing really fast I have my
paragraph here and on my paragraph I'm
going to change the color of it again
let's just do color red so it really
stands out the big difference that I'm
making to it and all my text becomes red
but my links don't my links stay blue
and it's a really ugly blue the default
and has that underline on there that
isn't the nicest the main reason for
that and let's just get rid of a few of
these things here that I don't really
want either and that last one we can
keep all of my text changed to red but
my my fonts didn't change my links
didn't change to red and what that's
kind of weird cuz my links are in my
paragraph and I told you guys that when
you style something that you know that
style cascades down so when I changed
this something in my body that would
cascade down into the paragraphs and
affect the paragraphs so how come when I
change something on my paragraph it
doesn't cascade down and take over in
the links and the reason for that is the
Cascade works as long as that thing
doesn't have a style on it so for
example when I change my body right now
if I come up to my body and I changed
this color to green and I can't spell
but if I change that over to green and I
save this doesn't become green so that
style is cascading throughout but
because my paragraphs have a specific
color on them this color wins and well
I've never told my links that they need
to be blue the browser is telling them
that the
need to be blue it's a default style
just like my paragraphs right now are
not right now but before the last video
my paragraphs there was space between
them even though I never told them to
have space there's a whole bunch of
defaults that our systems have or the
browser's have and one of them is that
links have to be blue and the only way
we can overcome that is if we use the a
tag so I'm going to select my a and
let's do color let's just do it yellow
so we see it change and now I see my
links change and the underline of course
changing with it so that doesn't look
fantastic but at least it worked let's
make them black maybe that might be
nicer and this red that's try fire brick
just so it doesn't look too ugly yeah
that looks a little bit nicer so that
looks okay
I want my links to stand out and they're
jumping out and I'm pretty happy with it
but what if I want a hover effect a lot
of places when you put the mouse on top
you see the the link change and this is
where we have to get into something
called pseudo classes don't want to make
it too complicated but a pseudo class
it's a selector that we can do the
selecting beat element in different
states of being if that makes sense so
just let's actually look at it for a
second as someone new a I'm gonna put a
colon and a merit hover and let's do a
hover color yellow and again just so we
can really see it refresh and now when I
hover over so I bring my mouse on top
its changing over to that yellow so this
is the pseudo class of a so it's I have
my regular link and then there's this
special state of being for my link when
my mouse goes on top it's a hover State
so I'm selecting this class that only
exists when I'm hovering my mouse on top
of it so that that state of the link can
come and go that's why it's a pseudo
class and the color can change to yellow
and you don't only have to change the
color I could even say font
font size 50 pixels and I could say
font-family
serif let's save that and refresh and
please never do this on your site it's
for just to show you that it works but
that is the worst user experience in the
world so don't do that but just to show
you can change different properties for
the hover effect so yeah we don't want
to be doing things like that but I
wanted to show you that you can now
there's not only the hover State there's
actually four different states there's
the normal link state so this is just
the default link so in its not gonna
count for the hover or anything else
only when it's a normal link that hasn't
been touched or Harvard or anything I
have my a link so my normal sort of
default link e style thing my hover is
when I hover over it how it's going to
change another one I have is a visited
and you've all seen visited link styles
before especially when you're on google
let's go over to google and just put in
CSS font family to see I've probably
clicked on things in here before you can
see a few of these are in purple maybe
you can see it um
so Google does this where to let you
know what you know that you've been
clicking on things and what have you
visited when haven't you visited you
know because it's purple if you've seen
it and it's not purple if you haven't
visited so let's try this out and close
that too let's give this a color of pink
I'm gonna make my links that I visited
pink so when i refresh this you'll
notice they've all changed a pink and
what happened there well because I just
used dummy links and I've been I guess I
accidently clicked on one before it said
I've already visited this page in the
past so all of my links changed so just
to show you if I put in a link I haven't
visited whoops
that was right if I save that this will
go back to black so the hover is still
there and this is when a link I haven't
been to and this is a link I have been
to so that's the link I have visited and
there's one last one and the last one is
a div and we'll use another different
color I have yellow I have pink I have
black let's put in Luke we'll go back to
the default link blue color the way the
active works is I have my regular link I
have my hover I have my visited so links
that I've already been to and the last
thing I have is my active and the active
is while I'm clicking down on the link
so I'm going to come off of that so when
I click down it's changing and then when
you let go of the mouse it goes away
active States let's be honest most
people click and it's finished that's it
no click click click you can see it's
flashing there because I have a really
big difference between it are you
usually gonna have a an active have you
ever noticed that really my guess is no
you can throw in in there if you want
though I'm showing all four of them to
you so something that's really important
guys they have to be in this order and
one of the reasons they have to be in
this order is because the CSS is reading
it in this order so it's gonna read my
regular link first and make it black and
then it goes oh it's not just a link
though it's a visited link so it's going
to overwrite that black and make it pink
let's just say you decided to put your
hover first so my hover is here and
let's refresh my page and well why is my
hover not working well what it's doing
is it goes okay well when something's
hover it when I have a link that's being
hovered on top of I'm gonna make it
yellow except oh that's also a link and
my links have to be black or in this
case my visited which has to be pink so
whatever the case is these are coming
after my hover so they're overwriting it
because both of these links are both you
know it's a hover link and well it's a
link and this one here is
and it's a visited link so it's doing
hover and visited visited as second in
my CSS so visited wins so it's just
really important that this is the exact
order you go in the same thing with the
active if you do want an active when I'm
clicking down right now whoops let's
refresh when I'm clicking down right now
it's active but I'm also hovering on top
at the same time my mouse is hovering on
the link it's on top of the link and I'm
clicking so both of these two are you
know they're both in play so it's
changing it to blue but because I'm
active this one here or because I'm also
hovering this one here is winning
because its second in my CSS so it's
really important that you put all four
of these in this order if you're using
them all and if you're not using one
well you can just you know leave it out
and then it won't apply refresh and we
can see my links are black you'll notice
this has gone back to the default purple
though because I don't have a visited
color anymore so I could have the a link
and my a visited color black and that
makes them all black and the other
option I have is just to put a here so
my links I'm not worrying about the
pseudo states of them I'm just saying
all my links are black except my hover
is going to overwrite that and become
yellow so this doesn't worry about the
pseudo states of them are the pseudo
classes it's just covering all my bases
and then I can overwrite any of the
pseudo classes that I want with that how
can we make our links look a little
nicer a lot of people like getting rid
of that line on the bottom so you can
just come in and do a
text-decoration:none and that will get
rid of that line so in the last video we
looked we have text decoration we have
underline over line or the strikethrough
and if you have one you want to get rid
of like in this case you can just do a
text-decoration:none and it will get rid
of your underline and that's something
that a lot of people like to do
important though make sure your links do
standout you don't want your links just
to fade into your site
um you need to make sure that people can
see them so I like having hover States
on them and I like making sure that the
color or something about them stands out
enough so people realize that they can
probably click on them I usually don't
do a really big hover like that though
my hover will usually be something like
I'm using black so let's just do like a
5 5 5 5 5 5 is like a little light gray
so there's a difference but it's subtle
but it's enough that you know the user
will see a little flash of color they'll
see that it is interactive I see the
little hand icon there's enough things
going on there that I'm aware that I can
click on it whereas if I made this
firebrick and I made this firebrick if
all my text looks exactly that there's
no underlines people won't know what
they can click on there's also a focus
which we might as well bring up since
for accessibility purposes and I'm gonna
do color let's just do yellow actually
again just to highlight the difference
and focus is instead of hovering on top
some people will visit websites hope I
never refreshed by pushing the tab
button on their keyboard so you can
cycle through your tabs you might be
going not many people do that but some
people with accessibility problems might
not being able to use a mouse or for
various other reasons they're not going
through like this so the focus you can
give it its own little look there and a
lot of the time it will be the same as
your hover so a nice little trick and
something I haven't looked at yet is to
select or have multiple selectors have
the same property so I've made a hover
I'm about a comma and then do a focus
and they don't have to be on two lines I
could write it like that if I wanted to
but I just find it easier to if you have
like four or five in a row sometimes so
the comma separates them I can't use a
space the space is something completely
different we haven't got to yet but I
can use a comma to separate and now both
my hover is that light gray
and when I tab through and I use my
focus state that's also gonna be the
same light gray so that's it for this
video just a quick look at styling our
links and the different things we can do
with our links I hope you liked it I'm
getting pretty excited because we're
getting closer and closer to the end of
