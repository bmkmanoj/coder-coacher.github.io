where we're gonna be looking at how to
build out a mobile navigation menu using
flexbox now bonus you're getting two
videos today our ride
so this first video here is just going
to be all about styling everything using
flexbox it's a different way to build up
the navigation you're gonna see it's
really really awesome and when that
video is done there will be a card on
the side where you can click and get
right away into part two where we're
gonna look at that jQuery and how to
build up the whole thing all of that out
of the way let's jump right into it so
the very first thing I'm going to do is
close a few of these files that we were
last using I'm gonna close my typography
and my buttons I don't need any more
colors I'll leave open just in case base
I still need no I don't need my base
main grid I can close for now one thing
you might notice it's a bit different
there's a pre pro six config file here I
can actually delete my old one I've
upgraded pre pros to the newest version
which is six I'm a little bit late to
the party they upgraded it a while ago
you can see I've gone with a dark UI the
layouts a little bit different but you
know functionality is all the same so
it's doing the same things it was doing
before so to get started with my
navigation and make a new file and let's
do a save as in here I am going to jump
into my layout there it is and we will
do a nav no that was weird okay so there
we go I have my nav file that's good and
ready to go so I have a few different
things I'm gonna have to do in here and
one of them I turned off my layout
header probably mean nav okay I can take
this over here we want to see my main
nav now so we're gonna save that it
should appear back cool actually there's
another thing I put my main nav all of
mine abs are in an on styled list so I
do I'm gonna start with that which
should go in my base file
unstyled list you know the basics of any
unstyled list margin:0 padding:0
list-style:none did I not do that
properly cuz list on my ul base base
base there we go I made a little typo in
there so that looks better and now I can
close that down in my nav ok so we're
gonna go to my nav actually we also have
to go to my main before I forget this
layout import layout to slash nav and in
here we can start working so the first
thing I'm gonna do and remember I'm
using flexbox so I actually I want to
keep them sort of like that so this is
my main nav and what do I want to do
with my main nav there's a few things I
want to do so let's start by giving it a
background color I'm gonna give it a
background of accent I think we'll keep
accent not sure but we'll start with
that I want it to be full screen so
we're gonna give it a position of
absolute and then top the zero left our
bottom 0 right 0 left 0 that should do
but that's going in the header
oh my main header is position absolute
oh okay I can fix that um okay there's a
couple things I put my header I give it
a top of one M which is gonna create
this space here instead of on my nav
here I could give my top like a negative
one M that could work
the only problem with that is I find it
a little bit hacky and it might not be
super easy to remember you know
maintainability of the site that's kind
of awkward so I think what I'd rather do
is put my top here to zero and just give
it a padding top of one M and that sort
of fixes all of that now for the issue
of because this is position:absolute but
it's inside my header it's being
constrained by the header there you know
my bottom zero stops it here so I'm
actually going to take the bottom off
and I'm gonna give it a height of 100
viewport height so that should there we
go
it's filling up the whole screen so
remember I'm doing mobile first this is
my mobile navigation and when I turn on
my navigation I'm going to want it to
fill up the whole screen it's gonna take
over the screen when somebody opens up
the navigation good good good I think
that's it for there we just have to
obviously style what everything looks
like inside there now so I'd mentioned
that I want my to use flexbox as much as
possible so I'm gonna style my nation as
well with flexbox so my UL that's inside
of main nav will be a display flex and
they're all gonna go next to each other
like that so there's a few different
things I could do here let's just change
the Flex direction I guess would
probably be the easiest flex direction I
want it to be a column yes there we go
so flex direction by default is row
meaning that they're gonna go this way
across I don't want them to be a row I
want them to be a column so I'm gonna
call them and then they're gonna go in
that direction
and then let's do a text-align:center
cuz that's gonna look a little bit nicer
okay and so what I want to do I want to
put an equal amount of space between
these I don't want them all stuck here I
want them all equally spaced out so with
that I should be able to do a justify
content space around and that should put
an equal amount of space between them
all but of course it didn't why not
let's go take a look um oops wrong place
it's in my header my nav no my list my
nav is taking up the whole screen but my
unstyled list is not we'll just give it
this the height as well height 100
viewport height there we go and now we
can see that they're all equally spaced
out and if this changes the whole thing
changes there now if you're not familiar
with Flex box one thing I'd really
recommend is that you use they call them
flex box playgrounds and stuff so this
is one that I found I'm gonna put the
link in the description below I really
like this one it lets you add different
flex items so say you want you know I
can add in Flex items I can choose is it
an inline flex or a flex flex Direction
I can play around with so in this case
we're doing a column this doesn't really
change anything right now justified
content so this is what I was playing
around with so you can see you can just
click through them all and see what the
differences are going to be so when
you're looking for something there's
lots of different properties to choose
from when you're using flexbox so I
really playing around with these can
really really help there's also the Flex
item properties so the Flex chloro and
Flex shrink which we can use to play
around a little bit we're probably gonna
dive into this a little bit after to
give you a better idea of what's
happening so there we go they're all
equally spaced I can probably get rid of
this height actually as long as my UL
has the right height yeah this is
growing too you know this is matching
automatically matching so I don't need
that 100 viewport height on that I only
need
my UL my li is I'm gonna need a few
properties
so let's come in here and say my li so
my main nav Li has a let's just give it
a background some curious background of
light blue yeah that's what I thought
was it was gonna look like so that's
okay for now I want these to fill up the
whole space available to them I don't
want them to be really narrow with this
really big space in between I actually
want them filling up that whole space
which would give us a nice big big big
area to be able to click on so with our
flex stuff there's more stuff in here we
can do so I'm going to give this a flex
the Flex is a shorthand property it
includes the Flex grow the Flex shrink
and whoops flex grow flex shrink
properties and the flex flex basis
property so they're all included in here
so a little flex growth like shrink flex
basis so what I'm going to do is just I
want my grow my shrink to be one and the
Flex basis to be auto so it's just gonna
be a flex one one auto and that should
make it fill up the whole space there we
go so if I look here I can see my list
items are all taking up the full amount
of space the only problem now is the
inside is aligned to the top so that's
that's good except I don't want the a
align to the top I want the a align to
the middle one thing we'll add on to
here just so we can see really the whole
space and I'm gonna change the colors of
all of this let's add in my border
bottom one pixel solid and I'm going to
go with dark in no I'm not even gonna go
with the darken I'm just going to go
with the RGB a
of black zero zero zero poops zero and
then like 0.25 or something that should
give us like a light gray line alright
it'll be light blue cuz we're on blue
darker blue line maybe even 15
I want a subtle subtle and once I get my
colors I might play with that a little
bit but just creating a subtle line in
between them all and now I can actually
take off my light blue there we go so we
can see the separation between them and
I want this to be moved down and put in
the middle so to do that what I'm going
to do is I'm going to justify the
content just I want to do a justified
content center
no I went doing a line items a line item
center except that's not gonna work
right now I'm trying to use flex
properties now my ul is set to flex so
these are flexing and I can use all of
the different Flex properties on my Li
you know this flex thing here but now I
want my aid to be able to do stuff on it
so I actually have to do a display flex
on this as well so display flex in my
center line anymore
so now that now these A's inside are
being affected by the display flex I can
now use my align items and do a center
and that will vertically align them and
we all know vertical alignment in CSS is
a pain in the ass but flex box has saved
that or not saved it but made it much
easier and now I need it centered in the
middle so I can do a that's where I want
the justified content center which will
pop it right in the middle awesome that
looks really good
I'm happy with that the last thing I
need to do now is style my actual links
and the nice thing with this is I don't
have to worry about before I style my
links just to say I don't have to worry
about you know my my padding on the top
and bottom and if I created more list
items it would automatically adjust to
it so say I'd originally done something
like where I'm saying that there's
padding on the top and bottom and then I
add a new thing I'd probably have to
come in and adjust all my numbers
whether it was a percentage or however
else I was doing it and now I don't have
to just to show you if I come and add in
just copy that and paste it in there it
just automatically adjusts and it works
and let's paste another one in there and
it just works flex box is awesome and
it's really widely supported now it's
not perfect obviously but it has pretty
wide support now so that's great now I
just want to style my my links so that's
the easy part
so my links are my a ah there we go so
what I want to
doo-doo-doo-doo my color let's try a
text universe and see if we can read it
that's okay
text-decoration:none that's good I think
I'm just gonna make my font size a bit
bigger for this as well but I'm gonna do
that just done and have font size 1.2
rim cool the reason I'm putting it on my
main nav and not on the links is I'm
just thinking maybe for whatever reason
at one point in the navigation there's
some regular text and not link text
don't know why that would happen but
just in case it happens all of my text
inside of here will be the same size so
I'm not being overly specific and
limiting it to something that's inside
of here I'm just saying any text that
happens to get thrown in the main nav
should be that font size and that's it
for this video guys the menu is done and
you should see a card on the side now do
get to part two of building at the this
navigation menu where we're gonna be
looking at building the hamburger menu
and using some jQuery to animate it
moving in and out so I'll see you guys
over there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
