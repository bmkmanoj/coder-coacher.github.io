our bootstrap project so the custom
folder the bootstrap gives us is really
awesome it gives us a place where we can
go in and take all of the variables
they've already created and modify them
for own without actually having to touch
they're just over writing things and
because this is all being done with sass
we're not actually bloating up a file by
having over rights over things it's just
going to compile it after the fact so
all of the things you know if I change
the color of the primary to from blue to
red which I'm going to be doing in this
project it's going to do it before it
turns into CSS so we're not bloating
anything with creating needless
overrides we can set it all up really
easily so let's go and look at how we do
that right now
okay guys so I talked a lot about this
custom file now one thing that's really
important with this they actually made a
mistake with this with if you're on the
alpha 6 if you're on for some reason an
older version of the Alpha this would be
in the right place and if you're around
on whatever the newer one is I believe
it will be the beta but if it's another
alpha whatever it is this custom will be
somewhere else but if you're following
along you've got to move it up to here
was they were playing with stuff and
this is the fun of dealing with pre
releases sometimes they make mistakes so
it's just really important you move that
up there and I'll show you why once we
get later on in the project but do make
sure you do that if you're on the alpha
6 and now I want to use this custom
folder I want to do stuff with it so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
jump over to their variables file
because we're going to have to do a lot
of digging around in the variables file
here to know what we actually want to be
doing so this is a massive file and
table of contents is super useful for
this just so you know and I'll show you
a bit how to use the table of contents
properly are willing to do that right
away
I want to do my colors so I'm going to
select it command F and hit find and
it's going to bring me there so I want
to overwrite some of the colors that are
in here because these are not the colors
that I want to be using so what I'm
going to do is that let's go over to
Photoshop and open up the project and
first thing we can do is switch the red
/ because this is the red that I'm going
to be using the most through the project
so I can push okay on that I got my red
did you guys see that on the screen I
should move that over sorry about that
we can copy that push okay I can shrink
that back down and now with my red here
now what they what we don't want to be
doing is replacing this number what I
want to do is go over it actually I'm
going to copy that whole thing come over
to custom and paste this in we remove
default and it says this right at the
top just remove the default that does it
oh it doesn't mention it here make sure
you take the default off that's going to
cause problems if you don't take that
off it's not going to work I'm going to
take the default off let's go back to
photoshop to get my red again copy e two
three four zero zero it's pretty easy to
remember actually and I'm going to paste
that and now my red has changed so
that's cool
let's go see what else we can change
we're going to want to change a few
different things so my black is going to
change now let's just take all the
colors actually that's Jake all whoops
too far too far let's start with all of
this but we're not going to keep all of
it just to make it a bit so we're not
jumping back and forth my white is going
to stay white so I don't need that black
is going to change red I've already
changed orange I don't think I need any
of these other ones actually let's just
go look fast white black red there's a
dark gray color that I'll be using red
gray black red yeah that's the only
colors that I think I I'm actually going
to use so I can delete all of that my
red is redefine my black will be okay
let's see here these I think I'm going
to play with a little bit too so we'll
get to there in a second my brand
primary is going to get switched over to
red because that's the makes the most
sense to me
an interesting thing they're dropping
the whole brand primary success info all
this starting in the next version might
be gone with the beta it looks like
they're going to be
dropping that if you're wondering how I
know that there you've started if you go
to the github page and read some of the
documentation and stuff in there that
and yeah it looks like these are gonna
get stripped out and it's they're gonna
have a going to go with more the color
naming system instead which is going to
take some adjustment for me
so brand primary is definitely going to
be red for me as long as this is still
here um and I guess that's the only
thing we need to change right that makes
it easy okay um so we'll just dump all
that we can always come back in here and
add something else if we have to gray
let's rename my gray color as this move
my black actually right that's like the
darkest color I'm going to do this one
as black let's just we don't need to
minimize that let's just my black will
become this one and my gray will be this
one gray will be this one and everything
else here we can get rid of and I'm
going to get rid of some of those
comments I don't really need them cool
so those are the main things that I'll
be using in there let's just go quick
and look at there's any other variables
enable rounded by default is on and I
don't want that to be on so I'm going to
turn that off so I'm gonna take that
over to my custom and make this false
except you have to spell false right
false
I don't want rounded corners my buttons
and other stuff are all square so that's
all of a sudden everything I had a round
corner no longer has a round corner
shadows gradients I'm not using
transitions on that's fine find glid
classes I do want print classes I do
want spacing I'm not going to play with
so let's go back up and look at the
table of contents just to see if there's
anything links I probably want to be
changing right so I'm going to hit a
let's go look at the body - command F
find and we're on the body so body
background color see yep here's some
stuff I want to change I'm just going to
take these two because I'm not going to
have any inverse body colors and all of
that anyway right right so let's jump
back here paste whoops so my body
background will be black and this will
be white
I guess my text color is white most of
the time right yeah I just use pure
white perfect okay so that's good good
good oh just realize guys a small
problem here because and this is
probably why they moved the custom
underneath originally and maybe they
found a way to fix this but because
they'd move custom underneath so you
wouldn't run into problems like this
because if I'm saving this here it's
giving me an error that it can't it
doesn't know what white is because white
hasn't actually been defined yet so I do
have to come in here and actually define
what white is white is FFF so that
should be okay I should be able to save
this and everything should be compiling
properly now I believe so okay so yeah
that's it
awesome possum we're you're good to go
and I think that's all the variables
we're going to need in this project I
might be jumping in that file as we go
through this project later on if you
know I noticed that there's something
missing but more or less I think that's
it in the next video we're going to be
doing the markup for this website and
because our variables are pretty much
set everything should just fall into
place more or less they'll be some
tweaking and some stuff that we'll
definitely need to be done but a lot of
our work really is done after this it's
just all the details and stuff like that
so if you like this video hit the thumbs
up if you have any comments any
questions whatsoever leave them down
below and until next time try and make
your corner in the internet just a
little bit
are awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
