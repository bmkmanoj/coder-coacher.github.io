to be looking at how to build an
awesome-looking navbar with HTML and CSS
on my screen right now I've got a
finished version of what we're going to
be doing and I think I've got it looking
pretty good I got my logo over here I
got my links and I put this kind of fun
little hover effect on there to make it
a little bit more interesting than what
we normally see so let's dive in there
and see how we can do this
so the first thing we have to focus on
is the markup or just our basic HTML
there's not very much to this since
we're just looking at the navigation
menu so let's jump in here and just do
the first thing I have is my logo which
is just a nice little image assets the
logo dot PNG it's my logo and I'm going
to give it a class of logo while I'm
here let's jump back to my file save
that whoops I'm on the run there we go
there's my navbar popping up my little
logo that I created and the next thing I
want to do is come down here and let's
make a nav closed-mouth and let's come
right to there we need a ul close ul and
then we need Li a href and let's just
close a close ally so then I have a list
item with my link inside if you're not
sure why I'm using a list item it's
because list items are the most
prevalent way not way the most prevalent
thing you'll see people use for
navigations these days and I'm having
trouble talking and typing at the same
time so let's finish that save there we
go we see it that really ugly blue it
sort of hurts the eyes right now while
it's on that gray so as I was saying
unordered lists are the most prevalent
way of creating navigation menus it's
not the only way there's other ways of
doing it
but if you're just getting into HTML and
CSS which I'm assuming you are if you're
watching this it's just you see it
everywhere if you're using a template
using something like bootstrap
foundation or other frameworks you're
going to see things like this if you're
using templates that you've downloaded
if you're editing somebody else's site
this is what you'll see and really it
makes sense once you think about it for
a second this is a list of all the
different pages on my website
and that's it we have my list of
websites so I'm using my unordered list
I'm putting it in a nav tag just to be a
little semantic there which is all
inside my header I'm using a container
here I forgot to show that to you before
so I have the container that was what we
were starting off with and if I jump
into my styles the container just has a
width of 80% now to stop it from holding
up on the side of the page and I have my
background color no margins and I just
change my font over here and I'm using a
Google font so I've linked that Google
font right there
I'm going to set a nice background color
on here that's nice teal ish d6a a and
there we go that comes in and looks very
pretty
and now generally speaking the next
thing that you're going to do is
something like this I want my logo just
stay on the left so I'm going to flow to
the left and that's going to free up all
this empty space over here it's going to
let my list come up so when I save that
you can see my list sort of moves up
there there's some other weird issues
coming up but that's okay and that's
fine now I'm just going to take my whole
nav we want that to be on the right
float right and it goes over there and I
go oh man what happened my header
disappeared oh that's weird
this is a problem you've probably run
into you before this is floating left
this is floating right the container
they're inside just shrinks away to 0
pixels it's still there but it's
ignoring all the floating items so I'm
just going to do a nice little clear fix
on this of header after content is
whoops
display table and clear it both and like
magic it comes back now if you don't
know how this clear fix is working you
don't really get it I'm just going to
put a link down in the description below
that goes into a lot more detail on what
this is from CSS tricks that but this is
pretty much you know I wouldn't always
have it on my header necessarily I'd
probably set up a clear fix class that I
could use wherever I need it but in you
know this is exactly what would be doing
it's just pretty much putting in
something that has a clear after both of
these that sets it up properly now the
next thing I always do is nav ul so I
want to select my unordered list inside
my navigation now let's just give myself
some space here so it's easier for you
guys you know this is the only unordered
list on this page so I could just do ul
but of course I want to be a bit more
specific let's say that you know
hopefully this would actually be getting
used on a real website and I want to
make sure that only my navigations ul
gets this of a margin:0 and you're going
to see that's going to take that space
off on the top and the bottom when I
save that
next is padding:0 and it actually we
won't see a change there but the padding
there is a space on the side here that
just disappeared and last but not least
list-style:none and now if we come and
look here when I save there go those
dots that looked really ugly awesome um
so let's go now and I want my nav li so
I want the list items because I have a
problem right now my list items are all
stacked one on top of each other and
obviously they need to go next to each
other and not on top of each other so
there's a few ways I could do a
float:left and it works they go up next
to each other I actually prefer you not
using flow
here I prefer using a
display:inline-block it does put a
little space between them most of the
time that doesn't cause an issue for me
and I personally think it is a bit more
versatile because it lets me use
different text alignment on it you know
text-align:right text-align:left
text-align:center in this case it
wouldn't really make a big difference
but in other scenarios it can you know
come in i find this more versatile but
if you want to use floats go for that
there's no problem with that at all i'm
also going to do a margin left of about
70 pixels and there we go just to give
my space in between each one now i could
do just a margin 35 let's say margin
zero top and bottom 35 left and right
now you can see how that pushed it away
here let's do an undo on that it's just
your margin zero so if I leave my mouse
here it pushes away from my mouse so
it's putting a big empty space here I
don't want that because ideally all my
content on this page will be lined up
nicely on the right side so I want my
margin only to be on the Left margin
left 70 pixels i keeps my spacing the
same but it keeps my alignment nice
there and i'm also going to give a
padding top of 25 pixels and let's just
save that and this is going to fix some
things in a second and this is really
specific for this one just because of
how i'm going to be creating this little
animation on the top right there so it
doesn't always have to be a padding top
but in this case that's what we're going
to want to go with okay and let's just
wait you know it sort of looks kind of
crappy right now let's just call my logo
and add
patting say 10 pixels zero let's see
what that looks like
there we go just to give myself a little
bit of space on the top and the bottom
and it sort of centers that at the same
time you know what this padding let's
make it like 23 maybe it looks more
centered I think so we're just a bawling
it but there we go okay I keep adding
this empty space and I think it's going
to get rid of it again on me um but
that's okay let's make our links look a
little bit better so my nav a and of
course I'm doing navitat
a you'll see that you'll see you know
it's get really specific things like
this if you do I'm not getting that
specific because I don't have to if it
was a bigger project where there's lots
of different use cases maybe I'd need to
in this case
nice and simple the only links I'm going
to have in my navigation are these ones
so I'm just going to keep it like this
so let's change our color right away
that looks a lot better let's turn off
that underlined text decoration and then
um text transform my auto-completion
thing isn't working very well today
transform uppercase as you see I love
the czechs transform uppercase I think
it works really really well and it's my
font weight correct I don't feel like my
font weight is okay 300 hmm pretty sure
it's okay and linking to the right yeah
it is what it is looks a little thin
here I find but that's okay and oh maybe
it's because the font size is too small
that's font size makes it I have it up
in 16th right whatever it is what it is
let's keep going
a little light maybe I'll come back to
that after just to make it so we can see
that a little bit better and the last
thing just for now that I'm going to do
is come in and give that a hover
so my hover and let's just change the
color to black and take a look and yeah
we can barely see that I linked this to
the font weight 300 let's move up to a
400 and just make sure I'm linking to
the 400 save save there we go we can see
that a little bit better now okay
perfecto
now the tricky part comes in so I have
this hover effect it's not even that
obvious it's really really subtle I want
it to stay settle like that it's sort of
part of the point but I want we want to
add this effect into the top that's
really what's showing that we're
selecting that page or that we're
hovering over that link before we click
on it so to do that there's a few things
we got to setup first I want to use a
pseudo element which is the before it's
sort of like here where I'm setting up
an after and I'm putting in a table
that's not actually in my HTML I want to
be doing the same thing I want this to
be a little block level element that
hides and shows when I hover on top here
so there's a few things that I need to
do the first thing I'm going to have to
do is I'm going to have to set up my
list item to be a oops position:relative
and it's important that my position is
relative on this and we'll see why in a
second
so let's come after all this and we're
going to set up a nav a 4 so it's sort
of when you do the before like this it's
in my link before the text what are we
going to have so the first thing I need
to say that there's content and there's
actually no content in there and when
you display:block okay block let's give
it a height of 5 pixels to start with a
width of 100% and a background color
that matches our check for for-4 so you
can see bang there there there's the
those elements coming in right there
they're five pixels tall they have a
width of 100% that's a hundred percent
of my a so or actually it's probably 100
percent of my list item actually and
this is where this position:relative is
helping out if I take that off and I
save no it doesn't change anything
hmm I thought it would have there that's
okay that's not really what's the point
of this position relative where that
position relative really kicks in is
when I do display:block I want to do oh
oh this width 100% agree position I've
so looked and you can see it sort of
went crazy right now position there we
go
I knew this was supposed to be doing
something so if this is position
absolute and the width is set to 100%
you can see it's actually shooting and
I'm getting this big side school it's
going to a hundred percent of my screen
size and the absolute positioning is
absolute relative to my browser window
unless I change this to relative and now
this absolute position
is relative to my list item and it works
a much nicer it's keeping a hundred
percent of my list item rather than a
hundred percent of my screen with that
big side scroll it was going on with
this I can also do a top of zero and
bang that looks a lot better and I'm
just going to move this width down here
because they sort of play together so
it's up exactly where I want it to be
the trick right now is I don't actually
want to see it so my width is going to
be starting as zero percent and it
disappears so it's there but it has a
width of zero and now what I need to do
is come in my nav a before that's all
right my nav a:hover before we're
getting crazy with our pseudo stuff here
and all I need to do is the width of a
hundred percent I believe and there we
go it's bang when I hover over though
with switches from zero to 100% and I
see that going over and right away
already that's kind of cool but it's
really on when you're going fast you see
this little like Paul you know that can
get kind of annoying and it can go a
little too fast maybe for you and to
flickery and all of that so we can just
come in with a nice little transition on
here transition oh not text-align let's
type it up in transition let's just do
I'm going to transition all let's do a
nice ease in out which is my favorite
transition at plus-2 250 milliseconds
and ooh and even if someone goes really
fast doesn't get that annoying little
flash that we were getting before it
just sort of like you know animates in
and out the whole time and obviously if
I made this longer let's make it a
thousand which would be way too slow but
it gives you that nice little animation
there but nobody's actually in a hover
over and wait for it to animate so you
know - 200 250 s probably
nice little compromise where it comes in
you can see the animation nicely and I
think it looks pretty nifty and good so
at the end there got a little tricky and
I had to do a few things that if you're
not familiar with the CSS the basic CSS
it might be like what's he doing with
all this weird stuff here you know the
a:hover before and all that but try it
out play around with a little bit the
best way to get better at this stuff is
to experiment to see really what's going
on so but if you have any questions or
anything like that just go down into the
comments below and ask away I'm glad to
help out that's what I'm here for is to
show you guys fun new cool things help
you understand a little bit more and
this channel is all about making the
internet look a little bit nicer at the
same time so we want to learn how to do
it but we want to learn how to make it
look good too so I hope you like this I
hope it you you know you take something
away from it try something out you know
see if you can do something even cooler
now that you know how to do this and if
you do something cooler make sure you
link to it down in the comments below so
I can check it out
I'm going to do my best to reply to
everybody that does leave a comment so
even if you're just saying hi I'd like
to say hi back to you and yeah thanks a
