have already started it I realized after
putting out the first episode that I was
missing an introduction to this episode
where there's a couple of things that I
should have talked about so if you're
watching this after it's already all
come out and you're sort of catching up
on things this will be in the right
order for you but if you watch the first
episode already you might be getting
this one after the fact
so just anyway with all that confusing
stuff out of the way what I want to do
is two things first I just want to show
you the project that we're going to be
building I built this in a previous
video so if you want to watch how I
built it in some of the thought process
that I put into this you can check that
out and I mistakenly thought that people
would have seen that even though it's
not officially part of this series so my
bad sorry about that so here's the
design I hope you like it this is the
site that we will build using bootstrap
for to build and that's the other thing
I want to talk about is the fact that
we're using bootstrap 4 to build it
bootstrap 4 is currently in alpha
version 6
they've been alpha so it's not actually
the official release yet and so I had
some people just asking is it safe to
use bootstrap 4 and you know there's
others they be using bootstrap 3 should
they be using foundation other stuff
like that and as we're going to see
there are some issues with bootstrap 4
still some people are using bootstrap 4
currently and if there's lots of good
stuff with it but there's a few bugs
that will probably run into along the
way if you are using bootstrap 4 just be
aware that some things might change if
you're watching this in the future and
you're in the beta or the official
release there's some things that might
be different from this video to what the
official release is actually like even
though for the most part it should be
similar it's more bug fixes and a few
little changes that could be happening
along the way sorry for the confusion of
the whole out of order thing for those
of you who are watching this as the
videos come out and for those of you who
are watching it after the fact and
everything is in the right order the
next video will be about downloading our
files downloading bootstrap the
different ways we can do that as well as
how to set up the files a little bit so
it works a bit better for us thank you
so much for watching and until next time
don't forget to make your corner of the
internet just a little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
