week we're going to be doing something a
little bit different it's the first time
I'm going to be designing something so
I'm making this video as part of the
create ICG or it's a create Internet
creators guild and there's gonna be a
whole bunch of other videos based on
that there's a link in the description
below for the playlist of YouTube stuff
and you can find it more at the website
which is also linked down in the
description below so for this video I
thought it would be fun to redesign my
homepage my homepage right now is based
on a pretty standard WordPress template
kind of boring I do web stuff I figure I
should have a decent looking website so
I want to do my own design on it instead
of using a template I think it'll be a
lot of fun to go through the whole
process from design into the coding and
seeing how I do the whole thing anyway
that's enough talking let's just get
into it
alright guys so what I've decided to do
is actually compress the whole thing do
a bit of a speed design and speed coding
just because it would have been like an
hour and a half long video if not if I
went through the whole thing and I
didn't do the best job of explaining
everything as I was doing it especially
did the design I've never designed
something and done it at the same time
so right now I'm just setting up the
document I went with 1600 pixels wide
because it fits nicely on my screen and
it's good to simulate a desktop and 4000
pixels tall just because it works well
it gives me lots of room to work with in
this one I'm not actually gonna use that
much space but it's just sort of what
I'm used to going with you can see I
have some colors picked out on the side
and a library in Photoshop there as well
as two pictures that I'm going to be
using now with this design I thought
this would be a lot of fun for you know
the create ICG to create my actual
website and I wanted something that was
really clean and simple and nice lots of
white space lots of breathing room with
a singular focus just on driving people
to my YouTube page because really that's
the main focus I have going on right now
when it comes now to setting up the the
text and all of that I'm really visual
when I'm first doing it if I had had a
really big website where I had I knew I
was going to have an h1 and h2 and h3
and all of that stuff I'd probably be
more focused on the ratio of the font
sizes together but because I pretty much
just have a
title and then so a few paragraph text I
just really I ball it and go with what I
find visually pleasing for titles I
usually just make it look good to begin
with especially if it's an h1 or
something like that I'm gonna focus on
let's make this look good especially in
the hero area where things tend to be
even bigger and sort of on their own I'm
gonna do it just based on I and then
adjust a little bit from there just to
make sure the ratios are okay but most
of it's by eye you can see already I've
put my main paragraph a nice big font
size and then I've big space in between
and then leading into my paragraph this
is an image that I'm bringing in just a
little thumbnail picture but I'm gonna
turn that into an embedded video once I
get into my actual design or the coding
I found it looked a little bit boring I
had a sketch originally for this and
that I'm following along I had a whole
bunch of sketches and this was sort of
the one that I went with in the end and
the sketch it looked fine on the layout
but when I was doing it I found it
looked a little bit boring I tried a box
tried blending modes they all look
terrible so then I said well what if I
just make this type of box you know a
stroked box instead and I thought that
actually looked pretty good I just need
to make a few adjustments to it to
balance everything out and make it look
good I want to make sure my spacing was
equal and the picture was properly
centered here and you know I wanted my
eyes to be in the right spot my face
that was kind of hard actually just
getting them that to look good and again
I'm just really focusing on trying to
have lots of white space and a focus on
what people are going to be looking at
when they're here and making it easy for
the eye to jump from one to the next to
the next one problem people that often
make when they don't have a lot of
experience with a design as things get
too cramped together there's too much
going on in the page there's too much
jumbled together there's not enough
space either between paragraphs or just
between different elements as well here
with the text that I'm putting in I
originally want to make it a little bit
smaller because it was sort of my
secondary paragraph text but then I
realized I have almost no text on this
website it's really really short I might
as well just make everything paragraph
text and make it all the same size make
it nice and big and easy to read my
focus really on this again is nice
simple and clean
there's not a lot of text so I can keep
the font size big I decided to put a
drop shadow on this what will be in my
embedded video because I do want it to
stand out a little bit I want it to pop
off the page a little bit more than what
it was doing when it was flat so yeah I
just put a little bit of a drop shadow
on there I wanted to make sure it was
dark enough that you could see it well
but not too dark you know I when you're
doing a drop shadow in general subtlety
is the key the more obvious it is sort
of the they can be a little bit weird
looking if you go too dark with them
then I just went in a little button here
that's gonna be finding me on YouTube
nice and simple button just again I'm
going for pure simplicity with this site
so it's super nice and simple but now
one thing I realized when I made this
button is I didn't like that color blue
as much as I thought I had when I picked
my color scheme so don't be afraid of
changing things along the way colors I
find can be a bit of a problem as you
work with them I find my colors I choose
colors at the beginning and then
sometimes I don't like them so much so
here I realize that blue is really not
working for me too well and I decided to
come and change it I tried grabbing a
color from the thumbnail but it looked
ugly so I went with this sort of tealy
color that I tend to like and I've been
using a lot lately so I decided to go
with that and you'll start to see I may
have a few other things coming up later
on that you might see that I use that
too for that I also use that for right
now what I'm doing is just organizing my
layers just keeping everything nicely
organized so I just did that and I my
very very simple footer that's super
super simple just with some social links
in it and that's about it that's pretty
much it for the website so you can see
it's based again I'm gonna repeat myself
but it's based on simplicity and lots of
empty space and when you're designing
things don't be afraid of the having the
fact that you have room and think about
what you want the person to be doing
what's the the reason that are on your
site and what are they going to be doing
when they're on the site that you're
designing so in this case really part of
just my style is this clean nice look
but what I find is a nice look so I
definitely wanted that to come across in
the feel the white space helps people
focus on what
are gonna be looking at and the colors I
don't have a lot of color on this site
but the color really is what leads the
eye and helps things go along I was
trying to see if I could add some color
to my links down below but I just stuck
with an underline in the end yeah and so
I'm gonna scroll up now I think and just
to show you that when you're on the site
you see my name is Kevin you see the
thumbnail you see the button that's the
main things that people are going to be
focusing on if you want to spend the
time to read the text awesome
most people don't spend a lot of time
actually reading text on a site so I
want to make my goal super obvious here
on what I want people to be doing now
jumping over to the code okay so the
very first thing I'm gonna do now is
just bringing my Typekit stuff so I can
use the Proxima Nova on my site which is
just copying that link the JavaScript
link into there and now I'm just putting
my design on the side because I like
looking at my design as I'm coding
things I find that's the easiest way to
do it so first I'm just doing my markup
right now I'm just throwing in a section
for each thing it's not really a header
per say there's no navigation or
anything like that so I'm just building
this out with a few sections this div
sample video thing I'm gonna change how
it's set up a little bit later I go
through a few different options as I'm
doing that my about me and then my
footer down at the bottom I forgot to
give it a class right now I come back
and do that a little bit later on just
pasting in all the text yet and just
putting my links in now the text is done
then there we go we take a look and mate
just make sure everything looks like
it's working and it does and so now I'm
gonna go into my files and in this I end
up with a lot of files I'm using sass to
build this I'm just fixing those little
things from the soft returns from
Photoshop I get those little boxes
showing up so it's just removing those
and now I start just making my sass
files that I'm gonna be using so I'm
starting with my variable ones for
colors and type and then I'm importing
them into my main sass file I don't have
a lot of variables to put in here I only
have a couple of colors and the one font
so these are pretty basic files that I'm
going to do we'll see now for my type
I made a little mistake here but it does
I did verify that it was working
I was a little distracted so I see that
my font is working and then I realized I
want to make this into a variable so I
just called it font instead of font
stack and I have my two font weights my
normal a my bold it's such a simple site
I wanted to keep my variables pretty
simple and then I had to update it there
and that's all for my colors I had my
brand color which is that green color I
was using my text color and the light
gray that I wanted to use in my footer
so I just called that one light gray in
the end I know I called the BG color in
the end so I'm just gonna throw those
all in there we go so those are done
then I got normalized and threw that in
as a in my vendor folder and that should
come in in a second there we go
so normalize I used on all my projects I
like always having it I should just
automatically include it in my my folder
then I realized I didn't have any
container setup so I came through and
put all my containers in there I'd
complete I do this all the time I forgot
to do my containers and then have to go
back through and add them in and now I'm
just in my base file setting up my
container and there we go we can see
that it's starting to work my image
right now is not inside of a container
so but then I Center aligned everything
so that fixes that playing around with
my font sizes a little bit just to get
it looking more like what I wanted it to
and now I start working on the hero
section at the top so I'm just here I
thought about doing a section of padding
5 m0 just to create the the spacing that
I want but in the end I just realized
that it wouldn't really work I ended up
taking that out a little bit after I
have some problem with my background
position a different screen size it
works perfectly at this screen size
actually I think I go with our left I
never end up fixing it in the video but
I might get around to that 1.4 now it's
still looking like that I'll
get around to fixing that at one point
and now I want to just typography I
don't have a lot in here it's just
setting up my font size I called it h1
do I keep I don't remember if I keep
that as in each one or if I give it a
different class name actually yeah so I
originally I want to use the outline
with the outline offset but then I
realized that I can't with the offline
out set you can't do different for right
and left and top and bottom yeah I
changed it to title box because I want
to play around with it a little bit and
I don't want I'm thinking in the future
I might build out this website a little
more add some more content to it I might
have other H ones I probably don't want
them all to have this box on it so
that's why I gave it its own class
playing with the line height a little
bit just because my lines were really
close together by default the default
line height is usually not very good so
I wanted to add to my default line
height there now I'm in my component so
I'm gonna build my button I believe Oh
my video box sorry yeah so the video box
first I tried a few different things for
that that worked perfectly sort of for
what I wanted to do but then I end up
changing how I did that soon because I
realize it doesn't quite work the way I
want it to especially once I bring in
some other stuff but anyway we'll see my
final solution the translate is the big
space on the bottoms because of the
translate Y minus 50% it positioned the
whole thing properly but yeah so now I
just put the sample video on the picture
itself instead of on the big div because
that makes more sense but we'll see that
causes problems once I bring in the
iframe because iframes are funny that
was when I realized I have that problem
with the big space and the translate Y
next I tried that which obviously was a
bad idea and the padding clearly will
not work so I think I end up taking a
completely different solution with this
yeah I just end up doing it differently
with my padding and now on to my button
text-decoration:none the buttons pretty
simple
so text-decoration:none inline-block
some padding on there just to make it
look good and the background color and
then I just play with my padding until
it looks nice there we go so I think
that looks pretty good and then I do I
oh I didn't do the hover effect yet I
come back and do the hover effect a
little bit later and now I build out the
social thing down at the bottom which is
super super simple that's pretty much it
I'm just playing with my padding again
just to make it look nice over here we
go now I'm doing my buttons hover effect
which I'd forgotten about originally so
I want to I've thought about doing it oh
I think I did I was gonna change the
color of it but didn't like how it
looked when I changed the color so
instead I want to make it sort of get
this like effect like it's moving up and
down so I'm adding a drop shadow to it
so when I hover on top it's gonna get a
drop shadow but I'm also gonna have it
move so I'm gonna use my transform scale
I don't want to change the padding
because that would shift the whole page
around whereas the transform doesn't
shift the page the transform sort of
keeps everything where it was but it
changes the size of it without pushing
other things out of the way so that
works better for making it bigger and
then I just played around the speed of
it my shadow and all of that until it
looked a bit more natural I was also
wondering I wanted the same angle on the
video shadow and this other shadow but I
wanted things to look proper and then my
image wasn't resizing so it was causing
lots of weird problems when I started
trying to look at it responsibly so this
is where I went and got my embed code
from YouTube and tried to set it up and
I ran into some problems here I won't
lie to you so just going through I am if
you're using an iframe controlling the
width and the height can be a pain you
have to give it a height if you're not
you can't use height auto or it's gonna
default I think 250 pixels so what I did
is I put it in a wrapper so I have my
sample video wrapper and I have my
sample video and I'd found a trick that
was supposed to work but that didn't
work for me for some reason which you
can see now a height of 0 with a padding
ball
which should set it up properly but that
padding-bottom was all even was always
going relative to the width of my page
and it was just causing some problems it
wasn't going if it was a full screen
video it would have worked fine but
because I didn't want it to be a full
screen video it was giving you this
black bar at the top and bottom and you
can see I was I was getting kind of
frustrated with this actually I came
really close to just switching it to be
an image that you'd click on and go to
my page so you had 100% width it works
perfectly fine I tried that in cheating
with the scale to shrink the whole thing
down actually is that what I ended up
leaving it with I think so but then that
cut yeah it got too big or it got too
small so I had some issues with that too
the scale did I started playing around
with a whole bunch of stuff really to
try and get this to work properly I was
getting really frustrated with it at
first that scale trick I thought was was
perfect
and the problem was it would just get
too big at the big screen sizes I end up
building some media queries into it I
think because I liked it being a hundred
percent at the small screen size that
makes sense that it's the full screen
and then at the large screen size it
doesn't here I'm just fixing up a few
things so I'm going into the what it
would look like now on a phone size I'm
setting it up properly for the phone now
instead of the large screen size and I'm
gonna start pumping in some media
queries in a second so it looks pretty
good up until now and then at my width
of I think 750 I switched out the width
of my sample video wrapper I give it a
specific height and width that sort of
locks it in and stops it from changing
size and then I just played around with
the sizes a little bit until I got the
sizes that I want and here I was just
checking what the dimensions are when
you're embedding a video at the small
screen size
yep pretty much I was just playing
around with the size to try and get it
to be the size that I wanted to while
keeping the right aspect ratio so I
didn't get those black bars showing up I
tried doing something for a second with
the viewport width but I had a feeling
that would screw everything up and there
we go so I pretty much it grows with the
page once you get to a larger screen
size it gets locked in place and then I
played around a little bit with the
padding and everything so it overlaps
the way I want it to and that was pretty
much it I think yeah then and there's
the site and as of this you can go to my
site which is Kevin Powell dot Co and
actually see it live if you want to
