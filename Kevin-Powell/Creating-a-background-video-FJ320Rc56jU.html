fix my microphone here so I can hear
myself properly sorry okay I should end
that before so I apologize if the stream
is a little jittery YouTube's telling me
my streaming is bad I was looking at it
it seems to come and go I don't know
what's going on the bitrate coming from
my computer seems good but let's hope
this works at well so my plan for this
video is to be looking at doing some
background videos but I'll probably also
do a Q&amp;amp;A along the way as well
just because yeah I think it won't take
too long to get through the content so
if you have any questions or anything as
I'm going through or if we get to the
end and there's some stuff that comes up
please don't be shy also for those who
are here please let me know if the audio
is okay I think it was okay when I was
checking it out before but please just
let me know if you can't hear me well
and again I apologize if the stream is a
little bit jittery or anything or all of
that it seems that that could be a bit
of an issue but hopefully it's okay and
I will be recording this so it will be
up eventually on my channel as well I'm
always using grid and some other stuff
on this as we go through because it's
just more fun to do all of that so hi
guys hi
Sahara and Tecna Paul and anyone else
who is here there are a few other people
here so hi and thank you for joining me
in this I think it would be a lot of fun
um so let's just get started on this I'm
not gonna start with the video right
away I'm just gonna start with the
layout and it won't take us long to get
there this is something that I've been
playing around with a little bit I don't
really think it's the right way to be
using grid but it works for what I'm
about to do so what I'm gonna do is I
have this section of more stuff here
which is just sort of the content that
comes after thanks Sarah for letting me
know that everything seems okay I hope
that stays true for everybody
oh um one second guys just have to pause
for one second here sorry
sorry about that so what we're going to
be doing is I'm going to be coming on
here my more stuff that I have right
here which just has my h2 and a whole
bunch of paragraphs I just want that
after my video but I figure I'll set it
up first so I'm gonna come here and just
do a more stuff like that and on that
I'm gonna do a display of grit because I
want to use the grid to lay it out now
where this can be a bit more fun is in
how we can use this so and again I don't
really think this is how columns how we
probably want to be using it in general
but it's a way to avoid having to set up
a container and all of that so on my
columns here I can do one if our 80% and
1fr so it's saying that I'll have a
column what we can see there we have a
column of 80% in the middle and then
these are just sort of the leftover
space on the two side so it's sort of a
10 percent and a 10 percent there and
I'm gonna be using a little bit of sass
on this but nothing too I hope I don't
say your name wrong for kundo okay
thanks for joining us hi Kim thank you
also for joining along so I will be
doing a bit of sass here yeah but it's
nothing whoops not seven ampersand and
star so pretty much what this is is
select any direct descendant of more
stuff if I was writing out this without
sass I would just do more stuff space
you know I could type it out like that
and then put my rules in here but I like
sass so I'm gonna stick with that for
this one and I'm gonna set up my grid
column and it's gonna start at line two
and it's all gonna span one which pretty
much means skip this first one put
everything in that middle one of 80% and
then we don't put anything in that last
one there on that side so it pretty much
makes a container without having to make
a container and you could even make this
a bit more complicated with a min/max on
that one and it would work I don't know
if I'd really want to do this on a live
website or something like that but for
my demos and stuff I have been playing
around that and I think it
it's kind of fun mooney play thank you
for joining us so thanks looks like
there's more and more people in here so
thank you guys all for joining in again
if you have any questions as I'm going
through this please don't be shy and let
me know ask away while I'm doing things
or even if they're off-topic I don't
mind that's what we're here for
sorry my I have another computer on the
side here so I'm just checking on what's
going on it's keeping me up to date on
how the stream is behaving so apologize
if I'm looking away every now and then I
also have allergies or a cold or
something right now so if I cough I
apologize I'll try not to cough into the
mic because I know that can be really
loud okay yeah I'm happy to be making
live videos as well this actually came
about because I'm really tight on time
these days I have a lot going on with my
real job and some stuff there might
actually not be a video next week we'll
see what happens there I'll let you guys
know but my real life job and family and
all of that has been taking a lot of
time so this takes more time tonight to
do because I'll be here for a little bit
but I think that I won't have to edit it
so I get to save a little bit of time
along the way okay so let's get to the
actual video and the meat of this so my
video will be going right here now
luckily with well actually let's just
start with the basics of this before I
get it luckily thing the video works
basically by having a video opening
video close if you've never used it
before so it's not like an image an
image you just have image and that's it
but this is like picture I don't know if
any of you guys have used the picture
closed picture I'm actually going to do
a video on using this this is more for
well the way I understand it the picture
one is more used for when you're doing
if you want to load in different images
at different resolutions so if you have
something you know you'd be bringing
your retina images
on four Retina displays and just a
regular 72 dpi image for low res screens
and stuff I do need to research it a bit
more but that's how I understand that
working video is a little bit different
because different browsers support
different formats of video even though
mp4 is sort of becoming the standard
there was the OGG which was really
popular Oh Gigi or you might see ogv
we're a popular format for quite a while
or popular they were around and they I
don't these days it seems to be mp4 as
well as the web web em WebM is an open
source one by Google it has better
compression than the mp4 so it has
advantages it just doesn't have as good
of a browser support so what we can do
with this video tag here Gary Val
ninety-two where the the sass thing is
I'll explain it again just so this would
be if I was writing this in regular CSS
this would be more stuff space star so
ya space and then my grid call um - all
of that would just fit in here the
ampersand just replaces whatever is here
so when I'm nesting it and you can only
do that with sass or a CSS and just you
know and actually I'm in presentation
mode so I know you guys are watching
this live but if you want you can
actually go to this URL right here I'll
leave this up on the screen for a second
and you'll be able to follow along with
you know what I'm doing live it might be
a bit easier to see so it's up to you if
you just want to listen and follow along
with what I what I have up here the
audio might be behind the code pen I'm
not sure because there is a delay with
YouTube so it's possible but if you want
to follow along with this you can go to
that URL and you'll be able to follow
along
I think live from what I understand on
how this works with code pen
I will be doing more tutorials on sass
and while you guys are here I did a
Twitter poll the other day and I should
have done a YouTube hole I always forget
that I can do YouTube hole so I might do
one later but if I were to do videos on
sass what type of video what type you
want beginner complete beginner stuff
you want more advanced stuff like cool
mix-ins do you want creating your own
functions what type of stuff would you
like to see I'd be really curious to
know I'm not going to do a ton but I
will be doing some videos along the way
okay so on here so what we want to do
now is there's a source tag and the
source tag is a little bit more like in
B the image tag that you're used to you
have the source SRC and then you'll also
have a type now the type will always be
a video I'm not going to get this
backwards a my video I think I'm having
a brain fart I can't remember if it's
video first or the format first luckily
I think it's video and then mp4 and if
you had multiple different sources you
could just have source SRC and then type
is equal to video / web M something like
that so this would be your path dot web
M video and this would be your you know
path to your L dot mp4 video and what
pretty much happens is the the browser
will be reading through it if it
understands what this is and it can load
that one in it will load this one
because it's the first one it comes
across but sort of like CSS if it
doesn't understand something it will
just skip it and go to this one instead
so won't load both videos in it's only
going to load one of them in general
you'd probably put the WebM first again
it's better compression so with the same
file size you could have a better
quality video so that one usually you'll
find first and again there is also OGG
but I think WebM has sort of got rid of
the OGG or OTV and file format now I
could be wrong on that I'm not a huge
expert on this is more about styling it
now sadly I've getting a WebM then
there's free online conversion tools
that aren't the best and code pen only
lets me upload
videos that are very limited in size
okay I mean the I can't get my assets
okay that's okay I can get it off screen
here so the first thing I'm gonna do now
let's just get my video that's okay
code pen lets me upload assets because I
have a pearl account but I couldn't
actually get a web M to be small enough
I could have made a shorter video I
guess but let's just bring in this one
so we can see that I have a video there
we go Calvin advance mix-ins would be
nice cool thank you for letting me know
if anyone else has any input on that let
me know so I've brought in my video here
but as you can see it's just a black
square and this is because the first
frame of the video is black if you had a
video that actually had a picture at the
very beginning then you'd be seeing the
whatever the first frame is that's what
comes up here by default and this is
kind of useless you know why would you
want to have this so on the video here
there's a whole bunch of attributes we
can put one of them being controls with
an S so that actually makes it a bit
more useful because now I can play my
video so there we go I have a video it's
coming in I can play it I can pause it
other ones you can put in are muted if
you want to mute now this video doesn't
have any sound to begin with but we can
do muted and this will become important
I'll mention that again a bit later we
also do autoplay and now it's you know
as soon as the page loads it's just
gonna play by itself and we can also do
a loop so it's going to autoplay and
it's going to loop and there's controls
down here at the bottom
Reva Kumar thank you I'm glad you like
my tutorials and yet it will be uploaded
a little bit later or probably tomorrow
or the day after this should be up
online so there we go it's loop through
you can see now it's looping through and
it's playing the video again so there
are some interesting things now I'm
actually going to take all of this off
and just go back to my black hole so I
have my black one now there are some
things you could do to try and prevent
this from happening and this is on one
of my code pen assets as well I took a
screenshot uhm so on here one thing you
can put is a poster so if I do poster
and this is where you put an image not a
video so I have an image from the video
and it's just yeah this is a really long
thing because the code man puts it on
Amazon you can see it brought in that
poster so whatever the poster is that's
if before the video plays what do you
want the user to see and because I have
no controls it just looks like a static
image right now
so in general you'd have controls or
you'd have auto play now the one thing
that's really important here is with the
auto play if you have auto play and you
actually want it to work
don't make sure it's muted because if
there is sound
I think Safari won't play it and Chrome
I think is starting to either Auto mute
things or maybe it will just not play
I'm not sure but the browsers are
starting to not like videos Auto playing
and I'm sure you've been on websites
where video Auto plays and you're kind
of annoyed when the sound kicks in so if
something does auto play it's considered
best practice to make sure it's muted
and you can do muted with controls and
then the person can turn it back on now
it's a little bit different with this is
we want it to be a background image
right so we want this to be something
that people can see so after my video
here but still in this let's come and do
in each one I'll just do the great
outdoors even though this is more about
like mountain climbing stuff but you
know I'll do that
excuse me now the great outdoors comes
out down here and this isn't like doing
a background image a background image is
nice and easy you go in your CSS
background image and we're done
I wish it was that easy all the time
sadly it's not with video they're not
meant to be backgrounds they're really
meant to be something that's in with the
content so if we want it to be a
background we've got a fight with it a
little bit and that's just why there's a
few important considerations that I'll
sort of try and go over with the setup
of this also ideally I would have my
second source but as I mentioned I I
couldn't get a WebM to be under 2m 2
Meg's I could have Premiere it's open
source and Premiere doesn't actually
have WebM encoding by default and I was
under a bit of a rush so I didn't have
time to actually get a plug-in to do
that which they do have yes I Hirsch
thank you I remember that and I will be
covering that in at one point or another
I'm I've the dynamic HSL color schemes
for sass there it's a really cool thing
and I'm I wish I had more time these
days as I said I've been really busy but
I will be doing I'll probably be
actually do a YouTube video on that on
that one because it's something really
cool that you can do a sass to
dynamically come up with color schemes
and stuff it's neat so I might I'll see
if I can get something out for that in
the not-too-distant future ok so I'm all
caught up in the chat and again if
you're not here live I don't have the
chat on my window his last time it took
up too much space but um if you can ever
come in live then you know you can
partake in the chat ok so let's take a
look here we have my thing so I want to
get this text on top of that and you
probably have an idea I am gonna be
using some absolute positioning for this
and you can also use fix positioning and
some other stuff for it and there there
is quite there's some interesting things
you can do to get this set up I
I'm gonna be using grid for it but
obviously grids browser support isn't a
hundred percent so just take that into
account or actually know what I'll show
you a way you can do it with grid and
maybe we'll look at a way to do it
without grid as well
Mohammed is asking which one is better
SAS or less I've never used less so I
prefer SAS because that's what I know
SAS seems to be bigger within the
industry so if you're just after what
more people are using then I would say
SAS there are I always get surprised
every now and then when some really big
framework or some big company is still
focused or is still set up with less
just because you see SAS SAS seem so
ubiquitous but less there's nothing
wrong with less and sass even now just
switched over to Dart which is instead
of Ruby they've gone to dart which for
them they're saying it's better I'll
take their word for it it's just it's
weird they've gone to a sort of an
obscure language and I'm curious if it's
gonna hurt them at all bit but I don't
think so just because of like node you
know libsass and all of that it probably
won't have any effect my throat is
really a jeep sorry guys these allergies
are throwing me nuts
a few people are saying that a CSS and
sass in general are better over there in
the comments okay so I'm gonna put a
background on my hero here background of
light blue and let's give this a height
of like a tbh I don't want to be full
screen if I wanted to be full screen
though you could just come in here and
make that 100 if you don't know about VH
I do have a video on it it's just a
viewport height so it's just gonna make
sure it's taking up the whole height of
my screen if you know much about CSS you
know you can't do 100 percent because
that's annoying and you can't there's
reasons for it but I don't feel like
getting into it right now so we're going
with a TV H just to get 80% of the
height of my screen so that way if my
screen just adjusts with it so that's
good let's just add a margin bottom here
to a margin bottom of I don't know 6m
something just to make some space there
maybe a bit smaller for
okay you know what I'll do Sahara she's
asking em how we can I'm talking about
using things that are have the greatest
browser support so we'll make this so we
can I'll create the fallbacks in this
why not yeah might as well
so should I yeah we might as well
actually I'm gonna switch my margin
bottom here to like a 5vh again my
margin then can adjust with the screen
five six maybe a little bigger I'm
trying to think to get my video on the
front and just if I am gonna do this
with a browser support what the best
idea would be yeah we'll do it because
it's it's pretty I'm not going to do
anything too complicated here yeah okay
so let's come up to my I'm gonna give
this video a class I have hero
background just so imagining we had lots
of videos we'd want to have a class just
so I can control them separately so we
gonna have my hero background I was just
saying how I like SAS and then I didn't
use it here but that's okay I'm a hero
background so my hero actually this is
my hero let's move this up so we can
have more of our CSS visible we'll do a
position:relative and then here on my
background I a position of absolute so
again my hero background is my video so
anytime you see this it's literally just
the video itself now what's weird about
all this let's just come in here and
give this a background of red so we can
actually see what's happening and I'll
give this a width of 100% and a height
of 100%
and you'll see that when I do the height
of a hundred percent you'd think the
video would actually stretch to fit that
whole space but it doesn't it ends up
having these red bars come out instead
that's kind of annoying like why would
that happen why wouldn't just make the
video fill up and maybe this would
stretch the video but this is kind of
annoying so one of those things I was
talking about that doesn't have the it's
not bad Bowser support but it's object
fit and you might see this for actually
the browser support for this is kind of
weird it was really good for images for
videos it's better but it's not amazing
and this is sort of like being able to
do background size cover you can see
there no it's covering the whole space
so that's kind of just how it works
sorry just reading the comments yeah
door eval just the ad vh exactly it's
just so it I always get kind of annoyed
with those ones that are 100 VH and then
they just put like the big arrow
pointing down that's bouncing up and
down I don't want to see an arrow
bouncing up and down just let me know
there's more content there you know
chances are I'm gonna scroll anyway but
I don't know just that that's my
personal belief a lot of people like the
big 100% screen so do what you think
looks nicer to it depends on the design
and lots of other stuff okay so and a
few other people that were just
mentioning the same thing that's cool
so background so object fit cover will
help now obviously I can't actually see
my text I'm wondering I'm just gonna
come on my text here hero title
I'm just waiting at my text to actually
be on top dot hero title and a position
of relative on that just so it pops out
on top
just because this is absolute so if I
give this a position they sort of start
restocking again and because this is
second it's after my video I don't have
to worry about a Zed index or anything
they'll just they'll stop
in the order that they're coming in as
long as they have a position on them now
I mentioned I was gonna use the grid on
here and the reason and it's we can use
the the display grid is because this is
my favorite thing in the whole world
place items Center ah how amazing is
that
I don't know if you I do have a
newsletter now just in case you don't
know and in my newsletter I did talk
about this and I just think that's
amazing place item Center and it's in
the middle how did it take this long for
CSS to give us this it still makes I've
been using this for a little while now
and it still makes me happy every time I
do it okay so that gets me that in the
middle and actually let's come back to
here and the hero title color white font
size for RAM box tech Shadow tech sad oh
I don't know 0:05 pixels rgba if you
wanted to another really amazing thing
with sass is like engine very black here
and like 0.25 and just you see it's
working
red it should just make that 1 or 0.5
hopefully you can see that on your
screen that it is working just being
able to put a color here it could be a
hex code whatever if I did zero zero
zero for black it's gonna work I love
being will do that that's with sass that
you can do that you can't do that with
regular with regular CSS you'd have to
write the zero zero zero thing out you
know if nothing else it's worth using
sass just for that sometimes okay so
that is in the middle now how can we do
that with actually let's go back to my
video let's get the video working and
then I'll come in build the browser
support back into that hopefully I do it
right I'm thinking as I'm doing this I
haven't done the it's using at supports
sort of like a media query at media and
app supports I feel like I'm gonna screw
it up though cuz I'm in it since my last
grid series
but we'll see what happens um okay so on
my background now okay so it's in there
it looks like an image so on here let's
just do my autoplay so the video
actually plays I also want to do a loop
and I want to do mute it the video
doesn't have any sound on it so I
shouldn't have to do that but I think
Safari or at least like the iOS version
of Safari might not play it unless this
key word is there at least that's what I
read so just maybe I'm passing on not
true advice but I read that somewhere
along the way so I just do it all the
time and it's not hard to write muted so
why not do it now there's a lot on I
just make sure there's small file sizes
if you do this cuz if this loads in it
like this 1080p thing on a you know it's
a simple little background video people
might be angry at you if it's using up a
whole bunch of their data data data data
so just be a little bit careful with the
videos you're bringing in if you're
going to do this so you don't try people
nuts and I'm thinking I might stop the
video in a second just because it's
bothering me having to work with it on
but basically that's how you do it um
now if you want to do it without this we
can so let's say so what I'm going to do
on this actually is doing at supports so
this is like a media query so it's at
media so it's at supports but instead of
putting in the size you're putting in
what it supports and I want it to if it
supports object fit I think I can write
it like that I'm just worried I have to
write like the whole thing with the
cover but I think this is gonna work
where I say object fit and I could do
object fit cover I think I can write it
out all like that so if it does support
it then I want this to work so it let's
see it's working good so the fact that
my browser's support
this so it's coming in and it's working
now because if it you know if I'd
comment that out it's not working so if
the browser if it didn't work on the
browser it's just it gets to this at
supports there's two possibilities the
first possibility is it doesn't know
what at supports even is so that means
it skips it it doesn't you look at it
doesn't do any problems it just do is I
don't know what that supports is let's
keep going
the second is it knows what this is but
it doesn't support object fit now I'm a
little worried about this because the
object fit some browsers support object
fit but they don't support it for video
they only supported for images so I'm
not sure how we could overcome that that
is something that could be interesting
but let's assume that it's not working
what I'm going to actually do on here is
a min width of 100% and a min height of
100% and I think what I do actually all
of this would have to go into my my ad
supports so this is gonna have it go but
what happens is this is going to give it
side scrolling because it's doing a min
height and a min width so with the
height has to be a hundred percent so
it's going to make sure that it fits
100% but to keep it in proportion that
means it's making it bigger than the
whole area so that just means over here
on the hero itself I need to do an
overflow hidden so overflow hidden the
ad supports I just see a few comments
coming in there's no need for JavaScript
no I see these things done with
JavaScript all the time and I don't know
why people make background videos with
these big complicated JavaScript things
I had honestly I looked into it I was
looking at their JavaScript I'm like why
are you making it so complicated I never
understood maybe in the old days before
you needed it for something I don't get
it
I just see something talking about
modal's and I don't know why they're
mentioning modal's that's a good I'll
keep going so I think this would all
ideally come into here so because it's
using the object fit so I'd actually
that seems to be working
I think comment that out it does it
change looks exactly the same I think so
yeah I'd probably do something like that
and even this could come up here so it
would use this and if it has the ability
to use the objects the object fit it
would do that now I again I am a bit
worried because some browsers support
object fit but not a video so that might
break that so this this might be the
better option for now and just doing the
overflow of hidden could work there and
the same thing for the grid on getting
that to actually be in the center this
could be something like at supports
supports grid display grid if it does
support grid do this and then if it
doesn't support grid or even that could
be at the bottom if it doesn't support
rid we'd have a display flex and you
know if it doesn't support grid
hopefully you're not going to like ie 9
or something display flex let's just
turn this off so I can make sure that
what I do here works justified not that
this is hard justify a content center
align items center right so I would use
this and you know would you really
bother putting both of these I'm not
sure I'm looking forward to the day when
this works for everything this cuz
there's only three lines but I can do it
in two so I'm lazy I like doing it in
two and this I don't know I get the
place items for me Center it's great can
the video be a youtube link
probably not
let me get I'm gonna do this off-screen
just so because I'm gonna be in my
dashboard and I think there's things in
there that I'm anyway I don't think
there's anything to secret but let's
just get the latest one let's see what
happens
the only thing I'm worried about with a
youtube one is I don't know can we auto
play a youtube link we won't have the
right control because I am with a it
won't work like You Tube it's coming in
as an iframe
sorry if that was loud
link IDO hopefully I got your name right
yeah this will be a video on my youtube
channel in the next couple of days yeah
so if you bring it in a YouTube embedded
YouTube things are always iframes
so iframes are a little weird in how
they work and if you're styling them so
I'm not sure I don't think it's gonna
work to be honest I think you do have to
have the video on your server which can
wreak havoc on your bandwidth except the
video let's see if I can actually get
this YouTube doesn't want my video to
load there we go
yeah I didn't think it would work i
frames if ever you have to style an
iframe and actually get it to behave the
way you want it to it's not very fun
why is this
just to show you in bed I'm gonna copy
all this let's just paste that in so if
we look here whoops this is one of my
videos that I just brought in myself so
iframe you get the width and height on
it which you can modify and play around
with and the source this is one of mine
allow autoplay you can't autoplay hmm
and allow fullscreen is fine you can see
there the video is coming so what should
I call that again here Oh background
let's just see what happens
plus equals zero background I don't
think it's gonna work it sort of works
but I have a play button in there allow
autoplay was on but it's not Auto
playing oh it's kind of awkward and you
have the controls you can't have the
controls turned off Hey hi so yeah
that's kind of awkward it can sort of
work and you're also getting I'm getting
the black bars and I think that's I'm
live look at that yeah I can't this is
where the iframe styling gets very
limited because of the way the whole
iframe thing works so yeah not really
let's go back to that I'm just gonna
take off the autoplay and the loop for
now and put that back yeah probably the
same of Amy oh I'm guessing this is
where you'd have to invest in a little
bit of server space
one thing I'd also recommend what we're
on the topic of all this is just to have
this hero area have a background on it
just in case like right now I have a
white text I did put a little Tech
shadow on there but if the video doesn't
load for something like something
catastrophic happens and this just craps
out you want to make sure people can
still read the text you have on there so
either as a background image or a
background color or something just to
make sure
worst-case scenario something really
weird
happens just having a background on it
in general would probably be a good idea
I don't really think anything
catastrophic like that would happen but
you just want to cover all your bases
just in case so well I have you guys
here if anybody has any questions I'm
sort of finished with this I think so
again just make sure you have muted
autoplay and all of that and the basics
of it are the position:relative for the
whole hero area and then having
position:absolute and just either a
min-width and min height and then
setting the overflow to hidden so just
those two together plus the overflow
hidden to make sure nothing weird
happens and if you can if object fit is
your your jam then you can just do a
width and height and a object fit of
cover let's just go check but can I use
it's pretty weird the object fit browser
support if I remember right oh it's
better than it used to be it's edge only
partial support there was another
browser that had partial support I am
sure of it that's better than I thought
it was so pretty much not an internet
explorer and it won't work for videos an
edge but everything else even like Opera
Mini like awesome I think some that
needs prefix so just be careful but Wow
why did I think it wasn't so good
because even the old versions hmm that's
interesting I also find it weird that
this is only for images and not for
videos but there you have it if you
don't know but can I use like really
really nice even the grid now guys like
you can can't use the grid depending but
look at that's important that's really
impressive
edge is fully supporting it's up to like
the current syntax so as long as you
don't need older versions of the grid
and even if you're Opera Mini like
a grid layout if it doesn't work and it
just stacks everything on top of each
other when you're on a phone is that the
worst case in the world probably not
it's it's just
ie 11 with their and even it's partial
support but it's an older version of the
spec so it just causes issues it's also
where you want to be careful with the
supports I think ie 11 understand
supports and it does support display
grid so you could always do a display of
something else because I don't remember
the older version of the spec Sahara
SHhhh
how is your SAS course coming along you
said you haven't had much time lately
yeah so if you don't know I am working
on a SAS course that a premium of course
and it it's come along really well but
I've just run into like I just actually
sent it I should send out a newsletter
for all the people that are on the
waiting list cuz I just sent out a
letter to those who have got in their
initial very early release saying that
I'm delaying any updates for like the
next month I was doing every two weeks I
was updating the content for it and I've
just got too busy but in about a month I
will be able to do some stuff dududu I'm
just looking for a property on here
display grig so like yeah it understands
the grid I can't remember does anyone
know the
and I can't find what I'm looking for
display grid display grid grid template
great column there's one of the old
syntax is that they use that I don't
remember what it is
anyway I'm not gonna worry about it too
much now but you can use one of the old
syntax isn't it's dead bootstrap studio
I don't even know what bootstrap studio
is boot straps to studio
what's boot straps to do is do that
right do WOD post-processor yeah sass is
a post processor yeah
bootstrap studio it depends if you're
using bootstrap a lot by the looks of it
no if you're gonna use something like
this in my opinion you might as well it
looks cool I bet you it's really well
done um it looks it's if you don't want
to learn the code part of it but if
you're gonna do that you might as well
use a whip flow just because it's won't
limit you to bootstrap it's just going
to make more available I would guess you
know it's same idea maybe I'm wrong I
have used web flow a little bit I get I
just can't find all the things I know
the CSS well enough that this actually
takes me longer to use these days but I
would probably use web flow over that
bootstrap studio but I could be wrong I
haven't used bootstrap studio so I don't
know for sure
Auto prefix er yeah autoprefixer should
take care of I'm not sure if
autoprefixer would look at the old
syntax or not though maybe actually
let's see
yeah it must right I'd have to do a
little test
I know autoprefixer is in here but I'm
not doing anything too complicated
to see if it picked up anything weird
along the way so it's it you know as I
mentioned the opera needs the Opera Mini
needs the the prefix on there so it's
doing that it's not doing anything for
my grid I don't
yeah I guess I would pick up the old
syntax yeah web flow is really cool
especially I'm surprised I don't like it
more just because I am a designer by
trade I came from like design in design
in Photoshop and illustrator and all of
that I just get frustrated because I
can't find the properties as fast as I
could just write them out but for
someone who's just coming up and
learning now it's such a cool tool I've
heard I have heard some people get a bit
feel a little bit limited by it because
I don't think you can do everything
especially now with the grid opening up
new possibilities I think that I'm
curious if that's gonna hurt any of
these sort of more automated things
because I don't know how they're gonna
handle the grid via far into the
animations it is pretty cool I saw a
comment before
hmm
I saw a comment before and I don't see
it now that I wanted to ask a question
not answer on hmm
oh this like yeah yeah that's a really
good question Muhammad I don't have us
well I sort of had this like channel
anyone who was in the early early early
access to my SAS course got into a slack
channel like should I talk about it now
I was saving this I'm thinking of
starting up a discord I like slack but I
think the discord will offer a little
bit more just because slack limits on
their free plan the voice chat and the
video chat it's really really limited
whereas discord offers a lot more on
that and I just think for you know if
there's a community going on that it
could either through voice chat on
sharing you know even if you open up a
code pen you're in collab mode or
something you're you don't have to be
sharing screens and you can share up to
like 10 people screens I think through
discord or like you know do a voice chat
and all that so I am thinking about
doing that there will be a lot more news
on that in a couple months maybe less
we'll see but I have looked at starting
to get into that so yeah yeah it's going
to be saving more information on that
later but now you know I am looking into
it
oh thanks for letting us know sir cursor
saying that due to backwards
compatibility issues prefix or
autoprefixer doesn't prefix grid stuff
by default yeah I was wondering about
that so that's interesting so grid
doesn't get prefixed by default I'm
guessing it's in the options where you
can turn it on XT is amazing I think
sketch is a better app right now but I'm
on PC so I can't take advantage of that
and in if any of you are from know about
envision studio I've played around with
the beta or I'm really looking forward
to the beta coming on to a PC mmm
especially if you're an app designer and
you want to do app stuff for animations
it's crazy how awesome and intuitive it
is really really nice app XT has its
work cut out for them a little bit and
if yeah Cyrus mentioned affinity
designer so it's a one-time payment if
you're into if you want to eat something
like photo is if you need to designer
more like Photoshop or illustrator I
always mix it up I know they have one
for each I think maybe I'm wrong
but if you're in you know sketch is
definitely good I have XD just because I
have the whole Adobe suite I use
Photoshop Illustrator InDesign Premiere
and xD I guess so those are the only
ones I use I'm looking at my bar down at
the bottom
um so yeah adobe their whole
subscription model is kind of annoying
but when it was two grand in one shot
just an email to software that sort of
sucked you but this subscription model
is expensive if you only use one or a
couple of the software and I think
they're limiting themselves a little bit
in that respect that for people like me
who need the whole suite it works like
50 bucks a month I can i can actually
justify that but if you only need one
app or maybe even two apps like it's a
complete waste of money I don't you know
you you don't need all of those things
you could get a one-time payment and
it's two months the cost of two months
or even one month like it's crazy a
little bit are you only 14 oh I wish I
was 14 doing this stuff I actually
started when I was young but I feel like
I'm I want to be coding something here
for you guys were just that I'm happy
you're so active in the chat though this
is a lot of fun yeah I remember
Photoshop my first was a how old was I
when I made my first websites I started
playing around Photoshop I was in high
school so probably a bit older than 14
that probably like 16 it was all table
based layouts that was fun that's a web
for me it was a hobby for the longest
time like I started in high school did a
few little simple simple websites like
really fun stuff I'd do it in Photoshop
even then you know he'd slice it all up
and export the table and then add some
interactivity and add your links in and
all of that then I started learning it
then I didn't touch it for two years
then I this would be fun to like do
something else like for like ten years
it was just like this on and off on and
off on and off little hobby and fun
thing that I was doing before I finally
started taking a bit more seriously but
even it was winners in school and doing
design stuff we had like one really
short class on web and I think that's
what sparked me to really get back into
it
Benni yeah 3:20 a.m. oh no I've just
sort of winding down but I don't know
what to do do I have anything on code
pen that's fun to play around with I
don't I haven't been having at the time
just to do stuff I'd do something like
just off-the-cuff now for fun but I
don't I can't think of anything cool did
you were too tired I'm trying to think
of something cool I could do with the
grid or something but even there if
anyone has any questions please let me
know it doesn't have to be a video just
something that I could be doing while
you guys are chatting away and I can be
following ninth grade and that's awesome
I'm gonna bring the chat up onto this
just so if anyone is watching this later
they're actually seeing a little bit of
what's going on since I'm just let's
bring it on this side since I'm just
talking right now anyway I'm not coding
create toots about clear coating for
collab yeah that's not a bad idea
I don't find I mean part of its leaving
comments I guess now I'm getting better
at JavaScript so you learn how to code
better when you're doing JavaScript and
leave better comments just because Java
scripts are more complicated than
18-month CSS Photoshop has been around
for a long time the first versions of
Photoshop named a layers I didn't use
that one the first version of Photoshop
I used it's a good question when I was
in school it was cs3 so that's just to
give you when I was in school for design
it was cs3 I was using Photoshop before
the whole CS thing even existed it was
just like Photoshop a number I don't
know what number it was
Photoshop six I'm wondering if that's
when I started oh you started in
Photoshop in your 14 but coding came at
40 is that Dexter with the H there
can we bring SVG into the video element
or create custom controls you know what
you can and I don't know how to do it I
have done it once like probably two
years ago so I'm not even gonna try
right now in the video I wish I could um
yeah videos are heavy web em should be
better bene than the regular ones in
general not in the stream yeah I'd
rather I'd like to do something on the
stream I have a little bit of time still
dododo m-- yes for compressing videos
web M is gonna help a little bit but I
find the online compression tools
there's like the free converters WebM
supposed to be smaller file sizes and I
was putting in mp4s and they kept be
coming out as bigger file sizes on the
WebM so I don't know exactly what's
going on there
video in general is just heavy like this
is a pretty short video and it's I got
it unto two Meg's and it took me a long
time to get it down to two Meg's it's
like three 320 P or something like that
like I really had to go small to get it
at a decent size which is which is
annoying I agree
hmmm how to make website load faster
than usual faster than usual I was gonna
be doing a video I had a suggestion a
long time ago for a video on what's it
called like the Google thing that tracks
like gives you Google is a tool that
will read your site and then give you
ideas on making it better so you get
like a score don't aim for 180 I don't
think it's possible
in general it's just on optimizing your
file sizes for images and it's not
something I'm super good at what do I
use for web hosting that's a good one my
personal site is currently hosted by net
Levi comm and I love net look like
because it's super easy to use oh my
goodness if you're not hosting if you
have it like I used to be using a
traditional one guys it's free you can
have your website for free now there are
limitations on it but it's it's crazy
this is static website so the main
limitation is its static websites you
can have like a wordpress site on here
anything but it even it connect with
your your github account so you just
push a change on your master and then
well my websites been updated I didn't
have to do anything I just pushed on my
master like it's really cool so yeah if
you're looking at if you are looking at
looking for web hosting wouldn't it
laughs I for now I think there's other
services that are similar but it's free
for anyway like HTTP free like zero
dollars a month HTTPS custom domain you
just have to pay for the domain
obviously and link it it's really really
cool I dunno they offer and they even
yeah the updated whoops they put in
forms recently so that's cool so they
have their own form thing it you just
have to put in I think on the they give
you the whatever the meta tag you need
to put in there and then it works
they're bringing in split testing like
it's all for static site stuff if you
I'm getting into Jekyll a little bit but
if you know Jekyll and all of that you
can
sort of a blog or whatever you need they
do have like protein like they do have
some pricing stuff for different things
depending on what you need if you need
teams of people there are prices so
which makes sense like they need to make
somewhere but if you're just by yourself
and you're a student or you're just want
to run some like personal projects with
custom domains and stuff
the other one is github pages github
pages very very similar deal going on
it's free it's just set up with sit up
with your github account pretty much the
nice thing with metla fly is if you
don't have a github account you can just
sort of drag and drop like here's my
folder on my desktop drag it into the
browser my websites live now that's
really really nice and you don't have to
have github so that's not something you
have got around to that's cool so just
suresh's said to trigger it github
education pack I've been heard of that
so that's a good thing to look at now I
have a good evening
I'm guessing SVG instead of gif yeah
SVG is a good way to go these days yeah
natla phi is is only for static web
sites but again if you have a haven't
heard of lighthouse if you have if you
have like a jekyll build or something
like that you can have a blog and stuff
Oh lighthouse this is for yeah the
quality for yeah sorry I have heard of
that yeah that's a night for performance
and all that and a bit more other stuff
definitely worth checking out for blend
modes who was asking me about blend
modes just now will look at them really
quickly because that gives me something
fun to do
and that's cool
github education good to know I should
check that out too who asked about
blended video I have a video on was it
blend modes background blend modes I'd
have a video on background 1 modes Benny
you can check that out if you want more
details on it but let's go and you let's
come just all the way down section blend
mode ok
so in here I'm just gonna put in
actually I'm gonna leave that just like
that and let's come to here my blend
mode height spell height right I before
E except after C except in the word
height or my spelling wrong with VH
background think that I spell height
wrong no I got it right see it's I
before E except after C but not in the
word height hmm anyway okay I'll leave
that there
so let's say I do a background color of
I'll do red just because it's gonna be
more obvious what's happening and then I
can do a background image and I'm just
gonna use a URL I use on splash it on
splash it's just a placeholder site so
this is the dimensions will be like 600
by 600
so that should there we go there's my
background image and we'll do a
background size cover and then I can do
a background blend mode sorry I don't
know if the background blend modes been
updated and if Safari actually supports
all of them now or not multi ply if your
with Photoshop or any of the other
editing software it's all the ones in
there Safari used to not support the
last bottom grouping I don't know if
that's changed or not the end of my
drink hopefully my throat stops itching
um so yeah that's a nice easy way to do
a background blend mode so it's gonna
blend the color with the image right
there and multiply overlay all the ones
you know and love should work it's
working I think it's just the image that
is in there or else I wouldn't be seeing
the red even like difference which is a
weird one and you can even have this
work with like multiple background
images right if you want to background
images at Comoros it just a space
I don't do multiple background images
often enough unsplash it 500 by 500
let's see if this works
oops maybe they are comma separated
there we go can I actually do this I
don't even know how he knew this overlay
multiplied since overlay seems to be
having some issues cool you can actually
do like different blending modes on the
different layers I think is that working
it is working that's kind of neat you
can do different blending modes on
different layers so multiple background
images multiple blending modes and all
of this does it work on the video no
because it's not a background image or
background the video is just a part of
the content it's like having text or
whoops I did something there full
support in Safari now awesome Thank You
Benny um yeah I won't work in the video
sadly that'd be kind of cool if you
could have a blending mode on a video
but I imagine that would also be super
hard on the processor that would
probably cause some performance issues
along the way
all righty guys I think I'm gonna have
to end it it's coming up on 10:30 and I
get up at 5:20 in the morning oh it's
terrible if you don't have kids if you
get up before the kids so I can be ready
for when the kids get up and then I have
to get them to school and then I have to
get to work and I get up really early in
the morning so it's part of the reason I
don't have time as much as I used to
well I've been at this job for a long
time now but yeah I think that it will
be it for tonight
we had a really good showing so thank
you for everyone who has men to turn up
the ending there was a little bit sorry
the ending was a little bit random but
that's cool you guys were having some
really nice discussions I really really
enjoyed the discussions going on there
so every time I do a live stream I say I
want to do more live streams for the
next month there will not be next week
there may not be a video we'll see what
happens I will post on the YouTube
channel and on twitter and maybe
Instagram right I ignore Instagram too
much you get up in three hours Benny how
old are you I used to do that I'm too
old to get up in three hours now
Oh seriously how old are you I'm really
curious when you're doing a live yeah hi
Terry no problem I hope you've been here
for a while I and goodnight
Mike when I say it's time to go it
usually takes me like five minutes to to
actually say bye or ten minutes so I'll
be here for a little bit longer still to
wrap up the chat I was a nice dream
thank you for joining me Dexter and for
everyone else no problem for the live
stream at all thank you guys this was a
lot of fun and this is the most
interactivity I've ever had in a line
stream year you're just chatting away so
this isn't for me this is great and this
is why I'd like to have the community so
I could actually be talking and you know
back and forth a little bit to be really
really cool
another life session not before like a
month from now at the earliest if I do
another live one I'd probably plan on
something a little bit longer this was
actually the video I had planned to film
tonight and then edit tomorrow but I
would know I won't be able to edit it
tomorrow so I said let's do a live
stream and you know you're 32 and you're
getting up in three hours
oh my goodness you're not young I'm 34 I
think now I can't do that anymore yeah I
really can't I'm not the only one who
gets up really early you guys I'm glad
I'm not the only one who gets up really
early or gets not enough sleep makes me
feel a little bit better so yeah for
those of you who have stuck around to
the end I will be starting some sort of
discord and then not-too-distant future
and by not-too-distant future it might
be a while but within this calendar year
I have a few thoughts on how I want to
do it and to get it set up and working
and to make sure who is in there as the
people that we want in there if that
makes sense but it will be it's in the
works and there will be more information
on it in the long term again um if you
have any suggestions about that just
leave a comment about anything I've
never used discord I don't have time to
game or anything like that so I haven't
used discord but it seems really cool
I've used slack a lot and discord too
seems to be better so but that
interfaces like what's going on I'm in
there trying to figure it out and
there's a lot of stuff all right
so I guess I am going to go again in the
next life stream I do I will have a bit
of a longer one for 40 am and you guys
you're making me feel bad I used to be
such a night owl I used to be up like
Intel all the time super late and then I
had kids and that doesn't happen anymore
I mean
I can be in bed at like nine o'clock if
I'm not doing this stuff it's crazy
it's embarrassing a little bit but yeah
I used to be such a night owl and now
even on nights like I'll be up with my
wife we go we get a babysitter it's ten
o'clock and we're just like oh like
let's go home and go to sleep we're
exhausted it's kids kids change
everything it's crazy all right bye
you guys are saying bye so rash and am I
saying your name right
suhara Sirach I hope they've been saying
your names right throughout I apologize
to anyone who I have and pronounced your
names right I should go instead of just
talking about how I am old and all of
that so yeah have an awesome night thank
you once again all for joining me this
whole time it's been a ton of fun and I
will be trying to do these more often
even I said I won't be another month
maybe I'll just do another like
livestream not next week but the week
after instead you know maybe I'll do a
few live streams instead of regular
videos and then get back more into the
