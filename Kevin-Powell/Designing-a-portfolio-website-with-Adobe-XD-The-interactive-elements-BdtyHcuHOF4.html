of our interactive elements and I think
the first I'm just gonna go from top to
bottom and I say interactive I'd only
have two things to do we have my mobile
menu and I have over here when I hover
what do these things look like if you
don't recognize these go check out the
previous video where I designed all of
this and if you don't want to go look at
that you just want to watch this one for
you know this is what you're interested
in well I'm working in Adobe XD and I am
on PC and depending on when you watch
this if it's in the future you'll
probably have better features because XD
is being updated every month but here we
are so what I'm gonna do is I'm actually
making new artboard if I was working in
Photoshop I probably would have a
tendency just to make a layer that would
be my overlay but I think it's a lot
easier just to have a new artboard so
I'm gonna wish ain't on my keyboard I
use this size so I'm gonna stick with
that and that gives me my artboard but
I'm gonna drag this to this side and I'm
gonna call this menu open nap so here's
my open nap so what's my own gonna look
like I never planned this so I had this
sort of rough sketch idea for the whole
site design I wanted to do but I have no
idea and specially cuz I don't have a
logo I'm hoping this doesn't look too
boring but I think I want to be a nice
big overlay so it's just gonna be like a
full screen should it be a full screen
just bang like this maybe or should it
be one of those ones that's like like
this and you sort of see like it it's
gonna go I'm gonna click that and then
my menu like comes out and then stops
but you still see that it's on top yeah
why don't we do that so I'm just gonna
option drag this over so it's on that
one and then shift command or shift ctrl
and the left square bracket to push it
all underneath and command G to group it
and I think a command L or control L
will lock it yeah so I can't
accidentally click on that and if I do
that I'm actually gonna put a shadow on
it too
x XY and blur my blur will be like how
opaque is this this is pretty subtle
I like subtle shadows a little bit which
way is why oh I want this at zero I
always get whoa I didn't do the right
thing this is zero and this can be like
five and now I can really drop my blur
oh no what oh sorry I'm not used to
their their shadow system on here my
color here should let's drop the opacity
way way way down there we go something
like that
and I subtle it's just too bright maybe
I should with the dark one share with
the dark one or should I have like a
full overlay could I even would that be
a cool idea how come it doesn't keep the
color of my fill what if I changed the
blur background just blurs I thought
that I keep huh I thought I could keep
the color that it was blurring hmm what
if I just darkened it all like I have an
overlay and then on top of my overlay no
we're getting too complicated here undo
undo undo lots of undos lots of undos
something like that so it's just gonna
whoops
when you click it it just like grows out
do I have it grow the whole size I
definitely want to grow to this thing
come out and then hide back in I just
don't know
yeah we could do the whole screen you
know what take the shadow off we're
gonna do the whole screen I'm just not
sure now if I should use this color
probably I'm gonna do a really simple
one here guys let's get my text thing
out and we're going to do home
and let's go with this bright color can
I do this but see if this isn't easy to
read home all caps and make the font
size bigger like something like that
Center it over here and then repeat grid
I have home about portfolio contact
those are the only things I really need
so say I did that so what do they say
home about I'm not gonna bother making
one that stops here home about home
about whoops is that really not showing
me at all cuz I'm in second though
Center okay we can stretch this out oh
my goodness that's not how I thought
this would work the repeat grid is not
gonna work here is it I don't that's
really frustrating do I have to put like
about open space it's still repeating
itself like that I get it but Jesus okay
I thought the repeat grid would be a
brilliant idea here but I guess not
do undo undo undo so let's find home I
should still Center my text though home
I just have to drag it them out that's
fine it's really not that big of a deal
I didn't space them equally select all
equal home about should you about or
about me about fine about portfolio and
contact I'm a little bit worried that
it's kind of hard to read my blue the
contrast here is pretty low but I think
I'm gonna stick with let's bring them a
little closer together actually and then
just move this down a tad this is like
super simple but I just want like you're
on mobile especially you click I just
want this big screen thing it's like
super easy just like big fat finger and
I'm doing it you can't see me doing it
but the big fat finger could just like
poke right I'm the one you want there's
no little link so I want to make this
super easy
and I have these little lines that I'm
using everywhere so I'm gonna bring that
back in let's make you this color but
like 30 percent I am Papa bah actually
that should be white and it's or could I
make it this color maybe that looks
better like 20 percent is it bad that
it's 19 that bugs me
you have to round it up and right in the
middle and right in the middle and
center all everything that way group
this Center it that way I'm not in love
with those lines anymore
I thought they'd look nice or if I do
use them I almost feel like I need it to
be like this space should be the same as
this space just because it sort of makes
it like a big button II area by doing it
like this what if they were white
instead because the colors sorta bugging
me what if this was the bright color and
these were the dark that's really like
in your face is a navigation but it's
super easy to read the way okay I'm
gonna do what I just said
that should go there that should go
there and then it's not gonna be perfect
anyway but that should be better don't
want you don't want you let's change
this color so I can actually see that
line good select those let's just I
might even do something whoops
I might even just do that so it's like
these big big button me things and I
guess I need a little xover there
let's meet way too big
let's take you Oh it's 15 by 15 okay so
it's actually just you can I say with
did it that the border on this case
should be 2 pixels I think I went with 2
on these didn't they and did a 2/3
that's - why is it look so much bigger
than the color gonna be you and I said
no I couldn't have been 15 pixels wide
how big are you what am i doing wasting
my time here can I just select one of
them please copy paste and it's in the
same spot so that's nice there's no
rotation - oh here we go 45 no often
move it anyway copy/paste the negative
45 there we go
bang little close button really really
simple I don't want to reinvent the
wheel on this one there we go I have a
nice mobile menu again it's just gonna
go like it's gonna go like that sort of
just slide out you push the X and it
slides back the only thing I'm thinking
is that maybe the X in this case let's
make that a symbol
I keep dragging it and let's just make
it a symbol and then let's put it maybe
on this side
does that make more sense I'm just
thinking like as its as this is like
sliding out that the little closed thing
except it's just annoying for user stuff
they're like if I did that I don't know
I don't want to put this on this side
then so that way if you want to open and
close your clicking on the same spot so
it's not different things because that
could be really annoying hmm it's not my
favorite ex it's a little bit big but I
just want to make it easy when I create
it we'll see we'll see about that X I'm
not a fan of my X it looks too big but
I'm this looks fine okay whatever I want
a nice simple menu like that so we're
gonna go with so let's now look over
here I'm gonna make another artboard for
you a four artboard move that down this
way okay whatever let's just put you
here and then drag it I just want it the
same size as this and let's call this a
work overlay the nice thing with doing
this instead of using layers is I don't
have to turn layers on and off when I'm
trying to set things up properly sweet
there we go okay so I think all I wanted
to do actually is just have this won't
be very long to do um I just want this
to cover let's take off my border and
put you on if anyone knows how to turn
the borders off by default like if I
take this like there's no there's no
setting for it and I know in like
Photoshop you'll get your settings and
if you change it or illustrator anyway I
have my settings I can change it and
then that becomes the new default but I
have nothing until I make a box and the
borders always on and I don't even know
I have settings in here
there's more options in the Mac version
here I don't see anywhere to get in this
settings maybe it's under help or some
crap but not something I want to care
about right now but anyway if anyone
knows how to do that I would appreciate
a comment on that um okay so there then
we're gonna have our project name will
have to be all caps project name because
I want to use my six caps on that six
caps you will be a bigger font size
though
project name maybe that would actually I
probably should have made a text box
instead of this but whatever project
name cuz it probably will fall on two
lines depending on the project and stuff
why is my letting cutting off the top
that's weird
this font is a little funky I think it's
part of it too so there's my project or
maybe once like if I make that smaller I
mean cut oh now it's working how I
thought it would
that was weird okay there we go project
name like that discidium be bigger I
think I'm gonna make that bigger for
this one cuz no that's not gonna fit on
that right and I want a project
description too oh I should have started
with my little ones that's usually what
we tell people to do this opacity can
just be like sixty percent something
like that so it's gonna like slide
probably the same way slide up from the
side just because that's what my mobile
menus doing and I like being consistent
and maybe I can bump that up to 70 I
want to make sure it's easy no matter
what the picture is you want to make
sure the text is easy to read so project
name short project description could go
right here and there's no way I'm going
to fill this in but then also read more
I don't really want that to be a button
though hmm yeah I really don't want that
to be like a button but I want to link
what if I just made that bold and
underlined do I have an underline option
I have to draw an underline yes do I not
have an underline my goodness to say I
did like a short a short project
description now how would the heck is
all this gonna fit on there let's start
the project name because that's
definitely just gonna have to be smaller
let's put it on one of the other one
if I did it of that let's bring this
into option drag so say did something
like that maybe I just don't put a
description for the little ones the
featured project it's a little short
description those ones don't that might
be an idea yeah
and that could be kind of cool because I
sort of have an idea of how I want to
code this up where this gets a featured
thing and I could just have like you
could include a description but it just
if you has one because that way you
could change your featured one whenever
you want and if you include the
description it will show and if you make
as long as it's featured and if it's not
featured then a description won't show I
think that's what I'll do and this would
be something cool to turn into a theme
at one point but I don't feel like
getting into WordPress stuff I just want
this spacing to be a little more
consistent here to the the padding on
the side yeah I think that would
actually look decent what if it was the
darker color is pointy miss yeah we'll
go with the bright blue for the overlay
cool and again I think that just slide
out when we do that or maybe like one I
don't notice slide from some direction
probably this way just so everything's
sliding the same way but I don't know
what if I do that and then we kept like
if I do a copy-paste and then there's
like a thicker like this one's at a
hundred percent so look okay no it
doesn't look so good but what if it was
on this side mm thick does that look
cool it's not obvious enough eh I think
something like that would look good but
I don't think it's high enough contrast
I don't want a new color I sort of like
that but I just find this text is kind
of hard to read
and again like would this work on the
little one and again some project names
will be longer than that right like
that's a short project name would I even
be able I could I guess I could squeeze
in but then so many things would fall
into three lines and when that just
break the whole layout
yeah and it's getting so close to the
side here I sort of like the look of it
I just don't think it's gonna be
reusable and I don't want this one to be
different from the rest I mean I guess I
sort of like it though I just I find
it's lacking a little something right
now but I have to think of how it's
gonna work on the smallest one maybe
that's something we could do on when we
get to the big screens mobiles a little
bit simpler but on the big screens I
just thought of that I guess we have to
click on it and it's gonna get a focus
state and then once it has the focus
state we'd get our little link and we'd
read more it's how we're gonna have to
do it cuz yeah one click focus comes on
it this pops up and then I click on that
too to act it to go and read more that's
what we'll be doing just read more make
sense or like because like here I guess
there's like a short description and
then find it more but then here it's a
project named read more reading we
haven't read anything yet
we'll come up with a better word infer
that though later is there anything Oh
oh yeah we need to come up the main
focus of this one guys is the fun part
now I'm actually just gonna can I not do
this
artboards hey can i not copy the whole
artboard I can cool okay so what I want
to be doing here is like we click meet
you we click we get this screen that's
kind of weird I'm doing on the two sides
anyway
we click here we get this pop-up and
then I click the the read if I click
anywhere else I guess it goes away or
well anywhere else I need to do I need
to click on this I should make this
stand out see if I do that it hides it
so it needs to be white maybe the font
size could be bigger I was doing 14 what
if I did like a 16 yeah and again read
more or we'll fix that now this is gonna
look completely different white
background
it's gonna be an overlay I want it
actually I shouldn't have copied that
one
I'm gonna delete this actually let's
delete the whole artboard I want to make
sure in this case there was this one I
want to make sure in this case that my
overlay is exactly the size of my screen
I think well maybe I'll have some you
know we might have a long text so maybe
we'll go below the fold mmm
I was gonna try and keep it on a single
screen though we'll see if I can pull
that off
if not we'll have some scrolling so what
I would have is I want to try and keep
consistent with what we see here to a
certain extent but the colors will
change so we'll have like project name I
guess like a new project title whatever
we want like that or I guess in this
case it could actually go over so I
could go like that I have this font
though that I'm using I'm wondering I
might actually copy this because I do
like the look at that so this would be
like project name and then we could
reuse some CSS which would be nice sub
sub title goes here mmm
the only thing is I was thinking about
having like a nice big picture maybe we
could just do something like that then
so say we do that then we have a sub
title and then that's just copy to you
and paste it whoops I want some text now
it's way too much text I definitely want
to be able to offer more pictures lo but
I want like a big picture in this case I
should it should be this picture that
would make more sense for what we're
doing I just love this though that it
just does like a background size cover
style thing where it just fills the
whole thing out
how come I can't send you back is it not
like realizing that it's on this
artboard right click arrange send to
back thank you it's like clicking on the
wrong thing maybe anyway we'll do that
yeah but now I care okay so what if I
did something oh I wonder if this would
work I never thought of doing it what am
I doing wrong for sending back
what's the shortcut for sending back I
was doing it before I'm on the French
keyboard yeah I think what the problem
was I don't have a CC do your thing you
there it's telling me to use a French
shortcut I'm in Canada and I'm in Quebec
where we speak see now it's back to
English we speak some French here make
shortcuts no one work but anyway my
keyboard sometimes switches back and
forth cuz sometimes I do need to switch
it uh bring forward there we go and if
this was white I should make it white
while you wait would something like that
be kind of cool
can't really I really hadn't planned
this part out to the level that maybe I
should have I almost feel like that's
cool but not quite cool enough to want
to do unless I made the picture bigger
I'm getting into like a whole bunch of
extra CSS just for this border color
actually it should be the dark one and
then like 20% except now I just can't
see it
none of my shortcuts are working anymore
none of them what did I do
I might have to save and quit and come
back I still can't see it but it really
it's just I'm gonna have to bump you up
more than I want this will vary so much
based on the picture but I think it's
nice I mean under line there and I want
it to be like full width here because
who knows what the name of the project
is maybe we could just do that cuz oh my
goodness
spacebar is zooming in which it
shouldn't be doing okay I fixed my
shortcuts without quitting the program I
don't even know what I did
but I'm happy it's working so because
it's using the same picture maybe this
would work that would look kind of cool
the subtitle I can't really read and
what if you want a long subtitle I mean
this this area probably like grow to fit
a longer title and subtitle I might have
to try out some different use cases or I
mean even if it's build out the ball I
don't know I'm gonna say this is what it
looks like um it's kind of hard to read
it what if I went with like a grey
instead that might be easier to read but
if I did that then I'd also want my
border color to be great
yeah papa or does the subtitle just come
down to here I should have line things
up a little better subtitle and then
this line could come underneath the
subtitle and then it would be like that
color and then this could be a lot
smaller and then that would sort of just
fit together so I need the line here
then probably not we can do something
like that sort of harkens back to this a
little bit but not exactly but mm you
know you still get the same fonts the
colors are related I think we may do
that and I said that I was gonna try and
make everything fit but that's just not
gonna happen and actually I want you
like that so we can extend it cuz I do
definitely want to have more pictures
available to me I think if the idea here
um and this would be I'm sort of jumping
all over the place a little bit here but
the idea here would be that this is sort
of like um this would be sort of like a
case study so we're getting more
information on it's not just like just a
bunch more pictures I want like a big
picture some text and then more pictures
and stuff so for now I'm actually just
gonna use the same picture a few times
maybe we could do like it's gonna be
harder on mobile I think this will be
maybe we'll just do like a full sized
picture like that and the text like a
little you have some text a nice big
image have a bit more text and this is
where like that
this grid thing will come in handy
actually I can even delete you and you
select you and you and just do a repeat
grid and you know we could throw some
different pictures in there and the text
lengths don't all have to be the same
but we could do something like that now
I just realized
a mistake I made though or is it a
mistake no it isn't this is where
go to my assets and I can pull up my
symbol I want you here because I want to
be able to X out right I need to be able
to leave this screen at one point that X
is way too big but anyway I definitely
need to be able to leave this screen so
it pops up but I want to be able to
leave the only thing I'm wondering but
like say we're on a phone and it's a
long one and we scroll the way down how
do we then get more information after is
one thing I'm curious about how we get
back to like over here since it's a full
screen overlay like I've seen a lot of
pages we have to come back up to the top
and X out so it's not like it's the end
of the world but I'm wondering if we
can't come up with a better idea and I'm
wondering if this could be like you know
there wouldn't all be the same picture
but I'm yeah say well let's just do
three pictures just cuz I'm you know
it's on a group the grid here so I have
different pieces just cuz I think if
like I may have it that's linked they're
grouped on group okay I'm just thinking
like let's just delete this one actually
and then we could have a bit more text
give that you have a picture maybe then
you can have another picture that's more
that's in but it's like a bigger picture
this way I have my text down here
somewhere that I can't select okay for
something that was going to be not
scrolling that didn't really work out it
and then like another block of text and
then of course we could have more images
let's say it's up to three pictures
don't do something like that give a room
for three and again this is just for
Leia we could have like 20 pictures
right it doesn't have to be that some
pictures could be like this I'll have a
class for pictures like that and a class
for pictures like this and I'm just
gonna leave that off it could be as long
or as short as we need but it's just
that we can include pictures and then
what will we have I'm wondering if we
should have like a little like go back
button here go back I don't know if
we'll call it go back but like something
that's obviously a link that will let
like so we don't have to scroll all the
way back up and hit the X so if you're
here you look at it you read a little
bit you want to get out the X should be
obvious enough it to be another thing
that slides out I want to keep the
sliding motion the same for all the
menus that came out maybe one thing will
come from the right and another thing
will come from the left but the whole
idea is you can see that it's like the
other information is still behind we're
not on a different page I want to make
it really obvious that we're staying on
the same page all the time should these
just be a different page we just sit
back on the browser am i overthinking it
by making it but I think it's gonna be
just more interesting for coding
purposes to make it um not like that
because then we get to do some
JavaScript go back to go back we're go
back just go back people are gonna be
like what do you mean go back I'll go
back to my other work see my other
projects see my other projects might
work better and I think I'm I don't it
doesn't look enough like a link so we're
gonna make this look like a link I hate
underlines I've seen some really nice
ones on some sites like where they have
like of this big thick border
should we do something like that like
this big thick border I don't know does
that look good
not really it was great
no it looks better with the blue is that
just too big maybe five if I did that
I'd want it more like or what if instead
you can't do like dotted borders in here
what's the plus plus now you just add
colors to be able to use that's handy
hmm that's interesting it has to be a
solid water whoops what if I and since
I'm doing it here what if I brought this
over to this one too but we made that
white of course I should make white
color in here because I'm using it
enough you know my links that's crooked
now undo undo
oh my original one was crooked nice hold
shift when you're working guys ugly
though that looks like crap I want to be
consistent with this I'm going to do it
so what if it was just two pixels read
more I'm thinking making it a dotted
line instead just so it's not like super
ugly and that would mean I sort of like
this one but what if it's too good just
maybe with an arrow on it like a little
arrow a symbol we could come in and make
something like that we're doing two
pixels for everything so at two pixels
this is like the simplest illustration
ever two pixels and make it that color
and then literally just like don't even
need whoops wrong one maybe forty would
be too much well even I did three ten
you know we just didn't uh euro so if I
didn't we need o when he needs me
can I reflect things arranged path
convert to path no I can't just like
flip line to pixel grid I don't want to
do arrange okay whatever that's 90 90 45
90 okay now that doesn't even look great
that way or is it cuz I whoops
something that's way off here maybe I
should have used the pen tool
yes screw this pen tool thank you
there we go 2 pixels there we go
whoops Oh seriously it's doing a film Oh
guys I'm dumb this is a stroke and know
what I'm choosing that okay I just just
means I need to I drop here there we go
that was really not smart of me let's
make that a bit smaller maybe a nice
little arrow you can add that to our
symbols and then we could also use that
like here but it would be white we could
do this with some cool trickery - I
think it's a symbol you have you can't
keep the color I guess is like locked in
here
like what if I want only this symbol to
be white I can't do that on the group
symbol like white okay whatever let's
just do that on group symbol and the
border color is white and then if I do
this and make a new symbol I get a white
arrow okay whatever it's kind of silly
we can't well I guess I get it I
I'd like to more easily be able to
change the color of my symbols okay
again I'd probably change the read more
text but I'm not gonna worry about that
for the moment we get to here see my
other projects that just means come back
to this maybe it's misleading but
whatever that would come back to this
screen here and then of course we can
look at the other stuff as well maybe
I'll change that maybe this won't be X
maybe yeah we're gonna keep it as an X
it's gonna be an overlay there we go I
think that's let's just zoom out to see
what we have so far I'm gonna change
let's just take you cuz I think this
just makes more sense to display it in
this order because this is like the
workflow we go from here to here to here
right so since we're looking at X D and
I know this is more about like design
and everything but one cool thing we can
do if I remember how prototype I want if
I click on that it will woops these
durations fine choose an artboard it
will go to my work overlay can I have it
dissolve slide slide right I guess oh no
no no not slide push push right let's
see if that works so that should be cool
this is my work overlay and this is my
portfolio item so then from let's say
this if I click on that it will go to my
portfolio item and so portfolio item
and whoops it will also be a push right
good if I click on this it will go to
previous art board series art board good
did that work
yep and then if I click actually let's
just make it so this goes back to my
work which one is that
that was this called this one there we
go perfect and let's see if that works
no it's not the right button this one so
here we go this is what my page will
look like oh we could also do that one
let's do that before I start so here if
I click on this it's going to come if I
can we just click and drag I thought we
could I can okay so that will come to
here it will be a push right to and then
if I click on this it will bring me back
to you here cool so let's go and try it
out play so I click here I awesome push
right I had to fix that to be a push
left let's do that actually
how do way this will be a push left so
it should go I'm on my screen I can do
that if I X out it's lights out so
that's exactly the behavior that I want
this to have it pushes and pushes cool
then when I'm on here I scrolled down
that's looking pretty good
I'm happy I'm happy I get to here I
click no I won't actually that should be
dissolved right sorry I'm thinking about
this stuff so this one will be a will do
dissolve because I think that's the most
realistic to what this will actually
look like so we get to here I click on
that it gets to there that's perfect and
then I click on read more
it pushes over I think I might have that
push from the other side but whatever
then either clicking this I didn't think
that one up but I'm not gonna do that
now I see my portfolio I read all my
stuff and then I can click on there and
go back but of course when it goes back
you would go back to like here but I'm
not worried about the height so that's
cool that's working good and just to see
the rest my spacing is
didn't know it looks okay down here oh
the scrollbar I think is screwing up my
spacing in alignment a little bit that's
okay um yeah
cool awesome so we're gonna click and
then read more yeah I think the read
more is actually gonna push in from the
other side but that's just a small
little detail I'm pretty happy with that
awesome so I'm really happy with that
actually I hope you are too if you liked
the video make sure you hit the thumbs
up if you have anything else you want to
say just let me know
don't forget until next time to make
your corn on the internet just a little
bit more awesome and next video we're
almost done the design I know you guys
are maybe fed up with all this but one
more design video I want to know what
this is gonna look like when it's on my
big screens and then after that we're
coating it up and when we code this
again it is with the grid now we're
gonna be using some JavaScript and I
think it would be a lot of fun so yeah
that's it for now laid off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
