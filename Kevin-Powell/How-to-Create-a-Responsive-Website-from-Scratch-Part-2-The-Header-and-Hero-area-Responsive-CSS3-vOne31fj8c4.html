creating a responsive website from
scratch in today's video we're going to
be turning this up here into this right
here so in the previous video we put all
of our HTML together we got everything
on the page in this video I'm going to
be looking at turning this part right up
here at the top to look something like
this and we will be making it fully
responsive so what are we waiting for
let's get started so the only thing I've
done since we left off on the last video
is I have imported my google fonts in
here and the font I'm using is called
railway so you could look that up on
google fonts and in my design I used the
300 400 700 and 900 weights which is
light the normal bold and the heavier
black or whatever the thickest one is so
let's just jump right into this the
first thing I'm going to be doing is
let's go to our body and there's a few
basic things I want to do on here let's
get rid of our margin so a margin of 0
and our font family everything on the
site is the same which was a rail
railway and saw serif will be fine there
we go we can see that it did update
there let me just move that over an edge
there we go
and the one other thing I'm going to do
here is do a text align Center if I look
at my design everything on the mobile
view is Center aligned text
oh this isn't but everything else is so
for the most part we're looking at some
center aligning so I'm going to put that
as my default on there for the for now
on my body oh and I did forget one thing
there we go okay and I did forget one
thing that I do on all my sites I'm
going to put a star here which is going
to select everything and choose my
border box not border box box-sizing
box-sizing border box and if you don't
know what this does it just makes
padding a million times easier to deal
with because in padding doesn't add too
the total size of something the box size
is the margins are outside of the size
but say something as a width of 300 and
you add padding the width will be 300
including the padding it's wonderful so
if you've never used border box please
try it out you'll be very very happy you
did and this should be the default but
of course it's not now we can jump right
away into our next part so in my whoops
story in my CSS I do like to use a lot
of comments so this will be my header
and in my header we have my logo which
doesn't we don't need to do too much
with my header will be a position I
always do that when I put a comment at
the top I forget to make my selector
after so my header will be a
position:absolute and I think I'm going
to put a little bit of margin top on it
of say 1m let's see what that looks like
though um actually I'm going to take
this off until I've fixed other stuff on
there let's just make it a comment I'm
not doing too good with my comments
today either let's just turn that into a
nice little geez
there we go I think that yeah my spacing
there looks okay margin top that should
be fine and I'm going to be going with
all m/s and REMS in this design for font
sizes and padding and margin I've been
pretty good with that but for actual
widths of things I tend to always go to
pixel value so I'm going to be pushing
myself to focus on using m/s and REMS
for everything on here I'm going to not
put any pixel value for anything and
let's see how that goes and then we want
my nav so my nav itself I don't think I
need to do anything for it for now but
my UL that my margin is zero my padding
is zero and my list style
none then I need to come down and do my
nav Li this blue display it is display
display:inline-block which will put them
in a line when that updates it's
updating really slowly for some reason
so I had a small problem with my
recording I lost part of what I recorded
I don't know quite what happened but
that's okay I've gone back in time and
set this up I pretty sure exactly where
I left off I'm just sort of doing the
middle section right now I'm so just if
anything was kind of out of place that
might be why so with our ul set up
properly we now want to come in to our
nav Li so for my list items there's not
too much I need to do here just do a
nice little display:inline-block as well
as a margin let's just actually let's
start with the inline block just there
we go we can see them in a line and then
a margin of let's try one M actually
that looks pretty good I'm pretty happy
with that
and now let's jump down to our nav a so
our links in our nav there's a few
things I want to do here they're bold in
my design so a font weight I think would
be about eight hundred nine hundred we
want to do a text declaration of none to
get rid of that underline that looks
nice
I'm going to do a text transform upper
case we need to also change the font
size looks a little bit big font size
point seven well that's way too small
point geek that looks better now they
look a little bit a little bit close
together but I think what I'm going to
do is just open up maybe the font size
is too snow I think I'm going to keep it
like that but there's a bit more space
between them here and I have here and I
think what I'm going to do is use a
little bit of padding and let's just go
with a padding of 0.75 mm what about
this point 5.5 looks pretty good and by
putting padding on it and we're looking
mobile and they're not the biggest I
want links in the world and let's just
give this a background background of
pink
oops so that whole pink area is
clickable so if I didn't have my padding
obviously I have to click right on the
word and with that padding it gives me a
little bit more spacing but more
importantly is it's making a bigger
clickable area on the computer that's
not such a big deal but most people are
mobile these days we're thinking mobile
first and if we have our big fingers or
we're using our thumb to click on
something it makes it just a little bit
easier if we're actually making the
clickable area a little bit bigger so I
wouldn't do that on all my links but for
something like that that we can hide
away by not actually having a background
on it it can be pretty good now I also
need to come in here and change the by
the color of these to white before I do
that let's move down a little bit and
set up my hero area so we have a
background that we can work with so
actually let's just come up and copy
that home hero and let's jump into that
there's not a lot I don't think we need
to do for this actually so we need our
background and background image URL and
it's in my improves in my image folder
and 0bg JPEG ah there we go great so we
can see that coming in now I want to
also give this a bit of padding so let's
come and just do a padding of we'll
start with 10 top and bottom nothing on
the left and right and that looks okay
now obviously we need this to actually
be uh this all here should be on top of
that and that's where that
position:absolute comes
into play so let's go and do that and
perfect so now this is on top of my
picture now one thing the
position:absolute does is it doesn't
have it stretch the whole size anymore
it makes it shrink down so the easiest
way to get over that is just left 0
right 0 or I guess I could just put
width to 100% as well now I can come in
and change my link colors as well there
we go we have my link colors and if I'm
going to be giving my links a color I'm
also going to give them a hover and if
I'm giving something hover I'm also
going to give it a focus color let's
just go with D D D and yeah that looks
pretty good it's a really really subtle
but we don't need much I just want that
nice little subtle effect I'm also going
to come in here and do an inspect
element and set this up for my iPhone
whoops and I forgot completely about
this my images right now are way too big
they're massive and it's causing this to
sort of zoom out to be able to fit my
image properly so something if you're
doing responsive websites that you'll
want to do all the time select all of
your images and change the width but not
with the max width to 100% so the
biggest they can get is the size of
their container and just to be safe
we'll set the height to auto wow that
looks better and now my image is shrunk
down to fit their parent so I need to
make a few changes to here and I'm going
to come up to here and I haven't done
this yet but we need a typography
section type type typography ah there we
go
so my typography I will be doing some
other ones but the only one I need so
far is my title it's a little small
right now um actually let's just go down
to the header for a second
not the header the section home here oh
I don't have a container in here oh jeez
I forgot to put containers when I did my
HTML didn't I a container I'm going to
throw a container inside of there just
to be safe I think that makes more sense
home here oh let's just do a container
in here and this is I tend to forget to
do containers until it's at this stage a
lot of the time this not my typography
something I use a lot I tend to keep
these up at the top so my container just
for mobile purposes will have to do with
of 95% and margin:0 auto and there we go
it just stops the text from actually
touching the side of the screen so that
looks a little bit nicer and I just
scrolled down but I still want to be
here
title my title will be font size of no 4
M that might be too big yeah that's a
2.5 maybe that's not too bad actually
that would be a pretty good font size
that's it yeah I like that and then I
have actually that's all I need further
there and then my title span would be a
font weight of 300 and I want to also do
a display block on this just so it's
always on its own line and it looks a
little bit too big and let's just jump
back here for a second I definitely have
a smaller font size on that and this is
where M's are amazing so my font size if
I did you know by default its 1 so 1 it
won't change at all if I made this too
it's going to become twice as big as
this one if I did point 5 it's going to
be 1/2
of that size so it makes it really easy
to put things in relation to each other
point eight point eight five point nine
I like that better
and obviously my color is off but I'm
going to do my color just on here color
FFF for white that looks pretty good
let's just jump back to photoshop for a
second I know here I'd had it on one
line and then now it's falling on on
more lines than but that's okay I think
it looks pretty good I'm happy with
everything there actually I just have my
button to finish up so again I'm going
to jump back up to my typography my
buttons come through a subsection
buttons and I have my dot button so dot
button my class of button and this will
have a font size definitely needs to be
bigger and let's say 1.5 RAM that looks
pretty good
text declaration should be none my text
transformation tricks transform
uppercase so all of my buttons are going
to have a border they have that sort of
the ghost style so let's just do a
border width of two pixels a border
style of solid and the advantage of
doing this so I have my border when I do
my different ones I just have to worry
about changing the border color and even
do I need to worry about changing the
border color it's just going to follow
the font color I might not even have to
we'll see as we go through border width
of two pixels that's good that's good
now I just need a bit of padding so it's
a padding top and bottom point 5m left
and right 1.5 in
that's not terrible actually 1.75 that's
better and I did forget
display:inline-block and it's just so if
I don't do the display:inline-block the
padding doesn't actually add to the
height of my whole thing so if you
didn't have room here they would sort of
merge into each other it's kind of weird
so the inline-block just make sure
things work properly and now I need to
change it looks a little bit big
actually now does that look a bit big
it's pretty big here but I'm just
thinking it's massive compared to
everything I'm going to change this to
the font size like 1.1 I'm just looking
at like the balance of the screen right
now if that was bigger I think it would
have been really a bit too much and my
title is going to get margin-bottom
1.5 M's yeah just to create a bit more
space there I think that looks nicer and
then my button accent will have a color
of let's see if a 0 0 FF c6 and actually
I'm pretty happy with how that looks
it's a nice balance yeah um the smaller
size it's still really grabbing our
attention with that bright bright green
so I'm pretty happy with that and then
let's come down if I have a button I do
want to have a button accent cover and
if I have the hover I do also want to do
a button accent focus and all I'm going
to change here let's change my
background to the 0 0 FF c6 and my font
will have to change colors color will be
at 23 23 23 which is going to be the
same dark color
that I have here and elsewhere just so
it's the same everywhere
so if I there we go oh the only problem
with that is my border color changes too
because it's changing with the font
color and border color I might as well
just set my border color here so it's
always the same my border color will not
be the same as my text my border color
will just always be this green color
that looks better
yep definitely and now we need to worry
about this what it's going to look like
on the big screen so let's get out of
our responsive view and let's actually
shove this over a little bit and what I
wanted to do with the big screen is I
want this area being a lot bigger so the
first thing I'm going to do is come into
here and add a media query so I have
media and we're going with a min width
and this is where things might change
width of I said I don't wanna have any
pixel values and figuring it wits
overall is a bit of a challenge for me
when it comes to using m/s and REM still
I'm thinking about you know when I get
to let's just turn this back on and go
to the responsive responsive so when I'm
getting to about 800 pixels ish a you
know 800 exactly would be 50 50 REMS cuz
50 times 16 is 800 so I think I want to
go a little bit bigger than that because
I think 800 it's looking pretty good at
800 but when I get to a bit bigger 900 I
don't know let's just try 55 minimum
with the 55 Rams
let's see what happens let's go with dot
title not tight til I am going all over
there we go
font size of this time I want to get
quite a bigger for too big too big for
that screen size for sure for three
let's just see how that that's not bad
and I might want it to get even bigger
at bigger screen sizes let's just see
yeah I would actually oh it's like I'm
900 900 when I'm switching it's like
eight 880 oh that makes sense yeah 880
so I date a DM changing from there to
there what I think I'm actually going to
do is make this 60 and change this up to
for floor might still be a bit too big
let's see actually
I'm going to be let's make it a little
bit better to smaller 30.7 yeah it looks
better to me that's much better
okay so I like that now there's a few
other things I want to do this has to
have some floats going on so let's just
copy that and when I do my media queries
I have a tendency to keep them all just
grouped together it makes my life a lot
easier so at the end of my navigation
I'm putting in my nav media queries and
at the end of my typography I put in all
my typography ones and stuff like that
so what I want to do at this is I can
probably do this at a smaller screen
size we'll stick it at the same one for
now though just to have one breakpoint
and that means my dot logo will float
left and my nav will float right let's
see whoops
I don't want that actually touching the
side there though but yeah I'm pretty
happy with that
um except I don't want that touching the
side so the easiest thing for that would
just be my header has a margin margin
top let's just do a margin of 1m top
I'll just do one M on all sides so I
have one M you know the margin is the
same all the way around and then it's
that's perfect so that makes sense to me
and it sticks to O and I'm just
realizing now I forgot I see my
backgrounds having some issues which I
forgot to look at I'm all over the place
here section will be down a bit lower
background image I need my background
size to be cover and I want my
background position to be Center ah
that looks better there we go so my
pictures not tiling which is a bad thing
to happen
okay so we're getting there I'm going to
close my inspect element for now though
because I don't when I'm at a big screen
size like this I want this to take up a
lot more room I think at the smaller
screen sizes it looks fine
but at the bigger screen size what I
want it to do is so we're going to come
right here at media min-width of I think
we're doing sixty REMS it's going to
have a height right and I always do this
at home Hiro will have a height of 100
viewport height so it's going to take up
the whole space and then the next one
will be right below so having a viewport
height it just means that you know even
if I'm here scroll down and it's
stopping the so the viewport height it's
it's the height of this is matching that
but what I also want to do is come and
give it a bit of padding top of say 40 I
think 50 be too much yeah because I want
this to be pretty much in the middle of
my screen and if it's 50 it's starting
at the middle so it's all offset with 35
it's pretty good actually I was worried
that would be too much too short but
pretty happy with that and then see our
work see now my button could probably be
a bit bigger so let's just run up what
let's scroll up here to my buttons
um and I'm gonna do one no we'll just
stay consistent at media
men with sixty REM and I want to do a my
button font size is 1.5 it's gonna get a
lot bigger there we go
so my padding by being in m/s again just
to get back on this is proportional to
the font size so if the font size gets
bigger my padding gets bigger with it so
at the small one I have small the
padding is smaller and then when my font
gets bigger that gets bigger and that
looks pretty good and I think I am done
with this part of it um my navigations
there my navigation was working good at
all screen sizes yeah it's I mean it's
not perfect the way that's breaking but
I'd rather that because this is bold and
that's not bold it looks a little nicer
so that span being block and especially
therefore was up here would look really
weird so I think that that is the best
solution and then once we get to the
bigger screen size bang it really gets
big so that's it for this video guys
that's done where this section is
completely finished we've taken our
header and our first section and I think
it's looking really nice as usual if you
