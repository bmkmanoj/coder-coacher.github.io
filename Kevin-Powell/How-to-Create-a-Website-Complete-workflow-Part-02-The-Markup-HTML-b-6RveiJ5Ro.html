my series on how to build a website from
scratch and we're looking at my complete
process in this one from A to Z in the
last video if you didn't watch that one
you should go and watch it you can click
the little card that should be popping
up right now and in that video we are
looking at or not looking at where we
did look at how to set everything up so
I set up github I set up a few other
things I made my file structure I put
everything together I already had the
design since the last video the only
thing I've done is I've added this image
folder and just threw all of my assets
hello why is this not responding yeah
they're there all of my assets in there
so I've also gone and updated my github
already for this project so if you come
and look you will see the images they
are in there so again if you do want to
follow along with this everything I've
done so far is present in here the link
is in the description below and if you
want to work along on the project with
me you can fork it and make changes to
it and put in some pull requests by all
means and as I mentioned in the last one
if you don't know what a pull request is
don't feel bad at all
but I would encourage you to start
familiarizing yourself with github a
little bit and if it's something you
would like to see me cover just let me
know in the comments below and maybe we
could do a video with a quick
introduction to github at one point once
this whole series is done so without out
of the way let's actually start some
coding and stuff here so I made my index
file in the last video but there's
nothing at all in here one thing I did
mention in the last video is that it's
really a good idea to set up a template
to use so my file structure it's always
pretty much the same thing that I'm
using so I like using that as a sort of
a template folder and I'd normally also
have a template here in my HTML but
let's write it out from scratch for this
since I said we're going to be doing
everything from scratch so my doctype
HTML so then we need my HTML and closed
HTML inside there we have a couple of
things we need we have my head will
close off my head and we need my body
body
clothes body there we go so there's the
basic basic structure up in my head
there's a few things we're going to want
to add I'm going to put in my medic our
set of utf8 oh no what happened Yukie f8
and I'm also this will be a responsive
website so if you haven't done a lot of
responsive stuff you will need this one
so the name of it is viewport and the
content is equal to width is equal to
device device width comma initial scale
is equal to 1 and I made a mistake
somewhere in here oops
content is equal to width is equal to
there we go so content with is equal to
device width initial scale 1 and what
that's going to do is it's going to let
this be properly responsive and
everything should work properly for that
the next thing I'm going to do here now
is come and do a title we'll call it app
belay happy lid I made a spelling
mistake Appy licious close title and I'm
going to link to my CSS link href is
equal to C SS / main dot CSS rel is
equal to stylesheet and of course if you
have any other meta tags you want to put
in there you can but for I'm sticking
with the very basics in this one and
that's I think all I'm going to need and
that should be it for the head so let's
hit save and I think I forgot to do one
thing let's open up github here for a
second and again if you didn't watch the
other video I am using the github
software so there is one change to my
index I'm going to create a branch for
this so I'm going to do a branch and
let's call it mark up and create new
branch super
so if you're not familiar with github
it's making it so right now I'm not
actually over writing my original stuff
that was up there I'm creating a second
stream of content it will just prevent
me from overwriting any of my things in
case I make a mistake somewhere along
the way because I'm using Adam and Adam
is linked to github this is showing me
that I have made a change here and that
change hasn't been pushed onto my onto
github yet it's only local on my
computer
okay so let's actually get started with
the creation of the the mark-up putting
the content on our site so I'm going to
keep the design here on the side because
I like looking at this while I'm doing
this so the first thing we're going to
need is this logo here and I will be
adding a navigation in that's going to
go in a header and then then I have this
main hero area here which is sort of
underneath but this is going on top but
so I think what we're going to do is I'm
going to open up a I'm using Emmet for
this just because I find it a little bit
easier so my header which we'll call
main header I like giving everything
classes and it'll just do that inside my
header I am going to want to put a
container because right now I want to
make sure that it's held all this you
can see is going to be held to a maximum
width on my screen and centered so I'm
going to have lots of containers on my
site so let's just do a div class of
container and I'm also going to call
this I'm going to be building a grid
system in here it's gonna be a very
simple flexbox grid system so anywhere I
have columns I'm going to need to use
the grid now I'm just trying to think
can I make just my container be my grid
or no I don't want my container to be a
grid because down here this is breaking
outside of my container but I still need
the grid there this doesn't all I don't
need a really a container there either
oops my background shifted a bit there
that's okay I don't really need em yeah
but so if we look here I'm gonna have a
grid inside of my container I'm gonna
have my grids to column system so I'm
gonna have a column system inside the
container a column system inside my
container and then a column system
outside of my container so in this case
we'll do grid so I have a div with a
which will be a container and it will
also be my grid which is setting up my
column system and we'll be setting all
of that up in the next video so if
you're curious about all of that and
what I'm actually talking about you'll
see how that works once we get there now
inside of my main header I am going to
have my logo and for that we are going
to set up a div of logo and I'm just
going to throw an image in there for now
you could also do this as a background
image and there's some tricks for text
offset and all of that but I'm just
going to do it the really nice and
simple way which is just doing my that
and then with an image inside of it and
my image is image / logo dot SVG and if
you don't know what an SVG is it's just
a scalable vector graphic it lets my
logo stay as a vector and my alternate
text is a delicious logo Wow a Palacios
is really hard to spell okay so I have
my logo that's going to be sitting over
here and my nav which we haven't looked
at yet but my navigation will be getting
put over right over there
so for my nav nice and simple we're
going to do a nav tag and I'm going to
call this main nav I'm gonna have a main
nav and I'm going to have a footer nav
Donaire I have a footer NAB that will be
different now the reason I did I like
giving everything classes I'm not going
to have a nav tag in my footer normally
your nav tag is associated only with
your main navigation so if you have
secondary navigations or other
navigations you generally don't you
shouldn't be putting them in nav tags
this is usually reserved or is reserved
for
your main primary navigation but I'm
still going to give it a class just
because I like giving everything classes
I find it a little bit easier to work
when they all have the same specificity
whereas a tag and a class have different
specificity okay so in there I will have
my UL and inside my UL I will have five
list items and inside each list item
there will be a link that will pump that
out and I'm actually going to class is
equal to nav and you'll see why I did
that
yes so my main navigation now we'll call
it map list sorry so I my main
navigation and then my UL is my nav list
I'm just going to use that as some basic
styling to take all of my you know the
bullet points away in the padding away
and all of that away okay perfect so
what are we doing now doo doo doo doo
doo I need to put my links in here so we
have a home we're going to have an about
I'm not going to be building all these
pages I just want to have a navigation
blog pricing and contact sort of a
typical type of navigation that you
might find so that's it for my header
it's just going to have those two
elements in there my logo and my main
navigation and that's it for my header
we're going to come down to my hero area
now I'm gonna put a comment here I like
commenting my HTML as much as possible
hero area I know there's some people who
come in whoops that's not what I want
your area some people do a lot more
commenting than I do
but I like to keep it nice and simple
but I'm going to be starting my hero
area so I like to have a little comment
just saying that so it makes it easier
for me to navigate around so my hero
area is this area right here it has this
big text these two buttons and this here
right on the side so we'll start with a
section with a class of
here oh nice and simple so inside of
this section we're going to have a few
things I do need a container again to
hold everything in place and I am going
to have two columns so there'll be two
columns there and then now I need two
columns here so we're going to do any
other container grid so this I am going
to call this one don't need to write div
I just want this to be my hero text oops
hero text when inside of there I need an
h1 class of title large and I will need
a paragraph trying to think the reason
that I'm thinking of title large is I'm
going to have this big title here and
then I'm going to have this one here and
they're going to be the same so I do
like styling it a little bit I'm not I
don't want it just to be my normal h1 I
want it to have a special class make it
bigger so yeah I'm gonna go with h1
title large and paragraph Hiro intro no
paragraph para large or solid intro yeah
we'll call it intro so that's sort of an
intro paragraph can make it bigger that
could be reused on other pages whenever
you need a paragraph that's going to be
a little bit bigger than everything you
can put some intro class on there to
increase its size compared to what it
normally would be
and the title large will be my large
titles we also will need to have my
buttons so my buttons will be a a class
button and I have two different buttons
so I'm gonna have a BTN
BTN BTN secondary plus an a button
button primary and let's a space this
out a little bit
whoops this first button is learn more
this second one is get the app and let's
just go and copy and paste my text in
okay and I want to save that now one
thing that you might see that I'm doing
a little bit differently is here I've
put in two hyphens and here I only have
one - basically the way I like to work
is if first of all I have my hero and
then inside of there I have my hero text
div so whenever I have things that are
inside of something else in there that's
where they're supposed to live I always
try and keep them with the same name to
start with it helps me in when I'm
reading my CSS stay nice and organized
and read it a little bit faster if it's
a div on its own so it's just like this
is my hero text box that's it it's not
anything else it just hits one - because
I can't put a space the double - for me
is when it's a modifier so I have my
button and then I'm modifying the
default class with this secondary class
so I'm adding on top of what my original
button was so in this case this hero
text isn't modifying the hero at all
it's sort of its own entity inside of
the hero whereas my button secondary my
button primary are modifying the default
styles of the button or adding on top of
the default styles of the button so I
want to give them their own class but
they get the little double - just to
help separate things a little bit and
there's lots of different naming
conventions out there if you don't like
this use your own but do have a naming
convention and if you're really not sure
look up some naming conventions for CSS
there's max and Knox and there's a whole
bunch of stuff out there so do a link to
some in the description below you can
check them out but I definitely would
try and find a naming convention you're
comfortable with and of course if you
end up doing this as a job you'll
probably be working in a team and you'll
have to learn your team's naming
convention as well but for now for me
this is how I am going to work so I'm
just going to space this out a little
bit to make it easier for me inside of
here so this is this part whoops this is
this part here right now and then we'll
come in and do for the phone so my phone
on the side there is also a div class is
equal to hero image
closed if and inside there we will have
our image with a clasp when you have a
clasp on there what am i doing no I just
thought of something this is no this is
little hero image I will keep them but
I'm going to put that on my image itself
clasp is equal to hero hero image and
let's just throw that in there IMG phone
dot PNG I when I did this I forgotten I
might have to come back up I forgot a
few things here I've created my grid so
this will create a column system but I
want to be able to control these columns
properly then I have to make my columns
I just have some divs in here so my hero
text will be a column and this will also
be a column and I'm just calling them
column for now because I'm using flexbox
it will be a pretty versatile column
system
I find flexbox for making columns is
super super handy it makes my life a lot
easier than having to set it up with
divs and calculating percentages and
stuff like that as you'll see when I get
there for now I'm going to leave these
as columns we might have to revisit this
but I'm gonna have to come up here and
do the same thing up here I have my logo
column and this will also be a column
okay so let's keep going your area is
nice and finished next in here I have
this promote your app thing so let's
just call it sales points so inside of
sales points what do we have well we
have sales points so let's just come up
with our sales points and that will also
be a sales points container this should
be my section section sales points
inside of this I need to put in my
container grid again let's just put that
in now this has a white background on it
so I could technically make my sales
points also be the container because I
don't have a background on there but
what if later down the road I wanted to
change the color of the background there
and it wasn't set up like this if my
sales points was also a container and I
tried putting a background on it it
would get limited to that size so even
if the design doesn't necessarily call
for it right away think about what could
happen the client could come back and
ask you to change it this could be your
own personal website and later on down
the road you're playing with your color
scheme you decide to change things this
makes it a lot more maintainable in the
long run and trying to make things
maintainable in the long run is always a
good idea um so what do we need in here
well we need this that's going to go
across the tops promote your app so that
will be an h1 that's just going to be my
normal h1 so let's promote your app and
underneath that we will have three divs
will they go inside of a div hahaha okay
we're going to do this so in here what
I'm going to do is I'm going to have a
div class of sales point so I have a big
div that has all my sales points and
then I have my individual sales point
times three so I'm gonna have three of
those inside each one of those I'm going
to have an image + + h2 plus a paragraph
so I'm going to have my image my h2 and
my paragraph and I have one two three of
them great app but I forgot they're all
so those will be my columns so just add
column on there you notice up let's just
put those all on
I've put just column for column even
though I have three columns here and
even though I have two columns here and
this is part of the beauty of flexbox as
long as your columns are equal widths
you can get away with doing stuff like
this I might have to modify it a little
bit this does this is bigger and this
one is smaller so I might have to modify
a slightly there but flexbox does give
us this where it can automatically just
figure out your columns for you if
they're all the same size so that's a
nice thing one of the really nice things
about flexbox
let's cut whoops let's come in and put
our actual pictures so my pictures are
image slash sales responsive dot PNG I
should have made these SVG's but I'm not
going to change it now paste paste this
second one I believe is sales hand and
the last one I think I called it sales
graph and again the sales points so
sales point and then sales for my images
and I did this on purpose when I was
creating or saving my images just to
keep the naming all consistent in the
same so for me it makes my life a little
bit easier and more organized I'm going
to save that and for the first time I'm
going to look at this and see what it
actually looks like because I haven't
been checking things at all and I just
want to make sure those images are
actually working I know where's my
project I am watching this alright okay
so something weird has happened along
the way
um take your app to the next level why
is there a giant space on the top here
oh my logo yeah we're gonna have to
resize that okay so there's my logo
that's taking up all that space up there
and then I have my navigation my comment
why are my comments showing up in here
what did I do
I'm putting it oh wow
nice one Kevin very very good I'm
putting in my CSS comments I feel that's
embarrassing
okay whoopsie doodles so you guys must
have been like what the hell is he doing
this whole time ah silly silly me save
that there we go no more comments and
let's fix that sale or did you take your
app to the next app to the next level
save I think it's I had a soft return
probably in Photoshop there we go
I just deleted the space and every said
what I did I deleted some stuff and
brought it back and it got rid of that
problem
and I'm missing one of my images so one
of the oh no it's there my browser is
just off the bottom okay
so so far so good let's just bring this
in so it's the right size cool we're
getting there guys we're getting there
let's move on to the next point okay my
next one is amazing app this is where
for me I end up having trouble naming
sections for here nice and easy it's
sales points it's descriptive of what's
going on I don't want to call the sales
points - I don't want to call it next
section but in this case it's very
specific content that's sort of there I
don't want to call it amazing let's call
it promote or is it a promotion promote
promote your app what do we call this
guys what do we call this if you come up
with a better name for this please give
me a suggestion in the comments below
because I hate naming things that are
sort of generic like this we're going to
call this section
and when I'm teaching the classroom I
get lots of people who would call this
like amazing app or you know I have this
box amazing box or amazing something
because the name of the section right
now is but that text can change so I
don't want to use any of the text in
here to really lead me to what I'm going
to be calling it doing great things for
you two pictures a box in the middle
just call it a promo promo section I
guess again if you have a better name
for this I'll be very very happy if you
suggest one to me I will gladly change
it or you can even put in a pull request
work it off put in a pull request and
yeah you could do that so let's see what
do I want in here someone have my
section of promo so let's just call a
section promo in here what are we gonna
have we're going to have my grid that's
not in a column because this is outside
of the column if it was a column
container sorry guys if that was in a
container it would be sort of blocking
everything off my backgrounds wouldn't
be able to escape so I'm just gonna have
a grid without a container in this case
and now grid drew Teitelbaum oops I need
this up here at the top so that will be
let's call that a title box it has a
title in it and I'm already using title
for my large title at the top and for
this those are my large titles so we'll
call this a title box so title box which
will have an h1 and a paragraph inside
of it
this app is amazing my paragraph is kind
of small and I can't read it
copy paste okay and after my title box
what do we need we need these two things
right there so for that I'm going to
have a column times two and what's the
first column has and normal h1 it has an
h2 and it has a paragraph a paragraph
and a a dot B
en dot BTN primary and that says get to
the app hmm whoops there we go get the
app doing great things for you copy
paste I have two paragraphs in here
whoops
copy paste
are they the exact they're not exactly
so copy paste closed paragraph okay so I
have my this that's going to across the
top then I have a column which will be
on the side here my column has my h1 my
h2 I did mention that this is a rough I
want this text in this text to be the
same this one will become white but
otherwise they should be exactly the
same I notice my letter spacing is a
little bit different I'm not going to be
playing with letter I'm going to be
setting it up so it's all consistent so
there's my h2 and then my regular
paragraphs and then my button that we
already have decided on so that's it
in my second column we are going to have
what are we going to have in the second
column there's just the picture and this
I have a feeling in I'm going to be
changing how I'm setting this up I don't
like having kala like an empty div with
no content in it so I could put this in
and I could put my picture in there
instead of doing it as a background
image but it would be much easier to set
up if the background image with a
background image but I don't like having
empty divs with no content in it okay
I'm going to do two things this might
change when we get to actually creating
this part but I'm going to call that
image box as well and in here where it
will add our image for the time being
image source is image / phone in hand
jpg and just put a hand holding a phone
yep we're gonna leave it like that for
now I don't know if I'm going to use
some overflow to prevent it from coming
out and just making sure that it's
always set up like that or I might do
that or I might just set it up as a
background image we'll see when we get
there I'm not 100% sure yet okay so then
we have this sort of next one down here
I have a lot of these get the app
buttons right now pen but you know it is
what it is so this one will be my call
to action that's sort of how I envision
this being a call to action right before
the footer so we'll call this one
section call to action and inside my
call to action this one is nice and easy
and we have a paragraph plus my h1 plus
my a BTN BTN primary again my paragraph
let's put the text in first and then
come up with some class names for this
after copy/paste okay that's fine I'm
just copying pasting so the showcase is
a little screwed up and this should say
get the app um the paragraph here is a
little bit different it's bold and I
believe it's a little bit bigger than
the rest um class should be it's not
intro we can call it something I'll get
to that in a second and this one I know
already class is equal to title large
yeah because it's the same one that we
used all the way up above there
so we have our title large that will be
there and I think what I'm going to do
for my title larges it's always going to
be just bold so I'm actually going to I
didn't do this at the beginning title
large I'm going to throw a span on there
take your app next level take your app
to the post BAM the reason I'm doing
this I'm going to use the span to make
it light or this thin text and then by
default it will be that nice big bold
because I think that normally you'd
probably get it looking like that
instead of I could use strong tag
instead but I don't really want it's
more visual here the next level it
doesn't really need to have the true
strong this to it so I'm not going to
use a strong tag I'm just going to use a
span to make the rest of it light makes
more sense in my head my paragraph does
need something here we'll call it a text
large I'm going to do that text large
and I'm actually going to come up to my
intro call it text intro just so it's
staying consistent again all my
paragraph modifiers will start with text
just paragraphs way too long to write so
text intro is intro text and text large
is to make it a little bit bigger bolder
the reason I'm not doing large text and
intro text is I dislike again having it
all start with the same word it makes my
CSS look a little bit more organized in
my own opinion and last but not least
we're finally there guys footer now one
thing with the footer is I have those
social icons but I'm actually going to
use font awesome to throw those in there
so we're gonna do it that way instead so
we have in my footer so we need to have
my
a footer with then a container we don't
need a grid in this one we don't need a
container either I don't think
everything's just center-aligned
container okay
so in here we will have what we have we
will have my h1 it's not really a
heading is it let's just throw a
paragraph there paragraph so we just
have a take your app to the next level
and we will have my another paragraph no
it will be a ul shouldn't have called
what we need to do what do we need to do
let me do a ul of social links and then
Li times 4 and with an A cool and we
will have another ul ul of nav and nav
footer and that will have Li times 5
actually let's just be lazy here and
copy the original one copy oh and I will
they call it an app list we nav list I'm
going to change nav list to on styled
list because I can use that for my
social links to on styled list copy
paste and bring that up
and unstyled list yes that is good that
will work
so the everything that's in a list if I
don't want it to have the default lift
style I can do on stab list now I could
be using a reset and getting rid of that
completely I'm going to be using
normalize instead I prefer normalize
like the whole complete reset sometimes
drives me a little bit crazy so I'm not
going to do the full reset and again I'm
thinking about long term if we were
going to build this out into a complete
site I will be putting you know it would
have a blog on there some other things
where we might want bullet points in a
regular list so if I just scrap them
from the beginning I'd have to code them
back game some people like doing it that
way with a full reset I don't like doing
that I prefer deconstructing it a little
bit it's really up to how you like to
work and now the only thing left to do
is to bring in these right here the my
my font awesome things there okay so to
be able to use font awesome I need to
you know use font awesome
I haven't actually linked to it yet and
I'm just going to be linking to that
actually using their CDN I'll do that in
a second
but let's go and get the font awesome
yeah so here's their website
I need the icons and what I'm going to
be using I'm going to be using
I need Facebook Facebook and I use the
square for all of them so I'm just going
to come in copy what words Facebook
Facebook was my third one we might as
well keep it the same I'm also going to
need Twitter that's going it Twitter
actually I bet you I can guess all of
these based on that one let's see if I
can get it right paste paste paste I
really don't like how that looks okay I
also put it in the wrong spot undo undo
undo undo paste paste paste paste so
let's go take a look here the first one
I have a
is Twitter Twitter I know a square
Instagram i think is just instagram
facebook is obviously the square and
youtube is definitely square youtube
square let's see if that worked
I'm not really sure oh I didn't link in
the map and so I'm going to link to
their two font awesome here through the
receipt and you can there's other ways
of doing this this is through a script
that I'm getting from font awesome I had
to you know it's for free you can get it
from them let's just save that and see
doot doot doot doot doot but I have two
of each Oh what did I do
I have like eight million icons
oh haha a lot whoops I forgot to close
my eyes I guess I didn't copy and paste
the whole thing closed I copy paste
paste okay there we go that makes a lot
more sense make sure you close your tags
guys add a few things here might add my
CSS comments going that we're working
and now I'm not closing all my tags off
not good practice but we can see they're
working now so again all I did was
linked to font awesomes CDN if you do
want to get to their CDN font awesome
but Baba how do we do it it's been a
while since I've wanted to do it let's
just go up start send me the embed code
and this is what they'll send you it's
your own unique one that you'll be
getting you can also download it and
link to it in other ways so it's not
like it's the only way you can do it but
I don't know for me I don't really feel
like managing and hosting it myself I
might as well let them do it so that's
what that's it guy oh that's it we're
done yeah we got through all of it
almost so all of that is done I think
you have everything I need
I'm definitely going to be coming back
into my HTML at times
make little changes to my classes and
stuff I never get it bang on I think for
my columns everything is well set up but
it's possible that I have to make some
tweaks to it and all of that and my
names and maybe I need to add something
or I forgot something
I might be changing something for this
image at one point whoops
um so just as a bit of a word warning
but you know we'll be getting there so
let's to save that and let's open github
backup and what I want to do now is I
want to publish so just to show you if
you're not used to github so here I have
my github on there I have my index but
if I come and I look at my index it was
created nine days ago and there's
nothing actually in here let's go back
to the code we can see everything going
on there's the one branch it's my master
branch there's not very much let's just
come in and say well where's my github
so what I want to do now is I'm gonna
hit publish and that's going to sync it
with the website so it's going to bring
all of these on to their website okay so
what I want to do is you can see here I
have one change that's been done and
right here you can see the branch so
this is where we currently are that's
the last change that I made it updated
to get ignore to put in the pre pros and
then I have this branch so you can see
this is where branched off this is where
I currently am now and I'm going to come
in here and Britt in all the mark-up and
I'm going to commit it so all the markup
let's just put all the hmm all the HTML
is all the HTML and commit to mark so
what you can see there it's gone and
done that change so if I come in here
and refresh now we have two branches and
if I click on the two branches we have
my markup branch which is active and we
have my default branch if I look at my
master branch it's been nine days since
the index has been updated sync
I just want to make sure that I'm
synched online and locally this was I've
made my local changes now I want to sync
it with the website that's sort of what
I forgot to do there okay so now I can
see that markup has been updated less
than a minute ago and I can compare them
if I want to so I'm going to click on
this I'm going to compare and you can
see that one file has been changed it's
been 144 additions and 0 deletions so
you can scroll down and see all the
changes may not it's all of my HTML so
obviously there's a lot that's been done
in there but if there's been changes
that are made it shows you the plusses
and minuses for all the different things
that color codes it to see what the
differences are so what I can do now is
I I'm happy with this it's good I know
it's working I'm going to create my pull
request so I'm going to pull this into
the project now so this branch has no
conflicts which is good which makes
sense because I haven't a conflict can
happen is if changes have happened to
the master branch and changes have
happened to mine and they're different
changes so I don't know someone someone
else in my team goes and does some other
stuff it isn't the same as me we're both
trying to merge in there could be some
conflicts between it because the code is
different so in this case there are no
conflicts because I'm in charge of this
I can pull merge my pull request and
when I do this it's going to let's just
do it confirm the merge I'm going to
delete that branch I'm finished with my
markup branch everything is done in
there so we can delete that branch and
now if I come here five minutes ago
index dot HTML was edited this is now
the live version that is up and running
we're back down to one branch and if I
go over to my commits you'll see a few
tests I was having trouble with the git
ignore at one point but anyway all of
the HTML was done and then was merged so
that's it for this video guys everything
is done it's all up there if you want to
go
and take a look at it if you want to
clone this on your computer so you can
work along see the code it is there the
