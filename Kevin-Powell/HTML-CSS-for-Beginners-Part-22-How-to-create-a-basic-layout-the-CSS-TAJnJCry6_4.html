because we're going to be doing our CSS
now so the first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to make a new file so
command or ctrl N and I'm going to save
that file I'm gonna make a new folder
called CSS and inside of that CSS folder
I am going to save my style dot CSS now
I could do a whole bunch of CSS but
before I do that I need to come over
here and link that CSS file over so
let's come here and do link href is
equal to and rel is equal to is equal to
so the H ref is where can it find my
file so we can go into the CSS folder
and inside there it will find styles.css
and my rel is the relationship we have
to tell it that this is a stylesheet
save that and while refreshing right now
won't actually do anything but now we
can start doing stuff and if you're not
sure if you did anything right you could
just come and change the color of your
the background color of your body let's
just make it red and see what happens
and it looks like I did things properly
so great now I don't want my background
color to be red but I am going to change
my background color I've got a few
colors pre picked out here so you're
free to use these ones I'm using CDE 7b
Oh so if you're following along you can
use these or you go find a color picker
and come up with your own color scheme
now what I want to do is let's change a
few other things I'm gonna use CSS font
stack so you might remember this I want
to switch over to century gothic it has
pretty good support and through the font
stack let's copy that and let's change
the font family so refresh so font
family and I'm just pasting this since I
copied it from CSS font stack but you
might want to be using something on your
own so font family
is how you can choose your font family
I'm also going to change my font size
make it a little bit bigger 18 pixels
yeah that looks pretty good so now let's
come and fix up my header region over
here so I'm gonna choose my header or
select my header so I write header
that's my selector and it's selecting my
header right there so we'll save that
and let's come and change the background
color of this area too and I'm gonna be
going with a five nine five nine for a
which is a dark brown there we go now
right away we see a little bit of a
weird thing going on when I do that is
we have this space all around here the
space on the top is coming from the
margin on the text but there is a space
on the sides here to what's causing this
is all of the browsers by default give
us a margin of eight pixels all the way
around it puts this margin all the way
around so by default our text isn't
touching the side so if you're not going
in putting a lot of CSS in there you can
actually read your text instead of
having the text nudge it up right on the
edge there
now most websites your will be building
if you keep up with this is going to
need this in your CSS a margin of zero
to get rid of that we don't want that
space there now up here we have a bit of
an issue but that's easy enough to fix
I'm just I want to add some padding so
I'm gonna do padding top of fifty pixels
padding bottom of fifty pixels and there
we go my heading is taking shape now the
padding is much bigger here so I'm going
to right click on here and I'm gonna go
down to inspect and if you're in other
browsers you'll find something similar
and I can see here is my header and I
can see that blue box is the content
inside and the green bars is the padding
that I just put on there and right there
is my h1 and my h1 has that default
margin on the top and the bottom that we
looked at already so that margin is
adding so this is 50 pixels plus the
margin top and then my margin bottom
plus the 50 pix
so it is bigger than the 50 there's a
few things I want to do also let's throw
a text-align on here text-align:center
that's better and let's change our color
to white so that's FFF and one more
thing let's do a text transform of
uppercase there we go my first website
it's really there and now let's come
down to this area down here so if you
remember there we have our div class
container and then inside of our
container we have a section and an aside
which is our sidebar so here's our
section and then right here is our side
and of obviously we don't want them one
on top of the other the whole point is
to put them next to each other but first
let's just start off with our container
so a dot container select my class of
container and the first thing I'm going
to do is give this a width of 80% I want
it to be 80% the width of my screen and
I can see that it's working it's holding
my content it's stopping it at the 80%
mark but I want it in the middle so my
margin 0 top and bottom and auto on the
left and the right so it automatically
calculates my margins and it holds my
content in the middle and as far as my
container goes that's pretty much all I
need to do so now we can jump down and
look at these two here so I have two
different things here I have my section
so I have a section and I have my aside
I want my section to stay on the left
side and I want this to pop over on the
right so let's take my section and I'm
going to do a float left and then I'm
gonna take this and do a float right
because this is what everyone does we
know floats or what we need to move
things around but it doesn't quite work
the way you might have expected when you
just do that this has moved over to the
right my footer oddly enough is come up
over here so a lot of weird stuff has
happened I want this to be up here so
the problem is this is taking up all the
space because this is taking up all the
space
this can't move up next to it so when
I'm floating something to the left if it
has big paragraphs or something in it I
do also need to tell it how big to be
now I'm gonna do a width on here of 70%
this is not 70% of my screen it's going
to be 70% of my container and my
containers at 80% so it's 70% of this
80% and maybe that's kind of weird but I
see that all of a sudden my sidebar has
the space to slip in there and just for
consistency sake let's say a width of
25% on my sidebar or my aside the reason
I'm doing 25 percent and not 30 is just
so we do end up with a bit of a space
between them I don't want them stuck to
one another I want to give a little bit
of breathing room between the two and
last but not least I have this here and
this is causing me some problems as well
it's here and I need to get it down
below so let's go and select my footer
and on my footer I want to give this a
clear both and that will allow it to
jump down to the bottom sweet on my
footer I will also give it a background
color
of 7286
a zero let's give this a little bit of
padding say 50 pixels top and bottom
zero left and right will do another
text-align:center
well I'm made a mistake there there we
go text-align:center and I want to move
it down a little bit so on this section
here let's just add a margin bottom of
100 pixels just to give it some
breathing room and why not also give it
a margin top
I could put a margin top on here of 100
pixels the only problem is it's gonna
move this down but it won't move
that down that's not quite what I want
so what I'll do is on my header we can
add a margin bottom of 100 pixels and
that will give us that margin on the
bottom of this whole header so it pushes
all of my content down and basically
that's it it's nothing too amazing
looking and I'll give you that
but it's if you can create a layout like
this you're pretty much on your way to
being able to make a pretty normal
layout yeah you know most websites are
using some variation of this you might
have three columns instead of two
columns you'll have a few more colors in
there some pictures in there you know
lots of fine-tuning and playing around
with things and a lot more learning to
go this isn't at the end by any means
it's just just the beginning but this is
the basics of most websites these days a
couple of things that are floating
around a clearer than some background
colors some padding and you got yourself
a nice looking website so that's it guys
I really hope you liked it and if you
have any questions I did go a little bit
fast through this but I just wanted to
show you you know how easy it is really
to make
good-looking lay out so if you have any
questions make sure to leave them below
if you like either this video or the
whole series hit the thumbs up make sure
you let everyone else know you liked it
and things are going to be going in a
bit of a different direction now we're
gonna be pushing things and looking at
some more interesting concepts and doing
some really fun stuff so if you want to
keep following along with all that
please subscribe so you don't miss any
of the videos so that's it that's the
end of the series it was a long one I
really hope you liked it as much as I
enjoyed making it take it easy guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
