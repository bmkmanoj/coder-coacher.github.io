and REMS we're going to see what the
difference is between the two of them
and in what situations you might want to
use one or the other hi my name is Kevin
and every new weekly tips tricks and
tutorials series on web design and
development recently Christopher Hayden
asked if I could do a thorough
explanation of the difference between MS
in REMS and when we want to be using
them because really it can be a little
bit confusing when you're not used to it
I know when I first started everything
was pixels so much easier I was also
using position:absolute for everything
too so I definitely wasn't doing things
the best way but once I started learning
what Em's I started using them
everywhere and then I was running into
some problems and then I discovered the
RAM and I was a little bit confused at
first but with some practice I
eventually figured it out but hopefully
I can speed that process up for you so
you don't have to go through all the
growing pains I did when I was learning
all about ends and REMS and all of this
stuff so once again I am doing this in
code pen the link to this code pen will
be in the description below so if you
want to play around with it by all means
you can go there for kit do whatever you
want with it in here you'll notice I
have my we're not going to spend too
much attention there but I have a column
here for my MS and a column here for my
REMS so we can compare the two I'm going
to start with the M unit and go through
all of that we'll see how it all works
and then I'm going to jump over to REMS
and we're going to play around over in
the REMS the whole EM unit has its
background in the print world but in the
world of the web it relates just to font
sizes if you set a font size using MS it
will be in relation to that elements
parent so here if we look at what I have
I have done a bunch of CSS but most of
this we don't have to quite worry about
yet it starts right here I have a nice
big comment to say MS and I have my
column M here so let's go and find that
right there I have a column M and let's
just space this out make it a bit easier
for you to see so I literally just have
a column M my h1 and two paragraphs in
here I've already gone ahead and sized
things a little bit so I've given my h1
a font size of 2.5 m/s and my paragraph
a font size of 1 M 1 M generally
defaults to 16 pixels because the parent
doesn't have a
sighs on it right now it's going up so
there's nothing on my column there's
nothing on my grid so that means it's
just going to go up to the body and fall
on the body and see whatever the font
size of the body is so if I come in here
and I give so this will be about 16
pixels or it is 16 pixels that is
generally the browser default and right
here you'll see my h1 is 2.5 so that
means it's 2.5 times bigger than this
paragraph size if I switch this over
let's just make that 3.5 we should see
that get bigger and I'll make that 2.5
again and I mentioned this is always in
relation to the parent so if I come on
my column m which is the parent for my
h1 and my paragraphs here and I say the
font size is 10 pixels everything is in
relation to that pixel size now so this
paragraph font size has become 10 and
this has become 25 if I go and make this
25 pixels now this font size is 25
pixels and this is two and a half times
2560 maybe in that range
now you can also have here the way all
of this works as it is look compounding
so just to show you what I mean by
compounding let's set this to 2m so
right away this is 2m so this is going
to be there the font size of this div is
2m so it's 16 times 2 is 32 pixels and
then what happens is this is 1 so that's
going to become that 32 pixel and then
this is the two-and-a-half and when I
say it's compounding this is one of the
problems that you can get as said you
grid so all of this is inside of a grid
so the column m its parent is the grid
if I say the font size is 2m it gets
even bigger the font sizes are
compounding on top of each other so the
font size of this is 16 times 2 which is
32 and then the font size of this now
becomes 32 times 32 which is 64 and so
on and so forth this
is two and a half times bigger than that
so you can see how things can get out of
control if you're not careful when
you're using MS so we don't really need
that or this on here I had just to get
it looking back to normal now if we look
at REMS instead of MS they work very
similar and according to the Mozilla
developer Network REMS were actually
invented with the sole purpose of fixing
that whole compounding problem we just
saw so you can see here I have set my
font sizes exactly the same two and a
half but I put a ram instead of an M and
what REM stands for is root M and if I
go all the way up that will relate to
this font size I put that this one that
that could be 16 everything will look
exactly the same so it's going to look
at the HTML elements font size and it's
not going to be looking at the body the
root M looks at the HTML or even you
could do the root and you could actually
put some stuff on that if you want to
but the HTML is fine so if I look here
whoops we want to go back to my rims and
I'm going to do just like I did before
where it's do a font size of even I'll
just do 10 pixels just like I did before
but you'll notice that this doesn't
change I saw a small change in width
actually but the font sizes don't change
that's weird the width change ever so
slightly so the root m is more
consistent it's always looking at the
root when used for font sizes M units
are compounding it build one on top of
each other and sometimes they can cause
problems where M units are a bit more
consistent we can also use both of these
units for other things than just font
size I use them all the time for padding
and margin you can also use them for
widths and Heights and everything
anything that could take a you know a
unit like that you can use it for and
that's where it gets a little bit
different now when you're using them for
margins or padding and let's use margin
is the first example so I'm going to
look at this let's go back over to our
MS so looking here on my h1 here I'm
going to add a margin bottom margin
bottom
of 1m and it should get bigger there we
go it does so what's happening is the
thing that's different with margin and
padding and all those other things the
font size is always looking at the
parent the margin and any other unit is
looking at this font size it's looking
at the font size of that element so
that's a bit of a difference in how this
works and that can be confusing so my
margin bottom of 1m means my margin
bottom is actually 2.5 m/s so just to
show you how that is working we can see
that space there if I change this to 1m
you can see that space got smaller and
if I change this up to 5m that space
became much much much bigger
so this margin bottom is equal to this
font size let's put that back to you 2.5
and the same applies for padding and
margin top and left and right in widths
and all of that and we'll take off that
margin bottom the same thing doesn't
apply for REMS REMS are always looking
at the route so if I set a margin bottom
on here margin bottom let's just do 1m
again so we can see the space so that
gets bigger if I change this to one REM
it's going to get smaller because it's
now looking at the root m it's going
back to 16 pixels so the root M is
always consistent it's always looking at
what the font size of the HTML element
is whereas m's are more variable the
font size looks at the parent and all
the other different properties that we
can apply they all look at the font size
of that element now why is that useful
that's super useful I use it all the
time for buttons so I have done a nice
call-to-action down here and I have a
button in here and I want to look at how
we can play around with that a little
bit so I have done a whole bunch of CSS
but it's just to make this look pretty
it doesn't really matter too much so
let's just jump right down to our
buttons my dududu so I've done a button
here but all this is doing is making my
text look good and I want to turn that
into a button so what I'm going to do is
and let's give that a background I've
had this transparent let's change that
background to blah let's try block let
me just so we can actually see what
putting so what I like to do is I like
to give this padding so I'm going to do
padding say 1m on the top and 3m on the
left and right and there we have a nice
big button now the nice thing with this
is I can really easily adjust the font
size on my button so let's find that
button here copy and let's add a second
button that this second button is going
to be a button small so we have two
buttons I'm a regular button and my
button small so my button small is going
to be exactly the same but I want the
font size to be smaller on it so I'm
going to do a font size of 0.5 M so it's
a really tiny button once that clicks
through loops this needs to - there we
go
so you can see it got really small and
because the padding on this is set with
m/s the padding around it has
automatically adjusted to that font size
if I had set these in REMS the padding
isn't changing the font size in the
middle is changing but when the font
size changes it doesn't adapt normally
or automatically
whereas with this in m/s the padding
adapts to the font size automatically
and it keeps everything in the same
proportions my big button is bigger my
small button is smaller and you could
obviously make it a very big button and
the same would apply so just to show you
what I mean let's copy this one and
let's make a button large scroll back
down so now we have a button large you
can oops large and a font size of say a
3m so we're going to make it a lot
bigger now it's gigantic but you can see
it scaled properly it got really big but
everything looks in proportion if these
were in REMS beside the font size is a
lot bigger this padding is the same as
this padding which is the same as this
padding and the left spacing is the same
all around so by doing things in M
it can often be a lot more adaptable to
your situation but where you might want
things to be consistent is and let's
make this a bit smaller so they can
still fit next to each other you might
want to keep the spacing on the left and
right equal and actually let's make that
even smaller that's just do 1.25 because
I'm going to run out of room so what I
could do here is I could say that my
margin I want you're on the top and
bottom but I might want a margin on the
left and right of my buttons maybe I
think they're too close together so I
could do 1m or I could do one ramp and
then the difference here is if I do 1m
the margin is relative to the size of my
button just going to make this a little
bit bigger maybe so the this margin here
is actually going to be smaller than
that margin there and we can do an
inspect element because it's not super
obvious but but call to action so we can
see the the margin is really tiny on
that one the margin is bigger on that
one and the margin is really big on that
one and if you do want consistent
spacing whenever you have buttons maybe
that's the situation where you'd want to
be using REMS so you're spacing is
always consistent and it's always the
same all the time and you can see when I
make that switch this space gets bigger
from 1m it's small and then when I put
it up to one REM it becomes bigger so
now all my spacing is always going to be
the same now that's way too big I'd
probably want something like 0.25 but I
can space elements out like that and I
can get consistent spacing all the time
it's not going to be relative to the
font size so I know that it's always the
same I'm doing all this with MS and REMS
this is the same ideas if I'm using
pixels right pixels are solid units
pixels never change but the reason we
want to use M's and REMS over pixels is
they make our lives much easier when it
comes to either media queries or just
making things that are more scalable so
just like these buttons I can set font
size to 0.5 or 1.5 and they sort of
adapt naturally I can also do something
I put a second call to action down here
and the whole idea behind that second
call to action
is it's my call to action small you can
see there I've added small and the way
I've said all of this up is my call to
action has no set font size on it right
now
but if I come to here and I say my font
size is let's say 10 pixels so it gets
really small you can see everything in
there got smaller let's go back to
having that with no font size on it just
we can see a change
so everything up bigger and then I can
have one that's small whoops
make that 10 and it's all gotten smaller
and the reason that's happened is I have
my button so my button is has a font
size it doesn't have a font size so it's
just taking that font size anyway and
then my call to action however has a
padding of 3m so the padding on the top
and the bottom which is set to 3m is
adapting to this font size so if I make
this 20 the padding on the top and the
bottom adjusts automatically and if I
make this 5 it shrinks and it gets
smaller automatically which is awesome
the other thing is the font sizes in
here is my h1 where'd I put my h1
there's my h1 font size currently is set
to 4 m so the nice thing there is it's
going to be 4 times bigger so here I
haven't put up on flies this one was
just briefed on size 1 M and again I
wouldn't ever actually use pixels I
would be using something like 5 M if I
needed to be smaller 1 M for something
bigger like cetera et cetera but you can
see the whole thing is adapting
naturally and this adaptation can go
even further that abdication gets really
useful when you start using media
queries so I've already built a media
query here but I haven't actually done
anything with it but on this media query
let's change the font size add a 700
pixels to 25 pixels and let's shrink
this down so you can see it's not going
too well let's look here you can see
that at my media query here so it's
small
brain sizes it's 16 pixels everything
looks normal and then when this gets
bigger everything goes out of whack but
this all got bigger and this all got
bigger and this even got bigger because
it's adjusting to this font size and
everything is working at one point it is
reaching this HTML so the MS and the
REMS both reach this at one point and
with the MS again it could get out of
control depending on how things are
compounding but it's just to show you
that I with one media query I can change
the font sizes of my entire site really
easily whereas if I had used pixels to
set all my font sizes I wouldn't be able
to do this I'd be running into lots of
problems I'd have to be building in
media crease or absolutely everything to
go through and change them in this case
a one fixed solution probably wouldn't
work properly for an entire site that's
just you know a little bit of wishful
thinking but it could push the whole
site in the right direction and give you
a lot less in terms of media queries to
build out later on and that's it guys
