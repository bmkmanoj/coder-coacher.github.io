series you haven't seen any of the other
ones did you recommend that you jump
back in time and go and watch some of
those other ones because it leads us to
where we are today as far as what we're
doing in this one we're taking our
portfolio whatsit and we're building out
this part right here this is probably
the part where the layout is most
interesting for me having overlapping
sections is really cool and the grid
makes it so easy to do now most of the
time that I'm doing my layouts I do want
to be using grid template areas I think
grid template areas are the bee's knees
and they're just they're really really
cool and they make it a lot easier but
in this case because I have overlapping
areas it's not really going to work so
instead I'm going to use some grid line
names so yeah this is what we're gonna
be doing and this is the markup that I
currently have so the markup for this
section is really really simple and it's
because all I have is a picture a little
bit of text and this box down here the
one thing that I like about this and
using the grid to do it is I don't need
a whole bunch of dibs all I need to have
are just there's just my image there's
my title there's my h2 and I do have one
div just to keep my paragraphs together
the funny thing with this is I'm not
really sure a flexbox fallback is gonna
work very well because of the way flex
box works either everything in this
whole area will fall into a column or
will fall into a row and it's because I
can do this with a little bit less
markup than I would if it was flex box
to say I wanted two columns here but
then this to go underneath but take up
the full thing and then I want that to
change I don't know if I'm sure I could
figure out a way to get it to work but I
actually think floats are gonna be a
better solution here and I'm actually
finding that sometimes floats with our
nicer fallback than flexbox depending on
the layout of course but I find the
reduced markup that I'm using just leads
to me sometimes finding floats work a
little bit nicer which is really funny
because I thought I was done with floats
but yeah that's that's interesting I
find with that out of the way though
enough talking let's actually get into
coding this up so I'm gonna just move my
design out of the way for now and this
is what we have right now
so I mentioned that we want to be using
some grid line names right okay so let's
go into my CSS here and go into my
partials and I'm gonna make a new file
called about me dot a CSS with the
underscore in front of it of course so
in here I don't have anything yet but
let's go to my all and let's just copy
that line and paste and this would be
about me and I'll save that I'll close
my all and before I keep going let's run
my gulp build of course this will open
it in a new tab and let's go there we go
there it is so I can close that down and
just make sure it's working body
background is red yeah good okay so I'm
actually going to start this video with
the grid and then we're gonna go back
the other way around and add in the
fallback so here I'm just gonna do an at
supports so if it supports the display
display grid I want it to do
display oops I want my about me to use
display grid I don't know why vs code
says that it's an unknown at rule it
thinks it's an S CSS rule
it's weird cuz app supports has been
around for a long time it's not widely
used but it's been around but it still
works but you'll see there's a few
errors in here cuz it's getting a little
confused about what's actually happening
here but it's all working it's valid
just to make sure it is really working a
grid template columns when FR when fr
there we go
so I can see that my everything is
working even though it's in my supports
that BS code doesn't really like right
now but that's okay so there's my start
now what I want to do is I want this to
have a pretty specific styling a little
bit I have I didn't put a container on
here actually and I don't want it to be
touching the side I sort of want a
container
and I'm just trying to think I'm gonna
make a new file no am i let's just go
look at my XD design again that sort of
wraps in there this also gets it yeah I
need a container so let's what I'm gonna
do is in my yeah I'm gonna do it in my
modules I'm gonna make a new file called
place holders but SCSS I think it's only
going to have this one placeholder so
what my placeholders is gonna have is
this thing and that symbol with sass is
the symbol for placeholder it's the same
whether you're doing sass or a CSS and
it's going to be called container and
what this is going to be is a let me
think
whip of say 90% margin of 0 auto and it
probably should have a max width on it
too right um I'll say a max width of
1200 pixels that might get changed we'll
save that and I should load that into
here
copy paste import place holders okay
so let's close that and close this now
this I don't use extend a lot at extend
and the reason I don't use extend as it
can be a little bit dangerous but I for
things like placeholders it can be super
useful and the placeholder only exists
to extend something it the placeholder
is doing nothing by itself it's almost
like a variable it's something that's
sitting there it can be used it's a
little bit like a mix into but just that
can't accept arguments
so at extend container save and there
you go it's acting like a container so
the nice thing with this is I don't have
to add anything to my markup I can just
extend this at any time I need it so I'm
gonna use it there I'm gonna use it in
here somewhere and I'll also be using it
in my contact form
as well but I as I said I don't need any
extra markup I don't need to add to
container class somewhere in here it's
just being brought in through an extent
which I like to do okay cool
and actually that should be here so I
should do having a boat at extend
placeholder a placeholder container the
reason I moved it out of my supports is
because I just want that to always be
there I don't want it to only be for
when the display this thing is working
okay
so what I want to do now is I want to
build in my columns so I'm gonna do a
grid template columns and we're gonna
use min max against will do a min max on
here I'm just trying to think I have
three columns let's the school look here
at my design
I have one column I'm gonna have one
column that's this space here I'm gonna
have another column that is this space
here and then I might have a third
column that's just the leftover space
here so I again this empty space here is
gonna be my first column and then this
one's gonna start right there and that's
how we're gonna get this stuff to
overlap so to do that I'm just trying to
think of what my min/max values should
be here minimum size and again this is
like up to the boat the halfway point
I've say like I'm gonna say like 6m
which is almost 100 pixels comma 1 F R
then we're gonna have another one that's
exactly the same so I could actually do
that too um we want no I don't I was
gonna do a repeat but I want to put some
names in here in a second so there and
then my last one should just be the
empty space and the empty space I don't
want them to be equal if we look here if
we look in the original design like this
this entire space should be about equal
to this entire space but this is two
columns so if this is one fr and one fr
this one should be two fr so I'm just
going to put a two fr I might need to
change that to a min/max of twelve and
then two but let's just this might work
I think this is gonna work better and
give me a bit more room for my mobile
type of stuff going on when I shrink my
screen size down I think this would be
more flexible so I'm gonna save that
it's gonna change things around a little
bit
now I want to lay thing all of my items
here I would on my grid properly so I
can do that with the grid numbers except
the numbers I don't like playing with
the numbers the numbers are a paint and
this is where the line names can be
really really useful so I'm gonna write
the line name that snow here I'm going
to call this just port to start so what
that means is like the first line starts
here so the first line is my port start
and then this one in the middle is going
to be so it's port start is and then I
have this space
so I've port start and then I have a
space of let's say when I far and then I
have another one here so square brackets
and this will be my name start because I
want my name to be starting here then
what we can do is I'm just trying to
think do I need a name end I'm going to
call it that's the portfolio start name
start then we want this to be our image
end because our image is stopping and
then all the way at the end is the port
and because my portfolio starts here and
ends all the way there so portfolio end
and at the other end of it we have the
portfolio start now if I save this okay
so now let's come in here and add in my
image
about image my about image I want this
one to be a lets us to migrate column
for so grid column he is going to go
from a port start to image end and there
we go and it's working so we can see it
seeing up to it now I'm gonna do an
inspect on this Firefox has a little bit
better because you can toggle the grid
on and off but in chrome now if you
hover over this or if you're using
you're a little inspector thing here you
can see that as long as I'm inspecting
something that's in the grid or the
parent the parent grid item here it
highlights the grid for me so I can see
what's going on so I can see that that's
going over the two columns like I want
it to now one cool thing with this that
I didn't show when I did my video on
grid line names is they've built into
the start and end naming conventions so
if I just do port over image it's
assuming it's port start over image n so
if I save that it's going to be exactly
the same which is really cool now we're
going to do a little bit more work on
this but I'm now gonna do my about about
title so my about title we want this one
to have a grid column of name over port
because I want to go from name start to
port end so let's save that and oh my
goodness it doesn't go to the right spot
why not well what's happening is let's
bring up my grid there so we can see
that can I not keep that's where I wish
I could keep it on but if you look at it
now there's a row at the top and then my
Joe portfolio the text there can't fit
in the left you know it doesn't it
doesn't fit in there so it's creating a
new row for it so you can see that
there's an extra row and then after Joe
portfolio there's another row where the
other things are fitting in but I can
force things to be where I want them to
be so what I can say is on my about
title that it's going to have a grid row
so I can tell it what row it should be
on now I'm not going to create names for
this one I'm just going to use the
numbers so I want it to start at the
first number one so number one's right
at the top so start at one and I wanted
to end at the second line which is this
line
right here line number one and end at
line number two so start at one end it
to save and let's get the same thing
copy that and put it on my image and now
they're overlapping just like I wanted
them to
now the layouts not exactly what I
wanted so we can do a little bit more
with this as well now where do I want
that let's go look at I want it pretty
much down at the bottom here so what I'm
gonna do is on my title align self and
and that should pull it right down this
empty space that's coming up there right
now I don't already have my inspect on
boat title is the margin bottom so my
about title I might also on here wanted
you just a margin of zero or actually
maybe not zero zero is kind of close to
the bottom so let's do a margin bottom
of I don't know 0.5 M that looks a
little better and since we're here let's
just do this on the iPhone 5 to 100%
it's going right up to the edge a and to
five how come if I make my margin this
side scrolling a little bit that looks a
little better though I'm gonna leave it
for the moment I might have to modify my
font size a little bit on that um let's
just get the rest of it looking a little
better let's just go back up to the f-16
just so the layout it's not busted but
it will fix that in a second let's come
in and fix this up down here now so what
do we want this to do what do we want
this to do so let's get the subtitle and
our other are the our text here working
a little bit better so let's come and do
my about sub actually my about subtitle
I want them both to just fill up all the
empty space here right so about subtitle
and
my about text these both are going to go
grid column port over port so it's port
start over port end and they'll just
take up that whole space there and my
subtitle this will need a margin on the
top a little bit so about subtitle
margin top of 0.5 in that looks good
actually it's just do a 0.5 M 0 top and
bottom no save top and bottom left and
right
did I misspell it
no 0.5 0 there we go just so it's
centered in that space and you know what
that looks pretty good I'm happy with
that I am happy with that awesome
awesome awesome that's really good
now I do want to build a fallback and
I'm actually wondering like mm-hmm
this can stay here this can stay here my
fallback and actually no we're okay I'm
just okay what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna pull a few of these things out of
the app supports thing so I have my
about me my about title and my about
subtitle actually let's just take you
and bring you up here because it doesn't
need to be in a media query our futures
query I should say my this is ok this is
ok that's great that's great that's
great that's great that's good this
isn't so let's take you out and put you
in here there we go save just I'm gonna
leave anything that's dependent on the
grid inside my feature query and leave
all of this out here
because I think it should be okay like
that now what I wanted to do is let's
just turn off this I'm gonna comment it
out for the second but but other than it
being stuck to the top here so that
would be an easy enough fix margin top
let's just say it's one M so maybe a bit
bigger than that so we get down we
scroll and we have a big picture with
his name underneath that's not so bad
right so right away it is actually
gracefully falling back a little bit but
as the screen size gets bigger now it's
not looking so good and just so we can
see what it would look like if we have
the grid on we do have to make a
modification to it but it's not like
it's dying or anything that's too wide
that's getting too big but that's okay
we can fix that so let's just go and try
and think when we get here let's comment
this back out and this is where like if
I wanted this to be here and then I
really think the easiest solution in
this point is my about image I really
think that the easiest thing to do is to
do a float left on this except I don't
want it always floating left do I I
might have to put that into a media
query actually yeah cuz that doesn't
look good but the idea here is like here
it looks okay we need a space under we
need a space there but here it looks
okay that doesn't look terrible so here
we do a margin left of I don't know one
M no not a margin left margin right
sorry just to give us our space there
the text wraps around it like that now
which i think is fine it's just this
that we want to break but I mean yeah
this sort of sucks that there's one line
of code down here but it's a fallback it
doesn't need to be perfect and it's
a really sort of small small screen
range there so if there's a few words
here could I add markup and make this
all work I could but I'm I'm more
focused on the grid itself and I don't
want to be putting too much time most
people this is gonna work fine on so
let's just build a media creating to
this at media I'm in with of I'm gonna
start with 40m and we'll see how that
looks
one thing with because people have used
frameworks all the time people get used
to having to have it built in for
specific things but like you can come up
with arbitrary breakpoints breakpoints
should be used when your layout breaks
not when just like it's oh this is on
this phone no who cares what phone it's
on does the layout look good you know
so right around here there we go perfect
uh there's a little weird yeah it's just
go for like 45 yeah that might be way
too big actually that's not terrible but
it that looks okay there we go so
there's enough room it jumps up and that
looks pretty good and then that looks
pretty good I don't know the dreaded
floats I never even thought about that I
haven't used a float in a while one
thing this image is actually getting a
little bit bigger than I want it to be
too though not that it's gonna fix this
problem but there's two things before I
fix my floating issue a couple of things
that I want to fix my about image here
I'm gonna give it I'm wandering I'm
wandering I'm wandering I'm wandering
it's getting a little bigger than I want
it to so actually let's just see let's
give it a max height
25 mm whoops that's on the wrong thing
about image
I should just limit sort of the total
size of my image a little bit more and I
might not actually run into this issue
now because my text I'm these line this
line length is way too big I did a max
width of 1200 pixels and that's not
gonna work for this these lines are
getting way too long so I actually want
to come and look at XD for a second here
and did I make this zoom out so here
it's clearly following the same
container as everything else my are even
just my containers max width might just
be a lot smaller okay that's cool so I
think I'll just do that in this case my
containers max width is gonna be a lot
smaller so let's go back over to my
place holders and did this in pixels too
so let's get rid of the 1200 save that
and I'm gonna label 55 which is close to
900 pixels I just have to save this all
one again to get it to compile okay
let's go look that's more of this that's
not so hot but that's more of what I
wanted I might even go a little bit
narrower than that I don't want to go
too narrow but let's just make this like
54 now let's just see what 50 looks like
I do like that a little bit more and
also I'm sort of cheating because it's
it's solving my my float issue but it's
I'm looking at these the length of the
lines and I don't want the lines to be
too long I also want it to be if this
text was longer if you're using this for
your site you might have a lot longer of
a text which means I should definitely
build a clear fix to this I'm being lazy
I don't want to build a clear fix but we
can do one right here
do another one call it clear fix which
is margin clear fix is the and after
this doesn't mean to work I think so
we'll find out
and after I've whoops that should have
eat to my and after of content I haven't
done it clear fix in a long time so
forgive me if I'm I'm trying to member
this content is nothing mmm
display is block and clear is both so
let's just make sure this is gonna work
and where am I gonna put that on my
about me right extending that and let's
extend clear fix and to see if it
actually worked I'm just going to look
at my actual CSS here about me
well because there extends they might be
that's kind of annoying but whatever
about me after it is working that's
because of where this is getting
imported in my CSS I didn't think of
that
I freaking templated the fact that my
extends would get brought in there oh
well I'm gonna leave it like that maybe
that's something I could clean up at a
later date but that means my at least my
clear fix is working so if you have a
shorter text it won't break your site
and if you have a longer text everything
does look good and the line lengths are
nice and good so hey we can put our grid
back on now guys so let's hit save we're
back with the grid not a big difference
there right now I whoops on do save like
all we're doing pretty much is
overlapping with that a little bit so
it's not a huge difference but it's
enough of one and when we come back to
fixing this for a larger screen sizes
we're gonna pull that up we're gonna
pull some things in next to here it's
gonna be a lot more interesting I hope
you liked this video that's it for this
one if you did and if you have any
questions just please leave them down in
the comments below if you like the video
please let me know if there's anything
you would have done differently also let
me know and until next time don't forget
to make your corn in the Internet just a
little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
