of you guys have websites and you're not
sure how to keep something in the middle
of it we want something like this
instead of something like that and the
other thing is when I change the size of
the screen here we want it to adjust
automatically I don't want to you know
you can see in my margins here are
changing so we're gonna look at how we
can set that up to work properly on your
site where it's always keeping the
content in the middle and it's not
keeping everything fullscreen like that
luckily for us this is a really easy
thing to do for this to work we have to
add a little bit of HTML just one simple
div to fix our problem and what we need
to do is we have to have a div that's
gonna hold all of our content in the
middle of our page with websites we have
nothing that defines the size of our
page they scroll up and down pretty much
to infinity as long as there's content
we can scroll and there's no problems
there but as far as the left and right
goes you know you make a new document in
lots of other things they ask us what we
want for our dimensions we don't have
that so it just fills up all the space
so we have to create something that
tells it what the dimensions are
actually going to be so I'm gonna come
in here and create a div class I'm gonna
call it container another name you might
hear or see people using is called
wrapper and then all the way down to the
bottom and close that and we'll just
indent all this since we're all inside
the container so some places you you
might see wrapper that's doing the exact
same thing as this container is really
really popular though you'll see this
used a lot for what we're about to do go
over to our Styles and all we need to do
over here dock container is I want to
select my container and first time we
gave it a background color just so we
can visualize what's going on and I'll
just make it white Save oh I forgot to
save my HTML file there we go so my
container is there and right now it's
not doing anything yet it just has a
white background to it and it's holding
all of my content what I want is you
next though is I want to give it a width
so let's say my width
is 600 pixels and now I have a white box
that's 600 pixels and no matter what I
do it's always 600 pixels the problem is
it's stuck over on the left side over
here it's not automatically adjusting to
anything it's just it's staying on the
left which makes sense HTML and stuff
always starts on the left so I want to
put it in the middle now this is where
the little nice trick comes in and what
it is is I want my margin left to be
Auto and I want my margin right to the
auto you can't use this trick anywhere
you want this is a special thing it only
really works when the left margin and
the right margin or Auto you can't do
this from margin top and margin bottom
it's only margin left and margin right
and what it's going to do is it's going
to make sure the margin on the left and
the margin on the right are always
exactly the same so when i refresh
voila it's in the middle and if I make
this bigger it stays in the middle and
if I make that smaller it stays in the
middle so no matter what I do it's
always in the middle so that's really
fun and cool now we can take this a
little bit of a step further one thing
just to make it easier for you what you
usually see this written as is margin
zero space Auto so zero pixels top and
bottom and auto left and right so just
margin:0 auto this is the magic sauce
this is what keeps your div or your
container in the middle of the page so
right away this is the big takeaway from
this video a couple of other things we
can do to fancy it up a little bit
though right now my width is locked in
at 600 pixels and that looks fine right
now but it's really tiny over here so
one thing you could do instead of
putting pixels is I could use percentage
so say I did 70% and this is what I used
at the beginning of the video for when I
was demoing it but we'd never wait back
around so it's always going to be 70% of
the total size so it's gonna grow and
it's gonna shrink along with my window
but these spaces are going to
automatically adjust also so right now
the spaces are still bigger and they get
smaller
yeah so that's a nice one there and the
last last other thing that we will add
into this is something called max width
so my width is 70 pixels but I'm gonna
say a max width of 1000 pixels so what
this does it means I'm gonna save that
and refresh so I have my width of 70% of
the total screen it has my margin:0 auto
to Center it but now if I'm on a small
screen it's perfect and it's gonna go
and go and you can see right here it
stops growing this box has now hit a
width of a thousand pixels so instead of
being 70 percent we're saying it always
be 70 but stop at a thousand so it can't
get bigger than a thousand pixels so it
will shrink down it will grow and then
it will stop at a thousand pixels so we
can sort of limit a little bit the total
size of our layout and that's it nice
and short and sweet thanks a ton for
watching I hope you learned something
with this one and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
