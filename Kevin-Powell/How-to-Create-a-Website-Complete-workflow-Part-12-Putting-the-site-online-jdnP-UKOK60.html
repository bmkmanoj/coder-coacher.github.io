in this series in this video we are
going to be putting my website on the
internet using github pages but I'm also
gonna take a look at how pre pros can be
also pushed things through an FTP as
well just in case you want to be doing
that so I'm here on my github site so
what I'm going to do is and this is the
specific one for this project and just
as a quick side note if you want to you
can see this project on github you can
clone you can download it if there's
something you'd like to you think would
be an improvement on my code by all
means you can fork it off do some stuff
on it put in a pull request I'd be glad
to check it out now to put this online
what I'm gonna do is go over to settings
and I'm gonna scroll down until I get to
github pages now in the github pages I
can here see I can choose my master
branch so that's gonna take the master
by default you can also make something
that's called gh you can make a branch
called gh pages and use that one but in
this case I'm just going to use the
master branch so I'll do that and I'm
going to push save now if I scroll down
you can see that your github pages site
is currently being built from the master
branch so what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to copy this right here I'm
going to go to Kevin Powell github and
that's another one I have though so one
thing with github pages is it's not
github calm it is github dot
so Kevin Powell github dot il and then
I'm going to put in the name of my
branch and right there you can see that
it's online and you can go in and check
that out and you can put all your
branches online or all your branches you
can put all of your github stuff online
there's the only thing is it is static
sites you they're not built on PHP they
do work on Jekyll so you can sort of
come with you know you could have a blog
or something like that using it and
there are also ways of setting up one of
these to be using something you know a
custom domain so it doesn't have to use
the this github I owe slash thing going
on you can do it with a custom domain as
well so that's all well and Danny
but what if you don't want it on get up
pages you want it on your own site so
you can use any FTP client you want I'm
just gonna open up pre post cuz that's
what I am using I use pre post to do all
my pre processing so I'm using sass to
write it if you didn't see early on in
my first video where I set this up I'm
using this to compile all of my sass it
also takes care of things like pre fixer
and all of that so I don't have to worry
about prefixes and you can notice right
here there is an FTP option so if I go
into my FTP you'll see there's an FTP
history and it's just all the files that
are in there pretty much and I am my
option show all export and upload now I
haven't set it up so I can't upload
right away so it just says go to your
project settings which is right here so
I'll click on my settings I have my FTP
settings and you can either choose your
FTP SFTP the remote path the main things
you worry about your host your port
number username password and as soon as
you've set that up and you save it
you're ready to just push things or
straight to the FTP it's awfully simple
with this it's pretty simple with any
FTP software out there and it's nice
that it is built into here right here it
also has some ignoring which is great
it's not going to bring up my config
file it's not gonna bring up my pre pro
stock config it's going to ignore a
whole bunch of files and I can add other
files that it will ignore here and have
it ignore Jade files if you're writing
things in Jade it's gonna ignore all my
sass files I don't want my sass files up
there it's looking at all of those and
it's going to ignore all my sass or main
s CSS files which is fantastic so I
don't actually need those up on my
server they're just a waste of space
really so that's nice the dot git and
stuff like that so just and you can come
in here and add your own too if you want
to ignore other files as well and that
just makes a super-short a nice
finishing up of this series so I hope
