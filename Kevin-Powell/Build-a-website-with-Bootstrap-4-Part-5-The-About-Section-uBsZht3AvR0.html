the About section for the band website
we're building with bootstrap for so hi
there my name is Kevin if you haven't
been following along I strongly suggest
you check out the other series in this
video because we're up to part five now
where we're building a website using
bootstrap 4 we're on alpha version 6 and
so far so good it's going really well
before we get started though I just want
to give a big thank you to everyone
who's subscribed I've done this a few
times now where I've said thank you to
you guys but we're up to over a thousand
subscribers and really that's frickin
incredible I didn't know that it would
grow this fast it's taken less time to
go from 100 subscribers to a thousand
than it did for me to go from 0 to 100
so like 0 to 100 was long and 100 to a
thousands been less time that's freaking
crazy so thank you so much for everyone
who has been supporting me and thank you
for everybody who turned out to the
livestream this week it was a lot of fun
there was a bunch of people in the chat
and so I'm going to try and do those on
a semi-regular basis in this case it was
exploring CSS grid for pretty much the
first time so it was a little sloppy at
first but in the end I think I started
getting a hang of it and there will be
videos in the future sometime maybe in a
month or two where I look at it in a bit
more of an organized and well-prepared
manner as I said this was the first time
I was looking at it but that's not what
we're here in this video for we're here
to see me build at the about page so
let's go and do that okay so here's what
we want to be building in this site this
is what we want it to look like when
we're done so just a few quick things to
take a look at right after this is what
we've already done now so I want this to
be a nice big 50 percent area each
pretty much with this text centered more
or less in this area and then these
three pictures which are band members
they're going to overlap that just a
little bit so it helps you know keep us
moving down the page or the visitor
moving down the page we have this little
overlap going there and these do have a
nice little drop shadow on them so
that's what we want it to look like
right now it looks like this so there's
a few problems that you can see these
are kind of squished right now and
obviously we don't have our background
and there's a few other things to take a
look at if we come and look at our
section here we have our section about
which is what all of this is inside I
have my container fluid my container
fluid is these two parts here that's
going to be the background image and
this over on this side so we have our
column six and our column six and then
down here we have our cards these are
done with cards that I've shrunk away
because there's a lot in there right now
I'll have to get into these eventually
but for now just we have our one two and
three cards and they're all inside of a
small column so before I actually get
into it I'm going to jump back up into
my custom file here where I have my font
size and I don't know if I did this when
I was trying to fix my leads font size
and then I accidentally changed my base
one along the way maybe but these
shouldn't be so close to one another
this this font size is too big right now
and I'm getting on to smaller screens
just that it looks terrible and even at
the big sizes I don't really like what
that's looking like right now so the
very first thing I think like oh I don't
I'm sure I had this small at one point
but it's been a long time I haven't
worked on this so I'm going to put 21.3
maybe that's a bit too small we'll try
one point for ram I think that will look
fine yeah that right away that I prefer
that so I think that looks a lot better
my lead will stay the same but this is
better
cool and now let's jump back into my
home so my home page s CSS file here we
want to take a look at our about so
let's go back up we're not going to
worry about those quite yet we're going
to look at these ones and I'm actually
going to shrink this down to I've my
about title and I'm going to call this
one I didn't do this originally but I'm
going to call this one about text
because we might have to make some small
changes in there and actually while I'm
here this one should be strong and
close strong okay um
see I'm going to shrink this away just
so I have my about title and my about
text now I want let's start off with my
about about title I want it to have my
background image right so a background
of URL one step back my image folder and
I believe it's about dot about BG jpg I
think is what I called it
save yeah cool good now it's way too big
at this screen size so we're also going
to do a background size of cover and
just to be safe or not safe but just to
position it a little bit nicer
background position of Center just to
keep the middle of the picture always in
the middle it's a nice dark area and I
want that text to actually be right on
top of it
I'm going to put that text right on top
of it using flexbox so I could come in
here and do it in the my own CSS but
bootstrap does come with a whole bunch
of stuff already done I have flexbox
enabled from the beginning so everything
is flexing right now but a column
doesn't flex by default but we can add
the Flex property something by doing a D
flex so when I do that nothing really
looks different except now this has a
display of flex on it which means I can
do in a line a line content cent content
Center and it should move a line nut
content a line items there we go so
that's going to Center it that way and
just defy content center will Center it
this way cool and last but not least
that font obviously needs to be a lot
bigger so we're going to throw a class
is equal to display too and yeah that's
pretty much the right size awesome I
don't even think I need to change that
that looks pretty good
now when I make this bigger I'm just
checking I sort of want it to be a
square all the time ish so I'm also
going to add a a minimum height it's a
um you know I'm just into a height
height of now I want it to be a square
and right now it's taking up 50% of the
screen this way so I always want it to
be when I want this and this to be the
same so I think the easiest thing would
be a 50 vertical width because it
already
the width is 50 so if I'm making the
height 50 it should be a square whoops
save small change there oh it's me a
little bit taller maybe I'll go at 40
then okay why is it started that's not
it's not a square that should be a
square let's just go look for some
reason it looks a little rectangular hmm
I'm going to switch that down to let's
say 45 I like that I think that looks
good so I'm going to stick with that
perfect so now if I go and look awesome
so that looks pretty nice so it's just
always keeping sort of that that big
thing now my text here I don't really
like the fact at the large screen size
my lines are getting too long so the
first thing I'm going to do is let's
come down to here instead of a small six
I'm actually let's just see where that
break point is the small spray point is
really tiny now let's switch both of
these over to medium instead of small
I'm going to make a medium six and a
medium six so let's save that you can
see the flash of unstyled text there
it's because I'm using Typekit Typekit
tends to be a little bit slow and
loading in the fonts yeah I like that
break point a lot better because my
lines are getting kind of short here
and it breaks awesome so that looks
pretty good
hmm I want me min height I'm going to
change this to a minimum height because
yeah that's what I want more minimum
height just on these times when it is
narrow I don't want it to be exactly 45
I do want it to match what's going on on
this side and then that looks pretty
good and then as I get smaller screen
sizes I'm shrinking that down so that
looks pretty good actually I'm happy
with that
this side needs a little bit of work so
that's I put text text what was I
thinking I just did this too I have this
what happens when I'm talking and typing
at the same time I want that to be about
text so we can do our about text and I'm
gonna do some padding top let's do
padding padding 10 vertical height I
like doing padding no not padding on all
sides
VH and zero I don't want it on the left
on the right
oh but that gets rid of my default okay
I can't do it like that then didn't
think of that
so my padding top is I guess I could do
now let's just do this padding top is 10
vertical height padding bottom is 10
vertical height there we go and it keeps
my padding on the sides so that's
looking pretty good now I still don't
like this well I also would prefer this
as centered and I want my text to sort
of stop here ish so let's do both of
those this is all going to be done in
the markup anyway um so I've might about
six I'm going to switch I'm going to
keep my six here but I'm also going to
change it at large screen size I'm going
to say column large for let's see what
that looks like so you can see now it's
a four maybe there's my medium yeah so
it goes there then it goes into that so
when I'm at the really big
screen sizes I don't have my text going
all the way up to the edge which is good
now the problem is I find it looks
really weird that it's stuck to the top
here and there's this big space on the
bottom so we're going to get rid of that
and we can do that just the same way we
sorted this we can use our flex so I'm
going to come on this one and I'm going
to say that it's a display flex save
that because it might change yeah so
it's putting it this way so a normal
flex is going to have a row it puts
everything inside it in columns but you
can change that behavior by doing a what
would it be it would be flex column I'm
guessing I think that's what they call
it yeah okay
so flex column so now this has changed
it into a column instead of a row so my
things are lining up that way and then I
can use my just II just defy Content
Center and that should Center it this
way it looks exactly the same because it
was but there we go you can see it's
perfectly centered you might be going
wait when you did the justified content
Center on this one it moved it this way
and now I'm doing justify content center
and it's moving it this way
so the justified content and the aligned
items it depends on whether you're a row
or a column so because I change this
into a column just the justified content
is always doing it on the cross access
so on this one its centering it this way
on this one it's centering it this way
because this is a row and this is a
column if you're not really sure about
it and you're just getting used to it
just know that those are sort of the two
things you would use to Center something
so if you try one and it doesn't do the
right thing you just do the other one
that's how I like to do it okay so
that's looking pretty good I'm happy
with that let's jump down to here so the
first thing you probably have already
noticed is my images are squish 'red and
it depends really on the screen size at
this point so there they look okay but
then they get smushed and smushed and
smushed and it looks pretty terrible the
other thing I don't like so the first
thing I'm actually going to do when I
squish this to here like this is
too small so I actually just like this
is switching over at the medium screen
size I actually want all of these to
switch over at the medium screen size so
they should be stacked instead okay now
you can see that the images are still
being squished and the reason so I'm
have to open these up now the reason
that they're getting squished like that
is because they're the image card image
top is making sure it fits in the area
and it's adjusting the width of the
image to match the thing but they're not
adjusting the height so I have to add in
image fluid and if you're coming from
bootstrap 3 that was image responsive in
the old days they've changed that to
image fluid instead of image responsive
and open up this one and so now when I
save that they should adjust and no
longer be squished awesome so the height
is set to auto now I think is what they
were are doing with that oops that's not
the window I wanted to resize so now it
looks better at all the screen sizes
which is awesome so I think I can no I'm
going to leave these open because I have
to do some work let's do the text first
and then I'm going to focus on pulling
them up so there's that little overlap
because the text is the easier part of
all this so I want to go here's my first
one so each one of these I want actually
the first thing I want to do I have my
container here I'm going to call this
band members so this whole column our
container area here is my band members
and then each one of these cards is a
individual band member and so let's do
all three of those first we'll add and
member and one more on my card band
member cool so I'm going to save nothing
should change there just refresh the
next thing I want to do is I want to
style the text both of these texts need
to be styled because they don't look
quite like what they should so on here's
the the singer and then what they do so
I'm going to come in here and give this
a bend member name I can copy that and
for this I'm going to call it band
member position and we have just have to
do that on all of them so band member
name band member position and you're
going to see what yeah this is just for
styling the text right and remember name
band member position do you call it a
position if it's a bend for band Z is it
really their position I feel like I'm
using the wrong word for that but that
is what I'm going to use so if we come
into here I can say that my band member
name will start with this the font
family is my saw Seraph did I do all
caps on that I did do all caps this is
something I could control here but at
one point you know text transform upper
case you can do text upper case but did
I make a mistake text try there we go
okay good so that looks alright and then
I just want to check it my bigger screen
size yeah that's okay that it's on two
lines that doesn't bother me
upper case so that looks good and now my
band member polarization I'm going to
curl what I want to I just want to make
it lighter it's too I don't want it to
be white if you look at my original
design I'll pull it up it's a great
color and I know I have a variable of
gray so let's see what that looks like
color is great because I completely
forgot oh okay this this is gray um
that's not what I want then okay a
custom though is my colors in here gray
so there's my gray so that's this color
I know that they come wid syrup comes
with a
a light so we'll use that variable
actually it comes with a great light so
before I even update that why don't I
just see what that looks like great
light that's not quite light enough and
I dunno it also it has a lighter and a
lightest I even think so we'll try it
lighter and that looks like white as far
as I'm concerned so we're not going to
use that one so I'm going to stick with
gray light but we're going to change
what it looks like so I'm going to come
into my custom if ever wants to jump
over and we're gonna do my gray light
I'm gonna do a lighting on this though
lighten gray by like 40% maybe will be
visible enough we'll find out in one
second well that should go out here if
you don't know this is it comes ass ass
you can lighten or darken colors like
this you do lighten you put the color
you want and then how much lighter you
want it to be that actually looks pretty
good the reason I like using this is it
keeps the relationship together so if
ever I change this gray this color is
going to adapt with it which is nice
because I want them to sort of work
together so for me that looks fantastic
actually I'm happy with that I think I
want to reduce that space though if I
remember right from bootstrap there's no
margin tops on anything it's always
margin bottom so let's just do a margin
bottom of like point to 0.25 M good cool
that looks all right let's this go look
yeah nice that looks really good
actually I'm happy with that
and then I get smaller and smaller and
then it stacks so when they're stacked I
do want some space between them so
that's my band I didn't even do it so
right here oh no bad yeah to be my band
member the individual band members can
have a margin bottom of like
one em let's try 1.5 yeah it's better
cool good
so they stack like that that looks
pretty good I think they're actually
getting stretched wider now than they're
supposed to be yeah they're I think
that's an alpha problem with the cards I
do know that we have the problem down
here too with these things getting
smushed and stretched and I'm pretty
sure the cards still have some issues
with the the Alpha so I'm going to chalk
it up to that and keep on moving but I'm
pretty happy with that that looks really
good so the only thing we really have
left to do is to move all of this up a
little bit because I want it to I'm hand
gesturing I'm pushing up with my hand
but you can't see that you want that we
want to move this up so it's have you
know it's on top of this image a little
bit and again it's just to help lead the
eye down to here so to do that what do
we need to do we need to select our band
members right I'm just trying to think I
want my individual I think what I'm
going to do so I have my band member I'm
actually going to work on that one so
I'm going to say that my band members is
a position relative because I'm going to
use some absolute positioning to move
after we need absolute positioning maybe
I can do with a transform instead I was
thinking I was going to need to do no I
do want it because I want thing my next
div that's here that we can't see
because there's nothing in it yet is
going to be that parallax image that I
want so you can see here there's an
image that's actually behind this and I
think the easiest way to do that if
these are positioned absolute they can
go to the flow and stuff can come up
underneath them so I think I'm going to
do that I'm going to these get position
absolute stuff's going to fly underneath
them I do think that will be the easiest
way to do it I think that would be the
best so um what band members Ben member
bye
member so all my band member individual
band members will get position
position:absolute the reason I'm doing
the the band members is right now the
band member I mean the individual ones
this band members is already right at
the bottom of here and I want that to
stay there if I did my position:relative
for the whole About section these things
would want to line up all the way at the
top and then I'd be having to try and
calculate to get them all the way back
down here by having the band members so
the div that's already here be the
position relative I'm starting here so
it just makes it a little bit easier so
you can see right away that worked
everything came up it's ignoring the
fact that they're there now obviously
that causes an issue because I need to
do a Zed index I'm just going with 100
so I know it goes on top okay and now we
need to move it up a little bit I like
keeping these properties together top
negative negative what 5m nope too much
the three that looks nicer good except
now this doesn't look centered oh and
I'm gonna have another problem here when
I go to the small they're stacking one
on top of each other because they're all
position:absolute they're just stacking
one on top of each other which is no
good obviously so what do I need to do
to fix that um I need a media query
bootstrap comes with a mixin so this is
a nice time to use to introduce the
bootstrap mix-ins because I sort of need
to so what we're going to say is
@include because I'm using a mixin media
breakpoint and with the media
breakpoints they have up or down so it
depends do you want min or max not
minute max it min the anyway up I went
up in this case
I went up of small so I'm saying from
the small no not small medium medium
up of medium because I change the I did
the whole set using small but medium
looks a lot nicer and that's because
they change the breakpoints between
three and four are used to always put
stuff in small but the old small is the
new medium so it's just to confuse us
all oops what did I do
why is everything getting highlighted in
red there we go okay and I'm going to
move all of this into there so what I
was saying a media breakpoint up so from
the medium screen size and up I am
getting this so this is exactly the same
thing is doing at media and then your
screen size and saying the pixels you
want but because bootstraps built on you
know I just want to use the same
breakpoint that they're already using I
can just use this mixin and it works
should work beautifully and again I'm
choosing medium because that's their
columns at medium and below the medium
screen size they stack one on top of
each other so let's save that and see
what happens there we go awesome so that
looks good good and then when I go back
to here look there we go okay I'm I also
forgot to give it there box shadow so
these should have a shadow on them I'm
have to check that shadow so I want a
box shadow and let's go back to my
Photoshop file bandmembers drop shadow I
do have a distance on it six pixels at
that opacity is thirty I'm probably have
to go a little bit yeah we'll see I'm
probably in a bit darker just to make
sure we see it size 13 okay cool so I'm
going to go with an offset of six six so
that's what I had in my Photoshop file I
think it I'll just do 15 for my blur
zero and then an RGBA of black
and I said I'm going to be like a 0.5
awesome keep selecting the wrong window
yeah there we go that looks sweet cool
now this isn't what it would be on top
of in the end but still that looks
pretty good I'm happy with that that
looks good and is the drop shadow make
sense there the drop shadow still looks
okay there so I'm going to keep that
like that the one thing I still like
right now is I have this space here and
then it looks super tiny here so I'm
actually going to use this I want it I
want to keep the same thing here because
at that's my my here my padding top and
my padding bottom and that the small
screen sizes I want this distance to be
the same as this I want them to be equal
so right now they are but when I get to
this screen size I don't want them to be
equal anymore because this is going from
here down to like right there so this
and this being equal make it look not
equal if that makes sense
so what I'm going to do is say the
medium break point my padding bottom
needs to grow padding bottom will try 15
and play with it from there vah vah save
and I said play with it from there but
wow that looks good perfect so again I'm
not worried about the distance from here
to here or you know from here to here
I'm worried about the visual distance
here and here I want that to look equal
and that looks pretty much equal I'm
pretty happy with that and then I still
want that and that to sort of be
balanced out so and I'm on the phone
I'll just go look so yeah at the small
screen size maybe it's a little bit too
big actually but let's make this a
little bit smaller let's try like six
and six and then I'll add it in here a
padding
top becomes 10 VH I think that'll look
nicer so about the text is there right
away then we get into the band members
they're cool and then when I'm on the
bigger size that gets a little bit
bigger and then of course with the
really big sizes it just centers itself
anyway awesome that looks really good
that took me a little bit longer than I
thought it would but overall I'm really
happy with it again this isn't going to
stay here this is going to get moved
down ring at that parallax image
underneath that so we'll be doing that
in the next video but for this one I'm
super happy with that I think that
turned out really well and I'm really
happy with how that looks that turned
out really nice I'm super happy with how
that is I hope you are too if you have
any comments or questions about stuff
going on things aren't working just
leave a comment down below I'll gladly
answer that hit that like button if you
