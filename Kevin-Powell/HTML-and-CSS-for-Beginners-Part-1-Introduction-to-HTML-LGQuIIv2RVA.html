Kevin and this channel is devoted to
helping people learn how to make the
internet and how to make it look good
while they're at it this week is the
start of a really big series and one
that I'm really excited about we're
gonna be looking at the basics of HTML
and CSS this series is really aimed at
people who are just starting to get
their feet wet in the world of web
development we're gonna be going all the
way back to the very basics in this one
starting this week with just a
introduction to HTML what it is and how
it works so let's hop to it so before we
get into writing our own code let's take
a look at what hTML is and how it
actually works cuz it's kind of weird
when you're not used to it
HTML stands for hypertext markup
language and the hypertext is pretty
much just a fancy way of saying text
they can actually link to other things
you know other pages or different parts
in the same page HTML is a very simple
language and it's made up of things
called tags and understand how this
works I'm gonna use a little bit of a
metaphor on this one let's say you've
got a birthday present and it's all
wrapped up and it's ready to go well the
first thing we have is a wrapping paper
now our computers are dumb if we tell it
that we have a piece of wrapping paper
it's going to assume it's an infinite
piece of wrapping paper it just goes on
forever and ever and ever so we have to
tell it that our piece of wrapping paper
actually ends somewhere so we start that
off we have our wrapping paper and we
put in these little triangle brackets
and then we close our wrapping paper so
those are the tags and they show the
start and the end of a wrapping paper so
the triangle brackets and we put
wrapping paper in there it starts a
wrapping paper and then we tell the
browser or a computer that we're ending
our wrapping paper by putting the same
thing but we put that little forward
slash there at the beginning to say this
is the end of my wrapping paper now
obviously we're not just giving someone
a big piece of wrapping paper inside the
wrapping paper we have something like a
box and then we'll inside this box we
have let's say a nice new train set so
again the box we have an open air box
and really end of our box and then we
have our train and the end of our train
and will this train it's made up of a
few parts we don't just have a train the
train has different pieces to it so we
have the
locomotive that pulls it along and we
have a few different cars in there as
well now these aren't real tags but it
gives us an idea of how it's all going
to work the opening tag is always inside
those triangle brackets and the closing
tag is always the exact same thing but
with that forward slash in it that tells
the browser that we've closed our
wrapping paper or our box or train so we
have our wrapping paper and inside our
wrapping paper we have our box and
inside of our box we have our train and
our train is made up of these four
different parts as I mentioned these
aren't real tags we're just you know we
aren't putting trains and websites but
this is how tags work and I just want to
make sure you guys sort of had a rough
idea of how it actually does work before
we really got it started now with HTML
there aren't a whole bunch of tags and
we can only use the actual HTML tags we
can't make up our own we can't make
trains and cars and boxes and wrapping
paper as cool isn't easy I guess as that
might make it but luckily even though
there's a whole bunch of them we only
really have to worry about a few really
important ones especially when we're
starting out and in the next video
you'll find out what they are so I look
forward to seeing then I hope you'd like

series and have yourselves a great day
