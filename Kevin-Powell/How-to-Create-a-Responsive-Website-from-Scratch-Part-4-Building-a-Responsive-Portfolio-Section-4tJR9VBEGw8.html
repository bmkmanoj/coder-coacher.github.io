how to build a responsive website from
scratch today we're going to be focusing
on this portfolio sections we're going
to build this cool grid put a little
hover effect in so we can click on the
link to find out more about the projects
before I really jump into that I just
want to say thanks so much for watching
so far I hope you've liked the series so
far if you have don't forget to hit the
little like button on this video it
really helps me out and leave a comment
below let me know if I've been doing
things properly if it's been easy to
understand or if you'd like any more
explanation on things also this series
is going to be wrapping up pretty soon I
got this video and one more left after
that for the two sections down at the
bottom so if you have any suggestions
for other things you'd like to see leave
them down below in the comments and I'd
be glad to take a look at those going
forward but enough about all that let's
actually start looking at what we have
here so I've already gone and done the
HTML a while back you haven't seen that
video go check it out it's number one
there should be a little thing you can
click on somewhere on the screen now to
go see basically I built a nice big
section class portfolio on there I put a
title on it and then I put in a bunch of
figures inside each figure is a class of
it support item portfolio item I have my
image in there which is there and then I
have a figcaption
and my figcaption is the little title
here as well as my big button now this
button I want to be a small button and I
never actually got around to creating a
style for small button so why don't we
start with that right now I'm just
coming in here I'm going to find where
all my other buttons are there we go um
so let's just put my button smell right
here so button small and for that all I
think I need to change my font size so
let's just do a nice little font size of
that's right point 6 REM and it's not
working because I have my media query
down here so basically this class let's
just bring this up then that's not a big
deal
basically what was happening as it was
saying my font size for button small
should be 0.6 and then my button size
should be 1.5 so because this was lower
down to my CSS it was winning there we
go and one point six is too small well
before I say that for sure well it is
too small but I am going to bring up my
responsive and just set this up to be
the phone size
I'm at 100% and let's just make that a
little bit bigger that should be pretty
good except I'm also going to increase
the font weight because that's at that
font size it's kind of small just go
with a 700 I think that'd be easier to
read it's hard on the white right now
but it's not going to stay on white it's
going to come on top of our picture now
a few things that are going on let's
just take a quick look um well I do need
some space here to push you know I I'm
glued to the top there I want to move
that down these aren't the full size and
this is a strange little thing if I look
in here let's just make that a little
bit bigger I'll make these font sizes a
bit bigger and figures for whatever
reason have or is it a margin on the
left and the right by default and it's
point four is it 40 yeah margin start
margin and the left and right it comes
as a user-agent style sheet where
they're just they have that so I'm going
to have to turn that off I'm just going
to do all that down in my portfolio CSS
which I probably don't have anything for
yet so for my portfolio I do the first
really quick thing we'll do is just
figure margin zero we shouldn't need any
margins on them and right away that
helps it with there it goes full size we
can just come and this is my pop-up up
portfolio
margin of let's say top margin within
our top and bottom 3m and left and right
zero just to give us some space up top
there
well I close that but I don't want to I
want to keep that opened okay so the
next thing I want to do is move my these
things on top of the picture so we have
a little bit of work to do but it
shouldn't be too much let's go and grab
my port item so I want my portfolio
items really important they need to have
a position of relative to be able to
move things properly problem probably
properly inside of there and so let's
leave that like that and then come and
say my did I give them a class figure
image figcaption is my portrait
description I should report item I
shouldn't change this I should change
this to port item my port item will have
the margin of 0 oh I really do it like
that port I figure is my port item I can
put all this together
that's silly of me ok and then my port
just script description will have a
position of absolute so just save that
and see what happens
port description is not poor description
its port description like that nice and
short and then it disappears so I do
believe I'm going to need to do
oh it's underneath z-index 100 yeah
there we go so now they're on top so
that's good I'm going to say bottom of
1m left of 0 right of 0 just to Center
it what why did it oh I forgot my
there we go okay so the bottom is one
I'm off the side the bottom I'm going to
make that a bit bigger actually let's
make that 3m just to move it up a little
bit and I'm going to do a couple more
things let's change my color to white
and now let's give this a background a
background of rgba because I want it to
be transparent and we'll do black zero
zero zero zero and zero 0.25 know much
more seventy five cool um I'm going to
say left also of three m3m I find it a
bit weird that I'm sticking it to the
sides there so let's just see that looks
a little bit better and we'll add a
little bit of padding padding of 3m
let's see how that looks
that's too big 1m and I'm actually going
to drop this down to like a two
basically I want to just be able to you
know I'm thinking if I'm on a mobile
device I want to always be able to see
the picture and this is just going to
stay on the top all the time that's
inside a paragraph this is just do my
port description paragraph has a margin
of zero hmm I just assumed that the
space up there was coming from this but
it's not
let's just do a padding-bottom
1m padding-top 0.500
thank you for getting my semicolons just
to try and balance it out a little bit I
don't really like how that looks right
now though a little what do I want to do
I think all I'm going to do here I put a
margin of zero let's just do a margin of
1m I can take off my padding top that
way that looks a little bit better and I
also have this really annoying little
space underneath these this is actually
coming from these images there's just
the annoying thing with images in
general I'm going to say my port item
images yeah port item and so anytime you
have images and they're the only thing
port item image so if you have an image
in it's only an image inside a div
because they're inline block by default
there's this little space that comes up
underneath all images to account for the
descenders on text you know something
like a down here the letter P has this
thing sticking down so if the image was
in with the text it would taking that
into account but in this case we don't
need it so if an image is all by itself
the simple thing is just to do a display
block the whole purpose of it being
inline block isn't really needed in this
case and we can stick them together
nicely cool that sort of fits with we
have this nice dark thing there and we
get into these I think it looks fine
I normally the project titles would be a
little bit more varied too so I think
that looks pretty good
the real fun of this is going to start
once we start getting up to bigger
screen sizes because there it looks okay
but once I get to a bigger screen size
and it's not on a phone anymore or a
tablet
I do want these to disappear and it's
only on hover that they appear and also
I want to turn this into a grid because
obviously my pictures aren't big enough
even for it to work right now so we have
a few little things to do we want to
make it be able to turn into a grid so
where's this actually breaking at about
six just over 600 pixels okay so we need
my ad media not me a great undo media we
need that and that and I don't know
quite where this is going to be so let's
do a min-width of we'll start with 30
ram and we'll come in here with our port
item and my port item is going to have a
width of 50% let's just see what happens
cool so it works ah except it's HAP yeah
it's happening it's happening at 500
pixels which i think is fine ish let's
make that 35 that's better I like that
we can keep it single jumps up so that's
cool actually let's bring that up to 40
can we get away with 40 you definitely
get away 40 oh we can't okay
37 of course this really depends on my
picture size but I think that looks
pretty good there and then we wanted to
jump up to a two column so they're there
they're also going to need to float to
the left there we go so now they're at
50 percent super and of course when I
get to the even bigger screen sizes I am
going to want that to change as well
where we're going to want it to break
into a grid of three so I'm just going
to copy this whole thing and that one I
think I'm just going to do it my
standard one that I've been doing for
everything of 60 REM and it's going to
be a thirty three point three three
three three three four and I don't need
the float:left it's always floating left
because of this one over here and there
we go
so I have it in a grid like that and
then that grid will snap and I have two
and then that will snap and go to
one super great I'm not super actually
happy with this a little overlay that I
have here but I'm going to leave it
there for now because that's is what I
wanted to look like at the bigger screen
size so at the 60 here there's a few
other things that I'm going to want to
do though I'm going to want my port
description pretty much I want to move
it away I want it to be off that space
so I'm going to move it down so it's not
inside this block anymore it's too far
down so I'm going to swing into a
transform translate Y so Y access is up
and down and let's just try 150 percent
and there we go so they all moved down
like that obviously the problem is I can
still see what's going on so on my port
item I'm just going to do an overflow
I've hidden and now I can't see them so
if they're not inside that box
they're now hidden and what I can do
which is always fun is a port item hover
my port description we'll do a transform
and it will do a translate Y again but
it will go to 0% so when I hover on top
except I however won't work because I'm
in responsive you did you do so when I
hover on top buying it appears like that
and that I'm pretty happy with hmm
actually let's just go back up here
bottom zero left zero I don't know I'll
keep the MS I don't really need them but
I'll keep them now let's just see that
looks a little bit nicer right and we'll
add my padding bottom of like - hmm I
like that a lot more actually now the
only problem is I don't want it jumping
and just snapping into place like that I
want it to transition
I could put my transition just on my
port item our port description I mean
but I like having everything have the
same transition on a site so up here
where I have everything selected I'm
going to add a little transition so
we're transitioning all properties we'll
just do a nice ease in out and it would
be 250 milliseconds which is sort of the
default that I tend to use most of the
time so now when I hover over anything
you get that nice little transition
right boop boop I think that looks
pretty cool and then on the responsive
one so once we get down to the two where
someone's on their tablet it's going to
look like that hmm and then that will
drop down and get to a single and it
will look like that maybe this is too
dark let's just jump back down there
there's something that's sort of bugging
me about these six yeah there we go I
like that a lot more it was just really
taking everything away from it a little
bit so this nice sort of grid here now
and this get obviously more than six
pictures of ski I could add as many
pictures as I want to this grid and it's
going to keep working all the time which
is nice and fun and then it collapses
and it collapses down so I could
technically do something where when
someone's on a mobile thing if they were
to click on it this could sort of fade
in but really if I'm on a mobile site
and I'm just I get to the top here or
even if you know I'm on a tablet I get
to here if I just saw all those pictures
there I wouldn't always necessarily
think of clicking on one I know that
sounds really weird if you're a big time
web user you click on everything pretty
much especially you're on a site like
this but for usability sake um you know
someone technically could get here and
then just scroll past it without ever
even knowing they could get more on more
details for these projects so I do like
keeping it for UX reasons just make it
really clear that those are
things they can click on but of course
if I get to it on a normal screen and
I'm I have to hover
so the hover effect for me I don't mind
having the the nice little hidden hover
effect on those and so yeah I think that
looks pretty pretty cool and I think we
did that pretty quickly so I'm really
happy with that and how it turned out
project details they're not going to
link anywhere for now because it's not
really a real site but it's looking
pretty awesome and if you were to do
this you could link it off to your own
thing so yeah if you like this video
please go down and hit the like button
because that would make me very very
happy and leave a comment please say hi
