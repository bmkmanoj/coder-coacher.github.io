how you can write them let's go look at
an example of them in action in a more
realistic project okay guys welcome to
this video we're gonna be looking at
this pricing table I made I'm not gonna
be coding out the whole pricing table if
you want to see how I created this you
can check out the code pen the link for
it is down below instead I just want to
be focusing on real the practical value
of using it in your projects so the
reason that this is super super useful
is that by containing all of my
variables here what happens is when I
have a bigger file like this one it goes
on and on and on and on and there's lots
of stuff in here I have all of my
different things set up that my
variables let me keep all of the
controls for my site in one spot so once
i've actually styled my whole site now i
can come in here and this one place has
all the controls on pretty much what's
going on so here where my font family is
i want to change my font family and i
could change it here as far as my naming
conventions go FF is for font family if
i had different ones i could have a font
family primary and secondary or i could
have just a font family serif and it
saucer whatever you want
fw c font weight so font-weight:normal
font-style:normal e i'd have more than
just three because i'd have then this
can be body instead of paragraph but i'd
have like font size one from h1 to from
h2 which is this 3 from my h3 which in
this case i'm using on my prices
paragraph and you get the idea I think
for that I have my colors set up so a
primary color secondary I have a light
and dark version of my secondary and
accent I don't even think I'm using the
secondary anywhere on here and that look
at that I have a spacer one so my
spacers what's controlling most of my
space and I also have a medium and large
space random and talk about this in a
second and then I have my shadow that's
used on my cards right now and B R
stands for border radius so that's if I
came in here and just change that to 25
it's gonna change the border it is here
and on my buttons so you can see it's
changing it on multiple things at once
so it keeps my border radiuses nice and
consistent throughout my whole site yeah
so that's what the border radius is for
so just to show you how this is
controlling things here on my primary
color if I were to come and change this
to red you can see that it's affected
most of my site so again I can control
things really really well just through
coming in here I want to change how my
spacing works on my site I need a little
bit more space of your one-point-five
everything's gonna get a bit bigger
because I'm also my spacers are being
used in my padding so it's affecting and
the spacing on things a little bit maybe
that wasn't the best idea but it's also
affecting these spaces you can see I
also have a spacing medium and large and
what I've done is I want my medium one
to always be twice the size as my other
one so I'm using the calc I'm putting in
my variable spacer but I'm multiplying
it by two and my large spacer is being
multiplied by three so if I were to
change this one that's controlling this
space that we see here so if I were to
shrink that down you can see that these
spaces are getting smaller and if I do
that all the way to one again it shrinks
the whole thing down so that's
controlling and that way by changing
this one thing it's actually affecting
all three of these at the same time
which is really cool just really quickly
one thing I did and I think I mentioned
earlier that there is sometimes a useful
case for overwriting your variables
inside of selectors instead of having it
up in the root so here I have my primary
color which is this darkish blue color
so if we look at how I wrote my CSS here
and we come down to my cards my card
title has the background of primary
color so this is the title here it has
that background color my card price is
the primary color has that color and my
button which is somewhere else also is
using that color
card button background is primary color
so the advantage with this is when I
change my primary color all of them are
changing but then I have this this set
here which is my sort of the one that
I'm trying to highlight this is the
package that I really want to sell right
so if we look here in my markup we have
my card then we have another card and
then I have my third card so one two
three but my second card this middle
card is an important card of card
important so this is the more important
card and I wanted to change the colors
in it now I don't want to have to go
through and redefine all of my colors
throughout the whole thing I don't want
to have to say card important card title
card important card price card important
card body etc etc to change the colors
so what this lets me do is if I come and
I look I have my card important I've
redefined what primary color is I've
changed primary color to my accent color
so that means I don't have to change
anything one line of CSS changes it all
so if I take this off it's going to go
back and they're all gonna look the same
now because these are all using the card
and inside of my card my pricing all of
those things are set up to be using a
primary color and so primary colors
working fine it's getting it from the
route and if I come here and I redefine
it here whoops
just on do I redefine my primary color
it's changing what it is in that one so
this is also if I had three I could have
card important and let's just say a card
very important and we do card very
important and on there I could say that
that primary color is var secondary
color which won't really be the best
color to use don't I have a secondary
whoops I forgot my period there we go
and now it's changed that one so it's a
nice easy way to change colors on a
system
is already existing and to come up with
some themeing options and stuff like
that so this is the one time where I'd
be looking at actually using it and
redefining variables I think in a case
like this it actually makes sense to do
it like that but do be careful with
stuff like this but again you're just
gonna be coming through and writing your
CSS like you normally would there's
nothing that's too fancy nothing that
you want to change around too much but
basically you're just going through and
setting all the things up that you
normally wouldn't but whenever there's
anything that's repeating so my
background color my colors are always
gonna be repeating bring them up and
make a variable your font sizes your
spacing issues your rate border radiuses
your shadows if you have gradients
anything like that and then it gives you
full control over the site in one big
area right at the top of your style
sheet which is just amazing and makes it
really easy then to make modifications
so there we go I hope you liked the

I love having discussions with you guys
down there and if you haven't yet
subscribed please consider subscribing
so you can get videos like this every
single week in the next video I'm gonna
look at how CSS variables differ from
SAS variables and that using them in
media queries is just amazing it's
literally a chain it can change the way
you're working they're just amazing
immediate where ease and don't forget
until next time don't forget to make
your corner of the internet just a
little bit more awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
