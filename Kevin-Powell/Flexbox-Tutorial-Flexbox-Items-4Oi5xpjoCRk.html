we're continuing our series on flexbox
we're gonna be looking at flex items
flex items are the little everything
that's inside a flex box as soon as we
take a container we say display flex
everything inside becomes a flex item
and we can do a whole bunch of cool flex
stuff with it we're controlling them
individually so we saw before you know
you can make everything shift from one
side to the other but what if you want
one thing to act differently that's what
you can do with a bunch of the flex box
properties that are dealing with
individual items and that's what we're
gonna be exploring right now all right
so 4 flex items the behavior changes
things a little bit so we're just gonna
stick with three items in this one so
the five that we had in the last and the
very first thing just to look at really
quickly there's actually three well
there's five different properties when
you're looking at
there's flex grow there's a flex shrink
and I always misspelled shrink I
hopefully I don't do that in this video
there's the flex basis there's the order
and there's the align self which is
really really awesome now flex oh and
there's one more sorry there's also just
flex and flex is a shorthand for these
three and it's actually sort of
recommended but we're gonna look at
these three first and then we'll get
into with those with these other ones
here are after now the thing that's
important to know with it is as soon as
one of your items gets it so here even
we can take my Flex grow off of item the
in see up here we have our one two and
three that I've added so each one I can
control separately so sue if I do a flex
grow on this I'm just gonna put a one on
there I mean see it's growing to take up
all the available space so the the
default flex go is zero which is why by
default they look like this but as soon
as I put a what whoops a one in there
and their unit list numbers so as soon
as I put a one in there
it now takes up all the available space
the way the Flex CRO works deals a
little bit with how some of the other
things work so I'm just going to set up
on here too so we also have a flex rink
and the default flick shrink
is one I'll put this to zero and we have
my Flex basis and the Flex basis is how
much room does this want to be taking up
if it has the available space how much
should it take up so let's say we want
it to be 250 pixels wide so now it's
sitting at 250 pixels and I'm gonna copy
this on to all three because I think
this is the easiest way to understand it
so we have a 2 and we have a 3 except I
should have made this a lot smaller but
just really quick this is how much space
it wants to take up you can see right
now it's smaller than 250 pixels there's
not enough room inside the container and
actually maybe I should make my
container a little bit wider let's make
it like 80 yeah that will work well so
it has the amount of space so what it's
doing is it's not growing so the grow is
zero that's the default it's shrink is 1
which we'll get into in a second and
it's sitting at its ideal width of 250
pixels and as I grow it it's gonna stay
there but if it gets just smaller you
can see that now when it's it's not
gonna overflow at the side it's gonna
get smaller than 250 pixels so this is a
lot like the width when I was looking at
it before it's more like a max width
it's the ideal width but if it has to
get smaller it will get smaller than
that so that is important to understand
it doesn't make responsively it's a
little bit easier to deal with because
you're not getting locked into a width
now I'm gonna switch number 1 here to a
flex grow of 1 and it grows to take up
all that available space it's taking all
the space that's available these ones
aren't growing so by this being a flex
score one it's saying I want to be 250
pixels but if there is available space
grow to fill that space now this is at 1
but it's the only one so if you're the
only one it's the only it's growing and
the other two are gonna stay the same
and then here everything shrinks
together now if I make this a flex one
sorry I flex grow of one now they're
gonna grow at the same pace these both
grow at equally so any bidding smaller
or bigger
there the amount of space that they're
growing by is the same and let's go on
to number three here and I'll make that
a flex grow of two so when we're at our
ideal width of 250 pixels they should
all look the same
they'll all shrink the same way but if
they have more space than they need this
one will grow faster than these two so
let's even make this a three just to
sort of exaggerate it a little bit you
can see that this space is now bigger
than these two so these two are growing
at the same rate and this one is growing
faster than the other ones because it
has the larger flex grow so you can sort
of guess now what's gonna happen with
the Flex shrink my flex shrink let's put
this one all the way up to a 3 so now
when I'm smaller than 250 pixels how
fast is it shrinking so now you can see
that this one is actually shrinking
faster than the other ones
so with these ones it's growing faster
when it's bigger than 250 pixels and
it's shrinking faster when it's less
than 250 pixels so that's pretty cool
so that's with the shrinks let's put
this back to a 1 so they should all be
equal and just to show you I could make
this one a 2 so now the one in the
middle is going to shrink faster than
the other ones but when I get to a
larger screen size this one here is
still growing faster than them because
the grow one a girl 1 and it grow 3 and
again if I have two items with the same
number those two will grow at an equal
speed and this one will grow slower than
the other ones and if this is a flex
grow of 0 it's gonna stay at its Flex
basis size so it's just always as long
as I'm bigger than 250 pixels it's just
going to stay at 250 so that's how the
flex grow the Flex shrink and the Flex
basis works and the shorthand for it is
just flex so this would just be 0 1 250
pixels and then I can get rid of all of
that and that's the exact same thing so
this one would be a flex of 3 to 250
pixels
and this last one would be a flex of 3 1
2 50 pixels so one thing that's nice
about just writing flex is if I just do
a flex 250 it's going to default the
rest too it's going to assume what you
want for the other ones now what that is
doing is it actually is letting this one
grow so let's do my Flex probe one and a
flex grow of one so the the growing
should be all the same now so it's
assuming if you do a flex 250 it's just
going to get a shrink of one a grow of
one and it works that way so it works
nicely and I could do a one to 50 or
let's do two so it's gonna grow faster
than the other ones because the other
ones have a grow of one let's put a
shrink of two on them but it's gonna
automatically give it a shrink of one so
the shrink is going it's it's still it's
shrinking slower than the other ones
they're shrinking because it's
defaulting to a 1 on the shrink so if
you want to use the shorthand here it is
a little bit easier because if you
forget one of them or you just ignore it
it automatically fills it in for you so
I usually just use the Flex property
like that so yeah but that's I think
pretty cool now well I'm gonna come up
to here and change a couple of things or
just one thing let's change my align
items to flex oops
flex flex start so when I do in the line
items flex start they all get aligned up
to the top like that or they get aligned
to the on the cross axis the start of
the cross access so now what I can do is
I can take the align self and put a flex
end on this and it's going to align it
it's the same as the align items
property except it's aligning only
itself on that part so the Flex end I
can pull one thing down or I can do an
align self center and it's going to
Center just that one item so aligned
self can be kind of cool if I took off
my client say I take this one off
these ones are stretching because the
default for align items is to be
stretched so that's why they're taking
up all that space that's the default but
as soon as I do an align self its
breaking out of the default so you can
choose whichever of the align items
properties that you'd want for align
self and control it on its own so that's
awesome and the last one and is order
and I was going to do order before align
self so I'm out of order but that's okay
you can control the order of things
now the thing it's a little weird with
order is if you do an order one it
actually goes to the end because these
ones don't have an order on them if I do
in order to zero it will go to its
natural resting place it doesn't pull it
over to the front which is what a lot of
people originally assumed and it's
because the default is zero so if I
don't give anything it's just giving it
an order of zero by default so order
zero just puts it back to where it is in
the HTML if you do want to pull it all
the way to the start you can give it a
negative value though and that will pull
it all the way to the beginning and you
might be wondering why would I want to
put an order on it this is nice when you
want to rearrange things when it's a
mobile display or going from mobile to
something else if you need to change the
order of things because you don't like
the way things are falling this is a
nice way to do it so I can actually have
my item two my item three and then my
item one or if I make this a bigger
negative value I could do that I
wouldn't suggest getting too far into
the negatives I think it would make more
sense to do a 1 a 2 and an order 3 if
you really needed to change the order of
things like that or in this case because
the reversed I could just change my flex
direction to row reverse that might be a
bit smarter but it's just to show you
you can change the order of all of your
Flex items to any order you want them to
be in so that's a nice nifty thing that
can give you a lot of control on for
when you're using media queries and
trying to get things where you need them
to
be and there you go and now some of
those items might be a little bit
confusing and weird still so if that's
the case don't be afraid to play around
with it a bit the best way to learn and
get used to these is by trying them out
and a little bit of trial and error
because knowing you know just seeing how
one thing works in a little
demonstration like that's not always
perfect
but that's why in the next video I will
be taking a look at an actual layout
don't worry it's give me a pretty simple
layout but it's common ways that flexbox
is used if you do have any questions
right now though please don't be shy
leave a comment down below and in case
you haven't heard I have launched a
patreon account so you can go and check
in the description below if you don't
know what patreon is go down there and
check the link and there's a nice
welcome video that explains it in a
little bit more in detail thank you so
much for watching and until the next
video don't forget to make your corner
the Internet just a little bit more
awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
