is we've seen that working in action on
something that's a little bit more
concrete and now we're gonna see how we
can use them inside of media queries to
make our lives just so much better it's
it's awesome
so let's let's just go ahead and do that
so if you watched the last video and
you're already using sass you might be
wondering what's the point of using
custom variables I already have
variables and they're a little bit
shorter to write in sass or less or
whatever preprocessor you might be using
and at the very basic level they might
look really similar but in reality
they're quite different because sass is
a preprocessor meaning that you tell it
what a variable is and then when it
makes your CSS file it just replaces all
your little variables with what you want
so in the end the CSS just looks like
normal CSS with custom properties
they're a little bit different they
don't go away in a way like the sass
ones do and they're not replaced by the
actual value the browser actually shows
it as the variable so here let's
actually go look at this one really fast
which will be coming back to in a second
but if I come and I look at this if I
look at my font size or my font family
here or my font size they're not showing
me what it is they're showing me the
actual variable here so that's really
cool and another thing that this becomes
really nice with is you can play around
with them using JavaScript which also
for theming and stuff like that and
amazing but we're gonna get to that in a
different video one thing I want to show
you is this the way we can redefine
variables in different places that you
can't do with sass and this might seem a
little strange at first but we're going
to come over back to this one a bit
after and to explore it a bit more but
one of the reasons one of the ways this
can really work is in sass it can get a
little verbose so I made this little
example this is something that doesn't
work and with sass so this is written
using sass so this is a sass a variable
and I'm saying my font size is 45 pixels
and I want that font size to change to
100 when I'm past a size but as we can
see here it's not actually working
instead what I'd have to do to be able
to make that work is all of this so I'd
have to have a small font size
variable and a large font size variable
I have to select my h1 and say that my
font size is the small one at small
screens and it's the big one at big
screens so now we can see it's working
so if I'm below I'm in with it's using
this font size and if it's above them in
width it's using this font size and you
can see that it changes so with the CSS
variables that do work like this so this
is really amazing and I know I'm getting
an error here legal man for value for
function and code pens has been giving
them crazy errors the last couple of
days I'm getting all sorts of weird
stuff so I don't know what's happening
with that um but we can see here I can
declare what my font size is I can say
that it normally it's 45 pixels if my
screen size is bigger than a generic
CIL's that has been changed and I only
have to give my h1 the font size one
time and now you can see that it's
working doesn't seem like a big
difference but if we expand this out to
a big thing you can see it will actually
make a big difference so if we look at
the sass way of doing something we I did
it with the regular CSS variables here I
have font size body for large screens h1
for large screens h2 for large screens
body for small h1 for small h2 for small
so we can see that it's adjusting the
screen as I go because I've said that my
h1 h2 my body have these font sizes and
then they get redefined at the larger
screen sizes so that works it there's
nothing wrong with doing it that way
um but that's sort of the SAS way of
having to do something and just to show
you it's almost like a it's more than
like my full screen here and the font
size is quite big but it's there's a lot
of code going in here just to change 3
font sizes we come and look at the CSS
variable way of doing it it's so much
more concise and easier to deal with and
everything because I can keep all of my
variables in one spot and I don't have
to redefine anything as I go so if we
look here I have my font size body h1
and h2 and then those change at a
different screen size so I'm saying that
when I get to this screen size I'm
redefining these variables and then when
they redefine that means I know
have to include my h1 h2 and h3 in media
queries anymore
a lot of things don't have to be
included in media queries because I can
do it all with my custom variables
including those in the media queries
that makes my life so much easier so we
can see now the font size is small the
font size is big and it's just so
concise I have all my font sizes
everything grouped in one spot I have
all I'll have like all my normal styles
together I'll have all of the ones I
need in my media query and then I don't
need to redefine things as much
throughout my site I'm just redefining
variables and then everything else can
just live on its own I don't have to
worry about it as much I could be
changing my line height so I could be
changing container widths I could be
doing all of that all in one place and
it just makes my life a lot easier to
work on that level and that doesn't mean
that you can't use sass variables and
CSS variables together and we are going
to be looking a little bit why you might
want to do something like that in
another video well if you if you think
you can use this from her cool let me
know down below or you know if you don't
see the usefulness yet of CSS variables
also I'd love to have a discussion with
you so leave a comment down below and
let me know about it if you did like
