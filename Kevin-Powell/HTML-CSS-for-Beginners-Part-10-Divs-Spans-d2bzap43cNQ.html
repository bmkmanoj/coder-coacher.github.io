video in this series on HTML and CSS for
beginners as you can see on the screen
right now we're looking at Dave's and
spans today so divs and spans are very
important for creating our websites
especially divs which help us really
control our layout so we're going to
start with those a div is well I did
it's short for division so open div
close div and it pretty much helps us
separate our content so I'm gonna make a
day of there and let's come inside of
here let's put a paragraph and put
inside a closed paragraph and let's come
down here and do another div and close
div and right here we will do a
paragraph this is number two close P so
if I save that and i refresh it looks
exactly the same nothing much has really
happened right there we we just have
text just it's two paragraphs it's just
like if I didn't have them some people
have trouble with divs especially early
on because by default they're not really
doing a whole lot they're just there and
by default a div is a hundred percent
width so it's taking up all the space
and its height to zero they'd pretty
much you'd they're invisible they're
just there and their height is zero but
they grow for the content that's inside
of them so this is pretty much a box
that's exactly the same size as my text
but it's stretching the whole way across
the page and when you can't visualize
that so why don't we come into our style
sheet here and select it so I'm gonna
say div and let's give it a background
so we can see it so background let's
make it pink and there we go we can see
my two dips so I've selected both my
divs and I've changed their backgrounds
over to pink and I can see them so I got
two boxes there and right away you might
be able to see how this can be helpful I
can separate my content into different
boxes and I can control those boxes I
can give them background colors and I
can give them sizes and stuff like that
so why don't I do that right now I'm
gonna give it a width of say 500 pixels
so I'm gonna tell it how big it needs to
be I want this to be 500 pixels and it's
500 pixels and I'm gonna give it a
height of 500 pixels we have squares and
now I have 2 boxes of 500 pixels by 500
pixels with pink backgrounds awesome I'm
just gonna come in here now and I want
to give I'm gonna make my paragraphs a
little bit longer just because I want to
do a few things with them so I've just
got some filler text here just like we
used to have on the home page save that
and refresh and I can see there's my two
boxes and actually I'm gonna delete the
height just to show you what I was
talking about so I'm going to save that
and I'm gonna bring these back to normal
paragraphs and save that so I mentioned
that the div will grow to fit the
content that's inside of it so right now
my div is really small and if I paste
this text in there and I save it and I
refresh whoa there you go it's growing
automatically to fit the content and
let's do that for our second paragraph
over here paste my filler text in and it
grows again to match the content that's
inside of it so dips are for blocks of
content they hold things or their big
can in boxes that hold stuff pretty much
pan tags on the other hand are like our
strong and bold Oh strong and bold
strong and italic so if you remember we
add our strong and close strong gotta
spell it properly close strong will make
my text bold and and
close em well make my text italic but
what if I don't want to make it bold or
italic what if I want to change the
color of my text so let's come over here
let's choose the first few words over
here and I'm gonna put a span tag and
over here I'm gonna close my span tag
I'm gonna save that and we can come over
here and do span and let's do color is
something that will really stand out
yellow refresh and I can now control the
color of my text I could even come in
and change the font font size forty
pixels and that text becomes much bigger
you do font-weight:bold if I also want
it to be bold and there we go it can be
nice and bold let's take that one off
though I have just to show you we can
sort of play around with a whole bunch
of stuff that's in there and the span
tag lets me select different lines of
text if I tried doing that for my div so
let's say I did let's add a new div down
here that's out a paragraph paragraph
it's just out of one of those long
paragraphs again actually so we have a
nice long paragraph and let's say I
wanted you know starting here I want
this text to have a pink background
color so I do my div and let's close
that div here close div and I save that
and it's getting a pink background color
but it's also getting a whole bunch of
other problems and it's even really
breaking my site in all honesty because
well the browser's doing a few things
here I've opened my paragraph and it's
getting to here and then there's a new
div so the new div is forcing a new line
of text a div is sort of like a
paragraph they're both what we call
block level elements which means they
stack one on top of each other they
never fit in you know here if I have a
link I have alt text
these are inline elements they can sit
in a line with other stuff whereas block
level elements
Legos sticking together but the Legos
you know they stick one on top of each
other you put two blocks illegal next to
each other they don't stick together so
block level elements like to stack one
on top of each other so this paragraph
is fine then it's putting a text inside
my div but the color of it is changing
to white and all of this is just white
here so what the browser is actually
doing by default is it's closing the
paragraph here because it's saying well
now there's a div starting and I can't
have a paragraph go here and then keep
going into a div it just it doesn't work
that way I can't sort of have a
paragraph half hanging inside and
outside of a box the paragraph is either
inside the box or outside the box
the reason the text color is different
is because I had originally said on my
body all text should be white but all my
paragraphs should be this dark color so
all my paragraphs are getting this dark
color my paragraph is ending here it the
browser goes it can't my paragraph has
to stop here so it's automatically
closing it it's putting in the div but
this isn't paragraph text anymore so
it's switching over to white and this is
just causing all sorts of issues if I
make this a span no save fresh then
there's no problem at all
span is great and works fine and it's
all good and dandy now when you're first
looking at this you might be going well
I don't you know I get okay I can make
blocks with my divs and I can control my
text a little bit with spans but you
might not really get quite why we're
learning this yet you know you probably
are gonna have a website layout that
looks like this but websites are really
made up of lots of blocks of content so
here I've just pulled up the w3schools
com website and if you haven't been on
this site before it's a really nice
reference for HTML and CSS and other
languages as well if they have tutorials
not my favorite ones but you can follow
along with them but as far as a
reference they're really nice it's like
a sort of a dictionary for HTML and CSS
and I just want to show it to you guys
because we can sort of see how
everything's made of a block so I got a
block that goes all the way across the
top here then I
this green block here I have a big block
that runs down the side of my site here
I have a block here that has two blocks
inside of it I have another two there
inside of a block again and again the
late note here we got three so you can
see it's a block after block after block
these are all divs that are creating
this whole layout divs are the really
the building blocks of sites and spans
are just an extra little thing for
styling you know they're not all looking
the same and right now with my site
they're all looking the same
all my divs are pink and they're all the
same size so in the next video we're
going to start exploring how we can
actually make them different from one
another until then though make sure you
