series about the ipython notebook this
is the third part and it's about basic
Python in this tutorial we'll be looking
to how to work with the code sales we
can execute code sales by hitting shift
and enter a keyboard shortcut for that
or ctrl + Enter shift and enter will
execute the code sale and move you to
the next one like this and ctrl + Enter
will execute the code sale and keep you
within the same cell like this so your
focus is still on the same so one
important thing you want to do is you
want to get help about a certain object
you have in your coding environment in
here we imported I all and we want to
know more about we had a question mark
to the end of it and execute that code
sale and this will pop up this help
window at the bottom where we can know
more about this if we need to knee and
know even more about it we can add
double ? and this will actually show us
more about I Oh actually it's showing us
here the complete source code plus the
dark string which is the help string of
this that showed up in the previous one
and I Python magic there are a lot of
codes for ipod magic and here we're
looking at quick ref this will return a
quick reference for ipython with all
other magic available and a lot of help
that might you might need whenever
you're looking for a quick reference for
example to get history ought to call a
lot of as line magic and block magic
available also in here and another thing
you can close that by hitting the
separating line and another thing you
want to do is help sometimes you want to
get help regarding
a function for example open function
which opens the file and it will tell us
this opens a file using blah blah blah
so and this is the parameters and this
is what its Rotarians so we know how
does open work we can open the
interactive help show and which will
look like this and we can show us open
and it will show us the same thing we
can always quit that by typing quit and
it will get us out of the interactive
help environment you can get more
information about what you're working
with p doc PDF p source and p file this
is all magic that we read more about
what you're working with
and find a little p file this is how you
get more information about them p doc
PDF p source amplifier but mostly you
will be working with the single and
double question marks to get help about
objects you're working with tab
completion is one of the most important
things we have in I Python notebook so
if you hit tab after adding a dot you
will get you can explore and browse
everything inside this object so you can
start typing V and you will it will
filter out only things starting with v
we can see that we have virgin info for
example then we can add dot again and
tab and it will give us more information
so we can see our major part of the
virgin for Python that's too we can
check our minor should be seven yes so
it's 2.7 we can check our micro so it's
two point seven point six the version
we're working good we can look at more
things like version and it will return
the complete string and one more thing
is shift up you go inside the
parentheses of any function and you hit
shift and tab and you will get this
pop-up box telling you more about this
function the parameters things like this
things you might need to use a function
a lot of functions do have a doc string
that covers and I think that you might
need on the fly to work with the
function so let's look at more magic one
important thing is LS magic this lists
all available
magic that you have in your development
environment these are line magic and
these are sill magic with double
percentage with the double percentage
single percentage a mark will affect a
single line this will affect the
wholesale so let's see how do they work
we have time it this is a very common
one time it will time any time I think
that comes after time it so let's try to
create a list of a thousand items using
two different functions and time and
time them to see what's more time
efficient for us it's executing them in
loops and measuring the time they take
to execute this might take a little bit
of time actually we'll be taking a
little bit of time here okay did it
100,000 loops best-of-three is 13.8
microseconds for the first one and for
the second one it did it in 198
nanoseconds so this is much faster than
this we can time we can time whole
blocks using time at the cell format of
time it this will time everything inside
the block make sure you put it in the
first line even if you have some
important comments add them in the
second line don't add anything before
the cell magic so we can time this block
and it will execute this loop over and
over and we can compare it to this cell
to see which one does better and this
does slightly better than this because
it uses X range instead of range reset
this resets all our variables we have to
press in here if we do too
actually um bash I've talked about this
a little bit but it's always good to
remember bash and this is really
important very useful you will always
need to access something in the terminal
and instead of jumping back to the
thermal to do something you can always
use the double percentage bash magic
cell magic and add any code you want to
execute in the terminal right from the
notebook input and output we can let's
try three plus five again so we have our
input number 22 giving us output eight
let's get let's check this n of 22 this
returns whatever was in our cell number
22 and it's three plus five it's a
string of three plus five we can access
our output output of 22 and it will
return eight so we can have we still
have access to every input and output
and they are in two lists in and out
lists and you can access them easily
just by referencing the number you have
the underscore so underscore plus three
this will always reference the last out
what you have so in here we can say
underscore plus 3 which is 8 plus 3 it's
like answer in the calculator so 8 plus
3 is 11 11 minus 4 is 7 we can even go
further and say for example x 2 and that
would be 14 this solution is available
open source on github and it's viewable
on NB viewer the link to this document
is in the description below you can use
that as a reference whenever you're
walking with ipython thank you for
watching and I hope if you like this you
will subscribe and watch the forest part
of this series and it's a
what number basics thank you for
