about ipython notebook this is part 8
and it's about sin PI sin pi is a
symbolic mathematics a library written
completely in Python so it doesn't have
any dependencies so you don't have to
install any of the other side PI
ecosystem libraries to have sin PI work
simple is completely written in Python
and can work independently to see what
can we do with the sim pilots first
import the library the way you import it
will import everything within sin pi so
from simple import star let's first take
a look at a normal math equation I'm
just adding 3 to the square root of 3
using the math library of basic Python
this is the standard math library so 3
plus the square root of 3 is 4 point 7 3
this is this is basically adding 3 to a
rounded number of this of square 3 in a
float context the way to do the same
thing within sin pi we will be adding 3
to square root of 3 and the result of
that is square root of 3 plus 3 it's not
a rounded number so it will keep symbols
the way they are to express this in a
more visual way I will use initializes a
printing function I'm passing use latex
equals mathjax parameter this is
optional but it resolves a bug in the
current version so I'll initialize
printing and I'll print the same
expression again and it's visually
better now
at square root of three plus three
instead of square root of three plus
three looking like this so let's look at
the square root of eight for example
what it will do it will try to simplify
the your expression in here it get out
to out of the square root basically so
it's two times the square root of two
and that's basically the square root of
eight symbols symbols are like variables
so we can divide affine symbols to
include them in expressions I'm defining
X and wine here using symbols function
then I'm defining an expression of X
square plus y square so you can write
expressions using you can include
symbols within your expressions this is
another X expression X plus y to the
power three assumptions of symbols so
let's have a as a symbol I can check if
it's imaginary and let's return nothing
because it doesn't have any information
about this symbol I can assume that this
is an integer which B is an integer so
when I check if it's imaginary to a
return false because it knows that this
number is not imaginary C is a positive
number so I can check if it's imagining
and it will if it's a positive but it
will tell me yes it's positive and if
it's imagining and it will tell me no
it's not because it's a positive number
we can have imaginary numbers within our
work or our expressions using capital I
so capital I and to the power 2 is minus
2
we can have rational numbers so in here
I have 1 over 3 make sure you use
capital R for rational because that's a
class so in here I have 1 over 3 it
didn't around the number to zero point 3
3 3 3 3 it it evaluated the output as a
rational number I can do work with the
rational numbers I can add them together
can do all kinds of mathematical
equations with them also so numerical
evaluation I can use capital in to
evaluate an expression and here I'm
having the same expression of 1 over 3
plus 1 over 2 which is 5 over 6 and I'm
evaluating that and the result is 0.8 3
3 3 3 3 I can control how many decimals
do I want so in here I'm evaluating pi
to 100 decimals and this is how it will
look at 3.141592 100 decimals the other
way to evaluate an expression is with
the function and a valve that's
evaluating an expression and float and I
can pass how many digits do I want and
that's it it's through 3.14159 again 200
decimals and substitute and let's have
an expression this is X to the power 2
plus 2x plus 1 I will substitute X with
1 and it will give me the result of that
4 and I can have a different expression
in here I have pi times X to the power 2
I will substitute X with 3 and it will
come it's 9 pi I can evaluate that I'm
using underscore in here underscore and
will always return your last input so to
a return 9pi basically and evaluated and
that's 9 pi which is 28.2 factor and
expand let's take a look at this
expression I have X plus y all to the
power 2 I can expand this expression and
it will return x squared plus 2xy plus y
square
I can refactor that again and it will
return X plus y all to the power 2
simplify simplify we'll try to simplify
your expression so in here i wrote this
expression and it did try to simplify it
in the beginning
using a simple thing so in here i had 2x
plus 1/3 times X or 1 over 1 over 3
times X plus 4 divided by X so what it
what it did here without simplifying
this it automatically added to X plus 1
over 3x and it's returned 7 over 3x I
can simplify this using simplified
function and it were 10 7 over 3 plus 4
over X and that's a much easier way to
look at this equation you can pass
simplify come in handy also once you
once you have a strength equation or
sink expression so I can simplify a
strength expression and it will return
that expression back to me
I can have some geometry in here I'm
dividing sine X its sine X divided by
cosine X I can simplify that and it's
Stan X apart and together in here I have
1 over
X to the power 2 plus 2x I can have this
apart and it will split it so I have
minus 1 over here 2x plus 4 plus 1 over
2x and I can put it back together and to
return this simple has a lot of
functions do calculus work I will be
just touching on the general things in
here the the the first thing I will be
doing here I have sine X and I want to
have the antiderivative for sine X I
will use the function deff for that and
I will pass the variable that I want to
have to have the equation use as a
variable basically so I'm passing X in
here and a sine of X the the
differential of the sine X is cosine X
in here I'm having a much more
complicated equation and it's returning
the differential of that fairly easily I
have the log of 2 2 squared plus 1 plus
2 X and it resolved that for me I can
have integral equation so in here I'm
saying integrate cosine X and it will
return sine X and I can keep the
integral itself within my expression so
in here I'm having an integral equation
of the sine X DX from 0 to PI and this
is how you cast that you pass your
variable first then your starting and
ending points for your
integration you can evaluate that and it
will return 2.0 which is the integration
of the sine of X DX from 0 to PI as some
so in here I have a Sigma from 1 to 10
for this equation of 1 over x squared
plus 2x and I can evaluate that using do
it function and that will evaluate this
sum product product in here I have the
same equation but I'm evaluating the
product for that and I can evaluate that
using the same thing using go do it to
have some use the sum function and
product use the product function always
pass the second argument as a tuple with
your variable then starting point and
ending point it's the same for product a
tuple with your variable starting point
and ending point so we'll try to solve
an expression assuming the expression is
equal to 0 so in here I have a 2x plus 1
and I will solve that and it will tell
me the result of that is minus 1/2
and in here I have X to the power 2
minus 7 this has two answers because
this is to the power 2 so minus 1 and 1
I can even solve systems of equations
and here I have two equations with two
variables so I have 2x plus y and the
other equation is 2y minus X is minus 5
and it's assuming all of those
expressions are equal to 0 so I will
solve that and I will pass both
variables
inside the tuple and I will pass my
expressions in the list so I'm passing
both expressions in the list and the
second argument I'm passing my variables
in a tuple and it will return the value
of x and y so it basically solved the
system of equations units units is a
part of the physics module in senpai
it's pretty comprehensive it has
mechanics it has quantum physics it has
all kinds of things but I'm just
touching on units here so you get a
sense of what you can do with unit units
within NASA simple so I'm importing I'm
importing units as you from simple
physics I will execute that and I will
start with the five times milligrams
UDOT milligrams and it's giving me the
it's giving me the weight basically in
kilograms and here I can take a look at
half an inch and it's point one to seven
meters I can have the Nano so this is
not related to any specific unit but
it's a conversion basically and it's
telling me one nano is one and times 10
to the power of minus 9 so point eight
zeros then one it's really useful also
to look at units so in here I'm looking
at what and it's telling me what is a
watt or what's an ohm for example
converting from miles per hour to
kilometers per hour so what I'm doing in
here I'm dividing miles per hour and
storing that in kilometer per hour kmph
and dividing miles per hour and storing
that in mph miles per hour and I'm
evaluating that and a result of that of
dividing them is 1.6 which is how many
kilometers in a mile basically because
I'm dividing miles by kilometres per
hour so I can now look at what's 80
miles per hour and it will tell me
that's 120 8.7 kilometers per hour so
it's really handy once you have any
kinds of units conversion plotting is
sin PI sin pi has a built-in
plotting interface and it basically
interfaces with whatever system you have
it will prefer to go to matplotlib but
if it doesn't have that it will try to
plot in text format it will try to plot
according to your what capabilities you
have within your development environment
but make sure you have the matplotlib
that will make your plots much more
clear to see and here I'm plotting sine
of two times the sine of X to the power
three and it's this interesting chart so
once you're plotting you pass your
expression you use the function plot you
pass your expression as the first
argument and the second argument is a
tuple where you pass your variable your
starting point which is 0 and your
ending point which is 10 in here
and work with numpy pandas and
matplotlib and I will show you now how
to interface with something else within
numpy pandas or matplotlib so and Here I
am defining a function it has a simple
expression it takes one variable and it
basically substituted in this expression
which is X to the power 2 plus square
root of 3 times X minus 1 over 3 so I
defined my function in here and let me
test it with the number 3 and that's the
result of the number 3 I will import
numpy as NP panda's as VD and matplotlib
that pipe lot as PLT these are almost
standard so try to use these short cuts
for your libraries I'm defining in here
list 1 which is numpy array and defining
a panda's series and storing it in list
2 so I'll have two lists one is an
umpire list one is a pandas list to see
how can we work with one of them
first I will do the most simple thing I
will loop over my lists and time that
and see what's the performance of doing
it this way and basically I'm passing
each item in my lists to that method for
the first one it did that in 102
milliseconds the second one it did that
in 104 milliseconds
these are really terrible results
actually we will look at a more
an efficient way to do that and I'm
using in here we're testing a numpy
Victor eyes so I can vectorize this and
I will pass the whole numpy let's do it
and in the second example I'm applying
to my less than pandas I'm using apply
function and the results are even worse
than looping over the lists a really
efficient way to do that is to have your
expression in a variable and use a
function named Lambda Phi that will
convert your expression into a lambda
function I'm storing my lambda function
and LF now I will test it over the numpy
list and the Panda series and see the
numbers and here you can see over the
numpy array it did that in 225
microseconds and even with the pandas
series it did that in 440 microseconds
which are really much better numbers
than these in here it did it in 1.1
seconds anyway finally let's plot this
I'm defining the figure and the subplot
I'm defining X values from minus five to
five and then I'm passing those values
to our lambda function LF and then
plotting it and that's a function using
our simple expression to plot thank you
