years old that's your a degree studies
for 14 years works 40 hours a week never
married from the United States works and
sales white nothing family is a male and
works in private sector this is based on
data from 1994 so this might not reflect
the marketplace today but I will try to
make a prediction whether he makes more
or less than fifty thousand dollars a
year and it tells us that he makes less
than fifty thousand dollars a year let's
look at the same guy ten years later
when he was 35 he still works the same
40 hours that's a degree same occupation
same everything let's see what happens
in 10 years now he makes more than fifty
thousand dollars a year if we changed
the race his race to black we can see
that he makes less than fifty thousand
dollars a year what if he was working 45
hours a week now he makes more than
fifty thousand dollars a year but if
there was a female makes less than fifty
thousand dollars here and let's try to
make that 50 hours still less than
50,000 let's make that 55 hours a week
now she can make more than fifty
thousand dollars this might look like a
very bad results or might not sound like
good results to everyone but this is
just based on census data from 1994</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
