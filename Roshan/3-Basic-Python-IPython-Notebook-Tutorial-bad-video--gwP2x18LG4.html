about ipython notebook this is the third
part and it's about basic Python in this
tutorial we'll be looking to how to work
with the code sales we can execute code
sales by hitting shift and enter a
keyboard shortcut for that or control
and eat their shift an enteric security
code sell and move you to the next one
like this and ctrl + Enter will execute
the code cell and keep you within the
same cell like this so your focus is
still on the same so one important thing
you want to do is you want to get help
about a certain object to have in your
coding environment in here we imported I
all and we want to know more about we
had a question mark to the end of it and
execute that code sale and this will pop
up this help window at the bottom where
we can know more about this if we need
to me and know even more about it we can
add double ? and this will actually show
us more about I Oh actually it's showing
us here the complete source code plus
the doc string which is the help string
of this that showed up in the previous
one
and I fight the magic there are a lot of
the codes for ipad2 magic and here we're
looking at quick rip this will return a
quick reference for ipython with all
other magic available and a lot of help
that might be my key whenever you're
looking for a quick reference for
example to get history ought to call a
lot of line magic and block magic
available also in here and another thing
you can close that by hitting the
separating line and another thing you
want to do is help sometimes you want to
get help regarding a function for
example open function which opens a file
and it will tell us this opens a file
using blah blah blah so and this is the
parameters and this is what the truth
Arians so we know how does open work we
can open the interactive help show and
which will look like this and we can
show us often and it will show us the
same thing can always quit that like a
banquet and to get us out of the
interactive environment you can get more
information about what you're working
with p dot PDF p source and p file this
is all magic that we read more about
what you're working with
you
and finally the file
this is how we get more information
about them p doc PDF p source amplifier
but mostly you will be working with the
single and double question marks to get
help about objects you're working with
tab completion is one of the most
important things we have an eye by the
notebook so if you hit tab after adding
a dot you will get you can explore and
browse everything inside this object so
you can start typing V and you will it
will filter out only things starting
with v we can see that we have virgin
info for example then we can and add dot
again and tab and it will give us more
information so we can see our major part
of the virgin for Python that's too we
can check our minor should be seven yes
so it's 2.7 we can check our micro so
it's two point seven point six the
version working good we can look at more
things like version and to return the
complete string and one more thing is
shift up you go inside the parentheses
of any function and you hit shift and
tab and you will get this pop-up box
telling you more about this function the
parameters things like this things you
might need to use a function a lot of
functions do have a doc string that
covers I think that you might need on
the fly to work with
a function so let's look at more magic
one important thing is Ellis magic this
lists all available magic that you have
in your development environment and
these are line magic and these are still
magic with the double percentage the
double percentage singular percentage
the mark will affect a single line this
will affect the wholesale so let's see
how do they work we have time it this is
a very common one time it will time any
time I think that comes after time it so
let's try to create a list of a thousand
items using two different functions and
time and time them to see what's more
time efficient plus it's executing them
in loops and measuring the time they
take to execute this might take a little
bit of time actually we'll be taking a
little bit of time here okay did it
hundred thousand loops best of three is
13.8 microseconds for the first one and
for the second one it did it in 198
nanoseconds so this is much faster than
this we can time we can time whole
blocks using time the cell format of
time it this will time everything inside
the block make sure you put it in the
first line even if you have some
important comments add them in the
second line you don't add anything
before the cell match so we can time
this blog
and it will excuse this loop over and
over and we can compare it to this cell
see which one does better and this does
slightly better than this because it
uses X ranging civil ground reset this
resets all our variables we have to
press yes in here if we do don't
actually and bash I've talked about this
a little bit but it's always good to
remember dash this is really important
very useful you will always need to
access something in the terminal and
instead of jumping back to the thermal
to do something you can always use the
double percentage bash magic cell magic
and add any code you want to execute in
the terminal right from the notebook
input and output we can let's try three
plus five again so we have our input
number 22 giving us output eight let's
get let's check this n of 22 this
returns whatever was in our cell number
22 and it's three plus five it's a
string of three plus five we can access
our output output of 22 and it will
return eight so we can have we still
have access to every input and output
and they are in two lists in and out
lists and you can access them easily
just by referencing the number you have
the underscore so underscore plus three
this will always reference the last out
what you have so in here you can say
underscore plus 3 which is 8 plus 3 it's
like answer in the calculator so 8 plus
3 is 1111 minus 4 is 7 we can even go
further and say for example x 2 and that
will be 14 this solution is available
open source on github and it's viewable
on NB viewer at the link to this
document is in the description below and
you can use that as a reference whenever
you're working with ipython thank you
for watching and I hope if you like this
you will subscribe and watch the fourth
part of this series and it's about
number six thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
