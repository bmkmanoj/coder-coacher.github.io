about Jupiter this second part and it's
about markdown analytic and the story
will be discussing markdown which is one
of the most important features features
and Jupiter notebooks it gives you the
ability to create documentation for your
code in formatted text and media and
there is support also for latex which
implements high quality mathematical
typeset to write down your mathematical
equations so we'll start with the
markdown we'll go really quickly over
this to create headings it will always
create a bookmark for your headaches so
you can link quickly to any part of your
code to do that use the hashtag sign and
you can use multiple of them to create
any level of heading you want
alternative headings you can use the
equal sign
following your heading or the - sign
following your heading font style you
can do bold with double asterisk or
double underscore and you always have to
close it with the same you can do italic
using single asterisk or single
underscore and you have always to close
it with the same one you can have
scratched the text using this symbol and
you have to close it do the same
and finally there is no support for
underscore text but you can do that with
HTML using the you tag next are lists
you can do an unordered list using the
minus signs and you can have sub items
just by adding a space before the item
and it will render it like this or you
can have ordered items and the way to do
that is to have a a serial number with a
following number like 1 2 3 with dot
then you add your text after space
always make sure there is a space
whether you're using ordered or
unordered otherwise it won't render
twine and next is links you can just
throw a link in your markdown that will
and it will render it just fine like
this or you can have a reference to
something with other text you can like
to github you
think bracket to github bracket and you
can put your URL inside parentheses
images it's almost the same code just
add a an exclamation mark to the
beginning and if you want to have some
tooltip text that will show up if you
have our own damage you can just throw
that inside double quotes and after your
link inside your parentheses and make
sure there is a space between your URL
for the image and the tooltip text you
can do the same for links also the next
thing is codes so make sure you clarify
if you're quoting someone so in here I'm
cutting Fernando Perez and to do that
use the larger than sign and you can
leave an empty line and you can have a
link back to the person you're coding or
the URL where you cut it from then you
can add the horizontal lines to the way
to do this just throw three dashes or
three equal symbols tables the way to do
tables is you have to use the pipe
symbol and separate your columns they
separated the names of your columns then
you add this formatting row this row
tells it how to align the code so in
here I'm not using any Collins or if I
used a column to the left it will always
align everything to the left if I use
two columns one to the right one to the
left that will run it to the center and
if I add one to the right it will align
it to the right HTML you can just almost
render an HTML by putting the HTML code
inside your markdown in cell and it will
render it just fine code sometimes you
need to put code inside your markdown it
will not render this code but it's
nice way to document parts of your code
especially if you have like a large
class and you want to get to three lines
to show what's happening there so the
way to do that is use three accent signs
then you specify the language that you
want to highlight with so in here I'm
using Python and it's highlighting
Python and here I'm using javascript and
it's highlighting JavaScript latex
that's used to write high-quality
mathematical equations it's used for so
many other things but this is beyond the
scope of this it will take a very long
time to go over everything in latex but
in here I left three resources for you
to investigate this further you have the
lady quickie beautiful resource you have
Duke University departments let's
schedule assigns they have a
comprehensive list in PDF for every
symbol and lydic very large document and
finally have the equation sheet it's
full of equations written analytic and
they're categorized chemistry physics
algebra calculus statistics so you can
choose which topic you're working with
and find all the equations written in
oolitic so to render some later code you
can enclose your code inside single
dollar signs and it will render it
inline or you can enclose it in double
dollar signs and it will render it as a
block it doesn't matter if you put it in
line it will still render it as a block
operators you can have add subtract
multiply divide just like this so add
subtract multiply you can do an asterisk
or times by a backslash x or you can
have dot product using dot to divide you
can use the
/or backslash dev to add this symbol the
divide symbol or you can use a fraction
so frac and the x and y relations you
can have an approximate an approximation
and oh one second to code yeah I forget
to change this to infinity sorry
anyway to use relations you can use
approximately equal and the way to do
this is aprox using a proxy backslash
aprox not equal to is in EQ so not equal
to and it will render this symbol it can
have an infinity just using infinity and
you can have a larger than or smaller
than sorry smaller than or larger than
just by using the same symbols and the
to render them fine you can have that
larger than or equal to or less than or
equal to or larger than or equal to or
greater than using leq less than or
equal to or geq which is greater than or
equal to fractions you can use a you can
create fractions like this sometimes
they're more readable in some context so
you can do that with using a carat that
will push the number one up and an
underscore which will push number two
down and you can create a fraction like
this and of course you have to have
forward slash between them second way to
do it is fraction and it will render
something like this
so use the backslash frac then a curly
bracket and the number you want showing
top then another curly bracket and you
can show your number that will show on
the bottom of the denominator at the
same with the
the same thing can be generated using
over so if you have a simple think a
simple equation you can just use over
between them so three over four to a
render three over four Greek alphabet
they're really handy in writing an
equation and instead of writing for
example alpha you can just show them
alpha later whether its capital small
and there are a few variations and
they're all available this is the
complete list of all the letters you
don't have to memorize them but it's a
nice thing to know how to get to them
one quick thing about them
for example Sigma is a perfect example
you will see the way to do a small Sigma
is just write Sigma and small letters
the way to do a large capital Sigma is
to use capital S then the rest of the
world so Sigma capitalized and the
variation Sigma is var Sigma and this is
a theme that you see all over the other
characters and power and index so to
show any powers in your equation you can
use the caret so 2x square 2 it will
show two X to the power 2 and if you
have more than one symbol that you want
to add to your power you can use curly
brackets to enclose them so one over pi
to a render one over pi and you can have
indices so to add an index X of the n
plus X of M minus one you can use the
underscore for so extender score in it
will render X of N and in there X
underscore in here I'm enclosing my code
inside curly brackets because I have
more than one symbol it's just like the
power
roots and logs to represent a root of
any level use the sq RT backslashes CRT
so in here I'm I have two roots one to
the level 3 and 1 to level 2 and I can
write that using s QR T bracket 3 that
will raise it to the third level and any
code I have inside it I will enclose it
inside curly brackets the second one I
did not add the level because I don't
want to show too because a square root
is by default is to the second level the
way to show log so log of X to the base
x equals 1 the way to write this is a
back slash log underscore then the base
then whatever you want to show after the
log sums and products you can represent
a sum using backslash some backslash
limits then underscore the lower limit
then caret the upper limit and make sure
you enclose your limits inside curly
brackets so this is how to write the
limit of one over X from 1 to infinity
equals 2 this is how we do it
x equals 1 in the bottom and infinity in
the top then 1 over x equals 2 that's
really easy to write and the product is
exactly the same just change some into
product or prod and it will render this
for you statistics a few things about
statistics sometimes you want to get to
show that you're getting the maximum of
something there is a max and usually
want to write the complete limit in the
lower part under your max so and here
I'm saying
a max of s equals max of s of I where I
of s of Y belongs to s and to do a
minimum just change the max to men oh
sorry just change the max - sorry to men
and to a render this by nominal
coefficient with the inches K and choose
K equals n factorial over K factorial
times n minus K factorial the way to
write this it's really simple just I'm
using choose so n choose K between curly
brackets it will render this for you and
the factorial I'm just adding an
exclamation mark to show that some
calculus in here I will the way to do a
limit you can use the backslash lamb
then limits to write your limit of where
does X go to our weirdest approach so in
here X the limit of 1 over 0 as X
approaches approaches 0 from the
positive side equals infinity and this
is how we can write that limit let's
underscore which is the lower one x2
which will render into this little arrow
X as it approaches 0 so I'm showing 0 in
the place of power or 1 over x equals
infinity simple the and here I have an
integral equation and the way to write
this is end then limits of a and B and
it will just show your two limits
function definition of our period this
is I added this specific example because
it's really common and it will it's very
common in your work that you will have
to define something over periods over
with a condition so to do something like
this we will have to do few tricks first
we have to use a large bracket and the
way to add a large bracket like this is
using left then bracket and the problem
with bracket with the curly brackets is
they're part of lytic language so we
have to escape the curly bracket to tell
latex no this is not part of the closing
or opening blocks of code no it's
something I want you to render and this
is how you escape a character and make
let it render it and to the right side
of this I don't want to show anything so
I'm using dot so backslash right then
dot and I can add anything in the middle
and it will render it inside this block
of code
the second thing by the way you can
change the square bracket into like
parenthesis or a bracket and for these
two we don't have to use a an escape
character before them so I can just
change remove the escape character and
change this into parenthesis and it will
work and to add a closing one just use
whatever matching and closing bracket
that you used the second thing is the
array and this is to hold things in
columns in here the format of this is
backslash begin array and in here I'm
specifying my columns so I'm telling it
left left which is the alignment of each
column and I can add whatever code I
want inside then I end array so I begin
array I define my columns I put two any
code I want and close the array the next
one we need to know about is how to
break into the next line which is just
double backslash
and the final one is the text alignment
alignment box which is in box then I can
add any text inside it and it will not
render it as mathematical so in here if
I want to show F in normal font and not
the font that it uses for equations I
can use an inbox then I can add my text
inside it so let's look at the code for
this it's f of X left backslash curly
bracket to write the big one
begin array define the two columns both
aligned to the left zero and which is
how I tell it which part of the array
this is this will go in so I have two
columns so this is the first column zero
and the second column I can separate it
from the first column using an ant so
this is my second column which is the
mbox F equal x equals zero which is this
part the same for this one one over X
and which separate the two columns and
the inbox if X is not equal to zero
not if you are planning to show your
notebook in MB view or write your letter
code in one line it does not work if you
render your code in multiple lines so if
I did this definition over two lines
like this it will not render in MB
viewer fine
one quick was try to write the normal
distribution equation this is the normal
distribution equation
I left few hints here if you solve it
and wrote the latex code for it leave it
in the comments and don't cheat if you
don't mind okay I hope you like this and
this is all available open source and
github you can use it for any purpose
you need except finding out what's the
code behind this and I hope if you like
this you will subscribe to this channel
and you can watch the previous part of
the series about which was an
introduction to Jupiter or then next
part which will be Python basics where
we will be talking about five and three
thank you for watching I hope see you
