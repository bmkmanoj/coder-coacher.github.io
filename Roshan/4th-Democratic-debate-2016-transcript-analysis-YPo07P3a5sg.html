video it's going to be different i'll be
doing a quick text analysis of the
fourth democratic debate primary debate
so and here i'm importing just number of
libraries to fetch data and to analyze
it i will be using the Washington Post
transcript of the democratic debate so I
will pitch that website and find all the
paragraphs that I need from the debate
so and i will add all of these into a
data frame into upon this data frame so
now i have that a frame with all the
paragraphs some of the paragraphs start
with a speaker name so sometimes people
this is the host she had like two
paragraphs in here not each paragraph is
labeled so i would have to deal with
that and first i have a function to get
the name so let's start with this one
i'm applying this function that gets the
name using regular expression on the raw
input and i'm storing this as a speaker
then I'm doing forward fell so if
anything is missing it will get the
value from the previous one so now I
have this each of them each one of these
paragraphs is labeled correctly I will
do a quick count
can see that Sanders has the most
paragraphs then halting Clinton then
O'Malley I will be counting I will be
getting the rest of the speech so here I
split out the names so i can get wounded
a speech i'm doing thats also using
regular expression and interesting thing
flows so i will just do a quick count
for how many times we had an applause we
had plus 34 times and if i do a values
count by Speaker I can see that sander
Clinton get the same number 12 applause
the nomadic get seven and hold get three
the moderator so I will be doing also a
word count to check how many words that
each one of them said so I'm just I have
a function in here that counts words it
used length and it counts this
tokenization regular expression so here
I have how many words in each sentence
and now I can filter only the three
people on stage and I can do a pivot
using mean first I will see how many
words did they say each used in each
paragraph ahmad used clinton actually
used the most 32.7 then Sanders 27.4
then O'Malley 25.1 I will do also a sum
the same pivot table but to count how
many words that each one say and Sanders
on top why 4595 thirty-nine percent of
the warts were were said by him then
Clinton third six percent point five and
finally O'Malley 24.2 I can see that
they didn't actually give him equal
opportunity and this way I didn't watch
the debate actually I'm just doing a
quick analysis of the transcript but I
didn't watch the actual debate anyway in
here i'm just doing guest speaker
dictionary so i can do some analysis and
i added the speaker number i'm doing a
count vectorize ur so i will basically
count how many words were said in each
centers that would create like a big big
vector of how many words who are used in
each of these sentences you can see the
most ward said was the two and four we
then you can see the least words used 0
bloodiest and etc so one of the
interesting things you can do with them
with a classifier is to check which
words are most telling basically of a
speaker so I will start by Sanders San
there is the most telling words of him
are major Goldman Sachs countries
contributions corruption spending and
the list goes on Vermont real rhetoric
the least towards telling of him as
Lester plan again Dodson's come had
caused attacks
actually and these are the least
probable words to find in a sentence by
Sanders these are the most probable
words
compare ibly to a sentence that he
didn't say so these are the most telling
words that it's a Sanders sentence I
will do the same thing with the Clinton
so with header its dot try Frank quite
pleased someone spent and the least
words said about her are Clinton of
course her name she won't say her name
these major terms things Andrea Goldman
Sachs of course you want to talk about
that secretary oh that's interesting
second country's issued on contributions
corruption it's down there anyway with
O'Malley it's a really interesting list
because most of his most common words
they start with M so no but after that
its momentum mom next mission missing
minute- month mindful meritor eyes
mindset Michigan message mentioned
mentally manifests me Liam Moone moral
moving that's really interesting the
most telling words of him they all start
with the letter M the least telling
words of him are just common words
basically because he didn't have as much
chance as the others to speak I will be
publishing this not work on github I
would leave the link to it in the
