about machine learning this is part five
and it's about pre-processing in the
previous lesson we've talked about
clustering k-means algorithm finding
patterns and the testing clustering
accuracy the series start with the first
part setting up your environment then
second part about it's an introduction
to machine learning where we cover
clustering then regression and finally a
clustering and this one will be talking
about pre-processing pre-processing is
really important to do because most
algorithms will only accept either
normalized data or at least numerical
data Sophia if you have text or boolean
Zoar dates you will have to process that
and make it compatible with your
algorithm for this data set I will be
using my YouTube stats have downloaded
my YouTube stats as of today and the
columns we have our video upload the
time with your length I think these are
two separate columns actually sorry the
D length and the rest goes on first I
will be importing a number of libraries
actually I'm importing some core
libraries feature extraction dict
vectorizer i'm importing pre-processing
module from scalar and i'm importing job
Lib I'm hiding warnings so we want
others with the depreciation warnings
and finally I'm configuring panda's
maximum columns and the width of the
screen so we'll be loading data using
pandas so panda that read the CSV but
for this tutorial I made sorry forget to
execute the first one for this tutorial
I made this notebook an interactive voi
so you can download this notebook and
use it in your own environment to do any
pre-processing first it will look for
any text or comma separated value files
so I can take a look at this stock for
example have some stock data in here I
can take a look but this is what we will
be working with my YouTube stats so I
have a number of columns in here some
have text some have text representation
of a date floats and integers so I will
load this and it notifies us this is
done the second thing I would be doing
is type conversion so mainly I will be
converting the data type or do some more
processing for dates so in here executed
the cell and here have video it's
telling me it's an object so I'll leave
it to that a plot time I will change
this one to a text date and I will put
the format for the text date I know it's
before month d for day Y for year i for
12 hour 12 hours and now capital m for a
minute then finally p for a mm p.m. if
you don't know the format I left this
table in here so you can go and check
which symbol you need to extract your
data or parse it so let me try to I'm
happy actually I can't change the death
type of any other columns I can see the
maximum minimum average median for each
column so I can know some interesting
stats about my youtube channel in here
I'll process this let me see yeah
type conversion was successful so the
next thing you will be doing is
processing guy text in here I have two
text columns upload time is already
processed as date so I'll not be
processing that but video video I have
the title of the video in this column so
I can do two things with it I can either
map it so it will map each video to a
number so this video will be number 15
the other one would be 1413 and list
goes on or I can do binary vector eyes
so let's do both and see how they work I
processed the rest as mapping and you
can see that I have a new column here
the do map and it shows 0 1 2 3 4
representing the video name the second
thing the problem with this is it infers
that this video is closer to this than
this because the the difference between
these numbers are smaller than the
difference between these two numbers so
it infers that these two videos are
closer to each other somehow but that's
not the case that might be the case in
some put some other data but that's not
the case with our current example so
I'll do binary vector eyes I'd process
the data and I will display it
and you can see I said have video mapped
but now I have a number of columns
representing each video so video is this
one and the first row shows one that's
true and the second and shows 0 for the
rest so basically this column is telling
me video as this one and it shows the
value for each video so I can tell this
one is markdown and latex which is
number 4 until number one is numpy and
the rest goes on and on with the binary
columns so finally I'll be pressing
dates in here I have the upload date I
will
I don't need actually the year because
all of my videos were uploaded in 2014
but I might keep it just for consistence
consistency but finally I will be
removing gas seconds because I don't
need that and I will process my data now
I can preview it again and you will see
that we have now new columns first one
is year month day day week hour and
minute so I'm basically decomposing my
main features and two numerical features
finally some of that some algorithms
won't work until you normalize or
standardize your data what we are doing
here is either centering our data around
0 or scaling them or doing both so let's
see how does that work now since we have
all of our features in numerical format
we can do this we can for example go to
video length in minutes and I will scale
to a scale between 0 &amp;amp; 1
and that will also process this one
average percentage viewed I will process
this one as a standard scalar so we can
see how these two work I'll process my
columns and I will visualize the
normalized feature so you can see video
lengths in minutes it goes from almost
few minutes two minutes maybe until
40-plus minutes almost 50 but if I go to
the scaled one I will see the same
structure of data but it's scaled
between 0 and 1 some algorithms require
your data to be formatted like this the
second thing we did with was a scale of
a standard scaler and I did this with
the average percentage viewed so some of
my videos have like 90 plus percent
average view this one has 70 the rest
are below 50 now I can go and see the
standard scalar version of this feature
and I can see that the mean the average
of this feature is 0 and the standard
deviation is 1 this is a standard scalar
feature now because it removed the means
from my features and it scaled it to be
one standard deviation unit further
processing my might you might have to
deal with the missing values the best
thing is to go back and check what you
can actually do about missing data
if you are at a stage where you have to
work with some missing data you might
need to drop some features or attributes
or columns you might need to drop some
rows like also called the samples or
data points and you might you might be
able to impute these values by
calculating the mean median or mode
which is the most common value you might
sum to need some your data might need
some denoising for time series and if
you're working with the long text you
might work with the counting vectorizer
it's like binary vectorizer but it
counts how many times you had a certain
talking in your text final you can save
your preprocessdataset and here you can
save it as a comma separated value but
to really keep it in the same state that
you have it I suggest you use job Lib to
pickle your data frame and now I have my
data frame a pickled and ready to be
used in any other not work this tutorial
is available open source on github and
it's viewable on MB viewer you can
download this and use it for any
pre-processing that you might need to do
locally thank you for watching and I
hope if you like this you will subscribe
to this channel and you will watch the
previous part of this series about
regression or the next part about
feature extraction thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
