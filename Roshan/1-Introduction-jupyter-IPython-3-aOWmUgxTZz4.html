series about Jupiter this is the first
part if you're not familiar with them
with the ipython this is a virgin three
of I Python called the Jupiter and it's
a web-based interactive development
environment that supports multiple
languages like Python julia r and octave
if you're still using version 2 or one
maybe you can upgrade to the new version
to version 3 using these two commands
you might run you might you might get
away with running just the second one
but this is what I did but if you only
use the first one you will get some
trouble starting terminals with and
develop Navarro to all still work but
you're going to start new terminal I
will show you that in a minute which
will make more sense if you don't have
one of the first things you want to do
after you and install a version 3 is you
want to add the Python 3 colonel this is
a link to instructions on adding so many
kernels for other languages but this is
a code that you will need to run to the
store kernel for Python 3 make sure
first you have Python 3 if it no doubt
that you can install it but after and
solid this is the way to add kernel32
year working environment it will create
a kernel for that so why is it called
the Jupiter first of all the new law
goes really brilliant it represent the
planet Jupiter and three of Jupiter's
four moons and the logo the name
represents the new direction of ipython
development they're moving away from
linking ipython platform with a single
language the way it works currently is
as follows so we have an interface level
you can start and I Python console or I
path cannot worker and I Python cutie
console and you will link that session
basically to one of your
kernels and you can connect to python 3
to Colonel parking three are Julia or
MATLAB or octave or something else but
the way it works now you can start a
single Jupiter session or a notebook
basically and when you start a new
notebook now we can select which kernel
you want use for that so you don't have
to shut down your notebook server and
connect it to a second Colonel now we
can just use you can start a new
notebook with a different kernel so it's
julia python and our Jupiter with a why
but there is another reason and it has
something to the planet Jupiter Galilei
documented his observations about
Jupiter's moons and publish them inside
res non seus which is the starry
messenger back in 1610 which was just a
pamphlet that he published basically
this was the first paper ever published
about astronomy that used observations
using a telescope he has proven that the
Earth orbits the Sun like Jupiter's moon
orbit Jupiter and this is an excerpt
from his book translated into English
but this is his original notes that he
published you can see drawings
explanation reasoning and multiple data
points it's just beautiful sharing these
observations and conclusions in a way
that can be replicated and verified
inspired the modern scientific method
this this is what I Python not work is
used for sharing the complete process
with others to verify your process and
represent your results so what's new
about version 3 it's the last month Eric
release of light by thon so it's the
last release that will be and using a
single language
in there and the way they work they will
grow more into splitting the project
into Python specific parts and language
agnostic components you can use
different kernels so if you start a new
kernel now you can choose which a new
notebook you can choose which currently
won't use for that so just quickly show
you that you can basically start a new
text file which can be an HTML file or
Python or anything else javascript a
folder terminal session bash notebook
octave Python 2 or Python 3 or are you
will not get all of these you have to
have the back end then you can still
occur enough for that so getting back to
what's new in version 3 you can use
unicode variables so this is only
available python 3 but you can use
things like unicode variable so instead
of saying alpha equals something we can
see backslash alpha and press stop and
it would come change that into alpha and
you can use say for example i don't know
ok and then alpha or something like this
and you can just use unicode characters
within your code within your identifier
name it makes things much readable but
you have to watch out for some things
you can use the capital and small
letters just by changing the first
letter so you can say capital of our
capital beta or capital lambda one thing
to I noticed as some of the characters
are not monospaced
so this is a smaller character and this
is a larger character there in one mono
space it might make your code not really
even and some sinners more things
widgets are not backward compatible I
will be this is a link actually can go
there and see how to migrate but this is
actually this will be covered in a
separate tutorial no hidden cells you if
you start a new cell you cannot choose
heading if you choose heading it will
just change it into a markdown sir so
you can just type your heading code
within a markdown cell and it will
generate the bookmark link to all of
them within the markdown so a text
editor this this is one of the most
interesting features so basically we
have a yeah we have a text editor you
can open any file you have and there and
it will detect the extension of the file
and highlight everything accordingly and
here i have a sorry and here i have an
HTML file and you can see that i can go
and edit the code or change anything
about it the other thing you have a
static file server so you can basically
fetch any file that you have in your in
your system just change just put files
then put the file path and it will
return the file itself so you can for
example use em edit some HTML file in
here then you can just serve it as a
static file by changing edit to files
and your URL and this is just simple
HTML file it will take two numbers and
it will use Ajax back end too
them if we get back to our list we have
a built-in terminal we have seen that a
few times while they were passing
through this is a new terminal in here I
have some flasks webservice working and
I can monitor that from my priming tap I
can see all my running terminals and my
running notebooks some more new features
they have google drive support for
Jupiter notebooks and the collaboratory
I will be explaining those two things
quickly so this is a notebook that I had
in my google Drive I can open it in my
google Drive and it will show it it will
show me the not work I can see the code
see the results I can edit anything I
can go in here and change and change the
code basically of any of my ESL's i can
add new mark down or cod cells but you
cannot still connect to a kernel which
is a little disappointing for now but
I'm I'm sure someone's working on that
so just to brief about some caveats and
limitations they work only with ipython
too so if you install sorry if you
install collaboratory locally you can't
connect to a kernel but it will only
work if you have ipython to installed
running notebooks from collaboratory
that Jupiter that org like the one with
the google drive allows you to defile
but you cannot connect to a kernel yet
so you cannot connect to a colonel and
run some code in there there is a chrome
app that they're working on also but it
only works with the development version
of Chrome so far
this tutorial is available open source
on github and it's viewable on mb viewer
you can use for any work that you have I
hope if you like this you will subscribe
to this channel and you will watch the
next part which will be about markdown
analytic or if you're still stuck with
the virgin too and you need some
tutorial about that I still have a
tutorial but I Python version 2
available for you I still advise you to
applaud to upgrade to version 3 but I
still have that option to for you thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
