about ipython widgets this is the first
part and it's about container widgets
we'll be covering the container widget
coordinate tab widget and the pop-up
widget so first let's start by importing
by import widgets from ipython with HTML
you can define a container widget by
calling the container widget class then
you can in here I'm defining a three
controls two of them are text widgets
name and email and a button widget to
submit assigning these three controls -
children - children property of the
container then I'm returning the
container in here and this is what I get
I get the container with the name email
and submit bottom with the accordion
widget you can show multiple containers
inside an accordion so assigning a
variable named container one that will
just point to this container then I'm
starting a new container container
number two and it has four controls
country state city and safe and I'm
assigning these four controls to
children inside container two I'll
execute that in here I'm defining an
accordion widget by calling the
accordion widget then I'm assigning the
two containers to the children of as
children of this accordion and this is
what I get I get paid zero with the
first container and page one with the
second container you can change these
names by using the set title
function
where you pass the index of the page and
name that you or the title you want to
set and you can see that they change to
personal information and location so if
I click on this I get personal
information and here and here I get a
location information finally tab widget
I'm defining tab widgets by calling tap
widgets function here then I'm assigning
the same two containers through this
tabs widget and this is what I get paid
zero page one you can do the same thing
and set the titles and you will change
the titles to a personal information and
location the last container that we want
to talk about is the pop up and in here
I'm calling the pop up I'm passing one
parameter description that will be our
title for this pop-up and then I'm
assigning the whole accordion as a child
of this pop-up so I get this form inside
the pocket you can minimize it and that
will make it into a form you can return
it back you can move it around you can
even close it or open it again from here
this tutorial is available open source
on github and viewable on Mb viewer the
link to this is in the description below
thank you for watching and I hope if you
enjoyed this you'll subscribe to this
channel and watch the machine learning
series or the ipython network series
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
