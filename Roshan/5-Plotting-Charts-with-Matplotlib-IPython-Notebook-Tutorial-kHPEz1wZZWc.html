about ipython notebook this is the fifth
part and it's about plotting charts we
will be covering the basics of plotting
charts with the matplotlib which is a
comprehensive TD plotting library it's a
part of a larger ecosystem for math
science and engineering work which is
numpy scifi ipython senpai and pandas so
what can we do with the matplotlib we
can do plotting which is like drawing a
line or multiple lines and this is what
we will be covering in this tutorial but
we can do much more than that
we can we can do scattering we can do
bars and histograms we can do pie charts
3d charts we can do a lot of work with
images and contours so let's start by
importing the library whenever working
with this we're working actually with
the pie plot which is a sub module of
matplotlib and we always import it as
PLT this is almost a standard in
scientific work so we'll be importing
pipe lot as PLT and numpy as NP so we'll
define two lists X which is 0 1 2 and Y
which is this squared so 0 1 &amp;amp; 4 2 times
2 is 4 so we'll execute that now we have
our x and y to plot any figures and
matplotlib first thing you do is you
define a figure so in here I'm going PLT
that figure calling the function figure
to define a figure then a good practice
is always to add a subplot inside your
main figure and do most of your work
within the subplot the subplots to do
that
you call your figure and you call the
function add underscore subplot pass 1 1
1 to define that you're working with one
chart if you're working only with one
sub plot within your figure you will not
need to do anything except 1 1 on in
here
this returned as a plot we can plot our
numbers with the function plot within
our sub plot we're just passing x and y
to this function and calling PLT the
show to show this chart and it's a line
0 &amp;amp; 0 1 &amp;amp; 1 2 &amp;amp; 4 that's our data set
but it doesn't really show an
exponential curve in here a good way to
do that is use numpy to increase the
number of data points we have between 0
&amp;amp; 2 the way to do that we're calling the
function blendspace which returns an
array of numbers between 0 &amp;amp; 2 with 20
steps so it's the length of this will be
20 between with numbers between 0 &amp;amp; 2
the y in here will be the x times x this
is powers - so I'm getting these numbers
to the power 2 and storing them in white
IRAs so I have X hirez and white IRAs
with
20 numbers representing this exponential
function will plot both of them also I
forget to execute this we we will plot
our old X&amp;amp;Y original X&amp;amp;Y and our
high-resolution x and y and it's
returned two lines with two different
colors to tell us that these are
different plots so we have our original
rigid line in here and we have our
exponential curve in green one thing we
have in here is the colors the colors of
these lines are automatically generated
we can't control the colors we want to
use using color parameter so we can use
the color parameter to select any color
we want and we have another parameter in
here line style I'm using dashed we can
use solid if we want and you will get
this dashed green line there is another
way to style your line and give it
colors by passing a parameter or an
argument with R - - R is short for red
and - - is the line style telling it's a
dashed line this will return the exact
same thing you don't have a lot of
control using this so it's better to use
this color and line style this will also
help someone who doesn't understand the
math plot library or Python to
understand your code where they know
this is the red line that's the red
dashed line it's really easy to read
this then trying to figure out what's
our - -
the next thing we want to do you want to
increase the line width using line width
parameter equals three then I'm showing
my plot and we have this clear red
dashed line with the width three we can
add markers to identify our original
data points by using marker and passing
the type of marker want to use and here
I'm using all which returns a circle you
can see more marker styles in the
section below I'm using marker face
color and I'm using blue as color for
this for these markers and finally I'm
selecting the marker size and I'm using
five for the marker size then showing
the plot and I get these twenty blue
points identifying up my original data
points you can use any one of these four
line styles solid dashed line dash dot
and dotted lines and you have a very
large selection of markers including
squares Pentagon star plus x diamond you
have a lot of cell a lot of options to
select from and for colors you can
either use the one letter shortcut for
some colors or you can name the complete
color if it's not in this list like gray
or anything else you can use RGB and
hexadecimal format and you can use RGB a
if you want you can in pass it as a
tuple with RGB s so you can con control
your alpha you can have say makes
semi-transparent lines
or marks for that matters you can use
single number to identify it's a
grayscale so you have really good
control over colors
title and grid to set a title for your
chart you use the function set a title
on your subplot notice here I'm using
dollar sign dollar sign I didn't find
the code in between his latex code so
you can use latex code in your title
then I'm adding grid to my plot and this
is the grid that generated that I can
clearly tell that one and one is
matching this point and I have my title
formatted in latex this renders any
latex code and shows it in the title a
good practice is to label your axis so I
don't have a label on my x and y axis
you can do that by calling the function
set underscore X label and set
underscore white label Y label and you
can pass any string that will show that
will show in your label you can use
latex if you want in here I'm not here
using latex in here so I have my X label
and my white label controlling the
figure size and here we're generating
this small nice chart we can create a
higher resolution we can control the
size of the chart easily in here but it
doesn't actually increase the resolution
of the chart so if I increase it to a
very large number I can see that it's
not really increasing the resolution of
the chart but what I can do I can change
the figure size and to do that I'm
passing a parameter named fixed size
short for figure size equals then
you pass a tuple to this with the width
by height I'm using 12 by 8 and let's
see how does that look and it looks much
better because it's higher resolution
now sometimes you want a small chart but
sometimes really need a big chart to
show the fine details within the chart
visualizing numbers as images actually
this is as far as we will go with the
plotting for now in here I will show you
a small trick that will utilize the
image capability of Pi plot I'm
generating a two-dimensional array in
here that's 128 by 128 numbers and
they're gonna be random so that's my
large two-dimensional array
you cannot tell anything from looking at
the numbers because you have so many
numbers in here but a nice way to
visualize your data is to actually show
them in in an image and this is how my
two-dimensional noise look like these
colors I have numbers between 0 and 128
X&amp;amp;Y and I have these colors representing
a the different values that I have
within my two-dimensional array if I had
any patterns in here I would have seen
some patterns that links x and y so this
is really helpful once you're trying to
find any patterns or visualize your data
one good thing you can do is add a color
bar to that so you have an index to your
colors
did not execute I'll just pause the
video for a second sorry for that that's
a common bug in ipython where it freezes
you're out but basically it doesn't show
any output the way to deal with that you
save your notebook close it and open it
again and it will work after that so
we'll continue on here we used the color
bar function to return color bar index
and we can see our color bar to the side
we can tell dark red as 1.60 dark blue
is zero so we can better understand
what's happening here we can use
different color maps if that helps
visualize things we can use a grayscale
by passing the parameter c map equals
PLT that's CM that's short for color map
and there is a long list of color maps
in here very long list of color maps I'm
using grayscale so let's so that
visualizes our numbers in grayscale well
with zero is black and one is white
there are so many other color maps
available
this is paired it's a different way to
look at your data this listen is
available open source on github and it's
viewable on MB viewer you can use this
notebook as a reference whenever you're
dealing with plotting or charting things
and that's create and the link to this
