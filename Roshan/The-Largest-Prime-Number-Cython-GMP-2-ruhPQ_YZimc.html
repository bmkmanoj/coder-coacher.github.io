the largest prime so far found so a new
record of the largest prime number has
been found lately let's explore this
number and know more about it and have
to deal with it using get some Python
numpy and finally we'll be using will be
using seitan and GMP library which is a
C library to deal with them very large
integers basically anyway i will be
importing in here numpy math and daytime
just two major some time that some
operations takes so this number was
found in 2016 this year using the great
internet Mersenne prime search gimps
this prime is one of the Mersenne primes
which which are of the which are defined
with the following formula 2 to the
power p minus 1 where p is a prime
number this is a pseudo prime number
meaning not all Mersenne prime numbers
are primes so 2 to the power of two
minus one that's 37 31 127 these are all
primes and in here you can see we did
the formulas to get these values the
first none prime number in the series or
the smallest none prime number in the
series is to the power 11 actually this
is to the power 11 so
so it's to the power 11 2 to the power
11 minus 1 so 2 to the power at 11-1
that's 2047 which is not a prime the
largest number found so far it's 2 to
the power of 74 million two hundred and
7280 1-1 the reason I did it right the
actual number is because it's over 22
million digits so to just calculate this
number and store it in a variable in
Python we can put this power and apply
the formula 2 to the power of this 2 to
the power of this number minus 1 and you
can see it took a little bit of time
just to calculate this the way to test
these numbers is using the locus slimmer
test which uses the locus series which
is for 1432 7664 the way this series
works is you start by the number four
then you apply this formula so every
time you take the last value in the
series take it to the power 2 and
subtract two so if we start with the
number four which is one digit the next
number will be four to the power of
actually I can use s in here which is
the last one so the last one which is
four to the power of two minus 2 14 and
here i can put s again and calculate
that so that's 194 then 37,000
then
1.4 million at 1.4 billion then I can't
even pronounce this number actually the
largest one found so far is to the power
of 74 million which is takes a little
bit of time I'm actually using a
different formula to count how many
digits because if I wanted to use this
formula of converting the number to
string it would take hours to process
this number but it's 22 million digits
over to 22 million digits so the tests
were using is the the test is basically
we check the number in this we take our
Mersenne prime number n to the power 2
minus 1 if it's divided by the basically
corresponding number in the series minus
two so the number lower by the prime
number by two in the same series you
should get a remaining of 0 the problem
with the series it grows very large very
fast so if we want to go until 74
million does the number representing the
74 million position in this series it
will be a very very large number that we
cannot really handle but there is
another way to do this test which is
taking the remaining of each number and
using it for the next number so in here
i can calculate for example up to and i
can try the power of 61 and if i run
thus it will tell me surprise so if I
just uncomment these numbers it's
oh ok if I uncommon this it will tell me
each one of these numbers how many how
much time did it take and they're not
taking much time to process but if we
try the actual number that we want to
deal with and to test if it's a prime
number or not you would notice something
in here it goes really fast then you
will see the time it takes for each one
grows really fast so in here we're
already taking 300 milliseconds for
number 20 it grew to one point one
second then three seconds then the next
one is almost ten seconds I think the
next one is more than one minute so this
approach would not really work for us so
let's stop this we can use site on which
is a an implementation of a language
that uses context very close to where
close to python but it's really really
fast the way it works is really really
fast and it uses see libraries and it
converts this code to a very efficient C
code so in here let's try 61 again and
you can see it's returned Prime really
fast the problem with the using C is he
we have a limitation of 64-bit numbers
so if we go any numbered be on 64 and 2
to the power of 64 it will overflow so
we cannot really use regular Python to
you to do this code so in here i'm using
the GMP library which is a seed library
design to deal with very large numbers
I will not go into the into explaining
this code it's basically this code and
it's the same as the Python code but in
GNP library feel free to check out the
code the length of this is in the
description below and I run this code
with the same power and I run it for
almost 16 hours and i get to 17,000 so
this will take this will process almost
a thousand every hour so to process 74
million that will take very very long
time feel free to execute it on your
machine and try to get it it might take
you a month actually to process the
whole number but anyway that's the code
in GNP if you want to rent in your
machine I get to 17,000 and I had to
stop it to actually record this with you
anyway I hope you like this and if you
are interested in this code the this is
all available on github and so we have a
loo and B viewer the link to it is in
the description below thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
