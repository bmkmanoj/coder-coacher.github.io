about ipython notebooks it's an
interactive development environment and
this is the first part it's about not
books and sales once you start ipython
notebook instance or server you get a
screen similar to this where you can
view all your notebooks or start a new
one you can have multiple folders with
the other notebooks to organize your
work you can browse back to your main
folder you can check your running
instances from the second tab running
and the last tab you can activate your
per computing clusters for ipython and
in this tutorial we'll be covering the
basics of notebooks and sales so
notebooks are basically documents
representing all your input and output
operations this includes code text input
and numerical text rich media out with
like charts and audio/video these files
have the IP ymv extensions stands for
ipython notebook everything in an I
Python notebook is a cell so
this document that we're looking at is
an i5 enough hood and each one of these
ourselves we have them we can add new
Souls by clicking on insert yourself a
new cell by default is a code cell so
you can change the type of a cell from
here you can choose to be marked down
grow and be convert or one level of
heading from 1 6 let's cut this out so
starting by markdown cells this is a
markdown cell actually
it can contain markdown language like
that and it will render into this bold
and italic we can have HTML code and it
will render just fine and we can have
latex code and it will just render like
this section
you can check their code inside a
markdown cell by double-clicking on it
and you can ring directed back by
hitting shift enter so you get back to
the rendered view of the cell we have
code cells this might contain iPod a
Python code or - magic Python code can
be three plus five equals eight
we have multiple operations or returning
key values and we execute that cell will
only get the last result the result of
the last line in that cell so this will
return only eight which is three plus
five it will not return one plus two we
can have more code in here x equals 1 y
equals two we returning X plus y that's
three in here if we deleted this line
first if we executed this we're
basically assigning X plus y which is 3
to Z but that does not return anything
it's just an assignment statement
assigning this value to this variable so
it will not return I think so usually
when you have something like this we
want to it and we want to see the value
we'll just add the variable in the last
line which would return the value if we
have the variable at the last line for
some reason but we don't want the value
we can suppress output by adding a
semicolon and that will suppress the
output of the cell ipython magic will
discuss our pathum magic codes like this
as we go through this tutorial so we'll
look at the - now this will this code or
iPod magic will turn the cell into a
at terminal or bash script
sale so we can have any commands like LS
we can we're echoing something here
we're adding a new file we're listing
again we're echoing something here and
removing the file so let's see that it's
listing all files in the directory
creating a new file we can see the new
file then finally did it in the file the
second type of cells we the third type
of cells we have is wrong the raw and B
convert and it will not render anything
in it so if you try to render this it
will not render anything it will keep
marked down dimmable analytics the way
it is but the problem with it if you are
sharing this in an open in an open
source way through and B viewer this
will render some HTML and latex code it
doesn't trim their most markdown code
that it will render HTML and latex so
you cannot show your formula throat and
B viewer with an MBA around EE convert
so finally we have the heading sales we
use those to add chapters sections and
the categories our work the good thing
about these are you can add they they
all have bookmarks we can add a link to
a specific header with in your notebook
so you can direct someone to see for
example this so his browser will take
him to a certain heading within your
notebook if you want to refer someone to
hidden within your notebook from within
your notebook you just add the header
name as a bookmark like this if you want
an absolute link you can add an absolute
link with a heading at the end as a
bookmark URL this listen is available
open source on github and it's viewable
like this on mb viewer so you will see
the link down in the description where
you have this document as a reference if
you need it and thank you for watching
and if you like this I hope you
subscribe and you see the next part
about markdown and latex thank you for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
