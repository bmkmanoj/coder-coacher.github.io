tutorial about Jupiter this is the first
part and it will be an introduction to
the system if you're not familiar with
the ipython this is the third version of
ipython named Jupiter excuse me it's a
web-based interactive development
environment it supports multiple
languages like Julie octave Python and
are in alphabetical order to upgrade the
to the new version if you still have
version 1 or 2 you can update to the new
version with this commands do pepper
install upgrade and ipython make sure
you put double quotes and all because if
you're going to start it like this
pseudo pip install upgrade ipython you
might get terminal unavailable if you
want to start a new terminal inside
Jupiter which is one of the exciting new
features about you up there
enabling Python 3 we will be working in
here using a Python 3 kernel so to
enable Python 3 you have to run this
command so ipython 3
kernel specs install - self and that
will install the kernel for python 3 so
why is it called Jupiter anyway and it
represent planet Jupiter and three of
them three of the Galilean moons are
available in our visible and logo and
the name represents the new direction of
ipython development they are moving away
from linking the ipython platform with a
single language and the way it currently
works is as follow and I have to stress
this is just an estimation of the design
so there is an interface level you can
run a Python console not work ipython Qt
console and each one of these will
connect connect to a kernel
the thing we're interested in is the
ipython notebook
each ipython notebook will connect to a
separate kernel but they're all from the
same type so if you start an ipython
server with kernel with the Python 3
kernel all your notebooks will use that
kernel of course you can use magic but
that's a different thing but now with
the Jupiter and you can start a Jupiter
server and you can start a notebook q4i
pi for python 3 another notebook with
the Python 2 kernel are julia and other
kernels if you look in here at file new
not work you will see that i have few
kernels available for me so the name
came from julia Python and R so Jupiter
and this is not to indicate that Jupiter
only supports these languages but it's a
reference to a talk by Fernando Perez
the complete list has more than 15
languages so it supports more than 15
languages but there's another reason
Gallade documented his observations
about Jupiter's moons and published them
in the sidereus nuncius the starry
messenger back in 1610 which was a
pamphlet that he published this was the
first paper ever published though
astronomy that used observation using a
telescope and he has proven that Earth
orbits the Sun like Jupiter's moon orbit
Jupiter and these are his notebooks you
can see he has titles data points
observe drawings images explanation
reasoning and it's all there and this
was one of the first notebooks and this
is the you know this is what they are
trying to carry out in ipython
sharing these observations and
conclusions in a way that can be
replicated and verified inspired modern
scientific method this was this is what
ipython notebook is used for sharing the
complete process with others to verify
your process and replicate your results
so what's new with the version 3 version
3 will be the last monolithic release of
ipython so if you look at ipython you
have a lot of features that are ipython
specific and many features that can be
used for any kernel like the ipython
notebook format or or the whips with the
socket system to process your code in
the backend then return its back or a
lot of other things with an eye pattern
so they're trying to split the project
anti Python specific components and
language-like was agnostic components so
the new features are you can start
notebooks with different kernels from
the same server you can start a new text
file folder or a terminal session and
the text file means you can start
basically a any text-based file that can
be an XML file HTML Python or JavaScript
anything you need and it has
highlighting for all of these languages
second thing is Unicode identifier this
works with the Python 3 and Julia before
you used to have to copy and paste your
codes from somewhere and now we can just
type backslash alpha also alpha and
press tab and it will change that into
an alpha side you can get any of the
Greek letters you can get a small or
capital letter by changing the first
letter from lambda to lambda you get
small and capital lambda and and if your
this is one thing I noticed some of the
characters are not monospaced so this
one is a little thinner than one
monospace and this one is a little
larger than one monospace might make
your code a little and organized so
that's one thing to watch out for and
you can use this as a part of a variable
name circuit code for example I don't
know SVM alpha or something there is no
stream but anyway you get the point
widgets are not backward-compatible I
will be recording a specific tutorial a
separate tutorial for for working with
widgets and ipython 3 but this is a
linked for migrating your current called
width widgets no other cells if you
start a header cell now it will just
make a markdown so but the good thing
you can just use markdown code ahem
hidden code inside your macadam cell and
it will still create this beautiful mark
bookmark link to it text editor then
it's a multilingual text editor but
let's jump it to the system to see that
in here this is the new interface for
the file browser you can see that we can
click on something to duplicate rename
shutdown or delete the file if you click
on you you will see a list of things
that I have I can start text file folder
terminal or some or any notebook with
with these kernels so for the text
editor I will be opening this file it's
um it's just an HTML file it doesn't
have much in it
it's just have two fields and some Ajax
code to send some data to the server and
written receive some results and show
them the the nice thing the it will
highlight the document according to the
extension of the file and it has support
for so many programming and scripting
languages in here so that's a good new
feature one last thing you might notice
that we have all kinds of files showing
up now so before it used to show only
folders and notebooks now you can see
other files and open them in the text
editor a static file server
you can serve static files basically any
file that's in your notebook folder can
be served as a static file including
your notebooks
which something that we have to watch
out for and due to the fact there is a
static file server in an educator it's
advice that you use HTTPS even if you
are running on a local server but the
upside you can start with exploring some
data and end up with running web based
application without ever leaving the
Jupiter environment you might not want
to use this static server for production
but it's perfect for development and I
will demonstrate this this is my file I
can serve it as a static file but just
by changing edit and two files and I can
see my file in here I can use it to send
2+3 calculate equals five and that's all
done within the Jupiter environment I
didn't have to use any third-party tool
to do
that there's a belt internal actually
this calculation is being done in a
flask web service and I'm running the
web service from within the Jupiter
environment using the new feature of
terminal sessions and the nice thing I
can watch all my things now from a
single place so I see all my terminals
in here I know my web service is running
and I can check my Python code my HTML
code all from the same place the last
thing is Jupiter Drive you can share
Jupiter notebooks from Google Drive
using the new Jupiter Drive this allows
you to share Jupiter notebooks like MB
viewer with all with all the access
control that Google provides so you can
share notebooks with specific people or
lived in public so we can have this kind
of access control you can also install
Jupiter Drive locally this allows you to
access notebooks on your Google Drive or
other notebooks shared with you it also
allows you to access notebooks on your
local machine so it will be an
environment that you can work with them
things from your Google Drive or things
share it with you to work or something
or things on your local Drive so to see
that and that's my Google Drive I can
have you i Python notebooks in here if I
double click on this one I get connected
app you have to connect the Jupiter
collaboratory app to do that but once
you click on this it will open the
notebook for you
you can edit the notebook from here you
can add new code or or markdown sales
you can edit your code you can edit your
markdown code and save and it will save
it directly into your
um Google Drive basically this tutorial
is available open source on github and
it's viewable on MB viewer feel free to
use any of this code for any purpose you
have I hope you like this tutorial and
if you did please subscribe to this
channel and you can watch the next part
of this series which will be about
markdown analytic if you're still stuck
with version 2 I first I advise you to
upgrade to version 3 but if you're still
stuck with version 2
there is another tutorial about version
2 by clicking in here thank you for
watching and I hope to see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
