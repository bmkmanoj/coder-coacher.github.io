series about machine learning I've been
trying to do series to introduce this
technology in a simple way and I've been
struggling to find the right setup for
everyone to actually do the work I've
tried to make some kind of a virtual
machine and it was just too large to
make it available online for people to
download I tried to I tried a few
approaches and they were not that
successful but finally I found a simpler
way to make everyone participate using
Amazon Web Services AWS
so what is machine learning actually
using that instead of logic to teach a
computer to perform tasks so if we take
an example of face detection and instead
of writing the logic to define how to
detect a face what is the face its eyes
and nose and mouth and how to describe
them to a computer instead of doing that
we use a lot of faces and we feed it to
an algorithm that finds what's common
between faces and learns to find other
faces later that's actually implemented
in your phone once you open the cover on
your phone your side you'll see a little
box so our learning faces that's face
detection using machine learning working
on your phone so let's jump into the
system and see how can we set up our
environment so this lesson will be about
setting up the environment this is
the hard part we have to go through the
basic things so we can get our
environment running and then we can
start doing some of the more fun things
basically what we learn in this lesson
is how to deal with AWS Amazon Web
Services as a platform we will learn the
basics of programming in Python we will
learn the basics of our IDE which will
which is ipython notebooks we will learn
we learn few functions from two
libraries
numpy and pandas and finally we will go
through administration monitoring with
urgentiy which is included in this image
thanks to a gently for giving us the
ability to include their product in our
image free of charge actually so shout
out to them let's start with creating
our image you will be using Amazon Web
Services go to aws.amazon.com
if you don't have an account open one
and we can you can have a you can open a
free account so let's do that
once we're there we'd go to my account
console and open AWS management console
once you're there you'll see a lot of
services the one that we will be using
is called ec2
and click on launch instance once you're
in launch instance go to community ma am
is and then look for ipython notebook
server i uploaded this am i made it
public it has all the tools that we will
need to start with the machine learning
so let's select this ami for all
purposes of going through this tutorial
i will be using you can use the micro
instance which is part of the free tier
you can you have 750 hours of free
access to this instance so you basically
can have 4 running instances for the
complete month for free and this is
available for the first 12 months of
your account signup per date and so we
will go with the the micro instance and
we don't have to go through every step
will just click review and launch one
thing we have to change is once we go
down will see security groups and under
security groups we see that we have only
one port open and our firewall to SSH
access and we need actually to open a
couple of more ports so I click on edit
and once you're here click Add rule add
rule and open both ports 80 80 and port
8000
make sure it's anywhere source so you
make sure you can access it click again
on review and launch then launch if you
already have if you already have a key
you can use your key if you don't have
one if you have a new account and you
don't have a key yet create a new key
give it a name download the file
it's a PM file and we will not use it in
this lesson but you need to download it
and keep it so you can use it later to
access SSH for the time being I'll use
my existing key I will acknowledge that
I cannot access my instance without
having the key and I will launch the
instance I can go to view instances
and this is the new instance that's
initializing right now I will name it so
I can access it an identified later
easily I will name it lesson one and
save in here you will see the status of
all your instances that's running at the
system if you have one right now
just wait for status check to finish
initial are initializing you can access
your instance by going to this IP we
open two ports 8080 and 8,000 but we
will start with port 8080 so I will open
new tab and we'll paste our IP column
8080
and now we have successfully launched or
on server with all the tools that we
need to do machine learning operations
the password the default password that
comes with the system is Russia and so
it's our Oh sh am Roshan and again and
it comes would with the few lessons in
the system but the only complete lesson
right now is less than one so we'll open
that
it might take a few seconds to load
because it's a big file and your browser
might take some time to render and
download all the content of the page but
anyway once it's up we have access to
our on Amazon s Tammuz own web service
instance where we can do machine
learning operations basically an
alternative setup is to do a local setup
I advise people to use Ubuntu on over
here on a virtual machine and install
Python dev Python pepp ipython and numpy
scifi actually few more would be pandas
and scaler and start your instance of
ipython just type ipython notebook but
this approach is much easier I might
record something later on how to on how
to set up your own local environment if
if someone actually demanded that but
anyway now we have our environment the
first thing to actually learn is Python
will be going through Python I would
learn just the basics but if you want to
really get into Python I advise you to
go through this book it's 50 chapters
it's really a quick read and you will
very much enjoy going through this book
so
let's start examining some code we have
where we can assign variables without
declaring them in Python so we don't
have to declare a variable before we use
it so we can say X equals 10 y equals 5
Z equals x plus y and prints it that
will print 15 to execute anything inside
your code cells press shift and enter
shift and enter we'll execute the code
inside your code so an alternative way
is to go to through cell and run and
that will run yourself another type of
variables that we have in Python strings
so if we have war 2 equals hello word
word 1 equals hello or 2 equals Python
and sentence equals word 1 plus space
plus war 2 then we print sentence we get
hello by them so let's do the math
variables that we defined in a previous
code cell will still be accessible and
other code cells so if we define the x
and y in here we can still access them
in here and another cell so we have X
plus y X minus y x x y or x y and x
divided by y and once we execute that we
get 15 550 and - another thing that we
have to know is string formatting and we
use percentages to have a placeholder
for a string inside our string so we can
insert another string value there so we
can say just hello as
base percentage sinus and save that into
a variable called template then we can
print template percentage and we pass
the second string to template which will
replace percentages so the output of
that would be also
hello Python where Python was replaced
in template we're printing actually
template and replacing the percentages
using percentage then passing the word
Python you can you can definitely change
things here and try other things you can
change hello - hi and execute that and
you'll get type out them so you can
change code and test ideas as we go you
don't have to do the same exact things
that I did so let's use string
formatting to improve the math results
we get here we get here 15 5 2050 and 2
and we have to say like 1 2 3 that's 1 2
3 that's multiplied so 50 is multiplied
so let's start by trying to replicate
this add result and we have a
placeholder for string and we're passing
an x + y subtract result and we have a
string placeholder then we're passing x
- y with multiply we're passing x times
y with divide or passing x / y so we can
also execute this we'll get our results
add result subtract results result
multiply result and divide result and we
can know H number
what kind of result is it we can pass
multiple parameters to a string so if we
have a template that has one two three
four and placeholders so we have so
basically one to replicate this it's the
ten plus five equals fifteen ten minus
five equals five ten times five equals
50 10 divided by 5 equals two so we want
to have a place for the first number
place for the operation a place for the
second number and find that a place for
the result and this is what our template
does here it has four places the first
number operation second number and
result to pass multiple variables to a
string we use brackets and put commas
between our variables so we go print
template X comma Plus which is a string
comma Y comma and finally the result of
X plus y then X minus y but and passing
a negative in here or as a subtract X
times y the right operation X divided by
Y and passing the right operation and
that generates this result one more
concept that we have to go through and
we can have multiple values in one
variable or one object here we have
lists we have tuples and we have
dictionaries lists and tuples basically
do the same thing can not exactly but we
will not get into the technical details
of the
the differences between them but you
need to know about them we you need to
know there are lists and tuples in
Python the last one would be
dictionaries where we not only store
single values like 1 2 3 4 5 but we can
have pairs of key and values for each
for each item in our dictionary so it
can be for example each employees name
and then there or each employees ID and
their name it can be any pair of values
basically it can describe a single
person like it has one key for name then
his name then for example age and his
age and gender and their gender blah
blah blah so let's see how do they work
we defined a list we defined a tuple and
a dictionary in here and we will be
printing few things about them first
we'll be printing the list we'll just
pass the list to a string for strength
using formatting then we'll be will be
measuring the length of that list using
the function Len so Len and then the
name of the our our list which is
numbers list we'll will generate the
length of that list we can access
individual items inside our list by
specifying their index inside the list
their index start with 0 so the index of
this one is 0 and the index of the last
one is 4 but
we can access the first item easily by
saying zero and instead of measuring the
length of the list to access the last
item we can use negative indexes
negative indexes would start from the
last value so minus one represents this
number minus 2 minus 3 minus 4 and minus
5 tuple is basically working the same
way
and finally dictionaries they we can
still access their values by using the
method values which returns a list of
values inside the dictionary we can
access their values with values and we
can access their keys with keys so if we
change this into keys we'll get the keys
of the first key and the last key of
this list because denim because this is
the same that doesn't make any sense so
I'll just change this one to 66 for
example so if we use values we would get
the first item 66 and if we use keys
we'll get our first item as one which is
the key of the first item and the second
thing that that we want to get into is
ipython notebooks and up to here we have
went through the main concepts and ideas
of Python we'll still have to learn how
to do loops and if conditioning other
things that we will learn as we need
actually so we don't have to go through
every aspect of the language in the
first lesson but the second thing that
we will be learning about is ipython
notebooks ipython notebooks is basically
a development environment and that we
that we're actually working with right
now this actual lesson is inside an
ipython notebook so this is what we want
to learn how to use this environment
ipython notebook allows us to have very
interactive development environment as
we see we can change things and we get
instant results the second thing that we
that we have in here is latex which
allows us to format functions in a more
readable way so instead of this we can
have this using latex you can actually
double click on in here and see the
actual code that I use to write this
function
there is a wiki page for latex language
so if you need to make your functions
very readable to non-programmers you can
go through the latex wiki and learn how
to do every trick to make your functions
more readable I spent two time talking
about this too much time anyway
it allows us to work with the charts a
great place to start with and to have as
a reference and it's just an awesome
place to go to is this link the gallery
of multiplet not what lip it has so many
ideas and charts they're all open source
you can go to any of them and learn how
did they do that very specific chart so
if you're interested for example and
making this chart you can see the code
in here and know exactly how did they
write this chart and the chart the code
is there for every chart in the gallery
you can copy basically this code paste
it in ipython notebook head shift and
enter and execute it and you will get
this chart
so how to work with charts first thing
we need to do is import the mat plot Lib
library this is a line that you we will
be using almost in every and every
lesson import matplotlib that PI plot as
P of T so we're importing this module
from this library and we are giving it a
short cut name as PLT so whenever we
want to reference this will just
reference it as PLT so let's see how
does that work we have X as a list it
has one two three four five then Y with
the three two five zero one and first
we'll we'll go with the PLT that scatter
this will scatter x and y and to know
the format of before we scatter actually
were plotted to know how to use any
function and ipython hitch shift and tab
and you will get this really cool help
that it's the dark string of the
function basically it's a little help to
give you information about this specific
function so once we want to execute this
cell
we'll hit shift and enter again and we
will get our chart basically it's
plotted X over Y X was 1 2 3 4 5 y was 3
2 5 0 1 so we can have our charts in
line and we can visualize our data
within our development environment which
is
we can scatter so scattering X over Y
will give us three to five zero one
again and we can add extra parameters to
scatter see four four color and I will
make C equals two Y so the higher the
number the colors will change
accordingly introducing one more thing
is marker we can use the parameter
marker to change the markers in our
scatter the complete list is available
in this URL and s for size you can or
scale actually you can scale your
markers up or down so we can say for
example we want to make it 800 and this
will generate bigger stars if we go with
80 that will generate much smaller stars
well this is a teaser for a 3d chart
using matplotlib which is this I will
not be discussing how to build this
chart it's available in the gallery if
you go to the gallery of matplotlib and
scroll down to 3d mat plot 3d you will
find this example in here and you will
find a lot of other really nice examples
to work with but we will not be
discussing this specific technique today
and two more tools that we'll be working
with our numpy and pandas they're very
powerful libraries for Python to deal
with large amount of numbers so to
multiply 2 by 10 is 20 that's simple but
to multiply a list with
100,000 numbers by in a very list that
that is another hundred thousand numbers
and we need to multiply each
corresponding numbers and get the result
of that that might be a very
time-consuming process using pure Python
so once we're dead once we are dealing
with large numbers we will be using
numpy and pandas as we imported the
charting library before matplotlib will
import numpy and pandas numpy as NP and
pandas as pd always try to create
shortcuts for your libraries because
everyone else uses those short handles
to access the libraries so your code
will be very compatible with other
people that you might be working with
one important function that we use is
arranged it generates an array we can
specify starting number ending number or
just an ending number so in here we
created an array of 100 numbers it
starts with 0 and ends with 100 we will
use another function called reshape to
reshape this to reshape this array into
a 10 by 10 so instead of being 1 by 100
it will be 10 by 10 and this is all this
is all actually an amp I will be using a
very important object and pandas called
the data frame it represents basically a
table but it's a very powerful and fast
table that you can work with and you
will be fine you'll be finding a lot of
people working with the pandas dataframe
for really large amounts of
numbers so to define a data frame we can
pass our
numpy array to the data frame and it
will take into that array and convert it
into a data frame and we stored it as DF
short for data frame then we're printing
the data frame just to visualize it so
these are keys the first column in here
and the FIR the first row are keys so
the key of the first column is 0 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 the same for the rows and
it tells us that it's 10 by 10 rows and
columns let's see how can we perform
some operations on on our data frame so
we can access the first column which is
sorry the second column which is column
number 1 - D F of 1 0 which is the first
column so it's subtracting the first
column from the second column and that
would be 1 - 0 which is 1 11 - 10 which
is 121 minus 1 which is 1 so we can see
the result is going to be 1 for all for
all values in here then we're adding
them together and getting the results we
can multiply and you can do all kinds of
operations and we will get really fast
results using pandas one more thing that
we use pandas for is to read comma
separated value files we can it treats
files from the local system which is
located on
Amazon instance and it can fetch a
comma-separated value from the internet
directly so let's see how can we upload
a file first into our system and see how
can we read it to upload file into the
system we'll be using our administration
watering tool agente to access a gently
go to http your IP column 8000 so let's
open this it tells us that there is
nothing called your IP or DNS so let's
copy our IP and paste it here make sure
we paste it over the complete ward and
hit enter it will give you a warning
depending on your browser you might see
a different screen telling you that this
product is using a certificate that's
not verified there or not signed by
someone who's verified so just add an
exception for this it will basically
protect you sending passwords over the
Internet but this is a very safe way to
do it but the license is free so it's
not signed by a verified source and to
the GaN to log into into agenting we
will use username root and password
admin make sure you change your username
at least change your password after you
log in the first thing you do after you
log in you want to change your password
this is very very critical this is very
very critical go to password and change
your password put admin in here and put
something else and
make sure you do that you don't want to
have your identity axis available to
everyone on the internet unless you have
protected yourself with firewall and
specified your exact IP but that would
be a much harder approach and if you're
ready to go through the trouble of
changing that I think it would be much
more beneficial to change just the
password in here - anyway - to up to
access our file system we'll go to file
manager on our file manager this will
access our main storage of the system
all our files are stored inside home
then
Ubuntu and everything you're working
with including your ipython notebooks
are available in here you will see a lot
of hidden files that the system uses to
do one a pressure another the last the
important one is the data folder open
the data folder and you can upload a you
can upload a comma-separated value file
into your system you can have one from
work or download the sample one from the
enter in it with some numbers to upload
it into the system it can be stock
prices can be something scientific it
can be the NASA exoplanet format it can
be whatever you want it to be whatever
you're working with and you can upload a
file into the system and this way you
will have it stored into the system and
you can access it later
to do some machine learning processes
with it
to read files that we uploaded into the
system we use pandas so PD again dot
read CSV which is short for comma
separated value and then go double code
data forward slash then your file name
so whatever the file that you uploaded
you want to access it if you want to
access the data and load it you can
access the data later on CSV underscore
data you can change that with a URL to
where a file exists on the internet or
it might be an API that generates comma
separated value results and you can
fetch that directly from your pandas and
have it loaded into the system where you
can process it and do so many wonderful
things with it this is the end of lesson
one I hope you enjoyed it and let me
know if this is clear and if you have
any questions cave keep it in the
comments below and I hope to see you
next time
