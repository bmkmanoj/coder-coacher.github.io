tip about pickling objects saving your
data and model is very handy to continue
your work on in-memory object over a
long time or multiple processes so let's
start by importing few libraries I'm
importing pandas as PD I'm importing
Canaan classifier and I'm importing job
lip from a scaler and that externals so
I'll execute that I'm loading a data set
and putting it and in a data frame in a
panda's data frame I named the columns
and I have 4,000 almost 4,000 4,000 177
rows and 9 columns so I would let train
a quick a quick model in here a trend
model and here I specified all columns
except sex as features I defined a
dictionary to convert the strength of
male female and infants to numbers then
I mapped that with column 6 in a new
list for results and executed that here
I'm training a quick model caning
classifier a text features and results
and trains a model and returns my
trained model I might need to work on
that for for some other time
some models take very long time to train
so you don't want to redo that every
time you want to use your model so the
way to save that is in pickle format and
there's an easy way to do it with the
dump function from job lip so I'm
dumping CSV data as data that piqué
piqué l which is short for pickle and
damping also my trend model as model
that PK
execute that now I'm just gonna list
what I have in my directory and I can
see my data pickle file in here it
spread the file over multiple files and
it spread off my model over multiple
files so if I need to transfer this
model to someone else I need I need
centered someone else I'll have to send
him all the files that represent this
object and if I need to send someone my
trend model I will have to send him all
these files
finally to load an object that he
received on a pickle file used load so
job let that load and just mention the
file name and here I'm loading back my
data model so I can take a look at my
loaded data I can confirm that it has
the same number of rows and columns and
I can retrieve back my trend model this
tutorial is available on github open
source and is viewable on MV viewer the
