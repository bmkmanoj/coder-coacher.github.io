series about machine learning I've been
trying to do series to introduce this
technology in a simple way and I've been
struggling to find the right setup for
everyone to actually do the work I've
tried to make some kind of a virtual
machine and it was just too large to
make it available online for people to
download it I tried to I tried a few
approaches and they were not that
successful but finally I found a simpler
way to make everyone participate using
Amazon Web Services AWS so what is
machine learning actually using that
instead of logic to teach a computer to
perform tasks so if we take an example
of face detection instead of writing the
logic to define how to detect a face
what is the face its eyes and nose and
mouth and how to describe them to a
computer instead of doing that we use a
lot of faces and we feed it to an
algorithm that finds what's common
between faces and learns to find other
faces later that's actually implemented
in your phone once you open the camera
in your phone you'll see you'll see a
little box surrounding faces that's face
detection music machine learning working
on your phone so let's jump into the
system and see how can we set up our
environment so this lesson will be about
setting up the environment this is
the hard part we have to go through the
basic things so we can get our
environment running and then we can
start doing some of the more fun things
basically what we learn in this lesson
is how to deal with AWS Amazon Web
Services as a platform we will learn the
basics of programming in Python we will
learn the basics of our IDE which will
which is ipython notebooks we will learn
we learn few functions from two
libraries
numpy and pandas and finally we will go
through administration monitoring with
identity which is included in this image
thanks to a gently for giving us the
ability to include their product in our
image free of charge actually so shout
out to them let's start with creating
our image you will be using Amazon Web
Services go to aws.amazon.com if you
don't have an account open one we can
you can have a you can open a free
account so let's do that
once we're there we'd go to my account
console and open AWS management console
once you're there you'll see a lot of
services the one that we will be using
is called
ec2
click on launch instance once you're in
launch instance go to community ma a.m.
eyes and then look for ipython notebook
server I uploaded this ami made it
public it has all the tools that we will
need to start with the machine learning
so let's select this ami for all
purposes of going through this tutorial
I will be using you can use the micro
instance which is part of the free tier
you can you have 750 hours of free
access to this instance so you basically
can have 4 running instances for the
complete month for free and this is
available for the first 12 months of
your account signup date so we will go
with the micro instance and we don't
have to go through every step will just
click review and launch one thing we
have to change is once we go down we'll
see security groups and under security
groups we see that we have only one port
open and our firewall to SSH access and
we need actually to open a couple of
more ports so I click on edit and once
you're here click Add rule add row' and
open both ports 80 80 and port 8000 make
sure it's anywhere source so you make
sure you can
access it click again on review and
launch then launch if you already have
if you already have a key you can use
your key if you don't have one if you
have a new account and you don't have a
key yet create a new key give it a name
download the file
it's a PM file and we will not use it in
this lesson but you need to download it
and keep it so you can use it later to
access SSH for the time being use my
existing key I will acknowledge that I
cannot access my instance without having
the key and our large distance I can go
to view instances
and this is the new instance that's
initializing right now I will name it so
I can access it an identified later
easily I will name it lesson one and
save in here you will see the status of
all your instances that's running at the
system if you have one right now
just wait for status check to finish
initial are initializing you can access
your instance by going to this IP we
open two ports 8080 and a thousand but
we will start with port 8080 so we'll
open new tab and we will paste our IP
column 8080
and now we have successfully launched or
on server with all the tools that we
need to do machine learning operations
the password the default password that
comes with the system is Russia and so
it's our Oh sh am Roshan and again it
comes with with the few lessons in the
system but the only complete lesson
right now is less than one so we'll open
that
it might take a few seconds to load
because it's a big file and your browser
might take some time to render and
download all the content of the page but
anyway once it's up we have access to
our on amazon and amazon web service
instance where we can do machine
learning operations basically an
alternative setup is to do a local setup
I advise people to use Ubuntu on /
on a virtual machine and install Python
dev Python pep ipython numpy Sipe i
actually few more would be pandas and
scaler and start your instance of
ipython just type ipython notebook but
this approach is much easier I might
record something later on how to on how
to set up your own local environment if
if someone actually demanded that but
anyway now we have our environment the
first thing to actually learn is Python
will be going through Python I would
learn just the basics but if you want to
really get into Python I advise you to
go through this book it's 50 chapters
it's really quick read and you will very
much enjoy going through with this book
so
let's start examining some code we have
where we can assign variables without
declaring them in Python so we don't
have to declare a variable before we use
it so we can say X equals 10 y equals 5
Z equals x plus y and prints it that
will print 15 to execute anything in
inside your code cells press Shift +
Enter
Shift + Enter will execute the code
inside your code cell an alternative way
is to go to through cell and run and
that will run yourself another type of
variables that we have in Python is
strings so if we have war 2 equals hello
word word 1 equals hello or 2 equals
Python and sentence equals word 1 plus
space plus war 2 then we print sentence
we get hello Python so let's do some
math variables that we defined in the
previous code cell will still be
accessible and other code cells so if we
define the x and y in here
we can still access them in here and
another cell so we have X plus y X minus
y x x y or x y and x / y and once we
execute that we get 15 550 and - another
thing that we have to know is string
formatting we use percentages to have a
placeholder for a string inside our
string so we can insert another string
value there so we can say just hello
that's
base percentage sinus and save that into
a variable called template then we can
print template percentage and we pass
the second string to template which will
replace percentages so the output of
that would be also
hello Python where Python was replaced
in template we're printing actually
template and replacing the percentages
using percentage then passing the word
Python you can you can definitely change
things here and try other things you can
change hello - hi and execute that and
you'll get ipython
so you can change code and test ideas as
we go you don't have to do the same
exact things that I did so let's use
string formatting to improve them after
results we get here we get here 15 5
2050 and 2 and we have to say like 1 2 3
that's 1 2 3 that's multiplied so 50 is
multiplied so let's start by trying to
replicate this add result and we have a
placeholder for a string and we're
passing X plus y subtract result and we
have a strength placeholder then we're
passing X minus y with multiply who are
passing X times y with divided we are
passing X divided by Y so we can also
execute this we'll get our results add
result subtract results result multiply
result and divide result and we can know
each number
what kind of result is it we can pass
multiple parameters to a string so if we
have a template that has one two three
four placeholders so we have so
basically one to replicate this it's ten
plus five equals fifteen ten minus five
equals five ten times five equals 50 10
divided by 5 equals 2 so we want to have
a place for the first number place for
the operation a place for the second
number and find out a place for the
result and this is what our template
does here it has four places the first
number operation second number and
result to pass multiple variables to a
string we use brackets and put commas
between our variables so we go print
template X comma Plus which is a string
comma Y comma and finally the result of
X plus y then X minus y but and passing
negative in here or as a subtract X
times y the right operation X divided by
Y and passing the right operation and
that generates this result one more
concept that we have to go through we
can have multiple values in one variable
or one object here we have lists we have
tuples and we have dictionaries lists
and tuples basically do the same thing
can
exactly but we will not get into the
technical details of the differences
between them but you need to know about
them we you need to know there are lists
and tuples in Python the last one would
be dictionaries where we not only store
single values like one two three four
five
but we can have pairs of key and values
for each for each item in our dictionary
so it can be for example each employees
name and then there or each employees ID
and their name it can be any pair of
values basically it can describe a
single person like it has one key for
name then his name then for example age
and his age and gender and their gender
blah blah blah so let's see how do they
work we defined a list we defined a
tuple and a dictionary in here and we
will be printing few things about them
first we'll be printing the list we'll
just pass the list to a string for
strength using the formatting then we'll
be we'll be measuring the length of that
list using the function Len so Len then
the name of the our our list which is
numbers list we'll will generate the
length of that list we can access
individual items inside our list by
specifying their index inside the list
their index start with 0 so the index of
this one is 0 and the index of the last
one is 4
but we can access the first item easily
by saying zero and instead of measuring
the length of the list to access the
last item we can use negative indexes
negative indexes would start from the
last value so minus one represents this
number minus 2 minus 3 minus 4 and minus
5 tuple is basically working the same
way and finally dictionaries they we can
still access their values by using the
method values which returns a list of
values inside the dictionary we can
access their values with values and we
can access their keys with keys so if we
change this into T's we will get the
keys of the first key and the last key
of this list because tenem because this
is the same that doesn't make any sense
so I'll just change this one to 66 for
example so if we use values we would get
first item 66 and if we use keys
we'll get our first item as one which is
the key of the first item the second
thing that that we want to get into is
ipython that works up to here we have
went through the main concepts and ideas
of Python we'll still have to learn how
to do loops and if conditioning and
other things that we will learn as we
need actually so we don't have to go
through every aspect of the language in
the first lesson but the second thing
that we will be learning about is
ipython notebooks ipython notebooks is
basically a development environment that
we that we're actually working with
right now this actual lesson is inside
an ipython notebook so this is what we
want to learn how to use this
environment ipython notebook allows us
to have very interactive development
environment as we see we can change
things and we get instant results the
second thing that we that we have in
here is latex which allows us to format
functions in a more readable way so
instead of this we can have this using
latex you can actually double click on
in here and see the actual code that I
used to write this function
there is a wiki page for latex language
so if you need to make your functions
very readable to non-programmers you can
go through the latex wiki and learn how
to do every trick to make your functions
more readable I spent two time talking
about this too much time anyway it
allows us to work with the charts a
great place to start with and to have as
reference and it's just an awesome place
to go to is this link the gallery of
multiplet not what lip it has so many
ideas and charts they're all open source
you can go to any of them and learn how
did they do that very specific chart so
if you're interested for example and
making this chart you can see the code
in here and know exactly how did they
write this chart and the chart the code
is there for every chart in the gallery
you can copy basically this code paste
it in ipython notebook head shift and
enter and execute it and you will get
this chart
so how to work with charts first thing
we need to do is import the mat plot Lib
library this is a line that you we will
be using almost in every and every
lesson import matplotlib that PI plot as
P of T so we're importing this module
from this library and we're giving it a
short cut name as P of T so whenever we
want to reference this will just
reference it as P of T so let's see how
does that work we have X as a list it
has 1 2 3 4 5 then Y with the 3 2 5 0 1
first we'll we'll go with the P of P
that scatter this will scatter X&amp;amp;Y to
know the format of before we scatter
actually were plotted to know how to use
any function and ipython hich Shift +
tab and you will get this really cool
help that it's the dark string of the
function basically it's a little help to
give you information about this specific
function so once we want to execute this
cell we'll hit shift and enter again and
we will get our chart basically it's
plotted X over Y X was 1 2 3 4 5 y was 3
2 5 0 1 so we can have our charts in
line and we can visualize our data
within our development environment which
is
we can scatter so scattering X over Y
will give us three to five zero one
again we can add extra parameters to
scatter see four four color and I will
make C equals to Y so the higher the
number the colors will change
accordingly introducing one more thing
is marker we can use the parameter
marker to change the markers in our
scatter the complete list is available
in this URL and s4 sighs you can't or
scale actually you can scale your
markers up or down so we can say for
example we want to make it 800 and this
will generate bigger stars if we go with
80 that will generate much smaller stars
well this is a teaser for a 3d chart
using matplotlib which is this I will
not be discussing how to build this
chart it's available in the gallery if
you go to the gallery of matplotlib and
scroll down to 3d mat plot 3d you will
find this example in here and you will
find a lot of other really nice examples
to work with but we will not be
discussing this specific technique today
two more tools that we'll be working
with are numpy and pandas they're very
powerful libraries for python to deal
with large amount of numbers so to
multiply
two by 10 is 20 that's simple but to
multiply a list with hundred thousand
numbers by in a very list that that is
another hundred thousand numbers and we
need to multiply each corresponding
numbers and get the result of that that
might be a very time-consuming process
using pure Python so once we're World'd
once we are dealing with large numbers
we will be using numpy and pandas as we
imported the charting library before
matplotlib will import numpy and pandas
numpy as NP and pandas as pd always try
to create shortcuts for your libraries
because everyone else uses those short
handles to access to libraries so your
code will be very compatible with other
people that you might be working with
one important function that we use is
arranged
it generates an array we can specify
starting number ending number or just an
ending number so in here we created an
array of 100 numbers it starts with 0
and ends with 100 we will use another
function called reshape to reshape this
to reshape this array into a 10 by 10 so
instead of being 1 by 100 it will be 10
by 10 and this is all this is all
actually an amp I will be using a very
important object and pandas called data
frame it represents basically a table
but it's a very powerful and fast table
that you can work with and you will be
fine you'll be finding a lot of
people working with pandas dataframe for
really large amounts of numbers so to
define a data frame we can pass our
numpy array to the data frame and it
will take into that array and convert it
into a data frame and we stored it as DF
short for a data frame then we are
printing the data frame just to
visualize it so these are keys the first
column in here and the FIR the first row
are keys so the key of the first column
is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 the same for
the rows and it tells us that it's 10 by
10 rows and columns let's see how can we
perform some operations on one our data
frame so we can access the first column
which is sorry the second column which
is column number 1 - D F of 1 0 which is
the first column so it's subtracting the
first column from the second column and
that would be 1 - 0 which is 1 11 - 10
which is 121 minus 1 which is 1 so we
can see the result is going to be 1 for
all for all values in here then we're
adding them together and getting the
results we can multiply and you can do
all kinds of operations and we will get
really fast results using pandas one
more thing that we use pandas for is to
read comma separated value files
we can treats files from the local
system which is located on Amazon
instance and it can fetch a
comma-separated value from the internet
directly so let's see how can we upload
a file first into our system and see how
can we read it to upload file into the
system we'll be using our administration
muttering tool agente to access urgently
go to http your IP column 8000 so let's
open this it tells us that there is
nothing called your IP or DNS so let's
copy our IP and paste it here make sure
you paste it over the complete word and
hit enter it will give you a warning
depending on your browser you might see
a different screen telling you that this
product is using a certificate that's
not verified or not signed by someone
who's verified so just add an exception
for this it will basically protect you
sending passwords over the internet but
this is a very safe way to do it but the
license is free so it's not signed by a
verified source to regard to log into
into urgentiy we will use username root
and password admin make sure you change
your user name
at least change your password after you
log on the first thing you do after you
logon you want to change your password
this is very very critical this is very
very critical go to password and change
your password put admin in here and put
something else and save make sure you do
that you don't want to have your
identity access available to everyone on
the internet unless you have protected
yourself with firewall and specified
your exact IP but that would be a much
harder approach and if you're ready to
go through the trouble of changing that
I think it would be much more beneficial
to change just password than here -
anyway - to up to access our file system
we'll go to file manager on our file
manager this will access our main
storage of the system all our files are
stored inside home then Ubuntu
everything you're working with including
your ipython notebooks are available in
here you will see a lot of hidden files
that the system uses to do one a
pressure and another the last important
one is the data folder open the data
folder and you can upload a you can
upload a comma-separated value file into
your system you can have one from work
or download the sample one from the
internet with some numbers to upload it
into the system it can be stock prices
it can be something scientific it can be
the NASA exoplanet format it can be
whatever you want it to be whatever
you're working with and you can upload a
file into the system and this way you'll
have it stored into the system and you
can access it later to do some machine
learning processes with it to read files
that we uploaded into the system we use
pandas so PD again dot read CSV which is
short for kind of separated value and
then go double code data forward slash
then your file name so whatever the file
that you uploaded you want to access it
if you want to access the data and load
it you can access the data later on CSV
underscore data you can change that with
a URL to where a file exists on the
internet or it might be an API that
generates comma separated value results
and you can fetch that directly from
your pandas and have it loaded into the
system where you can process it and do
so many wonderful things
with it this is the end of lesson 1 I
hope you enjoyed it and let me know if
this is clear and if you have any
questions give keep it in the comments
below
and I hope to see you next time thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
