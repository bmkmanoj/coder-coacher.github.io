announce the latter lower public server
it's a free server that runs our
software I'll go agent alga agent is an
algorithm breast trading platform the
purpose of the systems to help traders
make the right choices investing their
capital whether you're looking for a
short term or long term investment this
platform can help can be helpful to do
at your toolkit and this is a limited
server and currently I have nine
registered users on the server and it's
limited to only 50 users so 41 more
seats are available just click on sign
up and fill the form and you will be
logged into the system I already have a
user in the system so I will look in
with my user account what's your logged
in it will be on your main page you can
access your portfolio which will have
four stocks you can search for available
stocks in the system currently we have
four available stocks of the system and
you can and they're all added to your
portfolio you can open any of them and
check the chart out you can change the
type of chart open high low close or
even and a line chart can change the Sun
frame to weekly or monthly or even
quarters you can add features to your
chart so I'll add for example a simple
moving average of six days my chart and
I get simple moving average for six days
I can go ahead and hunt for example our
side 40 my chart and it will add to the
auxiliary area my chart the second part
of the system are special charts you can
currently there's only scatter chart in
here but later there will be more charts
or you can visualize some features of
the system so you can for example plot
our side 14 against the distance a
percentage from average to settle moving
average of six days and it looks like
this the most interesting part of the
system is very predictive models this is
where most of your work will be done and
here I have for predictive models two of
them are using a support vector machine
regression I have a weekly forecast on a
monthly forecast and you can see and I
will open for example the monthly
forecast you can see the values I used
for my predictive model here you can see
the training gears testing years you can
see the accuracy of your training data
and for your testing data to make sure
you're not overfitting you can you would
have simple badges in here to tell you
how was your accuracy and how is your
fit compared to your training set and
here there's on the left you have some
basic settings you can name your model
make sure your name we are model
something
you can relate to later the chart and
use the first letter to indicate what
kind of model is it so in here i'm using
the vitarium or monthly because this is
what's going to show up on the chart
later you can select which algorithm you
want you can select any number of
features that you need select which to
carry what to forecast and offset the
opposite is basically how many days
ahead would you like to forecast make
sure you I will be expanding advanced
settings on separate video but if you
need to make your model if you want to
make your model public for everyone else
to see just click on public model once
you're done save alkyl tell you will run
your model and update your back testing
results and your market simulation
results for market simulation we have
two instruments one is spread based and
one is commission-based and you can
specify which is from if you're using so
if you're using cfd for example that's a
spread base and if you're buying shares
it will be a commission based and there
is no short so I'm not trace you just
uncheck a short the other part of the
system is the public models so you can
click on public roads and you will see
the top models in the system so they top
model so far as mine and the second
for Jacob del my clique at work and the
third also and then two more models
which are also mine and what's your
improv models you can visualize any
predictions you have so i will be
visualizing for example my monthly
forecast for 21st Century Fox
incorporated and it will load chart you
can see on the chart this is the
forecast this forecast is trying to
forecast the price in 25 days to change
in a person 25 days and it's visualized
settle here as signals telling me that
it will go lower than 25 days so before
the big job in the market in the past
few in the past two weeks we had clear
monthly signal telling us to short the
market basically I have another model
that I usually work with so I usually
work with two models my monthly forecast
and bi weekly forecast my weekly
forecast is forecasting five days and my
monthly is forecasting 25 days both of
them are pubmed motos you can check them
out and i will go to three months and i
will just go back a little bit just to
show you the way you can use your model
so for example in here I had a monthly
long signal sorry
here I had a monthly long singular
telling me to that the general trend of
the market is up usually I open sick I
open positions with them weekly these
are end of days predictions so this long
position is opened the next day and then
here i received a weekly signal telling
me to close my long position so it was
it with the next open and you can see
and you can make you can make profit in
this straight this was a profitable
trade this one too between these two
this one too was also profitable this
one wasn't so not so wasn't and you can
see how you can open it close and here i
received a monthly a monthly signal
telling me the general trend has gone
down and then here the weekly also was
down so you can start shorting the smart
at this point and you can close your
first short position once you get a monk
signal while the monthly short so you
use the weekly to open across positions
so then here told me the next day to
close my positions
you close it here with the hope it and
you open another short position the next
day and this short position you don't
actually close the monthly flecked in
here between positive positive and
native it's just making sure that it
tracks the market but still that's a
very very negative signal of minus 6.8
that's a big negative forecast that's
that's what's available so far in the
system I will be adding I will be having
a fifth signal or FFF stock index or 4x
to the system and it will be anything
you choose so leave a comment tell me
what's the fifth take care that i should
add to the system currently we have only
four stickers in the system and you can
choose which ticker to add to the system
it can be any stock index or forex there
are more features coming to the public
free servers so sign up today and make
sure you reserve a seat and a free
server and you will be updated with all
the new features as the become online
thank you for watching and I hope you
enjoyed this and if you have any
questions you can chat with me or one of
my colleagues from the company and that
would be happy to talk to you and help
you use any part in the system thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
