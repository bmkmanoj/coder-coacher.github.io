tutorial about Jupiter this is part
three and it's about Python basics this
started as an introduction to Python 3
this should give you a set of pythonic
skills that you will need to proceed
with this tutorial series about Jupiter
if you don't have Jupiter installed in
your system you can find it using you
can start a Python session basically or
sorry a jupiter session using try
jupiter that org it's a really nice
service and you can use it to follow
with me on this with this tutorial
the idea of cells and interactive
computing is basically we will have a
code as a cell input and you execute
that and you get a cell output so in
here I have one plus two in a cell to
execute the cell we can use this button
run a cell but mostly if you're using a
keyboard to write code you want to
execute code using the keyboard shortcut
which is Shift + Enter
so if I do that I get 1 plus 2 equals 3
if you have 2 operations in one cell
like 1 plus 1 and 1 plus 2 it will only
return that value of the last operation
so it doesn't matter how many operations
you have in a Cell
it will only return the last one you can
show multiple values using the print
function so in here if I had a situation
like this and I wanted to return both of
them I could have printed both of them
or just printed at least the first one
so to print something use the print
function if you are familiar with the
Python tool you did not have / to add
parentheses around this because it was a
statement not a function in Python 3
this will not work and it will be an
error basically so you have to add
parentheses to your code
whenever you're printing so print 1 + 2
it doesn't return an output it just
prints in the output area but there is
no output of this cell because I did not
return anything I just printed
something out so this is the system
output basically not a return of that
cell if that makes any sense anyway
variables in Python 3 they're a little
different than Python 2 in a good way
you still have the boolean which is true
or false you still have integer but
integers now represent integers and lonk
values so there is no type special type
for Long's and special type for integers
they're both integers now float to
represent the similar values and complex
numbers to represent imaginary numbers
and there is no more L at the end of
long values now and here I'm defining a
few values a is an integer B is a float
C is not long it's also an integer now D
is a complex number e is a float again
because it's I'm dividing 1 by 3 and
finally F is a boolean so if I execute
that I created all these variables I can
say a plus B and it will add these two
numbers I can multiply a by C and it
does not return that little L at the end
it's like Python 2 now it just returns
the value which is much better you can
do something more complex by adding few
numbers I'm multiplying and even if you
have complex numbers and integers it
will just calculate the values fine in
here if you add an integer to a boolean
so 4 plus 2 which is a plus F equals 5
because it's assuming that Vallot or
equals 1 and value false equals 0 so
it's 4 plus 1 equals 5 basically you can
use the type function to know the type
of any variable you have in your system
so the type of
the value 1.5 is a float and the value
of one is integer and the value of true
as boolean other types string list tuple
and dect dictionary so with the strings
you can define a string with double
quotes or single quotes so figure feel
okay to use either one that feels more
natural to you or from any programming
background you come from both of them
would work just fine and you can mix and
match you can say you can define some of
them with double quotes and some of them
with single code and the same code it's
not really optimal but sometimes you
have to do such tricks too to do
something in your code so I'm printing
this variable and it returns a string
the second thing we have is lists so I'm
defining a list with values of 1 2 3 4 5
and returning that it returns my list if
I add something to my list I'm adding
another it list here I'm not adding a
single value it's not 6 plus my list at
6 it's my list plus a list that includes
only a single value of 6 that returns my
list basically with appended value at
the end 6 that did not change my list if
I check my list again it's only from 1
to 5 that did not change my list if I
want to change my list I will have to
risk to store the output in the list the
easiest way to do that is my list plus
equals another list that includes 6 7 8
if I execute that it will return my list
my modified list now with values from 1
to 8 plus equals is exactly like saying
my list equals my list plus something
else
so plus equals just makes your code more
readable and shorter
append is a function that you have in
your list that can add single value and
here I'm not adding Atlas basically I'm
adding a single value to my list and it
will modify my list and it will add
value of nine tables are like lists I
will not go into the technical
differences between them but you should
always use lists if you have unless you
have to use tools basically you can
append tuples together like the like
lists but you there isn't much to do
with the tuples after I defined them
basically dictionaries you can you can
have a key value pair type variable so
in here I have inside my dictionary two
keys name and credit and their values
Russian and 100 and if I execute that
out to a return a dictionary including
two keys and two values you can return a
single value by using the key for this
value so if I want to return the name
inside this dictionary I can use name
you can define other keys and values
inside your dictionary just by finding
them so I can add the key level and I
cut the add the value 4 to my dictionary
and you can see that in here you can get
all the values inside your dictionary
using the values is a function and you
can return all the keys using the keys
function dealing with the lists for
selecting and slicing the first thing is
the lamp function it's very useful it
will measure the length of a list or a
list like object and it returns in here
the length of my list
I can select a single value using its
index so it's a zero based index so if I
use zero I will get the first value in
my list I can select multiple values and
here I'm returning a single value in
here I'm returning if you're using this
selecting format it's called the slice
where you have a start and then step so
if I select from 1 to 2 it will return
only a single value but it's a single
value inside the list it's not just a
single value like this it's it doesn't
select the last the end index it stops
just before the intend X so if you start
from 1 and end at 2 it will only return
value number 1 in your list if you leave
the start empty it will assume the start
is the beginning so it will return
everything until 3 it will stop just
before index 3 if I start from 3 and
leave the end
empty it will assume that I want the
list and tell the last value you can use
a negative indexing and here I'm using
negative 1 which will assume which will
give me the last value of my list
basically if I use minus 2 it will give
me the 2nd last value of my list you can
use negative indexing goes on slicing so
if you start from negative 2 it will
start from the 2nd last value so it will
start from 8 if you stopped at a
negative index it will stop at the 2nd
just before the second value in the
ArrayList so it will list everything and
we will stop just before the second
value from the end it starts at 1 it
doesn't start at 2 so in here I'm it
doesn't start at 0 so because there is
no negative 0 basically so the last
value is minus 1 not minus 0
you can mix between positive and
negative selectors basically so I can
start from the third value or value with
index three and stop just before the
last value which were returned list like
this it will not return nine and it will
not show the first three values and this
list which are zero one and two the
third location in your selector is the
step so if I put a step of two it will
give me a very odd evalu I can start
from the third one and get every other
value and I can use negative step
negative step we'll look at the what
will will invert basically your list you
can use negative two and it will invert
your index and use a step of two so it
will show every other value in your
index and your list basically working
with strengths you can work with strings
just like lists so you can use start and
end step so if I get my name of index
minus one that will return the last
letter my name I can get my name until
index to zero to understand only the
first two letters and this variable
working with the Unicode is a little
different than Python 3 you don't have
to add a you before your you know
Unicode variables that's not the case in
Python 3 you can all strings are equal
now we can just use an a string variable
to store any Unicode value inside it so
and here I have a dictionary with the
error you cannot divide by zero and few
languages and I'm printing the handy one
basically the interesting thing when you
check the type of the this
value you will get the type of this
variable as strength oh this should not
be here actually this is almost equal to
anyway so it will return a strength not
unicode so all the unicode variables are
strings in Python three string
formatting you can have a template
string basically like value equals then
a placeholder and you can assert
anything inside this placeholder using
the percentage so to see this at work I
have first name and last name and I want
to format them in a way that shows the
last name first comma space then only
the first letter of the first name then
dot and if I execute that it will give
me the last name comma space the first
letter of the first name then dot you
can use another place holder that
formats floats to a number of decimal
values using dot then the number of
decimal values then F so if I want to
print PI only to the third decimal value
I can use three and change that to two
and print it and it will print PI like
this in here I have another string that
shows students grades in here I'm
defining three integers or three numbers
basically representing their grades for
homework midterm a final I'm calculating
their total and to show new lines here
I'm using backslash n which is the
newline escape character in Python using
the format function you can use the
format function to pass
to specify basically the name of
placeholders so in here you see that we
don't have names for the placeholder so
the first one will go into the first one
the second one one will go to the second
one and that's the way it works in here
I can specify a name of a placeholder
and it can mention that name as a
parameter in my format function so in
here I have a URL that takes you to
Wikipedia page and I can specify the
language using the format so in here I
want to show it in English and it will
print it like this mathematics we can do
add subtract we can do divide also but
dividing a Python 3 if you are familiar
with Python 2 if you divided two
integers it will assume that you want an
integer division so it should return
only two that's not the case in Python 3
it will assume that itself lot division
even if both values are integer if you
want to enforce that you can use the
double slash operator which is an
integer division you can multiply 2
times 5 is 10 and you can use power so a
to the power n is a asterisk asterisk
and so a to the 2 to the power 3 is 8
you can use mod which were returned
basically the the are rather the
remaining of division so the remaining
of dividing 10 by 3 is 1 because it's 10
divided by 3 is 3 with the remaining of
1 so that will return the remaining you
can add other import other libraries to
your notebook using the import statement
so you can import the library and you
can import
does an alias this is really common with
common libraries like an empire in
sci-fi
so numpy it's always or most of the time
imported as MP to make your coding
faster so I will be importing math which
has few fortunes that are interesting
and useful if you are doing some math
work so in here I have two variables n
equals 52 and K equals 1 and I'm
returning math dot factorial of n
divided by math that factor of a
factorial of K times math of factorial
of n minus K and that returns 52 I think
if any of you studied statistics you
will be familiar with this equation it's
interesting anyway loops you can do a
for loop so to do that use for then a
variable that holds the the tally of
your counter and n then you pass any
thing that you can iterate over so in
here I'm passing a list that has one two
three four one two three four and I'm
printing counter each time so it will
print one two three four you can use
range sometimes you have a lot of values
and you cannot just specify every value
so if you want to create a value from
one to 100 you don't have to type every
value from 100 you can use the range
function which returns and not a list
but an iterable that's that you can use
just like a list so for counter in range
of 5 that will return all the values and
stop just before 5 so it will return
values from 0 and 2 3 4 you can specify
a start and stop and step just like
lists and here it doesn't reach the last
value and your
and your function and this is to make
this right to make range of 1 to 10
equals 1 to 5 plus 5 to 10 so I'm not
saying I'm not skipping one number in
here I'm using the same value and if I
execute that it will turn it's correct
the range of 1 to 10 equals the range of
1 to 5 plus the range of 5 to 10 to
check if something is equal in Python 2
&amp;amp; 3 it's the same thing it's equal equal
and the chick if something is not equal
to in Python 2 you could use either
asterisk equals or greater than less
than in Python 3 you cannot use this
anymore you have to use the asterisk
equals to have an operator of not equal
to and here if I specify the starting
point in this range it will start from 1
and it will stop just before 5 and I can
use also the step to have it start from
2 and give me every other value until 10
and stop just before 10 you can use a
while loop so you can do that with while
then you will have a condition in here
and as long as this condition returns
true it will keep executing this loop so
in here I have a counter and I'm
incrementing this counter each time by 1
and checking if it's less than 5 so it
will just return 1 2 3 4 if statements
you can say if math that pi equals 3.2
then mr. Goodwin was right Edward
Goodwin was right if you're not familiar
with the story it's a geeky mathematics
thing that I left few links in here to
it if you're interested
and it will check if math equals three
point two twelve print mr. Goodwin was
right otherwise it will else it will
print a pi is rational and definitely pi
is irrational you can have an else F at
the way to write that in Python is LF
and in here I have F math of square root
of 2 equals 10 over 7 then the same guy
was right and if it doesn't equal to 10
over 7 square root of 2 is irrational
and definitely square root of 2 is
irrational I left a few links in here if
it's a really nice story about a weird
mixture of politics and mathematics
about pie it's a really interesting
story where bi-lo they almost set pi to
equal three point two anyway
probability equals zero point three so
I'm sitting a variable named probability
to 0.3 and I'm checking if probability
is higher than 0.75 if it's higher than
0.5 if it's higher than 0.25 or else so
it will just visualize it will return a
texture at a text-based
representation of this float number so
that's what I'm doing here so if I made
this to equal point eight it will be a
sure thing if I made that into a point
one it will tell me no way functions you
can define functions so in here I'm
defining a small function that
calculates the circumference of a circle
so and it's basically the keyword def
then the name of my function then I can
specify any parameters I want in here
then make sure you use the statement
return and then return whatever value
you want and here I'm just saying math
that pi times R times 2 which is the
formula for that but instead of
mentioning this formula over and over in
my code I can just use now this handy
little function to do that and here I'm
defining the function for the binomial
coefficient that is slightly mentioned
before and um when I execute the cell
I'm calling this function at the end of
the cell with the values of 52 and 2 if
you see this area this this is called a
docstring this is a way to document your
function so if anyone else wants to use
your function later they will know what
to expect from your function basically
the way to access that if you cannot see
the source code of the function and you
want to access that from Jupiter you hit
shift you go inside the parentheses and
then you hit shift and tap and that will
pop up this little tool tab box and if
you expand it you will see the doc
string area you will see that this
function returns the binomial
coefficients parameters and it shows
what it returns basically if you like
math this is the binominal
coefficient clear function that's the
formula for that in here I'm calculating
how many ways to select two cards from a
deck of 52 cards using this formula and
it returns 1326 and if you're interested
in this try to see how many ways you can
how many ways you can select two cards
from a deck a deck of 52 cards if order
didn't matter just like we have the
previous one but you could select the
same card twice so you would select the
card and return it then you select
another card how many ways you could do
that this is the Wikipedia link to this
and this is the formula and if you can
tell me how many ways to select two
cards from addictive 52 cards if you
could choose the same card twice I
believe that as a as a comment to this
video and if you get the value of 1326
that's just wrong the last quiz was
actually solved by pakery sure that's
i'm pronouncing it wrong but thank you
