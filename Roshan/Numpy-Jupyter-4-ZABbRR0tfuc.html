and to Jupiter series it's about an
umpire's to the fourth one in this
series we will be talking about numpy
this is the tutorial outline first numpy
is a fundamental library for python
which is used for scientific compute
computing and manipulation of large
arrays of data so if you have large
amount of numbers and you want to do
mathematical statistical operations on
these numbers numpy would would become
very handy actually the major advantage
of using numpy for handling aries is
that an umpire implements all the heavy
lifting in c language which is much
faster of course than regular Python
this allows you to tap into powerful C
language performance without from the
comfort of Python numpy is a part of the
supply system of libraries which is used
for mathematical science and engineering
this ecosystem includes Syfy this is a
fundamental library for science
mathematics engineering has a lot of
features for that sorry for the bill
numpy it's a multi-dimensional array for
efficient math and logic operations
pandas this is data analysis tools that
has the data frame and series
representing tables and arrays Jupiter
which is what the series about MATLAB
which was which is the subject of the
next tutorial it's a charting library
and finally some PI which has symbolic
computation library the main object that
does most of the heavy lifting and numpy
is the indy array object that represent
a multi-dimensional array so it's an in
the
like in dimensions array it differs from
a regular Python list and a few ways so
and the arrays are fixed in size if you
define them at a specific size they stay
that size if you change their size by
reshaping them or something then the the
array will be deleted and recreated the
memory basically and the array allows a
mathematical logical operation no
uncomplete multi-dimensional arrays with
a Python list you will have to iterate
over the sequence which which takes a
lot of time actually to execute and the
Ares have homogenous death types for the
complete array while Python lists
contain can contain multiple data types
within a single array you can actually
have multiple data types and in numpy if
you have a multi-dimensional array
anyway mathematical and logical
operations so first let's start by
importing Gannon pi
usually important umpire numpy as NP
this is almost best practice by now
create arrays so in here I'm creating to
Python arrays and to numpy arrays each
one has 5 million numbers in a sequence
in Python that took 259 milliseconds and
numpy took 16 milliseconds so much
faster adding a fixed number to an array
so a scalar addition you just add a
number to that array and it does it
really fast does it in eleven point
seven milliseconds for the complete five
million numbers if you see that in
Python it's more complicated to do that
and it takes much more time actually
with the loop it took 631 compared to
eleven and even with list comprehension
it did it in 382 milliseconds much
slower now adding two lists to each
other and numpy it's really simple just
add the two lists and did that in a very
efficient way and have a really fast
operation for the whole two lists each
one with five million values in Python
you can see it took 1.2 seconds to do
that and even with less comprehension it
took almost one second so that's the
difference between a real-time
performance and a much slower batch
system basically multiplying two lists
so this is a point wise product so I'm
basically multiplying each number with
the corresponding number and the other
array did that in 14 point 7 seconds
with Python it took one point one eight
seconds and with list comprehension it
took 914 milliseconds almost one second
matrix multiplication so with matrix
multiplication this is not point wise
product this is a regular matrix
multiplication the one that you will see
and
linear algebra your to matrices if you
want to multiply a by B and it has a
size of M&amp;amp;M and B has a size of OMP M
and n the inner dimension must be equal
and your output will have the size of M
and O and the P sorry which is the outer
dimension so the inner dimension should
be equal and your output will have the
size of the outer dimension so let's see
that in action I created two lists one
is 3 by 1 and 1 is 1 by 3 and these are
my lists you see it's a three by one and
this one is 1 by 3 a and B to do that
just a dot B use the function dot from
from your array and your output is 3 by
3 if you do a B dot a it's a 1 by 1
because you're taking the inner
dimension here and when you flip them
the inner dimension is one by one not
three by three order even this is you
can perform any logical operations
really easily so in here taking the
remainder of dividing by two and
checking if it equals to zero and it
does that on the complete list and
returns which numbers are even and which
numbers are true there are four
basically so this is even odd even and
list goes on with Python it's much more
complicated and I've done it only with
list comprehension to make it easier but
with a trigger or a list that will even
be more missing multi-dimensional arrays
operation so and here I'm creating a
2,000 by 2,000 array which has 4 million
values when the lists look like this so
the
all the first array is zero and it goes
until 1999 and each one of these arrays
basically has two thousand values
matching two thousand buddies so let's
do some operation with them so this is a
point wise product so I'm just
multiplying everything it took eight
point five three milliseconds to do that
for all four million values with Python
it took over two seconds eight point
four milliseconds to two over two
seconds to two point three for a second
so actually indexing this is how you
access items in your list so I have a
list in here of 5 million values the
first thing I'm doing here is just
retrieving the first value and that
array you can use negative indexing it
would return the last value so if you
use negative indexing of - authoritarian
the one before that so it will be four
nine nine on them and then eight you can
you can use the second place in your
index the second place you separate your
index with Collins and the second place
the first place tells that were to start
the second place tells it where to stop
if you use two if you use one you're
just three three being one value if you
use two retrieving multiple values so in
here I'm telling it to start at one and
stop at ten so it will not return them
to return just one until nine and these
are the and this is so there is still
one value before that which is values
here so I'm starting from the second
value basically because it's zero based
you can use the third place in your
index which is the step so I'm telling
it to step two so skip every time one
value so it's returning one three five
seven nine and that's how the Skip works
to the indexing in here i have a list
which is two dimensional it looks like
this 0 1 2 and tell 1990 this one starts
from 1 2 goes to 2001 list goes on until
the end so it's still a 2000 by 2000
list now i can retrieve if i put only
one index in here i'm telling it to
return item two basically so it will
return this complete item because it's
the second item in the first dimension
basically which is the rows you can
access values within this one within
this array by passing a second index so
i'm telling it to return the first value
in this array so to return the number
two which is this number but the nice
thing is you don't have to write two
characters you can melt these and write
one index like this with a comma
separator to tell it this is the first
dimension this is the second dimension
and you can pass anything else within
your dimension so i can tell it return
from the first dimensions from the first
dimension 1 2 5 so it goes 0 skip that
so 1 2 3 4 and it will not return back 5
so 1 2 4 only and return only the first
value the second the second index is
return the first value only so it will
return the first value from the from
these four arrays filtering you can
filter your data by passing instead of
focusing and index as a number you can
pass an array a boolean array so if I
have an area in here or that has 1 2 3 4
5 and I have a filter that has true
false false false true it will only
return the matching values of true so it
will return
one advice to see that in practice and
here I have a list that has 0 to 9 and
if I pass a this filter to it which is
true false false false false false then
at the end there is true it will return
only the first and last numbers instead
of writing true and false for each value
you can give it a logical operation so
I'm telling that NPR a 1 is less than 5
so it will only return true for values
less than 5 and I can use that as a
filter on my array I can collect on
their turn even numbers for example by
taking the remainder of 2 unchecking the
fifth equals to 0 and I can use the data
as a filter search them only even
numbers you can apply function to your
array so in here I have a function that
checks if a number is a prime and to
apply a function to and a numpy array
you will have to victor eyes this
function first
so impede that vectorized then I'm
passing my function and storing the
victor eyes function in here then I can
just apply my function to the array like
if the array was a single value
basically and use the output of that
because it returns true or false true
only for prime numbers so I have 1 3 5 &amp;amp;
7 these are the only primes this from 0
to 9 exploring the in D array object so
let's start by exploring some boolean
operators and here I have an array with
random values ranging between 1 and 10
and this is an R and and so it returns
only integers and these integers are
going to be values between 1 and 10 it
will have 500,000 values so in here I
can
check if the take the remainder of 2/2
and take the remainder and check if it
equals to zero so I'm checking if it's
an even number so it returns true false
true true false true true true false
through through four six seven go in
here you have you have this array
basically and I'm checking if that all
so are all of them true and it returns
false
and I can dot any so if any of them is
true it will return true this is really
useful actually for hunting beaudion
boolean Aries because most of the times
you just want to know if one thing if
there are any truths or if all of them
is true so I have two built-in functions
anyway exploring basic stats about your
alright so I can tap it there is a big
statistic implementation in here but I'm
just going to look into the very basic
thing so I can say dot max it will
return the maximum number that men to
return the minimum number that means
this is the average so it's returning
the average of almost five and standard
deviation and it's to 0.58 exploring
data shape and memory usage so I have if
you remember I had five hundred thousand
values in here you can check the shape
and it will tell me it's five hundred
thousand by nothing so it's a single it
has single dimension and I can check the
dimensions that NDI M number of
dimensions and it returns one sorry and
finally I can check the actual size of
that M bytes in memory so I can multiply
and get the size and multiply it by the
item size so the size of the array by
the item size in that array and it tells
me it's
four million bytes and if I divide that
twice by thousand 24 I get 3.8 MB memory
usage of that array manipulating data
types and shapes you can use the
function as type then pass any type you
want in here that will change your
function to that type that you change
your array to that type you can reshape
so your final shape should match the
number of items in your first array so
in here we had 500,000 so I'm going
reshape it to 500 by thousand and it did
that five hundred rows by thousand
columns and here I'm telling it to she
reshape it into a three dimensional
array of 100 by one thousand by five so
the product is still the 500 thousand
and if you can't see how this is three
dimensional just try to imagine if you
stack this number this array on top of
this area on top of this array in this
way so you stack all of your arrays on
top of each other and it will become a
three dimensional array a recreation so
we're already familiar with the arrange
this will create a list ending with this
number you can actually pass a start
and step if you want but anyway zeros it
will just return the array of zeros of
the shape that you pass and so in here
ten by nothing and you can pass a D type
to tell at which type do you want your
values to come out in and here I'm
telling it to return an array of one's
using Empire at once and finally with
the arranging here as I told you can
pass a start and a stop and it will stop
before the stop so it will reach the
last number for the stopping number
you can use linspace this will create a
linear space for you so between 1 and 10
it will return a bunch of values in here
between 1 and 10 if I tell a little
space of 1 to 10 with 37 values only
that will go 1 to 10 with 37 values only
returning a value each quarter log space
so with the log space you have start
stop then you have the number of values
you want you only have base basically so
your your values are going to be based
to the value of start and it will keep
going until base to the power source
^ start to base ^ stop so in here I have
1 2 5 with 5 values in the log space
it's returning 1 to the power 1 which is
1 1 to the power 2 10 hundred thousand
and hundred thousands and here I have a
log space of -1 - 5 so 1 ^ -1
that's a point 1 this is 0 because it's
1 to the power 0 then I have 100
thousand 10 thousand a hundred thousand
you can't change the base on in here
using the base - so it's returning 0.5 1
2 4 8 16 32 numpy array as an image so -
just to display these images the one by
creating in memory I'm using MATLAB and
I'm using a magic math lot LED in line
to make sure everything is plotted in
line we're gonna talk about this in the
next tutorial about math lot lab but
anyway I created here a random image of
shape 50 by 50 by 3 so 50 pixels by 50
pixels by 3 values in each pics
representing red green and blue RGB so
this is my random image in here I'm
using the third index so I'm telling it
all of the first index all of the second
index and for the third index only get
the first value and set it to zero so
I'm basically sitting all red values to
zero because it's RGB so I'm setting all
the red to zero though removing the red
from this image then I'm dividing blue
by 3 so I'm reducing the blue so it here
I'm telling it to go RGB so B is 2 which
is the third item and dividing that by 3
so you can see there is barely any blue
anymore in this image then finally
setting green and every other row to 1
so this is basically making green in
every other row to maximum in all pixels
of that row finally there is more about
in numpy there is a lot of functions for
statistics there is so many functions
for linear algebra fast Fourier
transform there is financial things like
present value and things like that there
is a whole implementation for finding
business days and dealing with their
dates this tutorial is available open
