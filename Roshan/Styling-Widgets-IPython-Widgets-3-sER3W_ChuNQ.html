ipython widget series and it's about
styling widgets so first we'll be
covering how to style widgets using
visible function sit CSS and add class
first we'll import widgets and will
import re which is short for regular
expression if you are not familiar with
that it's just the way to format text
and search and do some template work in
a way that could save a lot of time so
first let's examine widget that visible
I'm adding a container here with three
widgets when is a text widget and to our
buttons and I'm adding all of them as
children inside the container I'm
defining also two functions one called
show a hide user and one called show
user and I'm linking these two functions
to my two buttons on click and I can
click now hide and it will hide my user
field and show will show my user field
it's just this simple the second one
will be discussing is set CSS set CSS
will control any CSS aspect of your
widgets so you can control the phone the
background color the borders and or
anything that you can control with CSS
so to examine that modifying container
in here and I'm adding two widgets both
are text widgets I one called name and
one called email and I'm adding both of
them as children inside the container
I'm defining a function here that
matches the old and the new value of the
email left field and it will make sure
they are a valid email or not so and I'm
the reason why I'm doing that you can
directly check check the widget itself
and make sure if the email is correct or
not and control the this style but you
don't want to keep changing keep using
set CSS on every keystroke that will
make the user control not 3d useful so
let's examine that we have email in here
i will try something in here again it
will make sure that i wrote a correct
email if i forget for example this it
will return it back to read and that's a
nice visual way to validate someone's
input with no messages or anything it's
just a little visual effect that could
really help a user find where their
errors in their forum anyway the the
other way to control your widgets or the
start of your widgets is by adding class
which is a CSS class so you can define
your own classes or you can use any of
the bootstrap library which is available
n ipython notebook so am I will be going
over few of bootstrap classes just to
demonstrate and here I'm defining seven
buttons and I'm adding them to a
container as children
and these are my seven buttons here I'm
adding class to each one of them you can
find these classes and bootstrap website
and you can see that we can control the
style of our buttons in here the second
thing i will be showing you sometimes
you want to have a big button to
demonstrate something or just to have
this style of a button that's a block
button and the way to do that is also by
adding a class the other thing that you
can do and really have it will give you
really good control over styling your
form is using the HTML widget to examine
how your code will look like i will be
using cell magic in here HTML said magic
so anything I put in here will be
rendered as HTML so I'll be testing this
these are labels I can put them in a
string and define a HTML widget and pass
this code as value and when I display
that I get a form with these labels of
course you usually want to use one label
only in inside a single widget so you
can control how to show that the second
thing you i will be showing you as
alerts you can have these dismissible
alert so you can read the alert you can
dismiss it by closing it close it close
it close it and and that's how this
works in here i will be explaining how
you can use your the HTML widget within
your code so i'm defining the code of
and a dirt with the three key words
inside type title message so i can
control that i'm defining three widgets
in here HTML widget a text button and a
button and i have one function in here
save it's basically formatting this text
by adding the type success title saved
and adding some message and it's linked
to this buttons on click so if I execute
that I will get this form I can add
something save and that will get this
alert telling me you're my form has been
saved and I can dismiss that this
