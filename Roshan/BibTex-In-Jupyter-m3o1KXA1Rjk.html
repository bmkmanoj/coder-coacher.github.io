peptic and how to use it in Jupiter
peptic is a way to keep track of your
references when you're writing a paper
so in here I have just some code to
compile my paper once I'm done I have my
actual paper I have a template for the
paper and I have my references so you
will need these three at least to run
and you can't run this in the terminal
if you want but let's jump into it and
see how this work first in here I have
two things you will have to take care of
before you do this make sure that you
have a latex extra and peptic extra and
these are big downloads but you will
make sure that you will have every font
and every library that you might need
compiling your paper basically so in
here I have a claim about machine
learning is used in fingerprint image
classification and to create a citation
to a reference I can use the HTML site
tag and use the the data site attribute
to link it to a specific reference to
get the reference and add it to our file
in here using Google Scholar to find my
to find the paper that I want and this
is not exactly the paper I want but
yeah actually this is the paper that I
want sorry I will click on cite and
diptych and I will copy this depth a
code for a reference and I will paste it
in my reference file that web my RAF
data file I will get finally the
citation key and I will go back to my
paper and I will paste it in that aside
now if I save my notebook and I saved my
references is a file or my PAP file and
just take a look at the template before
we compiled our paper it's extending
article you can change your author name
so basically what put your name in here
or the names of people are of everyone
working at the paper with you the title
of your paper or article and I'm in here
I'm using the plain bibliography style
but you can use I Triple E if you want
and finally this is referring to my re f
dot bib file so if you renamed the file
to something else you can just change
this to mature bibliography references
file your bib file
finally to compile this I will run this
code you can run it in the terminal but
it makes more sense to run it within
Jupiter
so this code basically is converting the
my notebook too late ik u you want to
change this later to whatever the name
of your notebook as so in here I'm you
my name the name of my not work is my
not work that
i py and b and you can't change that and
change all of these to whatever the name
of your notebook is then I'm compiling
it to athletic using a peptic to link
all the references then compiling it to
PDF three times this makes sure that all
your references are are processed
basically once this code is done
actually it's been done for quite some
time now if I go back to my working
directory I will see a bunch of files in
here but what I care about is my PDF
file if I open that it will download and
if I select it I can see my article on
my paper and I can see the reference in
here and it's clickable and I can click
to it and it will take me to my II
references and it did all of that on its
own now and it will manage all your
references if you use the same reference
in multiple places that will render it
just fine
I hope this helped and thank you for
