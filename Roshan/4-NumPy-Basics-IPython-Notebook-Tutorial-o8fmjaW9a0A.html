about ipython not work this is the
fourth part and it's about numpy basics
numpy is a powerful set of tools to
perform mathematical operations on lists
of numbers it works faster than normal
Python and it can also work on high
dimensional arrays and do mathematical
operations on them in a very efficient
way so it performs usually it performs
in general faster than normal Python
code it's a part of a bigger ecosystem
called SCI pi which is a python-based
ecosystem of the open source software
for mathematics science and engineering
so numpy is a part of a bigger ecosystem
of libraries that can work in that can
help in research and development and it
contains these core live packages numpy
which we'll be discussing today sigh pi
it's a fundamental library for
scientific computing so if you want to
do for your analysis clustering a bunch
of algebra and calculus operations you
can use sci-fi for that mat plot lib
it's a charting library plotting library
and we'll be covering this in the next
tutorial in the series ipython ipython
with this development environment
ipython notebook is part of the ipython
project senpai this library can do a lot
of mathematics algebra and calculus it
can help in unit conversion it's a
pretty comprehensive library for math
for mathematical and science and
engineering work and the good thing
about it it's completely written in
Python so
doesn't need any depend it doesn't
depend on any other libraries and this
ecosystem but it it can perform so many
mathematical operations and it's pretty
visual the results it produces are
pretty vidual
pandas pandas is for data structure and
analysis it it's it interfaces the
normal numpy the multi dimensional array
and adds so many functionality to it and
it makes it really easy to work with the
data and analyze it in pandas other
important libraries that worth
mentioning or having in your development
environment scikit-learn it's a machine
there learning library socket image
that's an image processing library
OpenCV computer vision library enough
take a natural language toolkit
depending on what you're working with
it might help even just to download them
and experiment with them and see what
you can do with them so let's get back
to a numpy and we'll import the library
whenever were importing numpy always
imported as NP that makes it's almost a
standard in scientific work
so we'll execute the cell to import temp
i working with them in the array which
is in dimensional array and this is the
basic array in 9m pi and we'll be
working mainly with this saturday will
then generate a an array using a arrange
function so arrange function can take
the start-stop step and the type which
is short for
data type so it can produce a list let's
try an NPI range 10 that will produce an
array from 0 to 9 so it doesn't include
the number you stopped at so if you pass
only one variable that will be your stop
number and it will start from 0 and not
reach that number let's try 1 to 10 that
will use 1 for start and Tim for stop so
it reduced status from 1 1 to 9 instead
of 0 to 9 let's try 1 10 0.5 0.5 will be
the step so let's see how does that work
and it generated a list for number is
between one and nine point five and it
did not reach them that's the that's how
this cell function works it doesn't
reach the last number you mention and it
will use any step you want here so if I
said for example step 2
it will also step yeah that's the point
2 and it produced all the numbers and it
stopped at 9.8 let's try step 2 and it
produced 1 3 5 7 9 next one it's the
same start stop and step and finally you
can specify the data type you want your
array to use and here this array as we
can see it's an integer re we can
generate the same list but it will have
the dot indicating it's a float value
it's not an integer value anymore
so examining the the array object or in
the array object there's an a missing
here sorry for that so um first thing we
will generate a an array we'll call it
the s short for data set
and the first thing we want to see is in
dime in di M which is a number of
dimensions and it returns two in here
because this is a one dimensional array
it looks pretty much like this actually
the second thing we can examine about we
can see about our array as the shape
that will return the shape of a our
array it let's actually look at our
array we will insert a new salon here
and return our array this is our array
it's one three five seven nine and so
the shape of that is five and there
isn't a second dimension in this array
it's a single one dimensional array the
size of the array will return how many
items you have in the array the d-type
will tell you what's the type of your
array and in here it's integer 64 so
each value is taking 64 bit item size
will tell you the size of each value so
it's eight byte 8 y 8 that's 64 and so
let's see how does it store the data
internally it stores the data internally
inside the variable called data I'll
just list that and let's see what we
have inside we have here the code to
store the value of that array and access
it in a very efficient way to perform
mathematical operations on that that's
our array again finally memory usage you
can know the memory usage of our list by
multiplying the size by item size and
we'll get our value and bytes so this
array is stored in 40 bytes it's not
exactly 40 bytes because it stores other
information about it like hip and
pointer information and other things but
that's
outside the scope of this work anyway
why do we use numpy we will compare the
time it takes to create two lists and do
some basic basic mathematical operations
on them so I will be using ipython magic
time it to time creating an array using
range with this is normal fightin way to
generate an array from 1 to 1000 and NP
arranged that's a method in right in
numpy that we just discussed that will
generate the same list but in an India a
in the array object that's an umpire
object I'm using finally a sell magic in
here capture this captures the result of
timing these two and we'll store it in
time it results so let's do that
now it's performing each one of these
timing them and putting the results in
time it results let's print time it
results to see what we have did the
first one in thirteen point nine
microseconds and it did the second one
in two point three microseconds so to
process this we have to convert it into
seconds and and or we don't even have to
do that because they're using the same
unit in here I wrote a small function in
here to calculate the time a seconds so
we can compare the performance of Python
versus numpy and in here it's doing it
in six times the speed of normal numpy
so the python to numpy area in here
that's six to one a you can have your
code execute in six times the speed it
usually does for creating a an array so
let's do basic operations I will
generate
dualists to normal Python lists and to
numpy lists each is goes from 1 to 999 I
will be timing this whole thing in here
I'm adding the two lists subtracting the
two lists multiplying them and dividing
them and I'm using time--it as a cell
cell magic in here and I'm using capture
to capture the results of the timing
this in Python it will take a little
time let's print it did it in 619
microseconds let's do the same thing for
an umpire you can see one really nice
thing about numpy if we want to add two
lists we just add + - x / instead of
using this gizmo in python to basically
do the same operation let's see our
results did it in thirty four point two
microseconds if we compare that that
that's 18 times the speed of performing
basic operations like this other most
common functions in numpy will start by
less creation functions these functions
create a numpy list for you and in the
array object the first one its array we
pass an object to it it can be an array
a pie normal Python array or tuple or
tuple of tuples or a list of Lists or
whatever any object that can be
interpreted as an array or a
multi-dimensional array D type copy
order and Sabich false and in
and demand equals zero you can see the
documentation in here to know exactly
what you're working with or you can just
shift shift and tab inside the
parentheses of any function and you will
get this pop up and it will have the
help you need to work with this function
so we will pass through this function an
array of 1 to 5 and it returns an array
of 1 to 5 in an umpire object
multi-dimensional arrays we can pass a
multi-dimensional array by passing an
array of arrays like this so this is the
outer array and the objects inside it
are 1 2 that's that's one array is the
first object a secondary as the second
object and a third array as the third
object so you can see how we can nest
lists to represent a multi-dimensional
list and we can see it returns a Empire
array of the same structure basically
the second function we will talk about
is zeros zeros MP dot zeros and you pass
a shape this is the most important one
we'll pass a shape of three by four and
three will be the number of rows and
four will be the number of columns and
we can create even a higher dimensional
array by doing that and that's a three
dimensional array of the three rows main
rows by four sub rows by two columns
basically it gets really complicated
once you're dealing with explaining a
higher dimensional array so let's get
back to our main two-dimensional nice
array we can specify the D type we can
say for example we want
integer 64 because this by default
generates a float a float array and here
it returned the same array bit of type
integer 64 a linspace this generates a
list of numbers we specify a starting
point a stop point how many steps in
between whether to include the endpoint
or not and this is f true I will return
sample steps so I'll return to lists
each has one with the samples one with
the steps between the samples will not
be dealing with this in this tutorial so
let's try it
linspace 1 to 5 that returns all numbers
between 1 to 5 so the main difference
between this and a range is it by
default it includes your ending number
so if I say linspace 1 to 5 it will
include 5 in my array so M into the
linspace 0 to 2 num for so we want all
the numbers between 0 &amp;amp; 2 with 4 steps
and it will return zero point 6 1 point
3 &amp;amp; 2 we can not include the ending
point so it will return zero point five
one one point five and not include two
random sample or random that random
that's this method returns a an array
with random numbers basically all the
numbers returned are between 0 &amp;amp; 1
so this is our this is what we get
once we pass a shape of 2x3 two rows by
three columns or we can use random
sample this is the this is the other
name of this function it does the same
thing random or random sample so let's
try to do some statistical analysis with
the numpy this is the second thing we'll
be discussing today statistical analysis
of our array so once we have so many
numbers in our array we can start doing
some analysis of these numbers will just
generate our data set with random
numbers and we're storing it in a
variable called data underscore set and
it has this these values and first thing
we'll be working with is max so MP dot
max MP dot max you can pass your array
in here you can specify which axis you
want to major the maximum on out and
keep dimensions so let's see that in
action MP max set data set and it will
return our the highest value in the that
set which was zero point nine seven zero
point nine or seven sorry the second
thing we want to do is if we specify an
axis and told it to return the maximum
on axis 0 so it's using axis 0 two major
the the maximum value of each number in
that axis so so sorry
maximum axis is 0 it's checking in here
it's returning seven point seven because
this is the highest in this column it's
returning point six because it's the
highest here and
0.9 because it's the highest in this
column we can do the same thing but use
access equals one and it will compare
numbers and this
dimension so in here should return point
seven and the other one it should return
0.9 let's see a point seven and a point
nine so it was measuring the maximum in
this dimension which is the first
dimension not the zero dimension
basically then it does the exact same
thing but major is the minimum number
and returns the minimum number it can
handle also axes you can specify which
axis you want to get the minimum from
mean that this returns an average so it
just sums all the number and divides it
by the number of items it has to to
return an average basically which is
this is the mean median this is another
thing we can evaluate this returns the
center number so it might if your
numbers are skewed towards higher values
or lower values your median will reflect
that clearly but in here we don't have
much of skewed data set standard
deviation MP dot STD that's short for
standard deviation and it also can work
with the axes and the eighth major is
the standard deviation on your array or
a specific axis some does the same thing
and it can it can also handle summing on
one or on a specific axis and so summing
the whole data set is three point two a
third thing you will be dealing with is
reshaping your that's it
so in here we had let's let's look at
our data set first I'll add a new cell
and just show our data set our data set
is a two point at two by three so it has
two rows by three columns let's change
it into a three by 2 first so NP the
tree shape
you pass your array then you pass the
shape you want to the new shape that you
want it reshaped it into 3 by 2 if your
final value doesn't match the number in
here so if I past for example a 3 by 3
this shape doesn't match the total
values of this and here we have six
values and a three by three will be nine
values so it will not add to a return
exception telling you the new shape
there's a match the old shape so let's
try to reshape it into a six by one it
will return a a six by one basically but
sometimes we just want in here each item
is a list with one item inside it so in
this dimension we can remove this
dimension completely and change it and
make it into a single dimensional array
using instead of six by one just six and
it will return one dimensional array
with all the values inside the original
array
raivo it does exactly that but you don't
have to pass the new shape it will just
flatten your that is that actually there
is another function called flat it does
also the same thing as slicing this is
this is really important and it's and it
can save a lot of time to know the
tricks of slicing a numpy array
basically in here I generated kind of a
big array to be able to do some slicing
I generated a five by ten so I have five
rows and ten columns this is why each
column is two lines actually so the
first thing you can do is you can pass a
number between brackets and this will
return a single item from the
first dimension so their first dimension
the 5/8 return item number one always
remember indexing starts with zero so if
you wanted to get the first one you pass
zero and here we're getting number one
which returns the second item so this is
the second item in our first dimension
if we wanted a single value from that
now we have a one-dimensional array we
can so we can pass a second index of
zero between brackets
so we're referencing the first value an
easier way to do that or shortcut and
numpy is to put one comma zero between
brackets and it'll return just that
slicing a range in here we're returning
a single value what if we want a range
of values so in here we're returning to
two for 2 : 4 so it will start from item
number two and it will not reach number
four so it will go for two and three
only in slicing once you use a colon you
don't reach the final number it doesn't
reach the final number so any hit and
here we have from the first dimension
because this is the first bracket and
there is there isn't a comma there so
we're dealing with the first dimension
in this array and we're getting number
two and three let's see this is number
two and this is number three point nine
and point seven point nine nine point
seven these are now we're slicing from
number two until number four without
including number four so until number
three and here I'm slicing the same one
then passing zero so I will get from the
second dimension zero only I'm getting
only the from the second dimension the
the first value value with index zero so
it will return 0.9 and point seven so
these two values the first two values of
the second dimension
I can slice not a single value in the
second dimension but I can slice like
two Val several values this is value
number zero and tell to so it doesn't
include two so it starts from zero and
zero and one so it returns this it
returns a point nine point six point
nine point six the first two values and
it returns the first two values from the
second one to if you want to skip a
dimension and deal with the second
dimension only so telling it to return
everything in the first dimension you
don't leave the damage in empty you put
a column representing that there is a
dimension there then comma and you pass
whatever you want in your second
dimension so this will return the
complete first--i the Col your items
from the first dimension and only the
first the first item from the second
dimension I know it's confusing but just
bear with me I'm returning the first
value from the second dimension so the
first value in each item from the second
dimension so the first value in each sub
list in here I'm returning point nine
point three point nine that's point nine
point three point nine point seven point
eight so I'm returning the first value
from each sub list or the second
dimension basically stepping I can use a
second column and add any number I want
in here and this will determine the
steps so if I used step one it will
return all the values in here I can just
completely delete it and it will
understand that I want to deal in one
step or I can just leave a column and
leave it empty and it'll return
everything I can use step 2 so to a
return every other value it's returning
the first value and
the second value it's not returning the
second value the point three array is
returning the third value at the point
nine which is this one and it's
returning the last value and not the
fourth one which is point eight one
which is this one so it's skipping it's
using s step in here it's stepping every
two items returning every two items
let's take a look at this again and this
is slicing them from 2 to 4 this is 2 &amp;amp;
3 not including the last item and
finally in here I'm stepping in second
dimension so I'm stepping into this
dimension the second dimension or
dimension number 1 dimension number 0
and stepping every 2 so I'm returning
0.9 and not the second one 0.0 0.8 3 to
the third one the fifth one point 2
which is this one skipping this skipping
this returning this 0.6 and skipping the
last one the same thing with the second
1.7.9
skipping again point 0 8 and you can see
how this skipping can work with by
adding a second colon in here and using
any step you want this okay this listen
is available open source and github and
it's viewable and in be viewer you can
use this document as a reference while
you're working with the numpy and the
link to that is in the description below
