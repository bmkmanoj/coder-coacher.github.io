about ipython notebook this is the
second part and it's about markdown and
latex and we'll be discussing how to use
latex language and to add the 4matic to
our text in markdown sales so this is a
markdown sale we can add headers 1 to 6
by using the hashtag sign or hash sign
then our header we can do hitter 2 3 4 5
6 we have two styles of alternative
headings one by following the line with
equal signs and the other by following
the line with their signs the second
thing is font styles we can have italic
by using asterisk or underscore and
don't forget to close that to the same
character can have gold with a double
asterisk or a double underscore and make
sure you close it with the same one you
can have a through-line
that looks like this by using a tilde or
squiggly using two tildes or to school
with and make sure
lists you can have the unnumbered and
numbered lists by using either and dash
your items and you're in there like this
or you can use numbers then dot so
number one number two those are items
you can have sub items by adding a space
and you can even have have even further
sub items by having two spaces or three
and it will be winter collective links
you can just throw a link in any any
March down cell and it will render it
like this you can have a ward
representing that link by adding the
world between brackets and then they are
between parentheses you can have a
tooltip with your length by adding the
tooltip between double code inside the
URL parentheses images you can have
images with exclamation mark then add an
alternative text that you want to show
instead the image of a digit node and
then between parentheses you can have
the URL to your image and if you want
you can add two
like codes you can you can show codes
within your markdown cells of course
they will not render because it's a
markdown cell that they will not execute
sorry because it's a mock now cell but
it will highlight your code and you can
do that by using circle grape axis
symbols and they're closing with the
same and make sure you name the language
that you want the marking or the
highlighting to apply to this code so
this is a Python script I'm using Python
in here
this is JavaScript I'm using javascript
so it will always highlight my code
according and tables you can have tables
with this code codes you can have codes
with a larger than symbol in the
beginning of your line and you can sorry
and you can even insert more styling
inside your code like this I'm using
double header in here I'm using italic
and the Twitter in there like this HTML
this is the second thing we can add we
can just throw any HTML code in there
and it will render just fine horizontal
lines you can have presented lines with
dashes asterisk or triple underscore in
triple of the triple underscores or
triple asterisk or triple dashes Unicode
Unicode
you can throw in any Unicode characters
and they will render if they're
available the font of the browser that
your user is using but most commonly
you'll get those codes I will get a lot
of other symbols that you might need in
your notebook mark Duncan has oscillate
ecstatic saz a scripting language or a
language to represent mathematical
equations so we can add mathematical
equations within our notebooks using
latex language if we can have the inline
blocks like this so we add dollar sign
then we close out the dollar sign as
we're in there like this in line so it's
within the same line or we can have
block
blockhead formulas with double dollar
sign I suppose a good double dollar sign
you can see that this Ranger as a block
and this printer in line sometimes for
some formulas you have to ring their
block formulas because you hold your
left finger and one and Greek letters
all 24 great letters are available those
are the most common I can have alpha by
backslash alpha or capital A for the two
forms of alpha
same with Beta Gamma Phi Phi etc basic
operations you want to be able to have
plus negative x in two formats and
division and fraction or like the
division sign this is how you do that
and plus and minus that's easy I can
have 5 X which is 5 times X or 5 or X
backslash x which shows this symbol then
file you can have a fraction or a
division that's how we do it
backslash frac then you add your two
numbers between curly brackets or you
can have have it show the division sign
by using this code backslash there
or an index they're very similar you can
have like Y to the N equals x to the M
minus X to the M minus 1 this is how you
do that
y underscore M is y to the N equals x
underscore M that's X to the N minus X
underscore n minus 1 between curly
brackets whenever you have more than one
letter like here in only you have to use
curly brackets to enclose whatever you
want to show us an index it's the same
thing for power but you replace the
underscore with a caret symbol and it's
the same for more than one letter you
have to close it within curly brackets
fraction types most of the times we will
be using frac then whatever you want to
add between curly brackets but sometimes
you need to create something like this
like a simple fraction and that's how we
do that you use a carrot one that will
push the one up then an underscore two
that will push the two lower and just a
forward slash between them that's how
you can generate those two types of
fractions roots you can have any root by
adding backslash s QR t short for square
root you can enclose within the curly
brackets of that tool anything else in
here I'm enclosing a backslash frac
which is a fraction of 1 over 3 so this
is how it renders the second one
I'm changing the level of the road to
three so that's the third root of two
times X and you can have any level for
your root by adding that level between
brackets sums and integrals you can add
some like this backslash sum and it will
generate this beautiful Sigma symbol
limits that's how you add the lower and
higher limits of your sum and you can
format that while your backslash limits
then underscore for lower limit then
carrot for your higher limit then
whatever you want to add after the this
is an integration a backslash n then
limits or sometimes you will see
formatted like this and this is how you
format an integration where the lower
and higher limits show almost next to
the integration director
or lower and this is how you do it you
just remove the backslash penis this
listen it is available open source on
the github and it's viewable on nvme
viewer the link to this document is
available in the description below and
you can use that for reference while
you're doing any markdown or latex and
work thank you for watching and I hope
if you liked that you will subscribe and
watch the third part of this series and
it's about basic Python thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
