series about machine learning I've been
trying to do series to introduce this
technology in a simple way and I've been
struggling to find the right setup for
everyone to actually do the work I've
tried to make some kind of a virtual
machine and it was just too large to
make it available online for people to
download I tried to I tried a few
approaches and they were not that
successful but finally I found a simpler
way to make everyone participate using
Amazon Web Services AWS so what is
machine learning actually using that
instead of logic to teach a computer to
perform tasks so if we take an example
of face detection instead of writing the
logic to define how to detect a face
what is the face its eyes and nose and
mouth and how to describe them to a
computer instead of doing that we use a
lot of faces and we feed it to an
algorithm that finds what's common
between faces and learns to find other
faces later that's actually implemented
in your phone once you open the camera
in your phone you'll see you'll see a
little box surrounding faces that's face
detection music machine learning working
on your phone so let's jump into the
system and see how can we set up our
environment so this lesson will be about
setting up the environment this is
the hard part we have to go through the
basic things so we can get our
environment running and then we can
start doing some of the more fun things
basically what we learn in this lesson
is how to deal with AWS Amazon Web
Services as a platform we will learn the
basics of programming in Python we will
learn the basics of our IDE which would
which is ipython notebooks
we will learn we learn few functions
from two libraries
numpy and pandas and finally we will go
through administration monitoring with
identity which is included in this image
thanks to a gently for giving us the
ability to include their product in our
image free of charge actually so shout
out to them let's start with creating
our image you will be using Amazon Web
Services go to aws.amazon.com if you
don't have an account open one we can
you can have a you can open a free
account so let's do that
once we're there we'll go to my account
console and open AWS management console
once you're there you'll see a lot of
services the one that we will be using
is called ec2
click on launch instance once you're in
launch instance go to community email
a.m. eyes and then look for ipython
notebook server I uploaded this am I
made it public it has all the tools that
we will need to start with the machine
learning so let's select this ami for
all purposes of going through this
tutorial I will be using you can use the
micro instance which is part of the free
tier you can you have 750 hours of free
access to this instance so you basically
can have 4 running instances for the
complete month for free and this is
available for the first 12 months of
your account signup per date so we will
go with the micro instance and we don't
have to go through every step will just
click review and launch one thing we
have to change is once we go down will
see security groups and under security
groups we see that we have only one part
open and our firewall to SSH access and
we need actually to open a couple of
more ports so I click on edit and once
you're here click Add rule add row' and
open both ports 80 80 and port 8000 make
sure it's anywhere source so you make
sure you can
excessive click again on review and
launch then launch if you already have
if you already have a key you can use
your key if you don't have one if you
have a new account and you don't have a
key yet create a new key give it a name
download the file
it's a PM file and we will not use it in
this lesson but you need to download it
and keep it so you can use it later to
access SSH for the time being we'll use
my existing key I will acknowledge that
I cannot access my instance without
having the key and our launch distance I
can go to view instances
and this is the new instance that's
initializing right now I will name it so
I can access it
unidentified later easily I will name it
lesson one and save in here you will see
the status of all your instances that's
running at the system if you have one
right now just wait for status check to
finish additional initializing you can
access your instance by going to this IP
we open two ports 8080 and 8,000 but we
will start with port 8080 so we'll open
new tab and we will paste our IP column
8080
and now we have successfully launched or
on server with all the tools that we
need to do machine learning operations
the password the default password that
comes with the system is Russia and so
it's our oh Sh a.m. Roshan and again it
comes would with the few lessons in the
system but the only complete lesson
right now is less than one so open that
it might take a few seconds to load
because it's a big file and your browser
might take some time to render and
download all the content of the page but
anyway once it's up we have access to
our on Amazon and Amazon Web service
instance where we can do machine
learning operations basically an
alternative setup is to do a local setup
I advise people to use Ubuntu on every
on a virtual machine and install Python
dev Python pep Python numpy sci-fi
actually few more would be pandas and
scaler and start your instance of
ipython just type ipython notebook but
this approach is much easier I might
record something later on how to on how
to set up your own local environment if
if someone actually demanded that but
anyway now we have our environment the
first thing to actually learn is Python
we'll be going through
Python will learn just the basics but if
you want to really get into Python I
advise you to go through this book it's
50 chapters it's really a quick read and
you will very much enjoy going through
this book so
let's start examining some code we have
where we can assign variables without
declaring them in Python so we don't
have to declare a variable before we use
it so we can say X equals 10 y equals 5
Z equals x plus y and printed that will
print 15 to execute anything in inside
your code cells press shift and enter
shift and enter will execute the code
inside your code cell an alternative way
is to go to through cell and run and
that will run yourself another type of
variables that we have in Python is
strings so if we have war 2 equals hello
word word 1 equals hello or 2 equals
Python and sentence equals word 1 plus
space plus war 2 then we print sentence
we get hello Python so let's do some
math variables that we defined in a
previous code cell will still be
accessible in other code cells so if we
define the x and y in here we can still
access them in here and another cell so
we have X plus y X minus y x x y or x y
and x divided by y and once we execute
that we get 15 550 and - another thing
that we have to know is string
formatting we use percentages to have a
placeholder for a string inside our
string so we can insert another string
value there so we can say just hello as
percentage sinus and save that into a
variable called template then we can
print template percentage and we pass
the second string to template which will
replace percentages so the output of
that would be also
hello Python where Python was replaced
in template we're printing actually
template and replacing the percentages
using percentage then passing the word
Python you can you can definitely change
things here and try other things you can
change hello - hi and execute that and
you'll get try Python so you can change
code and test ideas as we go you don't
have to do the same exact things that I
did so let's use string formatting to
improve the math results we get here we
get here 15 5 2050 and - and we have to
say like 1 2 3 that's 1 2 3 that's
multiply so 50 is multiplied so let's
start by trying to replicate this add
result and we have a placeholder for
string and we're passing x + y subtract
result and we have a strength
placeholder then we're passing x - y
with multiply or passing x times y with
divide you are passing x / y so we can
also execute this we'll get our results
add result subtract results result
multiply result and divide result and we
can know each number
what kind of result is it we can pass
multiple parameters to a string so if we
have a template that has one two three
four placeholders so we have so
basically one to replicate this it's ten
plus five equals fifteen ten minus five
equals five ten times five equals 50 10
divided by 5 equals 2 so we want to have
a place for the first number place for
the operation a place for the second
number and find that a place for the
result and this is what our template
does here it has four places the first
number operation second number and
result to pass multiple variables to a
string we use brackets and put commas
between our variables so we go print
template X comma Plus which is a string
comma Y comma and finally the result of
X plus y then X minus y but and passing
negative in here or as a subtract X
times y the right operation X divided by
Y and passing the right operation and
that generates this result one more
concept that we have to go through we
can have multiple values in one variable
or one object here we have lists we have
tuples and we have dictionaries lists
and tuples basically do the same thing
can
exactly but we will not get into the
technical details of the differences
between them but you need to know about
them we you need to know there are lists
and tuples and Python the last one would
be dictionaries where we not only store
single values like 1 2 3 4 5 but we can
have pairs of key and values for each
for each item in our dictionary so it
can be for example each employees name
and then there or each employees ID and
their name it can be any pair of values
basically it can describe a single
person like it has one key for name then
his name then for example age and his
age and gender and their gender blah
blah blah
so let's see how do they work
we defined a list we defined a tuple and
a dictionary in here and we will be
printing few things about them first
we'll be printing the list we'll just
pass the list to a string for strength
using formatting then we'll be we'll be
measuring the length of that list using
the function Len so Len then the name of
the our our list which is numbers list
will will generate the length of that
list we can access individual items
inside our list by specifying their
index inside the list their index start
with 0 so the index of this one is 0 and
the index of the last one is 4
but we can access the first item easily
by saying zero and instead of measuring
the length of the list to access the
last item we can use negative indexes
negative indexes would start from the
last value so minus one represents this
number minus 2 minus 3 minus 4 and minus
5 tuple is basically working the same
way
and finally dictionaries they we can
still access their values by using the
method values which returns list of
values inside the dictionary we can
access their values with values and we
can access their keys with keys so if we
change this into T's we will get the
keys of the first key and the last key
of this list because tenem because this
is the same that doesn't make any sense
so I'll just change this one to 66 for
example so if we use values we would get
first item 66 and if we use keys
we'll get our first item as one which is
the key of the first item the second
thing that that we want to get into as
ipython that works up to here we have
went through the main concepts and ideas
of Python we'll still have to learn how
to do loops and if conditioning and
other things that we will learn as we
need actually so we don't have to go
through every aspect of the language in
the first lesson but the second thing
that we will be learning about is
ipython notebooks ipython notebooks is
basically a development environment and
that we that we're actually working with
right now this actual lesson is inside
an ipython notebook so this is what we
want to learn how to use this
environment ipython notebook allows us
to have very interactive development
environment as we see we can change
things and we get instant results the
second thing that we that we have in
here is latex which allows us to format
functions in a more readable way so
instead of this we can have this using
latex you can actually double click on
in here and see the actual code that I
used to write this function
there is a wiki page for latex language
so if you need to make your functions
very readable to non-programmers you can
go through the latex wiki and learn how
to do every trick to make your functions
more readable I spent two time talking
about this too much time anyway it
allows us to work with the charts a
great place to start with and to have as
reference and it's just an awesome place
to go to is this link the gallery of
multiplet not what lip it has so many
ideas and charts they're all open source
you can go to any of them and learn how
did they do that very specific chart so
if you are interested for example and
making this chart you can see the code
in here and know exactly how did they
write this chart and the chart the code
is there for every chart in the gallery
you can't copy basically this code paste
it in ipython notebook head shift and
enter and execute it and you will get
this chart
so how to work with charts first thing
we need to do is import the mat plot Lib
library this is a line that you we will
be using almost in every and every
lesson import matplotlib that PI plot as
P of T so we're importing this module
from this library and we're giving it a
short cut name as P of T so whenever we
want to reference this will just
reference it as P of T so let's see how
does that work we have X as LS that has
one two three four five then Y with the
three two five zero one first we'll
we'll go with the P of P that scatter
this will scatter x and y and to know
the format of before we scatter actually
were plotted to know how to use any
function and ipython hitch shift and tap
and you will get this really cool help
that it's the dark string of the
function basically it's a little help to
give you information about this specific
function so once we want to execute this
cell we'll hit shift and enter again and
we will get our chart basically it's
plotted X over Y X was 1 2 3 4 5 y was 3
2 5 0 1 so we can have our charts in
line and we can visualize our data
within our development environment which
is
we can scatter so scattering X over Y
will give us three to five zero one
again we can add extra parameters to
scatter see four four color and I will
make C equals to Y so the higher the
number the colors will change
accordingly introducing one more thing
is marker we can use the parameter
marker to change the markers in our
scatter the complete list is available
in this URL and s4 sighs you can't our
scale actually you can scale your
markers up or down so we can say for
example we want to make it 800 and this
will generate bigger stars if we go with
80 that will generate much smaller stars
well this is a teaser for a 3d chart
using matplotlib which is this I will
not be discussing how to build this
chart it's available in the gallery if
you go to the gallery of matplotlib and
scroll down to 3d mat plot 3d you will
find this example in here and you will
find a lot of other really nice examples
to work with but we will not be
discussing this specific technique today
two more tools that we'll be working
with are numpy and pandas there are very
powerful libraries for python to deal
with large amount of numbers so to
multiply 2 by 10 is 20 that's simple but
to multiply a list with hundred
thousand numbers by in a very list that
that is another hundred thousand numbers
and we need to multiply each
corresponding numbers and get the result
of that that might be a very
time-consuming process using pure Python
so once we're we're deed once we are
dealing with large numbers we will be
using numpy and pandas as we imported
the charting library before matplotlib
will import numpy and pandas numpy as NP
and pandas as pd always try to create
shortcuts for your libraries because
everyone else uses those short handles
to access the libraries so your code
will be very compatible with other
people that you might be working with
one important function that we use is
arranged it generates an array we can
specify starting number ending number or
just an ending number so in here we
created an array of 100 numbers it
starts with 0 and ends with 100 we will
use another function called reshape to
reshape this to reshape this array into
a 10 by 10 so instead of being 1 by 100
it will be 10 by 10 and this is all this
is all actually an amp I will be using a
very important object and pandas called
data frame it represents basically a
table but it's a very powerful and fast
table that you can work with and you
will be fine you'll be finding a lot of
people working with pandas dataframe for
really large amounts
numbers so to define a data frame we can
pass our numpy array to the data frame
and it will take into that array and
convert that into a data frame and we
stored it as DF short for a data frame
then we're printing the data frame just
to visualize it so these are keys the
first column in here and the for the
first row are keys so the key of the
first column is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
the same for the rows and it tells us
that it's 10 by 10 rows and columns
let's see how can we perform some
operations on on our data frame so we
can access the first column which is
sorry the second column which is column
number 1 minus D F of 0 which is the
first column so it's subtracting the
first column from the second column and
that would be 1 minus 0 which is 1 11
minus 10 which is 121 minus 1 which is 1
so we can see the result is going to be
1 for all for all values in here then
we're adding them together and getting
the results we can multiply and you can
do all kinds of operations and we will
get really fast results using pandas one
more thing that we use pandas for is to
read comma separated value files we can
treats files from the local system which
is located on
Amazon instance and it can fetch
comma-separated value from the internet
directly so let's see how can we upload
a file first into our system and see how
can we read it to upload file into the
system we'll be using our administration
monitoring tool agenting to access
urgently go to HTTPS your IP column 8000
so let's open this it tells us that
there is nothing called your IP or DNS
so let's copy our IP and paste it here
make sure we paste it over the complete
ward and hit enter it will give you a
warning depending on your browser you
might see a different screen telling you
that this product is using a certificate
that's not verified or not signed by
someone who's verified so I just add an
exception for this it will basically
protect you
sending passwords over the internet but
this is a very safe way to do it but the
license is free so it's not signed my
verified source to regard to log into
into urgentiy we will use username root
and password admin make sure you change
your username at least change your
password after you log in the first
thing you do after you log in you want
to change your password this is very
very critical this is very very critical
go to password and change your password
what admin in here and puts
thing else and save make sure you do
that you don't want to have your
identity access available to everyone on
the internet unless you have protected
yourself with firewall and specified
your exact IP but that would be a much
harder approach and if you're ready to
go through the trouble of changing that
I think it would be much more beneficial
to change just the password than here -
anyway - to up to access our file system
we'll go to file manager on our file
manager this will access our main
storage of the system all our files are
stored inside home then
Ubuntu everything you're working with
including your ipython notebooks are
available in here you will see a lot of
hidden files that the system uses to do
one a pressure and another the last
important one is the data folder open
the data folder and you can upload a you
can upload a comma-separated value file
into your system you can have one from
work or download the sample one from the
internet with some numbers to upload it
into the system it can be stock prices
it can be something scientific it can be
the NASA exoplanet format it can be
whatever you want it to be whatever
you're working with and you can upload a
file into the system and this way you
will have it stored into the system and
you can access it later to do some
machine learning processes with it
to read files that we uploaded into the
system we use pandas so PD again dot
read CSV which is short for comma
separated value and then go double code
data forward slash then your file name
so whatever the file that you uploaded
you want to access it if you want to
access the data and load it you can
access the data later on CSV underscore
data you can change that with a URL to
where a file exists on the internet or
it might be an API that generates comma
separated value results and you can
fetch that directly from your pandas and
have it loaded into the system where you
can process it and do so many wonderful
things with it this is the end of lesson
one I hope you enjoyed it and let me
know if this is clear and if you have
any questions cave keep it in the
comments below and I hope to see you
next time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
