about ipython not work this is part 6
and it's about ipython widgets ipython
notebook provides a variety of web
widgets that can interact with the
Python code from the web browser so
we'll be talking about ipython which is
a part of a bigger ecosystem the SyFy
ecosystem of libraries for science
engineering and mathematics so let's
start by importing our libraries I'll be
importing numpy as MP and pipe lot as
PLT and I would be importing three more
things for widgets I will be importing
ipython that HTML from there I will be
importing widgets and there will be an
importing interact from ipython that
HTML that widgets and finally I'll be
importing display from ipython the
display let's take a look at the
built-in widgets this code generates an
actual widget that shows most of the
available widgets within sorry I forget
to execute the first one so it looks
cute and still let's hit shift and enter
so I'll execute that again yeah and I
get this accordion widget we can explore
our basic widgets in here bottom check
box drop-down menu a radio radio buttons
select a text box or a multi-line text
box a toggle button that will save its
status and multi value toggle buttons so
you can have multiple values in here and
you can choose one of them through the
toggle buttons the second one is the
second group is number input we have
abounded the floor text so it will take
any numbers between 0 and 100 and that's
customizable and it will take any float
values in here to
this will take only integer numbers
between 0 and 100 the good thing about
them you the user cannot make a mistake
so if someone types any wrong input it
will just clear it out and if someone
types a number that's greater than 100
or your whatever your maximum is it will
trim it back to the maximum we have a
float slider widget that will this will
generate float numbers between any
desire to numbers by default it's 0 to
100 then we have float textbox this will
take any number it doesn't have a
maximum or minimum this is an integer
slider and it will generate numbers
between 0 and 100 and there will be
integer numbers finally I have integer
textbox and I can type any integer
number if I type anything wrong it will
trim that out finally we have output
widgets we have a latex widget that
displays latex code and we have an HTML
widget that displays HTML code so a
simple example will take the factorial
function in here so we'll define the
factorial function a factorial function
takes the number and multiplies it by so
X will be multiplied by X minus 1 times
X minus 2 and till 1 so a factorial of 3
will be 3 times 2 times 1 equals 6 and
factor of 5 will be 5 times 4 times 3
times 2 times 1 that's hundred and 20 so
I'm defining my factorial function in
here it will take X and it will print
the original number equals then the
factorial we are calculating the
factorial using numpy so NP that math
that factorial of X and it will return
our number in here I wrote this function
if you don't want to use factorial this
is how we can do it you generate a list
of numbers so you generate
list of numbers using a range from one
until X plus one and you take the
product of that list so you're
multiplying all the numbers in your list
so let's execute the cell and let's test
it
so factorial of 5 is 120 using inter
interact function we will explore our
factorial function using widgets now
using interact function enter to use
that just type interact then the name of
your function then add your variable in
here so x equals zero to 100 that will
generate this slider it's an integer
slider that goes from 0 to 100 and
that's a factorial of 100 we can easily
explore other factor your numbers just
by moving this slider in the browser so
we'll be controlling a chart now I will
define a function in here that plots a
chart it takes X&amp;amp;Y
it creates a figure a subplot it plus
the numbers it's a title and adds a grid
then finally shows the plot if you're
not familiar with the pipe lot or
matplotlib you have to check if part
number 5 where we discuss this in depth
let's define this function so what we'll
be working with is a function a
polynomial function I have a X to the
power 3 plus B X to the power 2 plus CX
Plus D where ABCD are constants so this
is where I'm defining this function f
it's x is a list of numbers between
minus 10 and till 10 with the 20 numbers
in between then we have y equals a to
the a times X to the
our three plus B times X to the power 2
plus C times X plus D which is the
Python version of this function
finally I'm generating title and latex
just to display the function and latex
with the ABCD substituted and though
into the function and finally I'm
plotting the function here so I'll
execute this function and let's just
let's test this
I have ABCD in here now values for them
and I'm calling the function f with
these values and it returns this chart
this is and it has the title FX and 0.25
two times X to the third power blah blah
blah and this is the function this is
the chart it returns we will link that
using interact also with the widgets
where we can control ABC and D and we're
also controlling some other styles
things about the function so we have in
here a I can use a small negative number
in here
I have B I can add more in here and it
will show you the function you have in
here and it will plot it for you at the
same time so we have this now we can
that'll see a little negative in here I
can change the color of the line I can
make it a blue line I can change the
width of the line I can make it into a
dashed line if I want it and I can
control all of that from these widgets
and I can later go and say well I
and lower value in here and lower value
in here and I can change the values and
they will update the chart instantly you
can have access to your widget if you
store your interact function you can
access your widgets later by typing your
interact your interact function that
widget which will display your widget
again and your output and you can go
ahead and change that and get your
results and the new one it will it will
not change your previous chart so you
still have access to your previous chart
and you can experiment with something
else and see how does that change your
data and you will be able to compare it
to your previous thank you for watching
