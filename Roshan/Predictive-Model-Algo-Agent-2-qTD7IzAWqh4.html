build predictive models in algo agent
first you'll have to look into the
system if you're not fit the tub user
yet you can sign up there is still 30
seats available on the public server so
if you don't have user create one and if
you do have one just click into the
system then go to predictive models I
will start a new model and I would be
using KNN which is one of the simplest
algorithms available so i will be
calling this one something like
short-term price i will keep that girth
in 2k and in classification i'll select
only four features RSI 40 change from
one then I will scroll all the way down
and select Bollinger list and bollinger
little dist this is the distance between
the two lines two lines of the Voyager
brats the upper and lower and this is
the relation between the price of the
middle line and I would keep the offset
to one so just predicting the next day
and I will select bank of america say
scroll to the bottom of page and open
the model and you can see without doing
any tuning to the model model already
performs better than the benchmark so
the benchmark is 0.8 percent and that
girth emeriti does 13.4 percent this is
not accounting for any spread or
Commission so I'm assuming we're using a
safe safety instrument so just put a
kind of a high spread here just to
explain how does this work so I added my
spread my long spread on my short spread
and I will save a continued you can see
the models now worried by stick the
differences still plus two point nine
persons or making better than our
benchmark but we still have it's a low
accuracy model I've it's under fit so we
can still fit this model better tour
data and with Kailen you have one
important parameter to tune which is the
number of neighbors so this is how many
neighbors your point is going to
consider round it and making the
decision
whether desktop would go higher and
lower so I will click on the small ranch
Nick next to the parameter and I will
look for all the values between 1 and 20
start and you can see that our best
value is 15 so i can use the best value
the good thing if you're the parameter
tuning will take too much time you can
just switch to another tab or anything
and once your model is done it will give
you a sound notification and it will
start blinking lit up so you can know
which tab finished the parameter doing
so if you have multiple things that are
derivative the system it will at least
not fire which tab finished perimeter
tuning so I will be clicking 7 continue
to make our changes permanent second
container gaining okay I can you can see
now our model is already doing better
than the benchmark the difference is
13.9 percent where our algorithm is
making 14.7 percent and the benchmark is
0.8 person and the badges for our model
is moderate accuracy and it has a good
fit which is important if your model is
over fit this is dangerous because this
might mean the simulation might not
really reflect what might happen if you
start trading with your motto and once
you're happy with your model you can
make your model public if you want and
that will show your model to everyone
in the system but if you don't wish to
do that you can keep your model for
yourself and you can scroll down to your
model and once you get to your model
instead of clicking the models name
click on the ticker his name so bank of
america so once i click on that it will
open a chart for me and it will give me
the short and long signals on the chart
so k NN is not really the best algorithm
to build predictive models but it's a
good introduction on how to build a
predictive model that beats the
benchmark basically so this is a
classification model and you can see the
value of our predictions here as either
0 or 1 which is stock will go lower or
higher and we can still see the models
did predict the big drop in the market
at least twice give a short signal and
because our testing period is one year
we can see the whole predictions for the
complete here and here once you're done
with your predictive model you can make
it public and if you make it public go
to top predictive models and you can see
other models in the system which are
which might interest you and that do
well basically and notice that by
default when you create a new model
there is no spread or Commission so
market simulations by default if you
don't set any spread our Commission
value and
they might not really reflect your
trading experience if you have any
questions you can leave them in the
comments or click in here and start
chatting with me or somewhere else for
my team and will be very happy to help
you and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
