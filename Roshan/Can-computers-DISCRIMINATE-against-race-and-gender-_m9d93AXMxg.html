person in here who's 25 years old
bachelor degree studies for 14 years
works 40 hours a week never married from
the United States works and sails white
nothing family is a male and works in
private sector this is based on data
from 1994 so this might not reflect the
market class today but I will try to
make a prediction whether he makes more
or less than 50 thousand dollars a year
it tells us that he makes less than
fifty thousand dollars a year
let's look at the same guy ten years
later when he was 35 he still works the
same forty hours
that's a degree same occupation same
everything let's see what happens in ten
years now he makes more than fifty
thousand dollars a year if we changed
the race his race to black we can see
that he makes less than fifty thousand
dollars a year
what if he was working 45 hours a week
now he makes more than fifty thousand
dollars a year but if there was a female
makes less than fifty thousand dollars
ear and let's try to make that fifty
hours still less than fifty thousand
let's make that fifty five hours a week
now she can make more than $50,000 this
might look like very bad results or
might not sound like good results to
everyone but this is just based on
census data from 1994
