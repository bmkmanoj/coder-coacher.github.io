about ipython widgets this is the second
part and it's about handling events we
will be handling events using two
functions on click and on trade change
let's start by importing our library so
first we have a function here and name
the print message it takes a widget and
prints a message you have clicked and it
prints the widget description so to
implement that I started with a
container i define the container in here
i define two buttons so what two button
widgets one called click me and one
called don't click me to associate this
function with these buttons i used on
click and then I passed the function
name finally I added to the two buttons
to the children variable of the
container and then I'm returning the
container so if I click on click me and
it will print you have clicked click me
and if I click the other one it will
print a message like that the second
thing is on trade change so in here i'm
starting with a container i'm adding
basically i'm trying to build a simple
calculator in here so i have to float
widgets description x and y then I have
a select widget with the description
operation it has four values plus minus
x + / then I have a widget that shows
the formula and finally a widget that
shows the result both of these are latex
widgets I'm adding all of these inside
the children variable of the container
then I'm defining a function here called
calculate form it takes all these
children and put them in a variable
named forms for it returns the value
from x and y it returns the selected
operation from operation it builds the
formula by making X as a string then put
the operation then finally the wire as a
string and it's displaying the formula
in here finally I have I'm checking if Y
is 0 so I cannot divide by 0 and add the
operation is divided I will return and
form number 4 which is the result / 0
otherwise I will evaluate the formula
with eval function that will evaluate
whatever two numbers we have in our
formula then finally I'm printing the
formula with the result just to have a
little history on your calculator in
here i'm assigning this function
calculate form to these three controls
so if I change X Y or the operation it
will calculate the form I'm using on
trade change and i'm passing value as a
the trade that i want to monitor so if i
run this i will have x and y and
operation i can try other operations
minus and it showed us the formula and
the result x / it shows us / 0 let's
change the 0 to 5 for example I can
change this to any other number
and I get the results and the good thing
I can get the results as i type so as i
type each digit it will evaluate the
formula again and it does the same thing
in here as i type digits it will
evaluate the formula and the cool thing
is you can call in this calculator
anyway anywhere in your notebook just by
calling the container again and you will
have this again where you can work with
it and get different results this
tutorial is available open source on
github and it's viewable on mb viewer
feel free to use it for any purpose you
need the link to this is in the
description below thank you for watching
and I hope if you like this you will
subscribe to this channel and you can
watch the previous part of the series
about container widgets or the next part
about styling widgets thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
