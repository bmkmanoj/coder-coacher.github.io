ticket and in this video we're going to
learn about PHP for each loop the for
each loop is used to look through an
associative array so inside the round
brackets here we have our associative
array follow that by the keywords as and
then we have our array key which we can
store inside of a key variable follow
that by the racket operator and then the
Aires key value which we can store in a
variable called value now the key and
value variables can be named anything as
long as you remember that this one
refers to the array key and that this
one refers to the arrays key value and
just to review this is what the
associative array looks like so the key
main would refer to Sam
in this example and the value variable
would refer to the key value which is 23
okay so that's the syntax of the for
each loop now the loop is going to end
when the final key value pair is reached
so in our example here when Jim and 42
key value pair has been reached the loop
is going to end okay that's it for the
syntax now let me show you a practical
example I'm going to go ahead and create
a new array here named animals and all
it's going to be is a bunch of animal
names along with it sounds those animal
name those animal make so I'm going to
create bad creatures and they're floors
just kind of add some granules here
dolphin clicks choose honks and vulture
cream okay so the animal name here is
the array key and the array value is the
sound that this animal makes so I'm
going to go ahead and flip through the
animals array now
as you can see I name my variables name
and sound because it makes sense inside
of our animals array we have the animal
name and this is what the name is is
referring to it's referring to the key
of the array and the sound is referring
to the valley of the array so if I echo
out these two here and use space to
concatenate the two together and then at
the end I'm going to use a VR tags to
make it look nicer this is exactly
what's going to print out it's going to
print out the animal name and then space
and the sound which the animal makes so
as you can see here the org as expected
we're looking through the associative
array and it's printing out the Araki
and the array value now an alternative
way to write this would be as follows
you can just use the associative array
name and since we have access to the key
this will give us the value of the array
and so now we have all the values
another way to write this is to
completely avoid this part and if we
wanted to just print out the array
values we can do so in this way as well
so this does the same exact thing as
before
okay so that's it for this this example
and now I want to show you something
else I want to show you how to modify
array values by reference so for example
if I add an array names numbers and just
going to keep this short and put five
numbers in here and then I look through
this area numbers using the short
version because I only need values let's
go ahead and print out this right here
numbers and numbers equals array and so
right now it's just printed out there
right and we have a key we have a value
you have a key you have a value so you
can see that all the key
all the values are one two three four
five now if we wanted to directly modify
those values here's what we can do and
this is called modifying array values by
reference so we would simply put the
ampersand in front of the array P and
then we can say something like numbers
equals coming number equals numbers x
times two and that would modify the
array values so now all the all the
values inside of the array would be
doubled so if I print out the array down
here now you'll see that these values
have been modified okay so now all the
values have been doubled so that's how
you modify the values by reference and
it's actually recommended to unset the
number because it's still going to
reference the last key value of the
array and that can lead to unexpected
behaviors so we want to break the
reference with the last element here
okay so that's it for this for each loop
finally I want to show you a last
example if we wanted to include the for
each inside of the HTML page you can
replace the opening curly bracket with a
colon and you can replace the ending
curly bracket with and for each
semicolon and this is just a nicer
cleaner way to include the for each loop
inside of an HTML page or alternatively
you can of course write it in the same
way here in a PHP page as well so that's
it for the for each loop I hope you guys
