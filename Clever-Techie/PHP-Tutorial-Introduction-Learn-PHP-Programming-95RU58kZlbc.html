ticky and in this video I'd like to
introduce you to bhp programming let's
go ahead and dive right in starting off
with the variable names every variable
in PHP must start with a dollar sign
followed by the variable name the
variable name must start with a letter
or an underscore it can't start with a
number we assign a value to the variable
by using an equal operator and in PHP an
expression is anything that expresses a
value the value would be an expression
of itself and once the variable has been
assigned a value the variable also
becomes an expression now the statement
in PHP ends with a semicolon and you can
think of statements as any kind of
action in programming so in this case
the action is simply assigning a value
to the variable and we complete the
statement in PHP with a semicolon
which is how all the statements and in
PHP and also just to get you guys a
little bit more familiar with the
programming lingo when the variable has
been assigned a value we can say that
the variable has been defined and
initialized and it's ready to use okay
let's go ahead and start programming I'm
gonna pull up the IDE here I'm going to
be using NetBeans with a custom dark
effect theme that I've created okay so
we start coding PHP by an opening PHP
tag and we end it with a closing tag
just like that now just to show you an
example of comments a single line
comment in PHP starts off with two
forward slashes
and the comments in PHP are just a way
for us programmers to understand their
code a little bit better and an
alternative ways to use a pound for a
single line comment now the multi-line
comments start off with a four slash
star and they're ended with a star
forward slash and you can type whatever
text or code you want in between these
and it's going to be ignored by the PHP
interpreter just like that now let me go
ahead and define some variable names I'm
going to go ahead and define some
variables here and they're all going to
have different data types and data types
are just basically value types okay so
these are for different data types this
is a string data type this is an integer
data type this is a float data type and
finally boolean data type and just to
clarify a little bit more there's three
categories of data types scalar
composite special in PHP scalar you can
think of as a single unit of data so
those are the ones that I just defined
so the first one here is a string which
is a text and it's going to be enclosed
in single or double quotes next one is
an integer which is a whole number
float which is a fractional number and
finally boolean which is a 0 or 1 and
the boolean can also be expressed as
true for 1 and false for 0 now under the
composite you can think of composite as
a collection of data so an obvious
example is an array which can hold
multiple values the second one is object
which refers to the instance of the
class which I'll cover at the end of the
video and finally we have special under
special we have a null which is like a
like a variable like has been assigned
constant null has not been assigned any
value or has
been unset and finally there is a
resource which holds special kinds of
alleys like database connections okay so
those are the data types supported by
PHP now let's go ahead and output some
of these variable values to the screen
I'm going to use a keyword called echo
which outputs the values to the screen
and I'm just going to say the game game
name was released in release here and it
now costs cost now at amazon.com I'm
going to create a non dollar sign here
and at the end I'm going to use a br
HTML tag which is a tag used to start
another line in a browser okay now I'm
going to go to the output and as you can
see all the variable values I have been
printed out to the screen just like we
wanted to now if I copy this whole line
here and I enclose it in single quotes
the single quotes in PHP are also known
as little quotes I'm going to go back to
the output and now it's literally
printing out variable names instead of
values which is why single quotes are
also known as little quotes so I'm just
going to comment this line out here so
basically using double quotes allows you
to use the variables inside those double
quotes okay let me show you what
constants are so there's two ways to
define a constant in PHP one way is to
use a built-in function called define
and the functions in PHP whenever you
call a function you use the round
brackets in this case the values are
going to be constant name enclosed in
the quotes separated by a comma is the
constant value so that's one way to
define constant and the second way which
I actually prefer is to use the
construct or the keyword Const followed
by the constant name and then just like
the variable we use the equal operator
and
the value and also by convention all
constant names are uppercase and never
prepend a constant with a dollar sign
unlike the variable another really
important thing to note about the
constant is that just like the name says
constant constants never change once
they have been defined okay so I'm going
to actually create a constant out of
this BR tag because I'm going to be
using it a lot throughout this video and
I'm going to use the Const keyword
method and I'm going to name the
constant BR and just place this BR tag
inside the constant now you can just use
this constant inside the quotes so I'm
going to have to use something called
concatenate and concatenate basically
just adds a value to the string of text
just like that and we use a dot to join
the string of text together so dot and
then the constant name and if I go here
and refresh the page nothing changes
and if I go to view source you can see
that the BR tag is still being printed
out so everything is working just like
we expected it to now let me just show
you guys arithmetic operators real quick
now all of these are mostly
self-explanatory and if you use plus or
minus or multiply or division or modulus
or even expand she ation which was
introduced in PHP 5.6 all of these will
work just like tricks you expect them to
the negation is just going to give you a
negative variable or a negative number
now the one that I would just want to
explain real quick is identity and here
it says conversion of variable to
integer float as appropriate let me just
explain what that means and a little
more detail so if I had that variable
and it had a number as a string here
let's create a float number if I use a
built-in function called var underscore
dump which is a function we can use to
find out what the data types are
function to find out what the data types
are in PHP and I'm going to use I'm
going to pass this non variable inside
this function go back to the output
refresh the page as you can see PHP is
telling us that it's a string data type
with six characters one two three four
four five six okay so if I put the plus
sign operator in front of it it's going
to convert it to float so it's just a
useful way to convert string numbers to
integers or floats and it can be useful
in some situations ok so that's what it
is just so you guys know now let's go
ahead and just another example so if
this function was for example just a
hundred if the valley was just 100 it
would convert it to integer so that's
how that works
okay all right now let's go ahead and
move on to arrays now there's two types
of arrays in PHP numeric and associative
and the numeric array is created we
create the Ares whether work with a
keyword array or rather array is the
proper way to say it
and then we use the round brackets and
we list the values of the array with
commas separate we separate the values
inside the array with a comma
now the word numeric refers to not the
values but to the array keys and just to
clarify here this is what the array an
example would look like so whenever we
create an numeric array like that the
keys are automatically created and the
key count starts with 0 so you can think
of keys as like an ident
fire for all the values so the valley
for would be identified with a key zero
the valley three you would be identified
by key one valley five would be
identified with key two etc and when
this array is created like this all the
keys all the numeric keys are
automatically created for us so we'd
have to worry about that okay so that's
numerically an associative array we
actually specify what the key name is
and we enclose it in either single or
double quotes and we use this rocket
operator to assign whatever value of
that name key is going to be so this is
an example of what the associative array
would look like you would have a named
key and that key would identify a value
in this case Starcraft key would
identify a value 1998 The Witcher key
would identify variable year etc okay so
those are their numeric and associative
arrays now let me show you guys some
examples let's just go ahead and create
and then an array called game genres
using the array keyword and I'm just
going to put a bunch of string values
inside this array
string datatypes rather and see here
action/puzzle stress to rat to G MMO RPG
and FPS so those are just the different
kinds of game genres and then what I'm
going to do here and I'm going to use
the equity or to try to print out this n
array to the screen so echo and then the
name of our variable array and here I'm
going to get it this notice array -
string conversion that's because we
cannot directly access the array in PHP
in order to access the array keys we
would use square brackets so for example
in this case the key here is of the RPG
for example keys the key of the RPG is 0
right 0 is RPG adventure is 1 action is
to etc right so here's what we do we
just use square brackets and we put the
key inside of those square brackets and
that accesses the value of that key so
if we go back
as you can see that RPG has been printed
out which is the value of key 0 just
like we have in our array if I put 1
here the next key is going to be X the
next value is going to be accessed which
is going to be adventure so now you can
clearly see how all these keys have been
automatically generated for us and we
can access all the values in the array
using those keys now let me just show
you an example of a multi-dimensional
array so a multi-dimensional array is
just a array which has an array within
itself so if I created another
out of these three values here now what
this array would look like is this so
first of all this is the key 0 for RPG
but the next key which is one is going
to have a datatype array and we can't
access that directly so if I tried
something like this again you can see
that we're trying to again access the
array directly and we get in this notice
because we can't do that so what we do
here is we specify we append the square
brackets with more square brackets and
then we access whatever the keys are
inside the second array so in this case
let's access adventure which is 0 and
then that would access adventure so just
like shown in this table here first
we're accessing key 1 but that's a data
type array so we can access that
directly this data type array has its
own keys so we access it it's its key
with more square brackets put the key
value inside of those square brackets
and that's how we access its values so
those are multi-dimensional arrays and
if I wanted to access more keys I would
simply go 1 and 2 and I'm just going to
pretend this with our BR constant here
using concatenate and this should print
out all of our valleys yep adventure
action and puzzle and just two also
going to print VR here so we get get all
the valleys printed out like this ok so
as you can see we're accessing all of
this this second arrays keys 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 and
adventure action and puzzle has been
printed out so that's how we access
arrays keys and that's how we access
multi-dimensional arrays now let's just
let's create associative arrays she ate
it Harry
okay so I'm just going to create an
array called
I'm going to create a variable array
called ears same using the array keyword
and then this array I'm going to go
ahead and create game names along with
their release years and I'm going to use
the rocket to specify what the values
all those keys are the way chair rocket
was released in 2009 comma the Mass
Effect 3 and here I'm just going to use
the constant which we have created
earlier
we chose the value of 2013 and finally
dÃ®ablÃ¸ I'm going to go to the next
line here
rocket 1996 okay so just like in the
example earlier we create our key name
use the rocket and specify the value of
that key so if I was going if I'm going
to print out this array and actually we
can print out the whole array using a
function called print underscore R so
this is exactly what I'm going to do
here and I'm also going to use HTML tags
called pre to format the array a little
bit nicer go back to the output and get
this error because something forgot to
do something here on line 57
um okay so comma here okay so I put the
rocket inside the quotes okay
there you go refresh okay so wait now
the constant is freaking out oh okay so
I forgot to I'm actually going to create
a constant out of this here just forgot
to do this and I'm going to use the
other technique this is what I forgot to
show you guys release here and I'm just
going to put the value twenty thirteen
so this is just another way to define a
constant as you remember from the
constant example so now we have the
constant release here and it holds a
value of twenty thirteen so now
everything should work I defined
variable release here this is oh this is
what I was going to do okay so I'm just
gonna print this release year constant
in the middle of this quote so in order
to print the constant here in this
string I used concatenation on the left
side on the right side and I also closed
the quote on each side as well so that's
how you would print out the constant in
the middle of the string okay okay let's
go back to the print our years and now
we're not getting any errors finally and
you can see that the keys and values
have been printed out and in this case
instead of numeric keys we have named
keys and they're all associated with
their respective values so this is our
associative array now the errors can
also hold different datatypes so for
example in this case you can see that
the array array skis can hold variables
and constants and numbers but they can
also hold three
beings and other data types so just to
mention that real quick okay let's keep
going here and we've covered the numeric
areas associative arrays and
multi-dimensional arrays now if I was
going to print out just games honors all
right here see what happens okay I'm
also going to use these pre art tags so
that is formatted on each individual
line okay you can see how this
multi-dimensional area has been printed
out with their numeric keys and for the
numeric key one the data type is an
array just like was shown in our table
here one is array and it has its own
keys and here has been printed out just
like shown in the chart okay so that's
it for the arrays now let's move on to
functions so here I'm actually going to
create a function but before I do let me
show you the function syntax in PHP we
define a function and construct is just
another word for a keyword so we use the
keyword function followed by the
function name and then the round
brackets are used and inside the round
brackets we have our arguments separated
by commas now you can think of arguments
just like them as just like the
variables and after the round brackets
we have curly brackets and inside the
curly brackets we have a group of
statements which is basically functions
code which is going to be performed when
the function is called now when the
function is called
we pass the parameters which will act
just like the variables and these
variables will hold values so they're
called expressions hence the name
expression 1 and expression 2 and then
these parameters get passed in to
functions arguments so the first
parameter is going to get passed to the
first argument and the second parameter
is going to get passed to the second
argument
and then inside the functions inside
this function the arguments are going to
be used to do whatever we want with
those with those arguments okay so I'm
going to create a function just spell
the function right here using function
keyword and I'm going to call it pretty
underscore R and use it curly in round
brackets I'm going to pass one parameter
or argument here called array and this
function what is going to do is just
going to print out the pre tags
automatically for us so we don't have to
do it every time and as you can see
we're using the we're also using the
print our built-in function to print out
the actual array but what it does is
additionally it echoes out the pre tags
automatically for us okay so let's
utilize this function let's go ahead and
delete these pre our tags what I need
them anymore and just utilize our pre
our function which will also clean up
our code a little bit more and go back
to the output and nothing is nothing
should change just like expect it
everything remains the same but now we
won't have to print those pre tags it
will just use the pre our function and
now we have successfully defined a user
i user defined function and just to show
you guys another example of the function
i'm just going to create a function
called ad which is just going to have
two arguments x and y and it's going to
add them two together and return them so
i'm just going to use the plus operator
and the return keyword basically returns
the value of the function to us so if we
were going to do something like num
equals 100 now add 100 to 100
the num is now Pecos just to give you a
common the numbers now 200 acronym we
are constant now the number that we
should be printing out is 200 yep okay
so it just returns the value which is
calculated from the function and we can
do this because the return value is
going to be whatever is returned by the
function in this case 100 and 100 plus
100 equals 200 and then we print out the
value to the screen okay so that's the
difference between printing out function
values as opposed to returning them all
right let's see what's next next is
conditional expressions now the
conditional expression is just any
expression which returns true or false
that's as simple as that so 10 is
greater than 5 is true that's a
conditional expression which evaluates
to true
10 is less than 5 that is false so this
is a conditional expression which
evaluates to false now the truth
expression comparison expression and
boolean expression all mean the same
thing as a conditional expression all
right guys we're now ready to move on to
if statements ok so here's how the if
statement works so we use a keyword if
and then inside the statement we have we
have a conditional expression or we can
have multiple conditional expressions
like shown here and end is an operator
it's called it's called a better
comparison now let me see what is it
arrey operators assignment comparison
okay it's called the logical operator so
and true if both a and B are true so we
have two conditional expressions here
age is less than 21 and age is greater
than 18 so if this if both of these are
true then our statement is going to be
executed so age if the age is 19 or 20
which is between 21 which is between 21
and 18 then this statement is going to
be executed next we have an else if
another condition is true so if age is
over 21 then the next statement will be
executed and else if age is less than or
equal 18 then this statement will be
executed so you can put you can think of
it as if expression value is 2 true our
first experiment is executed etc if this
one is true this one is executed if both
of these are false this else is I guess
executed so let me just show you a quick
example here
for example if 18 is less than 21 echo
it's true so so this will evaluate to
true and should print text it's true yes
it does okay so next one is if mmm 18 is
less than 21 same thing any same example
you do that but else if it's not so if
it's false do something else okay it's
false
and statement with a semicolon eka it's
true so for example if if if I put 18 is
greater than 21 here then it's going to
print out its false because we have a
false condition it's false okay so
that's how that works
and finally I'm just going to copy and
paste this code here we have Alice if so
if this expression is true then it's
going to execute this statement if the
next expression is true it's going to
execute this statement and if that
expression is true can I execute this
statement and if nothing none of those
are true it's going to execute this one
so you can have a nested if an else if
conditions and you can have as many as
you want in this case release ear is
equal to 2013 so is the year greater
than 2010 yes it is so the game was
released after the year 2010 is going to
be printed out the game was released
after the 20 2010
I mean after 2010 yep okay so that's how
that works and finally I wanted to show
you guys another conditional called
switch and switch is like a it's like a
short version of a bunch of else if
statements so if the expression we
evaluate the expression and if it equals
0 then execute this statement and then
we use a keyword break to exit from the
switch statement and if it's one execute
this one and if it's to execute that one
so etc and it's important to use break
at the end of each case statement
because otherwise it will just keep
executing and printing out all these
statements so let's just go ahead and
give you example of a switch so for
example
I'm going to define a variable named
best game and I'm going to have a value
of string value of StarCraft and then
I'm going to just paste this code here
so in the case the game is Starcraft the
best strategy game of all time your rock
blazer is going to be printed out then
we break to exit the switch in case it's
the witcher this code is going to be
executed etc so in our example since the
best game is Starcraft ok Starcraft this
statement is going to be executed the
best strategy game of all time your rock
blizzard okay so those are conditionals
and now let's move on to loops the first
loop I want to show you guys is the for
loop so we got three expressions here
and the first expression we define our
counter in the next expression we have a
conditional expression which is going to
define when the loop is going to be
ended so until this condition is true
the loop is going to keep going and
finally we have a modifier of the
counter in expression 3 which we either
increase or decrease the counter or
modify it in any other way so the loop
will continue executing statements
within the curly brackets as long as the
conditional expression which is
expression to a value is to true when it
evaluates to false the loop will end and
the I duration in the loop is something
that repeats the code so every iteration
the code is repeated the expression 1 is
only executed during the first iteration
so when the when the loop is run the
first time this expression 1 is read but
during the next iteration this
expression 1 is ignored and the easiest
way to understand any loop is if
expression is true then continue looping
and if it's Express
- is false then exit the loop alright
now let me show you an example just
clear out this code here a little bit
okay so for example for I equals 0 I is
less than or equal to 10 so just a
classic example I plus plus and then
we're going to echo out AI and use the B
are constant so this is going to print
out the eye 10 times zero one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten just
like we wanted to and that's the basic
syntax for the for loop now let's go
ahead and loop through our
multi-dimensional array that we have
created earlier okay so I'm going to say
for T equals zero key less than count
and then our game genres genres array
key plus plus so basically what I'm
doing is I'm using the function count
which counts how many how many elements
are inside the array in this case it's
going to be how many elements one two
three four five so it's going to read
the count game genres it's going to
return five and it's going to keep
looping just going to comment this count
equals five and then I'm going to echo
out gonna he'll go ahead and echo out
game genres genres key and then use the
V are constant and then let's see what
happens
notice aerate the string conversion so
what happened is we try to access that
key one that we talked about earlier and
it didn't print it out because well it's
trying to access the array data type but
it did print out strategy MMORPG and FPS
which means let's see if we go back here
strategy MMORPG and fps now why did I
skip RPG one or skipped RPG because key
0 hm
let me just cut this out and bring it
back here
okay so RPG should have been printed out
but it didn't hmm strategy FPS okay
I'm just going to debug this then Oh huh
oh okay so it messed up okay all right
well let's go ahead and actually in
order to print out this
multi-dimensional array we need to check
if key one is a data type array and
there's a function to do that so we're
going to go ahead and create an if
statement inside this loop and say if is
array game genres key then we want to
create an outer loop and this one is
going to go key to equals zero key to
lesson count game genres and it's going
to count the key and I increase the key
by one and then echo out that game
genres all right here using that multi
square bracket syntax that we talked
about earlier okay so that's going to be
our if statement else else is just going
to print out the regular array just like
that and this should work yep now it's
printing out all the multi-dimensional
array values now guys this is a little
bit advanced here but just go through it
and look at this chart a few more times
and you'll get it so when we get to the
key one we're just checking if it's an
array just like specified by function is
underscore array and here we have a key
so we know that we have that we're
accessing key one here and now when it
gets to 1 the is array is true so we
create another loop to loop through all
the values of our secondary and our
secondary has three values so the count
is going to be 3 instead of 5
so the count count is three and here
count count equals count is five so
because the secondary only has three
keys okay alright so and then we use the
the double we set the second key to zero
and we also loop through it by using the
second set of square brackets so just
play around with a little bit more and
look at the chart and eventually you
understand what's happening okay let's
keep going here finally I want to show
you the for each loop and for each loop
we use it to loop through the
associative array so this array here
because we can use the for loop since
for loop only loops through numeric Keys
okay so I'm going to loop through ears
as game here this is our for each loop
let me pull up syntax chart okay for
each expression one expression to an
expression 3 so expression 2 is going to
have the key of the array and then this
variable key is going to get assigned to
the actual key of the array and then the
expression 3 which is a value variable
it's going to be assigned a value so let
me print out an example so echo game was
released in year and then the B are
constant okay so the game is going to
get assigned the actual the actual value
of the key and year is going to be value
so let's see here okay so the nonce the
wrong one anyway let's see what happens
here
okay Starcraft was released in 1998 so
Starcraft is a key 1998 is value the
witcher was released in 2009 the witcher
is the key 2009 is a value the Mass
Effect is the key the Mass Effect 3 is a
key 2013 is value and then finally
Diablo is the key and 1996 is the value
so you can see how the game is going to
sign the key and ear has been assigned a
value so that's how you loop through an
associative array and then finally
there's two other loops in PHP called
while in do-while and network very
similar to the for loop basically what
they say is wildly expression is true
keep looping and then the do-while
basically the difference between these
two is do-while execute the statement
during the first iteration for sure
while the one while the while loop first
iteration is not guaranteed so let me
just show you a quick example of that
not to get too confusing just going to
paste these loops here so the first one
I is less than 10 keep printing I I plus
plus and start the I with is 0 and then
second one see basically the same thing
print out the C ok so we got two loops
printed out doing the same thing and
just to show you the difference if I did
this here so I change the operator to
greater than this would be immediately
false here so you want to print anything
but in a do-while it would print it out
because because the condition is
evaluated at the end of the iteration so
which so 0 has been printed out by the
do-while loop
because first we do so we print out the
statement which is zero C equals zero
and then at the end we do the comparison
iteration so that's the difference
between these two I hope that makes
sense
finally I wanted to show you guys what
classes and objects are all about in PHP
so here is a very basic syntax of the
object and the difference between class
and an object you can think of an class
as an abstract concept like a for
example an animal or a car and an object
is something that lives in the real
world like a car type is a red Ferrari
for example and when you when we create
the object we use a new keyword which
creates the object instance of the class
and when that happens the object
inherits all the variables and functions
of that class now the variables in the
class are called properties and the
functions are called methods and we use
the this object operator we'll just call
it a dart to access all the variables
and functions inside the class
okay so objects in class are a little
bit advanced and I think if I show you
an example it will make a lot more sense
so here we go let's define a class
called car and we define every class
using a class keyword and then we're
just going to create some properties
which are the variables inside a class
and we use VAR key or today to do that
so we're going to have var make bar type
var color bar max speed so those are all
their properties or variables and then
I'm also going to define that constant
BR because we can use the original one
because this is inside a class which is
a different scope and then we're going
to define the functions as well inside
this class and we're going to output
some messages now just to make this
video a little shorter I'm just going to
copy and paste all this code here and as
you can see all our variables and then
there's a bunch of functions and what
these functions do is they basically
output text message for example
accelerate this this color this make
this type is now accelerating so it's
going to have the values of the object
place them here in place of the this
color it's going to be the actual color
of the car instead of this make it's
going to be the actual make of the car
and instead of this type it's going to
be the actual type of the car and the
way so this is a car class clock car and
it's in it's like a abstract concept
right now in order to actually create
our car here's what we do
for example let's define a variable
called Acura and assign and create the
object using the new keyword new car car
is our class so now the object has been
created object is created and now we can
do something like this we can access
those properties using the dart and
assign all kinds of values to our
properties color it goes black and then
and then I'm just going to paste all
these other things here so basically
what I'm doing here is I'm taking up
creating the copy I'm creating the
instance of the car class and I'm
creating an object out of it so Acura is
now an object Acura is now an object
data type
and then I'm assigning all the variables
which are present inside a class and I'm
creating the values out of those
variables and then I'm also using the
same dart symbol I'm calling all the
functions which are also part of the
class and if we go to the output the
black occurs our sex is now accelerating
is honking loudly has turned on the
right signal so all these functions are
being used and the valleys are being
replaced by the actual values that we
have created in the class and finally
it's using the information function
which prints out all the information
about the car to the screen so make
accurate type our sex color black max
speed 140 okay hopefully this is not too
confusing I will cover classes and
objects in another video but I just
wanted to give you guys a feel for what
the classes and objects are all about
and just think of them as think of the
classes as a collection of variables and
functions and objects as basically a
copy of that class or more correctly an
instance of that class which can utilize
all of its variables and functions and
we can provide the values for whatever
properties that class has and we can
invoke or we can call all the functions
which that class has as well once we
have our object okay so you can play
around with this a little bit more and I
think you'll understand how it works and
this is a very basic class in PHP okay
let me see what else I got here okay
guys this concludes the introduction
video to PHP now before you go
before you go there's a lot of great
graphics like a bunch of these cheat
sheets that I've created which we have
which you've seen in this video and I've
also created a bunch of study guides for
you with all kinds of arithmetic
operators array operators assignment
operators comparison operators etc I
also created these tables where we
covered arrays so you can understand
these a little bit more and I've also
have a dark effect theme which I've used
in the NetBeans IDE here here's what it
looks like so that's pretty cool right
so you can go ahead and download all
these in the link one sec okay so these
are all the graphics and study guides
and cheat sheets and themes that you can
download by clicking on this link here
and you will be asked for your email
address and don't worry I won't be
sending you any spam I'll only be
sending you great videos like this with
all the awesome graphics and downloads
in the future so that you never have to
subscribe to geek again so go ahead and
download all of that and lastly please
like and share this video with your
friends and also make sure to watch the
next video and which I'll be covering
PHP variables in more detail till next
time clever take it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
