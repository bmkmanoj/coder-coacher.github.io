tikki and in this video we're going to
learn about PHP C URL okay so C or L
stands for client URL and it's a library
that lets you make HTTP requests in PHP
I'm just going to refer to it as curl
because it's just easier for me to say
that so we create first of all we create
the curl resource with curl initialized
function that's the first step the
second step is to set curl options using
peril set opt function and finally the
third step is to run curl or execute the
HTTP request with Carol execute function
and there's a fourth step where we can
close curl resource with curl underscore
close function to free up the resources
so that's how we create curl requests
now let's go ahead and actually create
one okay so I'm going to create the
variable curl and initialize the
resource now the curl is going to be
datatype Carolla resource and when that
happens when we have a curl resource
we're able to use functions that are
specifically designed for that resource
like curl underscore set opt which is
what I'm going to do here I'm going to
curl set opt resource curl resource and
then I'm going to use this constant curl
opt underscore URL and provide actual
URL which we which is going to be loaded
on in the curl and then I'm going to
execute the command with Carol exact and
that's how we create Carol requests
let's go ahead and test that okay so
I've just loaded this file in a browser
and happy Halloween Google is being
loaded using our Carol request awesome
so that's how you create curl requests
now
let's do something more fun I'm going to
go ahead and go to amazon.com now and
for the amazon.com they actually use the
HTTPS protocol and in order for us to
load this page we're going to set our
curl opt SSL verify here to false so
that's just one of the other curl
options so I'm going to use the same
function here provide our resource and
then the constant is curl opt SSL verify
here and then false and then here I'm
going to load amazon.com and then go
back to the browser and see what happens
and now you can see that the PHP curl is
being loaded and the amazon.com is being
loaded dynamically now so that's how
that works and if I comment out this
option here nothing's going to show up
because it because Amazon is using the
HTTP protocol it's not going to work
because it's it's a secure protocol so
make sure to set this verify period to
false if you know getting a load Amazon
ok so what I'm going to do here is go
back to amazon.com and we're going to do
something fun now I'm going to go /as
and then for the field keywords just
type this in underscore as I mean form
slash as and then forward slash field -
keywords equals BC videogames 2016
that's how we create a search on Amazon
using that kind of URL and what you're
going to see here is just a bunch of
video games show up on PC video games
for 2016 and now what we're going to do
is I'm going to go ahead and match every
image of the game and then we're going
to print them out in
visually into our script so in order for
us to do that I'm going to go ahead and
open up my developer tools here in
chrome and I'm going to go ahead and
click on inspect and click on this image
here and on the right hand side I'm
going to get a bunch of code here and if
I roll my mouse over this URL here this
image is going to pop up so that's the
URL that I want to match so I'm going to
double click on this copy this whole URL
okay um hold on one sec so I'm just
going to copy that and then I can close
the developer tools and go back to
coding okay so for now I'm just going to
leave this URL here for for matching
later and there's a lot of option that
you can set called Carol set opt curl if
I set the option to curl opt underscore
return transfer true and then I went
back to the browser nothing is going to
show up so what this option does here is
we're able to store the result in a
browser instead of I mean in a variable
instead of instead of a automatically
printed it in a browser so I can say a
result equals Carol execute the curl and
let's go ahead and also close Carol here
free up system resources so now the
result is going to be stored in the
result so all the HTML instead of being
printed out to the browser automatically
is now stored inside the results so if I
went ahead and echo that out it's going
to print out the Amazon stuff here now
let's actually go ahead and create that
search URL instead so I'm just going to
create on our variable here called URL
and then copy this thing here and then
going to close that in double quotes and
then /s filled keywords equals and then
I'm actually going to create another
variable called search string
it calls PC videogames 2016 for example
and then I'm just going to put that
inside of this string and for the URL
I'm just going to put the URL variable
here so now if i refresh this page
nothing is showing up for some reason um
okay I missed this misspell this field
keywords make sure that spelled right so
now this uh this page is being loaded
with PC video games just like I wanted
to so at this point I can use preg match
all function to match all those image
names so and that's what I'm gonna do
here brag match all and then I'm just
going to copy this URL that we copied
error earlier and in this image URL
basically anything this part is always
going to stay the same because that's
how amazon's what that's where amazon
stores its images and this part is also
going to stay the same so the only part
is going to change is this identifier
here which is a unique image name so i'm
going to insert some regular expression
here and I'm going to say match
everything about spaces basically so
this is the regular expression to match
any character bought the space and don't
worry about if you don't understand this
for now I'm going to create another
video about regular expressions later
for now just understand that it's
matching anything except spaces so it's
going to match a bunch of these you
RLS which are going to contain this URL
here and at the end it's going to have
the u.s. 160 underscore dot jpg so and
for the matching I'm going to actually
provide our kernel resource result and
store that inside matches variable and
now if we print it at that out matches
let's see what happens okay it looks
like it's matching all the image names
now so I just went to view page source
to view the array and actually this is
exactly what I wanted so as you can see
it's matching all these URLs just like I
said with different image identifiers
here so so what it does is just goes
through the page and finds all those
image URLs and matches all of them so
next let's see so let's go ahead and
print those images out to the browser
now first of all I'm going to go ahead
and make sure there's no duplicate
values in this array because right now
looks like there's some duplicates yep
there's it's matching duplicate URLs
which is not what we want so I'm going
to use a going to say images equals
array unique matches matches 0 and now
if i refresh this page go to view page
source messed up hmm matches Stratus
huh images are a unique way wet print
are matches okay so this one is matches
zero then let's try this
okay so images equals array unique
matches zero oh forgot to print that
okay now print the array back and okay
so now the array is unique so it's
printing it's matching and printing only
the unique images and now also the array
keys have been messed up so I'm going to
use another function called array values
to reset the array keys back to normal
so the array keys that have been now
reset to 0 from 26 and now we're ready
to print out those images to the screen
which is what I ultimately want to do
here so I'm going to create a loop to
loop through the array here
okay and then I'm just going to copy and
paste this piece of code here okay so
what is going to do is going to loop
through all these images and it's going
to use the image IMG HTML tag and it's
going to say image source equals
whatever the URL of the image that we're
matching is and if I go to back to the
browser now hold on okay let's load the
browser and it should print all those
image names yep
so that's what I wanted to do here I
matched all the image names and then
I've created a loop to loop through all
those images and output them into the
browser so that's one of the examples
that you can what you can do with curl
you can load some page on a website and
then you can then you can match all
those image names and format them format
the content in whatever way you want so
if I change the string here for example
to movies movies 2015 for example
refresh the page now all the movies have
been matched and printed out because
we've searched we search for the movies
now so that's an example of curl and if

you next time
