tikki and in this video I'm going to
cover PHP functions in more detail now
just a quick review we define a function
using the construct function followed by
the name inside the round brackets we
have functions arguments separated by a
comma and you can think of arguments as
future placeholders for the actual
values and when we call a function we
use a function name again the round
brackets and inside we have the
parameters separated by the comma and
the parameters are the actual values for
the arguments so these parameters are
going to be passed over to the arguments
and inside functions code they're going
to be modified or printed out or
whatever alright so let's go ahead and
go over some function basics here first
of all I'm going to define this constant
that I always define called HTML tag BR
and then let's create a function named
multiply and always going to do is
multiply two numbers together very very
basic function just to illustrate the
syntax and I'm going to use a keyword
return to return two values 1 times 2 so
so what the return does is it basically
you can store the return as a value so
if I call this function here and use two
values 5 and 6
nothing will happen in the output
because because that valley is returning
is being returned back to as a variable
basically so I would need to echo the
value out and now you can see 30 is
showing up here now if you wanted to
directly print the value to the screen
we can do so by just using the echo
inside a function and say echo 1 times 2
and now if I use multiply print
five and ten this value as you can see
has been printed out direct directly to
the screen without me using an aqua
keyword because I already use that in
the function so just a little
distinction between the return and
printing the values directly alright
let's go ahead and move on here
okay so let's define a function that
will print some basic information about
a person and inside functions arguments
you can actually specify what kind of a
datatype you're going to include so if I
specified array here this functions
first parameter is only going to take
array as as its value so we use it print
our function here so if I use this
function here print info and I specified
something like string here I would get a
catchable fatto fatal error argument one
pass to print info must be of type array
string given so so if I did array now
named pirate a key now I have my array
being printed out so you can use these
what are they called basically they're
called type declarations so you can
specify what kind of a type a functions
argument is going to take in as a
parameter and that's how you that's how
you do that okay you can also have some
default values here like for example let
me just go ahead and define an array
with some of my information my info
called my info
and I'm just going to have my basic
information in there like like name
smile name age 33 and gender em and job
very techie okay it should be enough for
now now I'm just going to insert this
array inside a function just to make
sure it's still been print it out okay
that's cool now let's go ahead and print
this array out using for each loop I'm
just going to loop through the array
inside the function and print out its
values and what I want to do here is
print it out inside a table so I'm just
going to paste this HTML here and all it
does is just a bunch of HTML with that
table table tags and you want to make
sure that you're going to be doing this
you want to make sure that the table tag
is printed out outside the actual array
and inside the inside the loop we're
going to print out the actual table rows
and table cells and what I want to do
here is just capitalize the function
func arrays key now I have two table
cells and the value okay the value is
going to be concatenate and end table
row so now you should go you guys should
have this table okay so hold on second
our cell padding okay for now I'm just
going to set it to ten
and I'm defining the variable color and
color I'm just going to set it to light
green for now okay so now we got a this
nice nice looking table so let's see
here okay okay so I wanted to show you
guys this default variable for example
if I had another argument here I could
set it to light blue as by default so
now this and if I pass this variable
instead of a BG color here we have our
tables color as blue now as you can see
I'm not using any variable here as a
parameter when I'm calling this function
so so that's what it means to have a
default value for it for the variable
inside your functions arguments or in
place of your arguments and that and
then specify in this variable the second
parameter is going to be optional so now
if I specify it if I say something like
light green table is going to become
light green because I've specified this
parameter it's been passed to the
argument and our argument is being used
for the table BG color here okay so
that's how that works and those are the
default argument values let's add
another one here here called cellpadding
equals 10 that's what I was trying to do
before and place that instead of that
and so now the default cell padding is
going to be 10 but if I set it to 20
here our table has grown in size and
that's also optional because that is a
default value so whenever you have a
default values for the arguments those
parameters that we call are going to be
optional they're not necessary now just
to be careful not to do something like
this like if you expect to pass two
arguments like this and you're trying to
pass cell padding as a parameter you
have skipped the color and and it thinks
that you're trying to pass color as
and and now our table is all black
because that's not how it works
so just make sure to pass the parameters
on the left before you before you decide
to pass the values to the parameters on
the right basically ok so let's leave
the color as light green for now and
cellpadding is going to be default so
okay so inside the functions you can
also do something like like you can have
a function name as a variable in PHP so
if I name my function just to show you
an example very simple print info so
this variable we can use that variable
as a placeholder for the actual function
name so if I used the same call here
with a slightly different parameters now
I have a second table being printed out
here in paint color and as you can see I
used I used function name as a variable
and because the variable names is string
print info it's perfectly legal in PHP
to use it as that okay so this is that
and also you can print you can use
functions inside other functions so here
I have some code that's going to print
it out if if the value of the of H is
over 21 it's going to print out these
extra tags here and what I'm doing here
is just adding extra table cells and
then I'm using the function multiply
that we created earlier and inside the
function I'm also using a built-in
function called rent and the random
function just picks a number from 1 to
50 in this case and then multiplies the
two numbers together so if I keep
refreshing this output you can you'll be
getting these random numbers in both
tables which are being multiplied by
each other and
and the reason I use this is I just
wanted to show you guys how you can use
functions within the functions and in
the notes here I put functions have
global scope so you can use functions
anywhere in your program on the other
hand if I had a declared a variable
inside a function called local for
example and I said local I live only
inside the function this is true local
variables live the variable that I
defined inside a function only live
inside that function so if I echo out
local here you can see that local I live
only inside the function but if we try
printing that local variable outside the
function you would get notice undefined
variable local and that's how the gloww
scope works inside the function the
scope is local local scope outside the
function the scope is global now if we
wanted to use a variable which is
defined inside the function and use it
outside the function in a global scope
we'd use a keyword called global and now
we can use and we can define it like
this and give it a value because that's
not the proper syntax we first need to
use the global keyword and then and then
assign whatever value we'll want to that
variable like for example global I'm I'm
all over the place okay so actually
single quote and now if I try to print
in global Global I'm all over the place
is been printed out because we have
defined that variable as global so
that's how the local and global scope
works now just a few more things there's
something called the recursive functions
recursive functions and those are
basically functions that call themselves
so let's define a function called
recursion and it's going to take 1 it's
going to have 1 argument and then we're
just going to print
a equals 10 less than 10 echo a and then
recursion so that's how we call the
function inside itself so this is a
function that calls itself recursively
and then if we if we called it here from
0 pass the 0 to it it's going to print
number 0 to 10 and that's recursion a
function that calls itself so when you
define a function recursive function
just make sure to have an end to that
function otherwise you're going to have
a problem because that function can run
forever so just like just like a loop a
function where where the loop has to
have a condition that will eventually be
false
same goes same same is true for the
recursive function ok so that's that's a
recursion and then lastly passing
function parameters via reference and
I'm just going to paste this code here I
have to make this video a little shorter
and so basically the way you pass
arguments by reference is by using m and
ampersand before the argument and then
when you use a variable outside function
and you call the function and as you can
see all it does is adds an extra string
to the existing string so we're starting
off with this is a string and then we're
adding and something extra to that
string so normally normally something
extra wouldn't be visible but since
we're adding the ampersand and passing
the argument by reference then we can
use we can modify the parameter inside
the function so something extra has been
printed out so just to you can free
remove remove the admin and percent all
of a sudden we just have this is a
string
which is the parameters not being
modified and it just has a default value
outside of the function so that's how
that works and that's it for PHP
functions I hope you guys enjoyed this
