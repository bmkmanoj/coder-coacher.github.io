and in this video we're going to learn
about PHP switch statement okay so this
is the basic syntax of the switch
statement we have a keyword switch
followed by the expression inside the
round brackets and then in between the
curly brackets we have keywords case
followed by the value and a colon and
break followed by the semicolon so what
this means is its expression value is to
0 then we want the following code
executed and then we end the execution
with a keyword break if we don't use the
keyword break after after code then all
the following cases will also be
evaluated and the code will also be
executed and I'll give you an example on
how that works a little bit later now
the default keyword will be executed if
none of the other cases match so if our
expression will evaluate it for example
5 then that code will be executed so it
is important to use break if you don't
want all the following cases to be
executed and the switch statement can be
written in an alternative form like so
so instead of curly brackets we can use
a colon and instead of the ending curly
bracket we can also use and switch
followed by the semicolon so that's the
switch statement syntax for you and now
let's go ahead and create a little
script to see how it works in practice
ok so I'm just going to create a not an
array called animals and I'm just going
to put 3 animals in it cat dog and duck
and then I'm going to use the switch
statement and for the expression I'm
going to put in our array and then I'm
going to use an array random array rent
function to pick out a random key from
the array and so at this point is going
to randomly pick out cat dog or duck and
that's the value which we're going to
get so we're going to write case
Colin echo now so I'm just going to put
in the sounds which the animals will
make in all our cases which is cat dog
and duck okay for the document put echo
woof and finally don't forget to break
that and case duck I'm going to close
echo clock also break okay and that's a
basic program and going to go ahead and
run it now and refresh the page keep
refreshing and it's going to as you can
see it randomly puts out different
animal sounds based on the counter kind
of a random array key and value which
has been picked out from the array okay
so that's a basic example of the switch
statement now let me show you a for
example on if we added the default
keyword here and we could say something
like unknown animal detected run for
your life
probably a good idea to run for your
life forever
unknown animal and here I would put
something like monster and now if if
none of the other cases have been
matched so it's not not if it's not a
cat it's not a duck duck it's not a dog
then the default case is executed which
is monster and in that case unknown
animal detected run for your life is
executed and if we keep hitting random
as you can see it keeps selecting it
once in awhile
randomly okay so that's how the default
works and okay so now I want to show you
another example if we simply don't use
breaks and I'm going to give you I'm
going to pick create a variable
name speed I'm going to say 65mph so
this is going to be like a car example
where we're going to be speeding okay so
I'm going to say switch speed and then
I'm not going to type all of that I have
always typed up already but basically
it's going to give you a different
message based on what kind of a speed
you have here so in case it's 65 mph
which is the value right now we're going
to say you're going the speed limit
responsible driver 95 is going to say
well they're slowed down you're way over
the speed limit
135 Paige is going to say did you forget
about your brakes and 250 you must be
driving a Bugatti okay so you can see
that I haven't used any of the brake
keywords here so let's see what happens
okay so as you can see it's printing out
all the messages so that's exactly what
happens when you use a switch without
brakes so if I use the brake here and
then refresh the page all of a sudden
only that case is executed you're going
to speed limit responsible driver now if
I set it to something like 135 here
there's no brakes
after 135 so it's also going to print
out the following case as well so did
you forget about your brakes you might
be driving a Bugatti and so in a similar
way use brake here refresh the page and
then it stops the execution right after
that case is matched so that's exactly
how the brakes work and then the final
example I want to show you a case
grouping so we're going to create a new
array named species and we're going to
do similar thing put some animals inside
of these species and some insects as
well
and this is going to be a combination of
using cases called case grouping so I'm
going to use the switch statement here
and also we're going to use the same
function array rent that we used
previously which is going to pick out
the random mob random value from the
array and then we can say case cat okay
dog Colin and case cow Colin echo week
are animals and then we're going to stop
the execution with a break also we're
going to say case fly Colin is V Colin
and case and Colin echo we are in six
break okay just to okay so what I've
done here is I grouped all the animals
from the air a cat dog and cow and I've
also grouped all the insects from the
array which is fly B and end and so you
can see that after we have selected it
as a specific value would I have to
immediately follow that by any kind of
code and so this is called case grouping
where we group a bunch of values
together and then we specify whatever
code we want to execute based on the
selected three values here and then we
end the execution with a break so that's
how Keys grouping works and finally an
alternative way to write switch
statement would be this we just replace
the opening curly bracket with a column
and we replace the closing curly bracket
with and switch semicolon so that's just
an alternative way to write a switch
statement and finally I have a practical
function
with a switch statement that I found
which is pretty cool it's called a gate
get Chinese zodiac and you specify the
ear for for the property for the
argument and it's going to print out the
Chinese New Year based on the years that
you specify so here you can see that
I've at going out and then the function
name and I'm specifying this parameter
which is 2017 which is the current year
and let's see what happens sprinting out
rooster and it's going to find any
Chinese New Year's name based on the you
provided so I enter my birth ear and I
click Save immediately I know that I'm I
was born in the year the board and you
can obviously put in your year whatever
year you're born in and it's going to
work in that way as well so that's just
a pretty cool function and it uses the
modulus operator to figure that out and
then it print it actually returns these
values based on based on all the cases
so so now you know pretty much
everything about the PHP switch
statement and I hope you guys found this
video useful also I have a text version
of this video on a website so make sure
to check it out too if you want the
source code and if you prefer to follow
the text version go ahead and check out
my website clever take it calm and
that's it for this video I'll see you
next time
