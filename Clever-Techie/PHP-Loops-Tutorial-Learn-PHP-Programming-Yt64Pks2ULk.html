in this video we're going to learn
everything about PHP loops alright so
there's four kinds of PHP loops the
first one is a for loop and this loop
consists of a word or keyword for and
three expressions inside the round
brackets so the first expression we set
the value of the counter you usually to
0 and then we separate that with a colon
followed by the second expression now
the second expression is a conditional
expression and when that expression
evaluates to true the loop exits and
then the expression 3 is a modifier and
usually we increase the modifier or
modify it in any other way to keep the
loop going and inside the curly brackets
we have the actual statements which is
the code that will be executed over and
over as the loop runs its I iterations
okay so that's the for loop next one is
a for each loop and for each loop is
usually used to loop through the
associative arrays but you can use it to
loop through any other array or use it
for anything else as well so you usually
have your associative array then you use
the as keyword followed by the the key
which is the variable that will be
storing the arrays key and then you use
the rocket operator followed by the
value and the value variable is going to
store arrays value and that's if your ID
rating through an associative array and
then also inside the curly bracket so
you have your code okay so the next one
is a the next two are while and do-while
loops okay so the while loop the keyword
while and then expression and the
expression runs until it's until
expression is true so in the do-while
loop you have a you have a do and and
then the while the expression is
evaluated at the end of the statement
unlike the while loop so in
in this case in the case of the do-while
loop fix the loop is going to be I rated
at least once because the expression is
evaluated at the end of the loop so the
first iteration is always guaranteed
okay so those are the four loops now
let's let me show you the actual syntax
okay so I'm just going to use this code
here that I've prepared and use the PHP
tag first okay so basically what it is
is it's the code just to read the files
from the directory called movies and
then the the scan their function reads
that directory into an array called
files and then I use the array
underscore div function to get rid of
the double dot in the dot which is what
happens when we use the skander function
and then we use the array values
function to reset the array back to its
original key values so on the right side
you can see the final result of using
all these functions and all that is is
just in a numeric array with a bunch of
file names file names in it so now I'm
going to use our for loops to iterate
through through this array and using
these four different loops so first of
all the for loop I'm going to say count
keep plus plus and all of these arrays
are just going to do the same exact
thing you just want to show you the
syntax of these loops okay so now I'm
looping using the for loop and the count
function just counts the array elements
in this case it's going to return eight
because there's a total of eight array
elements including the zero and then we
set the counter into zero then we set
the condition run until basically the
key is less than eight and then
and increase the key by one and then
keep printing the array with the key
inside and the key is going to be
increased by by 1 every time starting
with 0 and I've inserted the B are
constants so that we get the end of the
line break statement in in the in the
browser so as you can see it's printing
out all the file names file names ok so
now I'm going to use a for each loop to
accomplish exactly the same thing and
this is the syntax just like was
illustrated and just going to do the
same exact thing and this is going to
output these files again now I'm going
to use a while loop and before using the
while loop I'm going to set the key to 0
and then say while key count files so
it's basically just exactly the same
thing with just a little bit of syntax
adjustment and then key plus plus is
going to be at the end here and I'm
going to insert the BR constant so that
we can clearly see what's going on so
that's printing the files again and then
lastly I'm going to use the do-while
loop and also set the key to 0 here do
and then the expression files key and B
are so same code and key plus plus and
then while key less than count files and
then don't forget to end that with a
semicolon and insert another BR constant
here ok so these are the for loops first
is the first one is the for loop next
one is the for each followed by the
while loop and then finally do while so
these these are the for PHP loops and
that's how you use that syntax to
loop through the numeric array using H H
and everyone loop and that's it for the
PHP loops if you guys found this video
