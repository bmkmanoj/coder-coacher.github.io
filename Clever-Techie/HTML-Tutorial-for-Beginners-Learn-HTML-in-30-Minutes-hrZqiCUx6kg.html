this video I'd like to show you how to
code in HTML so we can start creating
websites now before we begin let me show
you something here I have created some
files that are going to be using in the
video like these backgrounds diagrams an
HTML cheat sheet and some images that
I'm going to be using here in this video
and I've gone ahead and packed up all
these files in a zip file and if you go
to clever techie comm forward slash HTML
- video you'll enter your email and then
the system will automatically send you
that file so if you want all these files
go ahead and do that ok let's get
started here
first of all I'm going to be using
notepad plus plus to code in HTML and I
just created a new file here and I'm
gonna go ahead and save that file as and
when you're doing this with a notepad or
not put plus plus or whatever make sure
you choose all types and then your page
name I named page 1 that HTML and now we
can open that page in whatever browser
we want I'm gonna do Chrome
and and so here on the right hand side
we're gonna see how the interpreted HTML
code looks like alright so what the heck
is HTML let me show you here real quick
so HTML all it is is a bunch of tags and
this is what tags look like you got a
tag name surrounded by these angle
brackets that's your opening tag then
you got a closing tag which is the same
thing and it's going to have exactly the
same name as the opening tag with the
exception that is going to have a
forward slash right in front of the tag
name so that's your closing tag the
content like the text
images links and whatever goes in
between the opening and a closing HTML
tag now if we combine the whole thing
together with an opening closing tag and
the content in-between we get what is
called an HTML element all right let's
start coding some HTML here let me show
you some examples of the tags okay so if
I just type some random text here for
example this is my first website ever
it's going to be about baby animals at
the same time I'm going to learn how to
code HTML this is very cool exclamation
mark okay so if I just refresh this page
here in chrome I'll get exactly the same
text so nothing's going on yet okay so
let me give you an example right now if
I use this tag called strong on this
first sentence
you can see that this first sentence has
been bolded so what so what that strong
tag did to this sentence is just
formatted as bold and that's what strong
tag is supposed to do another example is
a e/m tag which stands for emphasize and
all it does is makes text italic so the
second sentence here it became italic
and if I wanted to for example underline
the fact that this is my first website I
can do an underline tag with au and that
will underline the word first so you can
see how you can use these HTML tags to
format your text and you can use other
HTML tags within within these tags
inside of them so we get like a nested
effect okay so this is a basic idea what
the HTML tags are now if you notice here
we have I put these sentences on three
different lines but if we look at the
browser it's all like one sentence
especially if I expand it like this you
can see how the whole thing is on one
single line so in HTML you gotta use a
tag called ER if you want to have the
text to head it stands for the breaking
line and if you want to have your
sentence show up on the next line this
is the tag you used you use now if you
notice this tag it's a unique tag
because it's called an empty M
empty HTML element because there's no
content that goes inside of this tag and
so it also doesn't have a closing tag so
it's just one opening and closing tag in
one and it's self closes with a forward
slash in between inside the tag that's
why it's also called itself
closing tag there's only a few of those
another example is a horizontal rule tag
and all it does it creates a horizontal
line just like you see here another tag
that I'm going to cover is the image tag
IMG and those are the only three
self-closing tags and I know of and
you're probably not going to run into
others but if you do you know what they
are now okay so those are the self
closing tags and another exception to
the standard HTML opening and closing
rule is the comment and this is a
comment comments are basically for for
the coder for the programmer to
understand the code better so I can say
strong tag stands for bold you know and
this is how we do it we use the same
angle brackets but it starts with the
exclamation mark with two dashes and we
close the tag with just two dashes
without the exclamation mark and the
young new angle bracket so that's
another exception to the rule and that's
pretty much it now let's see where we
are here okay so I'm not a set of tags
that you're going to encounter a lot is
called the heading tag called h1 now h1
is going to be your biggest heading then
there's h2 and as they go up in number
the heading is going to become smaller
and smaller you'll see what I mean here
in just a sec I'm just going to do this
up to h4 and say something like welcome
to my hobby pet site and then I'm just
going to copy this text and put it in
between these tags refresh the page and
as you can see the biggest heading as
the h1 the second is h2 h3 and then H 4
so it goes all the way up to h6 and it
becomes smaller and smaller as it goes
down so this is it really useful tag
for setting up your headings on your
website now there's also something
called nested HTML tags and these are
tags like for example an unordered list
tag ul and let's just put some text
inside of it like kitten and elephant
and piglet and if i refresh the page
here
as you can see created like a tab space
here but it doesn't really do anything
by itself so in order for this to work
we need what is called a list item
inside the UL tag I'm just going to copy
this list item tag to the other ones and
don't forget to close it and just going
to copy and paste now we got three list
item items inside of our unordered list
tag and as you can see this is a created
a bulleted list and this is called an
unordered list in HTML so you can see
how it's nested it's like the UL tag and
then there's Li tags inside of it okay
so if I did a Oh L that would be an
ordered list and now we change to one
two three which is an ordered list just
a numbered list that's all it is okay so
those are the nested HTML tags now okay
before moving on to more tags let me
show you how a typical HTML page
actually looks like okay so here's the
structure of every HTML page that you're
going to see first of all you got your
HTML tag and this is the main tag that
defines the HTML document and all the
other tags live inside of it after that
we got a head tag and just remember for
now that inside the tag is where you put
your title tag and title is going to
show up as a title of your webpage now
inside the tag inside the head tag we
also have stuff like JavaScript CSS meta
info
and other stuff that you include like
external scripts and CSS stuff like that
but don't worry about it right now just
remember about the title goes inside a
head and after the head we got the body
and this is the visible visible part of
the web page and most hTML is going to
live here and that's where we're going
to be putting all of our HTML ok this is
the structure and I'm just going to
update this document here too to correct
the structure because right now we don't
have the HTML tag so I'm going to create
that all that is going to go in between
then I'm going to create the head tag
with a title tag inside of it just like
that and also the body tag and all of
this HTML is going to be inside this
body tag okay and I'm also going to put
some kind of a title right now you can
see like here's a page one that HTML
which is not a title at the site so I'm
going to say best baby animals ever
refresh the page and now this is showing
up as a title just like we want okay
that's the structure of HTML and the
title tag now now let's get into the
attributes okay so what attributes do
here I got a this little picture here to
illustrate it a little bit better okay
so we got a tag name inside the tag name
we put an attribute name followed by the
eco sign and finally we put the value of
the attributes inside the double quotes
okay let me show you an example so you
guys understand what I mean here so for
example if I wanted to change my my size
background color I can use an attribute
called BG color and I can set it to any
color I want like light blue
save this file refresh the page boom the
collar has been set to light blue so
just like in the diagram we got the
attribute name followed by the equal
sign and inside the double quotes we got
the value now certain attributes will
only apply to specific HTML tags but
some attributes will also apply to other
tags like the BG color can apply to
other tags like I have like I'm showing
here in my cheat sheet
the BG color can apply to body table
table sell in table row and I'll get
into it in a little bit okay so what
else
let's see you introduced the font tag ok
well another thing you can do here is
for example if you wanted to change the
color something of the your text you
would use a font tag and a font tag has
a attribute name called color you can
set that to blue or 8th now red set it
to red and if I wanted to just do this
whole sentence close the font tag and
now the second one is going to be red
okay so those are attributes now instead
of using these color names as as actual
words like light blue red we can also do
something cool for example let me show
you something here let's go to a website
called w3schools and have my URL just
gonna paste it here now here you if you
go to this URL w3schools com4 slash
college photo slash colors underscore
picker ASP and pick a color any kind of
color for example I'm just gonna take
this pink color
well I pick this purple
here you're going to see this value
which starts with a pound symbol if you
copy this value and like as you change
the color obviously the value is going
to change so pick any color you want
copy this value it starts with a pound
tag and you can put this inside this
value for color and that's going to be
exactly your color so that's how you can
use what is called hex values to
basically choose any kind of color you
want instead of coming up with color
names like light purple and some other
names which might not be even HTML
values this is like the sure way to do
it alright so I just wanted to show you
this that part okay our body can also
have a different attribute called the
background and if we wanted to set our
background as a picture instead of
instead of a color we can do this you
can use the background attribute and
then since I have my backgrounds here
inside this BG folder I would have to
specify where it's located so I'm going
to be using clouds that jpg so for the
value I'm gonna set BG clouds that jpg
so you can see how this works here my
patients inside of this root directory
here but the clouds background lives
inside the BG folder so when I go to it
the clouds that jpg is right there so
that's why we're specifying BG forward
slash clouds that jpg which is the full
path to our clouds that jpg background
and now i refresh the page and you can
see all these cool clouds all right now
I already explained how we can have
multiple attributes apply to different
kind of tags now let me introduce a tag
called image IMG and this is how we
insert images into our
Paige so you start with IMG and the
attribute is SRC which stands for source
equals and then we self close this image
tag because there's no content that goes
inside of it and for the path we also
specify where this image is located in
this case I have this image inside of my
IMG folder and I'm going to use this
cute kitten here kitten that jpg so
IMG's photo slash kitten that jpg and i
refresh the page and I have my kitten
showing up here and I'm going to insert
that BR tag so the tags so the text goes
on the next line okay so that's an image
tag now while we're still on the paths
let me also introduce a link tag and the
way you create link is by using an a tag
which stands for anchor and this tag has
its own attribute called href and we can
create two types of links for example we
can link to another website like I'm
going to link to this URL here I'm just
going to copy and paste this whole URL
here and if you're going to be linking
to another website make sure you start
with HTTP and then type the full address
of whatever URL or website you want to
link to otherwise it's not going to work
now inside the a tag you also want to
enter some text like go to animal center
to adopt a kitten and then of course
don't forget to close the a tag and now
I have this link shown up here and if I
click on it it's going to open this page
where you can look at all these pictures
of cute little kittens
all right so if you notice this link
also opened in the same tab and if I
wanted to pour this link to open in
another tab there's a attribute for that
called target target equals blank and if
we test the page now and click on the
link you can see how it opened in
another tab so here what I did is
basically created another attribute
inside the a tag and you can place with
these attributes anywhere inside the tag
as long as they're followed by the equal
sign and the value and an all HTML tags
can have multiple attributes like for
example the image tag also has its own
attributes like besides SRC it has an
alt attribute and for the alt attribute
we can say kitten and for title is
another attribute you can say now now
what the alt attribute does is in case
the image is not found like I'm gonna
make it so it's not found on purpose
here this is the words is going to show
up here kitten and if I go back here and
fix that and then the title is going to
show up when you roll the mouse over the
image so as you can see it's saying now
now okay so those are multiple
attributes can be applied to the same
HTML tag to achieve all kinds of
different results and all the attributes
do is modify the way the HTML tag
behaves so we can set all kinds of
different values and change all kinds of
different elements of our webpage now
let's move on here and lastly I'd like
to show you guys tables okay and I've
created a diagram for that as well let
me show you real quick actually before
we do that let me show you another type
of link it's what I wanted to do first
okay
it so if I wanted to link to another
page on my site I would create the first
of all let's create another page file
new and I'm gonna save file as page to
that HTML and I'm just gonna copy this
whole thing so I don't have to type it
again and pretty much delete everything
inside the body tag and I'm just going
to leave everything else alone here and
here I'm just going to say something
like I am GSoC equals IMG elephant we're
going to put an elephant picture on this
page and let's see if that works I'm
just going to go to this page now page 2
okay I got my elephant picture here
because I have that picture inside the
IMG folder and now we're going to name
the title elephant refresh the page now
this page is called elephant okay so
from page one we can now link to page
two by simply specifying where page two
is located which pick and page two lives
inside the same directory so we can just
link to it in the in this way page two
HTML
visitor my friend elephant and close the
a tag so for the href instead of
specifying you know a full URL like that
I just said page two because it's
already on our computer so now if i
refresh
first of all let's create another br tag
here so it's more neatly organized and
if I click on it here it goes right to
page two where our elephant lives pretty
cool right okay those are the links and
finally I want to show you guys how to
create tables now this is what a typical
table looks like let's open it up here
okay so you got a table tag you got a
closing table tag inside the table tag
two types of tags called TR and a TD now
the TR stands for table row and as you
can see there's only two rows one and
two so the one row is in green color and
the other row is in another green green
color below the first row okay
got a little bit confused here and
inside our rows we got a table cells now
every table row has two table cells
within it and these are shown as in
orange and I just created this diagram
for you guys so you can understand it
better because it can be a little bit
confusing at first because you know
there's a lot of tags that make up the
whole table structure so you got the
whole table is blue table rows are green
and the table cells are going to be in
orange and inside the table cells is
where the actual content goes now let's
create the actual table so you'll see
what I mean here okay so I'm just going
to create the table cell here be a below
my h4 tag let's say table
close table right away then I'm going to
put the TR which is a table row close it
I'm going to put another TR close it and
then within the first table row I'm
going to put two table cells and close
them as well so we have exactly what I
just showed you in the diagram and I'm
just going to copy all these I don't to
type them again and also we can use a an
at should be called border equals black
actually border equals one and now you
can see how tiny this table is because
having to put in any content inside of
it so now we're going to put some
content for example I'm going to put
animal names inside of these
puppy leopard and kitten so now that I
put all these names here you can see the
table okay that's pretty much it for the
table
another thing cool thing about the table
is you can make it bigger or smaller by
using cell padding and cell spacing
attributes cell padding is going to
expand the actual space around the text
just like you see here and cell spacing
is going to increase exactly what it
says is going to increase which is the
cell space cell spacing as you can see
there's cell spacing between those cells
now now I finally I want to show you the
BG color attribute and how it can be
applied to the table basically if you if
we take a look here at our cheat sheet
again we can see how the BG color can be
applied to body table table cell and
table row so we can have all these
different elements of the table in
different color okay so for example if I
set the table BG color to say light
green our whole table is going to be
light green because we haven't specified
what kind of background we want for the
row or the cell now if I wanted the
first row to be something other than
light green can say maybe like yellow
now as you can see the whole row became
light yellow I want to just do yellow
because it's kind of looks white here
okay so there you go now if I wanted to
apply to individual cell I can do the
same exact thing and say something like
what other color is there you're just
gonna go back here
choose light pink or not white pink
white purple copy the value and insert
it here and bam now we have so basically
BG attribute can be applied to all
different kinds of to all kinds of
different elements within the table and
I think this is it just keep playing
around with HTML and have fun and
eventually you'll just realize how easy
it is because this is all it is it's a
bunch of tags and attributes with values
and as you play around with it you're
going to get used to it and all this
code is going to be really easy to
understand and I'll be I'll be putting
out another video on CSS where we're
going to get into some really cool stuff
on how we're going to be styling
websites and make it look really nice
