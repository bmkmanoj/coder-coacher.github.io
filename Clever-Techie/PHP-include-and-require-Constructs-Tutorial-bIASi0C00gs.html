tikki and in this video we're gonna
learn about include and require PHP
language constructs okay so this is
basic syntax of how these two can be
used in PHP so if we're going to include
a PHP file from within our HTML document
for example we would use the PHP opening
and closing tag and within with it we'll
have our PHP code now the include and
require are both language constructs
which means we can use them with or
without the round brackets so here I'm
using the include without the round
brackets and following it with the
actual file name that I want to include
which is one that PHP and I've
surrounded with surrounded the file with
single quotes and so suppose our file
had just one variable named name and it
had the value string value of vova and
when we output that text hi this is
variable name will have the output hi
this is vova because we have included
the one that PHP file which had the name
variable and now the variable is shown
up in our file where we are including
from ok so as you can see require works
in exactly the same way doing this same
thing we're including a file to that PHP
and it has it has a same variable named
name with a different value romo and
when we output that we have hi this is
rhomin so these two work exactly the
same when when it comes to syntax but
they are slightly different as you can
see here when use an include statement
the scrape will continue to run if the
file is not found so just use the
include if if the PHP file that you're
including is not required by the
application just as the word implies on
the other hand on the other hand require
will terminate the script and give you a
fatal error
if the file is not found so users
require when absolutely required when a
file when a file that you're including
is absolutely required by the
application okay so this is the basic
syntax and this is pretty much most
things that you need to know about
including require but let's go ahead and
dive a little bit deeper and see how
these actually work in action
okay so I've created two files here one
of them is named game that bhp and this
is the output here on the right hand
side and I also have welcome that PHP
and this is the output here as well so I
have them in two different tabs in a
browser okay so to get things rolling
here let's go ahead and create some
random variables inside of our game that
PHP file okay so I'm just gonna create
like three variables here one of them is
gonna be string I'm just gonna create a
game name which I really like the
witcher 3 and provide a cost and another
variable which is the developer okay so
three variables is gonna be enough for
now and from the Welcome that PHP I'm
just gonna say some random welcome
message like welcome to our of kisi
video game review website and then I'm
gonna use the include construct to
include the game that PHP in our file
and this is assuming that both of these
file are in the same directory if
they're not you'd have to specify the
complete directory for your file that
you're including okay so now that I've
included game that PHP in the Welcome
that PHP file and something okay so I'm
gonna view this file it's actually a
welcome I don't know why it's showing
game but anyway okay so now that I've
included game that PHP all the variables
from game PHP become available in the
welcome that PHP so I can go ahead and
output output those variables so I'm
just gonna type some random message
developed by developer you may purchase
the game at amazon.com for cost okay so
now let's see what happens and as you
can see welcome to our PC video game
review website today's feature game is
Witcher 3 The Witcher 3 developed by CD
Projekt RED you may you may purchase the
game at Amazon for thirty five sixty and
so those variables that were including
become available in the Welcome that PHP
so that's pretty easy now if we're going
to include basically all variables we'll
have variable scope from the line from
which they're been being included
however functions and classes which are
defined in the file that has been
included have global scope meaning
they'll be available anywhere in the
program including inside other functions
and classes okay so here's what I mean
let's create a function just a basic
function inside of our file that we're
including called message for example and
it's just gonna have a simple message
like welcome to our PC preview EPS
review website okay so in if inside the
welcome let's just delete this I had
another function and let's name this
function welcome okay so if I tried
outputting these variables inside the
Welcome function like and say name
let's just go ahead and delete this and
then I called the function here as you
can see it's showing undefined variable
name
that's because variables that are
included have a variable scope which
means they're only available from a
place where they're included so if I
included this file here within the
function all of a sudden this variable
would become available because we're
including it from the function local
scope as opposed to global scope outside
the function okay so that's how
variables behave now if I wanted to use
this function here a message I could
actually use it inside of welcome
because see welcome to our PC review
website which is a message that's been
printed here that that is because all
the functions and classes that are being
included have global scope which means
they'll be available inside and outside
the function so I can also put this
message I could put it outside a
function and it will still work so
that's the difference between variables
and functions that are being included in
the file and hopefully this makes sense
now moving on here let's see if if for
example I wanted to access okay so if I
wanted to include the game from within a
function as I already showed you we
could do this right call the function of
course okay so now the name is being
output it to the screen but if I wanted
to access the name from the outside of
function first of all I would get a
notice undefined variable because that
variable has functions local scope so
for that we would need to define the
variable as global using the global
keyword
so global name and now if I delete it
here the variable is available from the
outside of functions so when we are
including the another PHP file from
inside a function and we want to access
the variables from outside a function we
would use the keyword global to
accomplish that okay and let's just
let's see here so here's what will
happen if we just print it out named by
the Vale of prayer
okay so you can see that we are
accessing these variables again from
within the function which are named and
developer and they're being printed out
but if we did the same thing from the
outside of function here's what we get
undefined variable name in undefined
variable developer but hang on a second
name should have been available icon
what wait it just worked out mine ate
global name include game that PHP hacker
Oh
oh my god I forgot to call the function
of course sir
make sure you first call the function
and then output it because otherwise
nothing is gonna happen of course so you
do need to call the function first then
he'll be defined with a global keyword
and then include it from the file okay
so that's how that works and that pretty
much sums up include and require and
once again the the only difference
between the two is that include will
continue running the script that what
the file is not found and required will
give you a fatal error if the file is
not found and that's it for this video I
hope you guys found it useful I'll see
you next time clever take it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
