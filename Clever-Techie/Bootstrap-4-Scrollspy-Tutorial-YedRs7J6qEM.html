tikki and in this video we're gonna
learn how to create a scroll spy in
bootstrap for a scroll spy is used to
automatically update links in a
navigation bar based in a scroll
position and this is what a scroll spy
is going to look like you can see that
as I'm scrolling down the page the links
are being automatically updated in the
navigation bar we're also going to add a
drop-down submenu with a couple of links
which will do the same thing and we can
also click on any of these sections to
take us to the corresponding content on
the page alright let's go ahead and
create the scroll spy now before we get
started the scrolls by makes use of
JavaScript so make sure to include both
bootstrap j/s and bootstrap CSS files
and also make sure to include jQuery
before including bootstrap files alright
so first of all inside of our body tag
we're going to use a attribute named
data spy and we're going to define our
scroll area in the body tag so the value
is going to be scroll and we're also
going to define a target which is going
to be our navbar class using data target
attribute our class name is going to be
navbar make sure to include a dot with
this class name and there is another
optional attribute named data offset
which we're going to set in just a
moment but before we do let me show you
what it does so if I go back here to the
scroll spy you can see that as I'm
scrolling down the page the link is not
being updated at the very top of the
section it's already overlapping the
content so we can fix that with the data
offset so if I go back to the scroll spy
completed code here and add data offset
equals 50 refresh the page and then if I
scroll down here you can see that the
link has been updated right away at the
top of the page so that's what the data
offset does all right so we're just
gonna add it here data offset equals 50
all right so we've defined the data
target as net bar now let's create the
actual net bar on which the links are
going to be updated I'm going to go over
to this section very quickly if you'd
like detailed explanation of all the
bootstrap classes I'm going to be using
while creating this navbar you can watch
my video called responsive navbar with
bootstrap for all right so by looking at
this cheat sheet we can see that the
navbar is created with four HTML tags
nav ul Li and a and here all the
corresponding bootstrap classes that go
along with all these HTML tags so let's
go ahead and create the first one nav
with nav bar and nav bar expand classes
now class equals nav bar number expand
SM to make it responsive I'm also gonna
go ahead and add BG dark and navbar dark
to make it dark and finally sticky top
to make our navbar stick to the top of
the page as we're scrolling down I'm
gonna close the nav tag and next we got
ul and that one is just gonna use navbar
nav and the next two tags is to create
the actual links so we're gonna use a
lie with nav item and a with Neve link
so let's go ahead and add all those
three now ul plus equals navbar m li
class equals nav item and a class equals
nav link now we're gonna make this first
link active so just include active class
right in there
close the link close the eye as well
also we're gonna add an href which is
going to target the section on our page
so in this case it's going to be href
equals number content one and now I'm
just gonna copy this whole thing
to create more links and just change
this to content two three and four and
we're also gonna add this text content
one content to content three and content
for okay at this point our navbar is
almost complete the last thing that we
have to add on our navbar is an actual
drop-down menu so if we refer back to
the cheat sheet you can see how the
drop-down main is created which is gonna
use a job down clasp on the list item
we're also gonna use job down toggle on
a tag and we're also gonna identify our
drop-down menu with a job down - menu
and we're gonna use drop down items on
the links in the drop down menu
so let's go ahead and do all that right
now so our last link is going to be the
drop down menu so we're gonna add drop
down here and then inside of this Li
we're going to add the link so a class
equals nav link Oh actually we already
have it here so it's actually that link
okay so so for the content it's actually
not gonna have anything because the
actual link is not gonna go anywhere
because it's got sub links on it so
we're just gonna leave it as the pound
and four in order to make it first of
all this is not gonna be active here so
I'm gonna delete all these and then I'm
gonna say drop down
Tuggle and also we're gonna use an
attribute called data Tuggle equals
drop-down okay that's it for the link
lastly what we're gonna do here and
we're still inside the Li is we're gonna
add the actual submenu and that's gonna
be inside of a div class so div class
equals drop-down menu just close the div
down here and now all we have to that
all we have to do is add the two links a
class equals item equals number
these are sub sections that we're adding
here so I'm naming them content for one
and that's gonna be our section one and
the other one is gonna be the same drop
down item and that one is just gonna be
number content 42 for two section two
okay
at this point our navbar is complete
let's go ahead and see what it looks
like in a browser and this is what our
navbar looks like in a browser so far
you can see that the drop down link is
working and now all we have to do is add
the actual sections alright so before we
move on here I just wanted to fix a
couple of things real quick so instead
of enough bark it should be navbar and
instead of stick top it should be sticky
top so this is the reason our number 9
didn't look right so if i refresh the
page now this is what it actually should
look like all right let's go ahead and
add the sections now so we're gonna be
outside of our nav tag and inside of a
body tag and all we're gonna do is
create a bunch of the
dibbs with the same ID as we use in our
navbar as links so div ID equals content
one for the first one and we're gonna be
using bootstraps class called container
fluid for all of them in order to make
the div stretch across the entire page
and we're also gonna use different
background colors for all of them so for
this one I'm gonna use BG success to
make it green and let's also go ahead
and add inline styling and increase the
height of our divs with padding top and
padding bottom padding top 70 and
padding bottom 70 pixels close the div
also I'm gonna go ahead and include a
header with h1 name it content 1 close
the header and lastly I'm just gonna
include a couple of paragraphs here and
I already have this content ready so I'm
just gonna copy and paste it just to add
some random tags inside the div okay and
at this point I'm just gonna go ahead
and copy this whole thing 1 2 3 4 5 6
times and all I'm gonna do now is change
this to content to content to content 3
content 3 content for one because this
is a subsection and let's name it sub
sub section 1 this one is going to be
content for 2 which is a subsection 2
some section too and for the last one
it's not gonna have any ID because we're
not using it in a nutbar
I'm gonna delete this one that one is
extra just kind of name this the end and
at this point all we have to do is
change the different backgrounds so that
they're all different colors so for the
second one let's go ahead and use let's
see here I'm gonna use BG wording for
this one
BG primary for the third one BG danger
for section 1 PG info for subsection 2
and for the last one
which you're not gonna be using in an
MRI we're just gonna use PG secondary
she'll make it grey and with that our
scroll spice complete let's go ahead and
see what it looks like in a browser and
as I'm scrolling down the page here you
can see that the links are in fact
updating in a net bar and let's go ahead
and test our submenu click on section 1
section 2 and you can see that all of
that is in fact working we can also go
ahead and click on any of these links in
the navbar and it will take us to the
correct section and that's how you
create a scroll spy with bootstrap for I
