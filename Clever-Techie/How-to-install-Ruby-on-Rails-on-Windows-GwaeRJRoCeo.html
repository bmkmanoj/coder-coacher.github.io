techie and I'm going to show you how to
install Ruby on Rails on windows 7 now
let me just show you something real
quick here's an image created to
understand Ruby on Rails a little bit
better
ok so ruby is a programming language and
it stands on its own it doesn't really
really need anything else to you know to
run so you can code it will be without
rails and you'll be fine but rails is a
framework as a radius framework provides
additional functionality functions
libraries that make it a lot faster and
easier to develop websites and that's
why we want rails now you can see here
that Ruby has all these gems and gems
are you can think of them as just
additional functions libraries plugins
whatever you want to call them and rails
is just one of those gems and def kit is
what's gonna make it possible to
basically just install all these gems on
windows you know that's all that we're
gonna need it for now the only two gems
that I would just keep in mind for now
if you're new to Ruby and rails is
obviously rails jam and bundler gem what
bundler gem does is it manages and
installs other gems for you so for
example if you were if you're installing
rails as a rubies gem usually a big gem
like that with a lot of code and liners
and functions usually it will depend on
other gems which it does and basically
bundler gem takes care of that so rather
than installing all the gems it depend
holy gems that rails depends on
individually you'll just you
bond learn to install all those gems
automatically and then you'll see what I
mean later on so let's let's start
installing Ruby first
all right so open up the browser and go
to Ruby install org and I just press
this big download button now the one
that you want to get is definitely a
ruby 2.16 32-bit or Ruby 2 point 1 6
64-bit depending on what your operating
system is you don't want to get the
latest version because I've tested it
and the two point to point to doesn't
work on Windows if you want to spend
hours and days trying to figure out how
to make it work on windows go for it but
I would just definitely get the 2 point
1 6 which is the version that works on
Windows ok so I'm going to get the
64-bit which is the operating system I
have download that and if you scroll
down here I'm going to download the
development kit 32-bit and development
kit for 64-bit I'm going to get the
64-bit one download and just minimize
that go to the Downloads folder and just
on Ruby on Rails installer accept and
I'm just going to install it under C
Ruby just makes it easy to access you
guys can you just take your directory
and I'm going to check these two here
add Ruby executables to your path and
associate RB and on BW files with the
Ruby installation install just wait for
it install now and finish now I'm also
going to run the dev kit here and I'm
going to navigate to my Ruby directory
which is on computer C and then navigate
to the Ruby
the directory and I'm going to create a
new folder called dev kit just to keep
it all organized together and click OK
and I'm going to extract to that folder
click extract okay wait for it to
extract and then we're going to
configure our dev kit so that it works
with Ruby which will make it possible to
install gems later on so I'm going to go
to the directory where I'm extracted
left it which is here under Ruby defconn
and then here's what we're gonna do
hold shift + right mouse click anywhere
in this area I'm going to click here ok
so you guys can see open command window
here so you're holding shift and
pressing the right mouse button and that
will open the command under that
directory which we're in right now which
is what we want now go ahead and type
Ruby DKR be English in it I and I T and
that's the first step for configuring
your dev kit and then go ahead and type
Ruby decay that RB install now you might
get this error in valley configuration
while Ruby's listed please please fix
config that why am L so what you want to
do here is in the same folder go ahead
and open up the config dot yml and you
want to add your Ruby directory here
under these
on three dashes and you want to use a
dash before that just like that
otherwise it won't work and then just
enter your directory or you install the
Ruby make sure to use a forward slash
too and then just file save exit and
then we're going to open up the command
prompt here again and the same in a deaf
kid directory and then type Ruby decay
that are being slow again and you should
get these messages and that means it has
successfully configured deaf kit to use
with Ruby so that's taken care of all
right
next okay let's just go back to command
prompt here and we can type Ruby - V and
it's going to show up which version of
Ruby we're running so that means we've
successfully installed really and we
have it in our environment variables now
just to show you something real fast
that really actually works on its own
let's go back to our Ruby root folder
here and create a new folder and create
a folder named code enter that folder
and then I'm going to create a new file
text file and I'm going to call it
anything just called anything you want
I'm going to make it high dot RB which
is RB is a ruby extension and then I'm
going to create a little program a Ruby
programmer fast and I have my code here
that I'm going to paste so it's a very
basic type of Ruby program don't worry
about what all this means just go ahead
and copy this or just create your own
Ruby program if you know how to code in
Ruby and then I'm going to save and
close this and then just going to open
up the command prompt here again by
holding shift right click it and open
command window here and I'm just going
to type
I dot RB and the program works my name
is Walter I'm the boss and that's what
we have here that's what the player is
supposed to do so Ruby's all working
okay that's great now we're going to go
into the next part but before we install
the rails let me just show you something
else here you go to Ruby folder and then
go to the library folder and then Ruby
again and then gems 2.10 and then gems
again here all the gems are currently
installed in for Ruby so going back to
this that's what the gems are and you
don't have rails installed here Ian
because we haven't installed a year but
he came with rake our dock and test unit
so these are just three gems that we
have installed right now all right
let's go ahead and install a rails just
open up the command prompt any in any
directory and this is going to be super
easy just type gem install rails and
then should take a while
just be patient on this one you should
start getting in the progress progress
text really soon
yep there he goes that's all you should
be seeing its so remember how I talked
about that rails actually depends on a
bunch of other gems so that's what it's
doing right now it's installing those
other gems in order to run rails so
rails depends needs other gems to run so
that's what it's doing right now here
okay
wait until this is over should take a
while actually
here you can see the bundler which is a
little gem that I showed here which
manages and installs all the gyms and
while this is happening
you still have that gems folder open you
can tell there's a bunch of other gems
that showed up here so that's where all
these gems live rubies gems live so we
can for example open up the rails gem
right Oh
basically gems are just a bunch of
libraries in code Ruby uses and then
that's how easy it is to install and
just type gem install rails and does it
installs all there all those gems for us
now after a while what I noticed it's
just gonna stop right and I think what's
happening here is it's actually finished
installing all these gems
so when you see parsing documentation
for rails 4 point 2 point 4 and
installing our eye documentation for
rails 4 point 2 4 that's actually means
it's done if it hangs like that for you
just press go go to your command prompt
and just press control C and that will
interrupt just GPS and trust me that
this will work there's nothing that has
an unfinished so you you have now
successfully installed rails so we're
just going to test it out and see if it
works now let's go back to our Ruby root
directory and create a new folder named
rails and then go back
oh it's actually hold shift again right
click and open the
new year so that we were in the rails
directory and now what we're going to do
is we're going to use rails to generate
a new app I'm going to generate a new
rails app so all we have to do is just
type reals new and then our app name
whatever you want to call it I'm just
going to name the first app and rails is
doing its job right now it's creating
all those files for us for our brand new
app and I think my command prompt
hanging up again I'm not sure why it
does that I don't know you guys are
gonna get the same thing but I'm just
gonna hit ctrl C now throughout the
progress now here you can see your rails
has created a new folder called first
app which is the name of our app I'm
just going to open it up and look at
that it's got all these files in here
generated by the rails framework but by
the way of jam now all we have to do now
is I'm just going to type bundle install
and first of all you got to be inside
the the app holder so go ahead and go to
type CD and then the name of your app
and I can you know test to see that I'm
inside this folder here inside the app
holder and I'm gonna go ahead and now
tie a bundle install and if you remember
again bundle is a takes care of
installing all the other gems for us and
that's exactly what it's going to do now
it's going to install all the gems that
we need to run the Ruby on Rails
application and if here is still if you
want to check it out and some both cans
are being added into that
Ruby library folder this is lost in your
right
the Hangul sign so great we're now ready
to run our Ruby on Rails application and
just type rails server so I need to do
and then should successfully start your
first Ruby on Rails application just
wait for it to load here and then you're
going to access it from HTTP column for
rapport / localhost column 3000 just
going to wait a little bit here because
it takes a while all right
that means the app has been loaded
successfully let's check it out
go to the browser tag glow co-host
welcome who's that local host 3000 and
there's everything
oh and misspelling got localhost area a
local host column 3000 if you get this
page welcome aboard you're writing Ruby
on Rails that means you have
successfully installed the Ruby rails
and you're ready to use this awesome
programming language and framework to
make websites that is all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
