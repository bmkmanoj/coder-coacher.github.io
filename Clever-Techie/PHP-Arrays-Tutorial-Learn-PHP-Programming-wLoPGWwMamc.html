ticky and in this video we're going to
cover PHP arrays in more detail now
here's a quick overview of PHP arrays in
PHP we define a numeric array using the
keyword array and then inside the round
brackets we have our values and the
numeric keys are automatically created
for us when we define a numeric array
and then if you if we wanted to create
an associative array we use the same
keyword array and then inside the round
brackets we specify what the key names
are in the single or double quotes and
then we use the rocket and follow that
by the value okay so let's go ahead and
start coding so here's what we're going
to be creating I'm going to be we're
going to be reading these files and
images inside a numeric array in PHP and
then we will create a associative array
out of it and then finally we're going
to we're going to create a HTML table
out of the associative array that's
going to look something like this so
it's pretty nice looking an HTML table
and we're going to accomplish that with
PHP arrays alright let's start coding so
first of all I'm going to put up the PHP
tags here okay so my directory of the
movies where those files are located is
inside the movies folder so I'm going to
specify the directory with a dirt
variable and I'm going to use a function
called skander which is going to this
function skander and it's going to read
the directory and it's going to put all
the files in and in the array so here's
what it's going to look like if we print
out the files array and close that and
I'm also going to use the function
called
pree are that I've defined earlier in
another video so we can print out those
pesky pre tags automatically okay so
once we use the skander function here's
what the array is going to look like as
you can see it has read all the file
names into an array and it created a
numeric array out of it now let's go
ahead and remove those dots in the first
two keys of the array and for that we
can use a function called array diff so
we're going to save files which is our
array and then diff and I'm going to
specify the array which is our existing
Airy and then for the second one I'm
going to specify another array and the
values so what the array underscored if
function does is it compares the two
arrays together it compares the first
array which is files and the second one
that I've just created here and it
returns an array which is going to be
which is going to have all the values
but the ones that are specified in a
second array so as you can see I've
printed it here and it's the dots are no
longer there okay so as you can see also
it has it's not starting from key zero
and one instead of starting from key -
and before we start looping through
these that this array I want to reset
the keys and for that there is another
function called
I'm going to say file files equals array
values and then files so that will reset
the count back to zero so what that
function is for as you can see it's
starting from zero now and now we're
ready to work with this numeric array so
I'm just going to comment out all these
printing functions and I'm what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to create
another array called movies and
we're just going to loop through this
numeric array called files with all
those file names and we're going to put
it all inside this movies array and
we're going to create an associative
array out of it and and it will be a lot
easier to work with once we start
creating our HTML table so let's go
ahead and create a loop a for loop and
just say count files and what the count
function does is just counts the files
array and returns how many elements are
inside the array so that we can know
when to end the loop once the end of the
array has been reached
next we're just going to say I plus plus
and then I'm going to do some regular
expressions here using the pragmatic and
don't worry if you don't understand this
regular expression what I'm going to do
here is just match the file names and
then I'm also going to match the ear
name inside the file names and I'm going
to store these as separate values inside
the associative array I'm also going to
match the whole image name and store
that separately as well so here's what
the regular expression looks like and
again don't be scared if you don't
understand what's going on here I'm just
I'll create another video where I'll be
explaining what's going on here so this
is going to match the name of the of the
movie and it's going to match the year
of the movie and then I'm going to
specify which since we're looping
looping through the array and specify
files and then the I which is going to
be the count of the numeric key and then
I'm going to store everything in the
results array so pragmatic function
takes in three arguments the regular
expression the the value of the array
and then finally it's going to store
everything inside the results array so
if I'm going to print out the results
array
this is what it's going to look like
right now actually let's use the pre are
pre are okay so it's store the whole
thing and 0 and then it stored a break
heart which is a movie name in key one
and it store the year in key too so
that's how the preg match works and
again don't worry if you don't get
what's going on right now next I'm going
to go ahead and clean up the movie name
a little bit so instead of I'm going to
use a STR replace function to replace
the underscores in the movie names with
spaces and I'm going to provide the
results one which is the movie name and
also I'm going to capitalize every
letter of the movie using the you see
words function and let's see what the
movie name looks like now it's the first
one for now Braveheart so which is
exactly what we want okay so I'm
actually going to use the movie named as
an associative key now so in order to do
that I'm going to type movies array and
I'm going to place this variable inside
the in place of the key name and then
I'm going to say image equals files I
which is the image name and also movies
I'm going to create another one and this
and this time place the variable here
and for the year I'm going to say
results two which is where the ear is
stored and then I'm going to print out
the whole thing to see what happens okay
so this is exactly what I wanted so the
name of the movie is being used as a key
inside this associative array and then
the second array second dimension inside
the array is created with image name and
the
and now we're pretty much ready to work
with this array let's go ahead and test
to see how the whole thing looks like
now by printing out the movies array
outside the loop and as you can see all
of these all the movie names are created
in place of the key name and the image
image and year are also stored inside
the associative key image and year for
every single movie so now we're ready to
work with this associative array and
create a table out of this ok so I
already have some CSS created in order
to make that table look nice so I'm just
going to paste it here and you guys can
either pause the video and just type the
whole is this CSS yourself or you can
download the file with the this code
inside the description of this video so
here's the CSS I'm going to be using ok
finally I'm going to use for each loop
to look through the movies array but
before we do that let's go ahead and
print the actual table to the screen
because the table is going to be living
outside of our a bar for each load
because we don't want to be printing
table more than once ok so I'm just
going to print this table and first
table row is also going to be outside
I'm going to create a class for it okay
so this is going to be our table and
table row I'm also going to end the
table tags echo key our table
and then inside I mean between these
tags we're ready to look through our
associative array so I'm going to say
for each movies which is our array as
movie name which is the variable is
going to hold the movie name and then
and movie name is the key in this case
and then the rocket and info which is
going to contain the image and the ear
values okay
so now now we're going to print the
table cells so I'm going to store
everything inside the content variable
and for the table cell its TD let me say
class span class equals name just the
format name a little bit nicely and then
I'm going to say movie name remember
that we can print the variables inside
the double quotes and then span and the
tag and then use the BR tag and then I'm
just going to press Enter weight just
creating a mutter okay
concatenate that and then I'm going to
say image source equals movies info
image and then close that BR and then
concatenate that again close this first
and then span class equals here and I'm
just going to explain what's going on
here in just a little bit just let me
type this thing first and then info here
and and the span tag and the table cell
okay so what's going on here okay so for
the movie name I'm just using movie name
and I just want to print it out as it is
and I'm placing it inside the span HTML
tag because we wanted to format it
nicely next for the info image where our
image file name is located I'm using the
image as SRC tag to actually print out
the image to the browser and this is a
perfectly legal weighted of doing so
because info image holds our jpg path
and you can actually print out the
associative array between double quotes
without specifying without enclosing the
image in single or double quotes
just like that which is very convenient
you don't have to concatenate that or
use any kind of curly brackets and then
for the year I'm doing this pretty much
the same thing I've done for the movie
name and placing it inside its own span
tag and and hopefully oh this is going
to be nicely formatted so now I'm just
going to echo out content to the screen
save file and voila all the movies along
with their names and year numbers have
been basically an HTML table nicely
formatted HTML table has been created
out of this and this is the CSS for it
and that's it for this PHP arrays video
