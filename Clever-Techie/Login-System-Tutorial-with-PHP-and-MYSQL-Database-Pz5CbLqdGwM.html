tikki welcome back and in this video
we're going to learn how to create a
fully functional login system in PHP
including user registration login forgot
password or reset password functionality
and I'm going to be able to log in here
and we're going to have a profile page
I'm going to be able to log out and all
of that is going to work so let's go
ahead and get started so first of all
what you want to do is download the
source code for the system it's included
in the description of this video and
it's called login - system bed zip so
when you first download it here's a
here's the file that you download login
system you're going to go ahead and go
ahead and extract the file into your
Apache root directory and once you
extract all the files you're going to
have a log in system folder with all the
files and source code included ok so all
these files the PHP code is already
typed up and the system is basically
ready to go we just need to modify
database settings and create actual
database using SQL but if you prefer to
actually type the PHP code yourself you
can I've included this new folder here
and all these files they have HTML in
them but they're missing the PHP code so
this is a in my opinion it's a good way
to learn PHP by typing the actual PHP
code yourself so if you want to follow
this video inside the code PHP you go
ahead and do so by by using this folder
this new folder here okay before we move
on and create it out of a SNL lab let me
just show you something here if you open
up the image folder and click on the
login system chart this chart that I
created is going to give you a good
overview of how the login system works
and
where all the files are what the
function what the main functionality of
each PHP file is in a system where the
mail has been sent out and just how the
whole system is interacting and how the
old PHP files are interacted in the
system
okay so I've labeled all the or most of
the PHP files in yellow so you can see
where they are I also have messages in
green so those are the messages that are
going to be displayed and as you can see
for the error and success pages all
they're going to be doing is displaying
the error and success messages for us
now from the index page which which is
the main page a user can take three
actions register login and they can go
to forgot that PHP page where they reset
their passwords so for the register by
the way the gray text is the main
functionality of the file so for the
register page it sends the counter
notification link it's it adds the user
to the database and it generates unique
hash now you can also see how the files
are connected so from register they go
to profile page which is where the user
is redirected around right after
registering and from the profile page
that can go go to logout which is they
can just click on the button and they'll
be logged out in green you can see all
the messages is going to be displayed so
for example in a profile page you're
going to have a account not verified
message when they use the first
registers and it's also going to show
it's going to display the confirmation
link sent message once okay so same way
for the login and profile and you know
you can see here what the login page
does it verifies credentials and sets
the login to true and you can see how
that's all connected now the important
part here is verify that PHP and reset
that PHP and I'm going to have to label
them blue because they've been sent
through the mail so they're kind of
unique in that way
but I just wanted you to know where they
are in the system and how they're
connected so from the register page you
can see that one of the registered page
functionality is some activation sign
account verification link and that's
where the verify that's how user will
access verify that PHP from from the
email message and in the same way for
God that PHP has a send password reset
link and that's how they get to the
reset that PHP page and from the reset
PHP page is going to have a different
form action which they will basically
direct them to reset underscore password
which will then make sure the passwords
match and update the passwords in the
database so I've just created this chart
you can look back on it as we as we move
along this video and all the code so you
can see the big picture and how the
files are interacted and hopefully this
will clear up some confusion ok so
there's also two other files inside the
image folder one of them is MySQL and
this is just a basic review of how the
MySQL works and especially you want to
understand sessions so you want
understand that we start a session with
a session start function and we're able
to access session variables on another
page and we can also call session
destroy' to remove session and unset
session variables and that's how we're
going to be logging out so make sure you
understand our sessions work because
we're going to be using them a lot in
this video okay so anyway once you have
all your files let's go ahead and create
the database along with a user's table
so there's two ways first of all you can
open up this SQL file you can copy this
text go ahead and open up the command
prompt and connect to your MySQL and
then you can just right click here to
paste
the code I already have database created
so and I have the users table created as
well and I should just go to my PHP
myadmin and I'm going to log in here go
to our towns and you can see that the my
users table is already here I'm going to
delete this user and if I go to
structure you can see that all the user
SEOs have been created which are the
main ID first name last name email
password hash and active so that all
worked an alternative way to create this
database and user stable is to run this
PHP scripts are created for you guys
just make sure to fill out the user and
password and then just run the script
and it will do exactly the same thing as
you can see it's creating accounts
database here and it's also creating
users table with all the fields that you
just solve from the PHP myadmin okay so
once you have your database and you have
your users table we're pretty much
pretty much ready to go let's just go
ahead and done I'm going to go ahead and
create a new project in that beans
actually Hana already have it created
but I'm going to delete it so I can show
you what's going on okay so I'm just
going to remove this project and file
new project PHP next it's going to call
the project's login system and on the
resources folder I'm going to navigate
to localhost log in system select that
folder it's going to let me know that
the projects folder project sources
directory is not empty that's fine I'm
going to click finish and right away
it's going to open the index dot PHP but
first we need to open up the DB PHP and
make sure the username and passwords are
both set mine is set so it's all ready
to go now I can press shift at 6 to run
this and and this is a fully functional
for
that's going to show up here so you can
go ahead and test this out by
registering a user I'm going to register
mine here just to show you what's going
on just to show you that in fact it
works and it does it lends me on the
profile page and it's got the
confirmation message and the account not
verified message because I haven't
verified this account yet and remember
this is exactly what was showing up on
our chart from the register we went to
profile and on a profile we got these
two messages letting us know that the
confirmation link has been sent and that
the account is not verified okay so that
all works now let's go behind the scenes
and see how how the magic happens okay
so first of all we're including that
database PHP file which is our which is
our database connection things we're
also starting a new session so that the
set so that we can create new session
variables okay so down here not sure why
this icon is showing a loading scene but
let's just keep going okay
so first of all we recheck it the form
has been submitted with a method post
and if you look down here the form
action method equals post so when this
file is submitted it calls itself and
this PHP code is executed because the
method is posed now you can also see
here okay so if post login is set then
we want to require the code from our
login page which is the login process
and if the post register is said then we
want to include our register dot PHP
file which is the registration process
here okay so how does it know about the
post login and post register variables
easy if we look down here on their login
form we have a button named login and
that's
the that's how it knows that this
variable is set so it's able to access
the post login and so the same thing for
the registration form has got a button
named register down here okay so based
on which form is being submitted we
include different code so let's examine
oh my god this this icon is really
annoying Ayana why ho what's cousins
it's like something that's loading I'm
not sure what it is
anyway umm okay so let's examine in the
register dot PHP first okay so we set
all the session variables from our post
variables so that we can use them on the
profile page and then we get ready we
basically use escape string function to
to escape all of our values to protect
against the SQL injections and so these
are all the values that are we're going
to be inserting now the two that I want
to explain are the passwords and hash
variables
okay so passwords for security reasons
passwords can just as be inserted in the
minus QL database because that's not
secure so we first must hash the
password with a password underscore hash
function which takes in the parameter
for the parameter one it takes in the
raw password that user entered and then
this is the algorithm it's going to use
called password decrypt which is going
to basically it's going to what is going
to do is create a random string out of
the password and that way it will be
secure also we want to generate a new
hash key which is going to take in one
function called Rand and this function
is going to generate a number between 0
and 1000 and then it's going to use md5
to generate a unique hash from that
number okay so if I output the password
variable here and hash then I'm just
going to terminate the script and I
click Save I just want to
I just want to show what these two
variables look like so you can just
quickly understand what's happening
serve enter something random here ran
faster okay so these are the two
variables this is our password and this
is our unique hash key and as you can
see they're just a bunch of random
letters and numbers and you're going to
find out what the hash is for later on
as we verify the account and reset the
password we're going to use that a lot
and basically this is a safe way to
store the password inside our database
okay so hopefully that makes sense let's
go ahead and go back to register delete
this okay so next check is the user with
that email already exists obviously we
want to check if they use already exists
before registering them so we run a
simple kiri select from users for email
because equals our email and this result
is going to be the result object and
it's going to have a property of numrows
now if the number of is greater than 0
then immediately we're going to know
that the user without email already
exists and if that's true which is going
to say we're going to set the session
message and we're going to say user with
our email already exists and redirect
them to the error page and at that point
the script ends okay and the reason
we're able to connect to the database
and use our session on this page without
including them up here is because we've
already included them on the main index
page and since the register that PHP
page has been included from the index
page then we no longer need to include
it here we no long you need to include
database and session start here because
it's already been done and it's like
register page is already here on the
index page ok so let's move on here if
the user doesn't exist then we want to
create an insert theory or insert SQL to
insert
all of our variables into the database
and this is exactly what we're doing
here now since the active is zero by
default we're not going to include it
here it's going to do it by itself then
we're going to run the Curie by using
the Curie method of MySQL and this is
the SQL that we're inserting and if that
goes all well then we want to set
session variables like active equals
zero because well because the user and
newly registered user hasn't activated
their account yet so we're just going to
set that to zero and then the logged in
we're going to set the true because the
user is going to be logged in and for
the message we're going to say that
confirmation message link that we saw
earlier and okay so once that's done
we're just going to need to send the
email a verification email to the user
which is this down here and basically
the mail function is what does all the
magic take sim aramet err to which is
the email where we're going to be
sending our message which is going to be
the user's email subject account
verification from clarity key and the
message body is going to contain our
link and you want to make sure to change
this URL here if you're going to make it
work on your computer or wherever you
have uploaded the script to but here's
the magic part verify that PHP as you
remember from the chart again verify PHP
is right here and it's accessed through
sent account verification link which is
exactly what's happening here and we
also include email and hash variables in
the URL by by specifying email and hash
and then the actual variables that we
have for the user okay so that's how
it's going to verify that's going to
have that that's good that's going to
have the verified PHP URL in the
email message and then we just redirect
the user to the profile page now here is
what the actual verification is going to
look like
so hello Vladdy thank you for signing up
please click click this link to activate
your account and then this is the verify
that PHP with email
Vladek we take a comm and hash which is
the unique hash and if I click on it
it's going to say success your account
has been activated now if I go home and
I rely in now it says your account has
been activated and the annoying message
about account activation is no longer
showing up so it can go ahead and log
out and the logout also works so that's
all cool it's all working let's go back
to coding now and let's actually examine
the verify that PHP now ok so here we're
required in the database and start in
the session and now what we're doing
here is we're making sure that that
we're making sure the email and hash
variables are set and that they're not
empty so those are the variables that
are being passed along in the verify
link so if we just accessed we just want
to make sure that somebody's not doing
something like this you know if they
just enter the verify PHP we want to
redirect them to the error page and I'm
going to say invalid parameters provided
for the account verification which is
which is the message here and this
message is happening because because the
variables are empty ok anyway moving on
if the variables are in fact set then we
want to escape them for security
purposes and then we want to check if
the user with the email and that unique
hash that's what the hash is for
if if the email matches the unis cache
which is stored in a database and the
active status is zero then then if the
result equals zero then the user has
already been activated
or something went wrong so we want to
display an error message but if if the
rose is not equal zero well it's going
to be and if it's not equal zero then we
want to say your account has been
activated because our theory has been
successful and then we want to set the
active we want to update the database
and set to active to one where the email
equals our user email and then we also
want to set the session active to one as
well because we don't want to be showing
any messages about account activation
upon successful account activation okay
so if we look at the database here arm
and I go to browse and this is the user
that I've just registered so you can see
that a user has an email password and
the unique ash so when we match the hash
which is a unique number here an email
we ensure that this user is in fact
trying to activate their account and
then we set active to zero to one so
this is what this code is doing here so
hopefully you can see where the hash
what the hash is for it's a unique
string and we're matching it with the
email to make sure that we're in fact
very fine that user that wants to be
verified okay so anyway then we
resurrect to the success page and that's
that completes the verification process
for our user now let's move on and look
at the log in okay so in case our form
our login form has been submitted this
is the login page
so so the first thing we're doing here
is we're basically setting the email
variable and we're escaping it before
running an SQL Curie on it and we want
to check if the user ratings with that
email exists before logging in a min
because if they don't exist well we
don't want to walk them in so so if the
result returns
numrows equals zero then we want to say
user with that email doesn't exist if
it's not equal to zero then the user
exists so here what we're doing is we're
storing the user data inside of a user
array so if I go ahead and print out the
user array let's see what it's going to
look like here I'm just going to try to
log in with my email and password okay
so so this is the array with all the
user data and as you can see it's got
all the keys like ID first name last
name email password hash and active
status so that's awesome now we're ready
to work with this user array and that's
where all these variables come from here
including email first name last name and
active so basically that happens by
calling a fetch associative function so
it's fetching the from the result that's
returned result is an object and the
fetch associative returns that object
and puts it into associative array and
that's exactly what our user variable
but becomes it becomes an associative
array with all the data what I'll use
your data in it okay moving on here we
verify the password with a password
verify a function and what it does it
just matches the two passwords together
so we make sure that the password
entered equals users passwords which
lives inside the database then we set
all the session variables that we're
going to display on profile page
opponent
test for login like user email first
name last name and also the active
status we also set the session logged in
to true so that we know the user has
been logged in and finally we ready
direct them to the profile page if the
password entered has been wrong by the
way so if this if statement fails else
you have entered wrong password
ready director error page so that's the
functionality for the for logging in
it's going to head and login here and
refresh the page
and now we're showing that first and
last name and email and we also have a
logout here okay so that works now let's
keep going here and okay so that's the
registration login and account
verification and and okay so the error
page and the success page I just want to
show you this real fast ok so the error
page always doing is displaying all the
error messages and the success page has
exactly the same code with the exception
that it's called its title is success
and the heading is success and in error
page its titles error and its head
heading is error and always doing is
display in a session message and we
first make sure that the session message
is said it's not empty and if it's empty
we just simply redirect back to the home
page so that's the functionality of
error and success that PHP and again
this is exactly what we have here on the
chart okay finally let's go through the
password reset functionality starting
with the forged PHP page which is where
the user lands after clicking on a
forgot password link it sends them to
the for gadot HP page which asks them
for the email address and again this is
the first step here forgot at each piece
and password reset link and then once
the password link has been sent the user
is going to end up
on the reset that PHP page and that's
the functionality of our forgot a PHP
page so it's going to send this reset a
PHP link through the URL in an email as
a link okay so we require the database
we start the session variable we make
sure the form has been submitted with a
post and then we set our email email
variable and escape it from the post
which has been submitted then we make
sure that the user exists by by running
a simple SQL statement select from users
where email equals email which has been
entered in the form which has been
entered in this form okay so we make
sure the user exists if they don't we
want to redirect them to the error page
if the user exists then we do the same
thing we store the user inside of a
associative array called user and then
we have all our variables so we just set
all these variables because it just
makes it easier to read next we set the
session message to display on the
success that PHP page and it's going to
say please check your email for
confirmation link to complete your
password reset okay so we're going to do
this right now I'm going to enter my
email and I'm going to click reset and
it read directed us to the page with
this please check your email for a
confirmation link message so so this is
our first session message and then on
the success page we're displaying the
session message on our success page here
because that's where we're a directed
next after all this code is completed
and the final part here is of course the
email which again uses the meet mail
function takes in the parameter to
subject and message body and this is
where our URL for the reset is being
constructed so again make sure you
replace this part with your own URL and
then here's the reset that PHP so that
we can
direct the user to the reset a PHP page
again just like we saw in a chart here
and it's going to have two parameters
again just like the in the account
verifcation it's going to have an email
and hash so that we know the correct
user is trying to reset their password
so that's that's it for the for Java PHP
now let's look at reset let's see what
happens on a reset page okay again we
require the database we start the
session and then we make sure that the
email and hash variables are set because
if they're not set then something is not
right okay so once we make sure that
those two variables are in fact set and
these variables are being set right here
in this part of the URL we then want to
escape email in hash for security
purposes to protect against SQL
injection and now we make sure they use
the email with the matching hash exists
just like we did for the account
verifcation so this should look familiar
we again run the security to make sure
the email is matching the hash and then
if if they don't match then we want to
redirect to the error page and you want
to say you have entered value or URL for
password reset if it's successful or if
I if these variables are not set then we
want to say sorry verification failed
try again so basically always code here
um basically it's going to fail if any
of this is true here inside of this arm
okay so so next so basically we don't we
don't want this happening here we want
to make sure that our number O's is
equal one so if it's equal one if it's
not equal to zero then it's not going to
redirect us to the error page
and if the eaves variables are not empty
it's not going to redirect our so error
page again and the code is just going to
continue executing so we're going to see
our reset dot PHP form okay let's go
ahead and test this out I'm going to go
ahead and okay so I'm going to go ahead
and go to the email and click on the
link so I've got the email with a
password reset as you can see it's got
the reset PHP here so this is the form
that the user is going to see if
everything went well so I'm going to
take a new path search one two three
four five six and I'm going to put a
confirmation password and click apply
and now it's supposed to redirect us to
the reset that password that PHP let's
see why it's empty though okay so I
figured out what the problem was it was
in this SQL statement it was a little
bit wrong so so now I've corrected this
QL statement and it works basically
ready directed to the success page and
your password has been reset
successfully okay so that's pretty much
it for this video please like share and
subscribe and just play around with the
system see how it all card all works and
make sure everything is working and be
sure to set the proper Apache mail
settings before before testing out the
PHP mail function in order for that to
work and just refer back to this chart
here if you get lost to see how the
whole system works and just to see the
big picture all right you guys please
like and share this video with your
friends
