techie and in this video we're gonna
learn how to create a responsive
navigation bar using bootstrap for now
what I realize is there's a lot of
bootstrap class names to remember and we
also need to know which HTML tags to
apply them to so I decided to create
this cheat sheet where in the first
column you can see all the HTML tags
colored in green and in the second
column you can see all the bootstrap
classes colored in blue so that way you
can immediately know which booster class
belongs to which HTML element there are
also HTML attribute names which I
colored in yellow and finally attribute
values are in gray I also use indent
spacing to make it clear that these
attributes belong to their respective
HTML tags so I'm gonna keep referencing
this cheat sheet throughout this video
and you guys will see that it helps a
lot in the process of creating our
navbar all right so I've created this
basic workspace so we can get started
working on our navbar and one thing to
know before we get started is you have
to include the jQuery file before
bootstrap files in order for the
collapse and drop down functionality to
work so make sure you include a jQuery
file before bootstrap CSS and bootstrap
JavaScript I've also included a custom
CSS where I'm importing montserrat font
from Google and I'm simply applying it
to the body ok so let's go ahead and
create the basic responsive navbar first
so by looking at our cheat sheet you can
see that the basic navbar consists of
four HTML elements and five bootstrap
classes so let's go ahead and create the
first HTML element with these to
bootstrap classes ok so nav class equals
navbar navbar expand I'm gonna go ahead
and use MD to collapse the navbar at
medium screen sizes the next HTML
element is UL with a class named nav bar
- nav
the next one is list item and then we're
gonna have a a with an F - link inside
of a list item so let's go ahead and
create those two next a plus equals nav
- link I'm also gonna add a H ref with a
pound so the link is clickable I'm gonna
put link 1 and now I'm just gonna copy
this multiple times name this link two
three and four and that's it for our
basic navbar let's go ahead and view it
in the browser and that's our responsive
navbar if I drag the window you can see
that it's collapsing at the medium
screen size now let's play around with
appearance a little bit as you can see
the first four classes in the appearance
tab belong to nav HTML tag the nav bar
dark goes well with BG dark and then bar
light goes well with BG light so let's
go ahead and see what they look like
so first I'm gonna apply navbar light
and BG light and that will create a
light navbar now let's change that to
navbar dark and BG dark and now we'll
create a dark navbar and you can also
apply all the BG colors like primary
success BG warning BG info and BG danger
so let's go ahead and add BG primary for
example view it in a browser and you can
see that now our nav bar is blue you can
also apply any of the other ones let's
say danger and that will make our navbar
red I'm gonna go ahead and change it
back to dark
and so you can go ahead and experiment
with all of these all of these work on
the navbar HTML tag okay now we're gonna
go ahead and add some text and logger to
our nav bar okay so for the text and
logo we're simply gonna add the span and
a HTML tags with NAB our text and then
barb Brian classes okay we're gonna do
this inside of our nav HTML tag so the
first one I'm gonna add is span class
equals nav bar text put some text in
there and the second one I'm gonna add
is a class equals nav bar brand and
inside of this a class I'm gonna add IMG
SRC equals clever gear dot PNG which is
a clever techy logo
close this one and now we can see what
it looks like in a browser and you can
see that it added the text with a
collaborative logo and that's how easy
it is to add text and logo to our member
okay before we apply position classes to
our net bar let's go ahead and create a
header on top of our nav bar this is so
it can properly demonstrate the sticky
top class so on top of our nav bar here
I'm gonna go ahead and add a new div
with a bootstrap class named Jumbotron
and I'm gonna go ahead and apply custom
styling to it to remove the bottom
margin so margin bottom 0px I'm also
gonna go ahead and add some content
inside of the header add a paragraph as
well with something like let's learn web
development close this tag now let's see
what it looks like in a browser refresh
the page and now you can see that added
a huge header on top of our net bar with
a header and a paragraph now in order to
scroll past this navbar we also have to
add some content at the bottom of than
that bar so we can properly see sticky
top in action so let's go ahead and add
that
image in the bottom of our net bar so
I'm gonna say IMG SRC equals bootstrap
for navbar cheat sheet dot PNG and I'm
also gonna go ahead and add a class
named IMG - fluid to make this image
responsive now let's see what it looks
like and now we can start adding our
position classes to see how our navbar
behaves so let's go ahead and do that
right now let's do the fix - top first
now as you can see this fixed the navbar
at the top of the page and it also
overlaid the header now let's do the
fixed bottom and displaced our nav bar
at the bottom of the screen and finally
sticky top if we scroll past the nav bar
here you can see that it starts to stick
at the top of the page so that's the
functionality of the sticky top and
that's it for the position of our net
bar let's move on to the collapse okay
so to add the collapse functionality to
our nav bar we're gonna go ahead and add
a button with two attributes the data
toggle and data target the data toggle
is gonna have a collapsed value and data
target is gonna have a name of our
target that we collapsing we're also
gonna add a span class inside of our
button tag for the navbar toggler icon
then we're gonna go ahead and wrap our
navbar links in a div with the same ID
as the target name in a toddler and
we're also gonna add a class called
navbar collapse to that same div the
reason for adding this functionality is
to let the user manually decide when
they want to expand or collapse in that
bar bootstrap is going to hide our nav
bar links at a breaking point and show
the toddler button instead allowing us
to collapse and expand in that bar by
clicking on the button
okay so inside of our nav tag let's go
ahead and create the button first with a
class navbar Cutler it's also gonna have
two attributes data toggle with a valley
collapse and data target with our target
name so data toggle eCos collapse and
data target the target name can be
anything I'm gonna go ahead and name it
collapse underscore target also gonna
add the span tag inside of the button to
add that toggler icon so a span tag with
a navbar toggler icon class and our
button is radio let's see what it looks
like in a browser I'm gonna go ahead and
reduce the window size until it
collapses and now you can see the
buttons showing up here now all we have
to do is wrap our links inside of the
div tag to make them collapsible okay so
we're gonna have to wrap the content
which we want to collapse in a div tag
including the text and the logo so let's
go ahead and create a new div here and
the class of this div is going to be
collapse and navbar collapse we're also
gonna add an attribute name ID where the
same target name as data target so
collapse and navbar collapse first
collapse in that bar collapse and the
attribute name is once again ID where
the target name collapse underscore
target and make sure that for the data
target you actually include the pound
here otherwise it's not going to work so
I'm gonna go ahead and fix that here and
we're gonna go ahead and close our our
div down here at the bottom of the UL
tag
now let's go ahead and see if this works
I'm gonna go ahead and reduce the window
size and now you can see that in fact
reduced it collapsed in that bar and if
I click on it it's going to go ahead and
expand in that bar and that's it that's
we now have a responsive navbar with a
custom collapse button the last thing
we're gonna do is add drop-down menu to
one of our navigation links so for the
drop down menu it's actually very
similar to what we just did to the
collapse we're first going to identify
the area which is going to collapse or
expand our menu and then we're gonna
create the actual menu itself so for the
list item here we're gonna add a class
named drop-down so I'm gonna use this on
our first list item I'm just gonna say
drop-down and then for the a we're gonna
add drop-down toggle class and also
we're gonna have to add two attributes
down a toggle with a value drop-down and
ID with our target name so we've got a
toggle eCos drop-down dot a target
equals and once again the data target
can be any name we're gonna name it
drop-down underscore target okay so I'm
gonna go ahead and rename this link one
here to drop-down and I'm also gonna go
ahead and add if span here with a class
named Carrick and this is not on the
cheat sheet but this one is really easy
to remember and all it does is it adds
the arrow next to the link so let's see
what it looks like and this is our
drop-down menu with a caret next to it
now let's go ahead and create the actual
drop-down menu next alright so the next
thing we're gonna do is add the actual
drop-down menu content itself and you
want to make sure that you're still
inside the list item of the link that
we're gonna be clicking to expand and
collapse
sar menu so I'm gonna go ahead and add
the div inside of our list item here or
the class name drop-down menu and it's
also going to have an attribute name re
a label by with our target name and the
target name is of course drop-down
target okay so the last thing we're
gonna add is actual links inside of our
job down menu and of course the links
are created with a tag with a class name
drop-down item so a class equals
drop-down item I'm gonna name the first
link PHP videos and then I'm just gonna
copy this whole thing name this one CSS
videos and bootstrap videos I'm also
gonna go ahead and add that divider
between the list items just to see its
functionality so a div with a class name
drop down divider
okay now let's see what it looks like in
a browser refresh the page click on our
drop down menu and now we have our menu
showing up now if you guys want to make
this job down mania horizontal instead
of vertical we can simply wrap these
links inside a UL HTML tag with a class
name navbar - nav and this will make our
drop-down menu horizontal so let's go
ahead and do that right now so UL plus
equals navbar
- nav close the UL tag here refresh the
page and now we have a horizontal menu
and if I reduce the size of this window
it's gonna collapse and then click on
this button I can also expand our drop
down menu here and you can see that
everything is working and that's our
responsive navbar with bootstrap for you
