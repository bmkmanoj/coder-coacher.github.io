in this video I'm going to show you how
to install PHP myadmin on windows let's
go ahead and open a browser and go to
PHP my admin dotnet click on this big
green download button to download the
latest version PHP myadmin
can close this window here and just wait
until the file finishes downloading I
already have my file downloaded so I'm
just going to cancel this and go to my
downloads folder and open the file and
I'm going to double click on this folder
here and then click extract two and I'm
going to navigate to my Apache web roots
directory and my Apache web root
directory is located on C localhost
yours might might be different it might
be something like C Apache
slash Docs or something like that so
check to make sure that you know what
your patch your root directory is so I'm
going to extract all the PHP myadmin
files into a PHP myadmin
my admin folder in Apache root directory
and this is going to take a little bit
just going to wait until all those files
get extracted whoo it's really been hot
in San Diego here I'm sweating right now
I've been running the AC all this time
but it's not really helping that much
because it's one of those wall ACS it's
not essential but you know can't
complain about sunny weather in
California anyway now that the file have
been that the files have been extracted
let's go ahead and navigate to the PHP
myadmin folder and let's go ahead and
first rename the configuration file
remove the word sample from it so that
its config that I on see that PHP and go
ahead and open the file for editing and
we're going it
all we need to do for now is just
provide some kind of a long string here
and make sure it's pretty long because
otherwise going to complain and just
save that file open up the browser now
go to your localhost / PHP myadmin and
if everything worked fine you should get
this PHP login welcome page so go ahead
and login with your root username and
your password that you've set up when
you install the MySQL and press GO ok
and you have successfully installed PHP
myadmin now the only thing that you if
everything went well you should have
this and then you're ready to go but
it's still giving you some errors you
might need to enable some PHP extensions
and here's how to do it go to your PHP
folder and find PHP that I nine file and
enable the extension curl the extension
MB string and the extension MySQL I
those are all required extension in
order to correctly run PHP myadmin on
your computer and then once you're done
save this file and go to your services
and find Apache and then restart the
service once that has been once the
Apache server has been restarted go back
and load try loading PHP my admin again
now there's another optional step if
you're going to be working with advanced
features of PHP my admin you might want
to do this go to import choose file and
again navigate to your Apache directory
and find the PHP myadmin folder open the
SQL folder and double click on the
create underscore tables that SQL file
and then press go
and this will import all the tables
along with a PHP myadmin database and
another step that we need to do is to
configure the config that I and see
again and for that for those advanced
features here's what we need to do first
we're going to uncomment always dollar
sign CFG lines going to replace all of
those replace replace replace replace
replace replace replace replace replace
and then just fill in your user which is
route and password which is your mysql
password click Save and now all the
advanced features of PHP myadmin are
ready to go and you're all set please
