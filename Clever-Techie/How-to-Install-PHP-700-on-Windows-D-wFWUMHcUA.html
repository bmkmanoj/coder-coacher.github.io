in this video we're going to learn how
to install the latest version of PHP 7
and make it work with the latest version
of Apache 2.4 16 on windows 7 operating
system alright first thing got a dude
open up a browser go to windows 8
windows php.net /q a and here you'll
find the PHP 7 beta version we're going
to scroll down from here and you're
definitely going to want to read safe
version because that's the only version
that will work with apache and then it's
got the required dll libraries included
with it we're also going to get VC 14
since that that's the latest version of
Apache that was compiled in ec 14 and
I'm going to get the 64-bit version but
if you have a 32-bit and I want to get
the x86 let's say VC 14 anyway let's
download it and I'm not going to save it
I already have it downloaded by you guys
can click OK here and just wait for it
to download it takes about 2 to 5
minutes alright so I'm going to open up
my downloads folder once 10 is
downloading you're going to end up with
this file here and I'm using WinRAR
which I talked about in the Apache video
and you can get it at rar soft calm and
that's what I use to extract the zip
files so I'm just going to right click
on this file here extract files and I'm
going to extract it to the C Drive
directly in the PHP directory C slash
PHP and it's just gonna extract all that
alright
okay next let's just check it out and
see that we have a pH a folder here
and you're going to end up with these
two PHP ini files in your directory
where you extract PHP I already have my
PhD that an i but you guys can go ahead
and rename this PHP development just
delete this part just completely delete
it and press enter and it's going to
change it to just PHP ini PHP ini is
what you want to end up with and before
you do that make sure your you go to
that your extensions are not disabled
from the view so you can check that by
going to organize folder and search
options view and then just make sure
that this check box is not checked so
you don't want to hide extensions for
known file types and press apply so then
you're going to be able to change an
extension of this son of this file here
all right so now we need to configure
Apache to work with our PHP because the
two don't know about each other just yet
so let's go to our Apache folder and
line is on the C Drive Apache 24 folder
I'm going to go to my conf folder and
open up the httpd.conf file which is the
Apache configuration file I'm going to
open it and I'm going to see a bunch of
texts with Apache configuration text and
here is all the text that you need to
add in order for Apache to work with PHP
let me just explain briefly what all
this means so this first line at handler
here just tells Apache to parse PHP
files so it knows to interpret the PHP
code the add type we are adding an HTML
and dot HTML capability of
interpreting the PHP code inside those
HTML and HTM documents so basically you
can create an HTML page and you can
insert some PHP code within it and then
attach it's going to interpret that PHP
code without this line the PHP code will
be in an HTML file it's not going to
work so I recommend that you add this
line and then the last one is the load
module which actually loads the Apache
module and just copy the fault line and
make sure that you put your PHP
directory where your PHP files are
located - C PHP and I have that file in
there and you should - and if you
haven't if you download it there and
you're installing an earlier version of
PHP then make sure to change this value
to 5 and this value to 5 but we're
installing PHP 7 and we're going to
leave it like that and here let me just
show you where that file is C PHP and
there it is that is that DLL file file
that we'll be loading from the Apache
configuration and the last one is the
PHP ini directory and this is where your
PHP dot ini file and we have renamed
earlier on and this is also an endless
scene that CP h game directory feared on
my C Drive PHP PHP ini this is what we
were telling where that file is located
by this last line so just go ahead and
add all these lines and then let's
scroll down here and just make sure that
you know where your web files are going
to go because we're going to need to
access that directory in a little bit so
mine is C localhost and I put all my PHP
and HTML files they'll be running using
Apache later on okay that's all we need
to do here make sure you
save the document close that let's close
that as well now let's see here okay
well pretty much ready to go let's go to
our pachi folder go back here and then
open the bin folder and then you can
just open up the fashion monitor by
double-clicking on it let me move this
here so you guys can see and now we have
the Apache monitor right here and voila
my Apache is already running I'm just
going to restart it to make sure
successfully loaded and looks like it is
so if your Apaches not running you can
just open the patching monitor stop it
here this means that patch is not
running so you want to start it and then
boom the Apache services started you can
close the monitor now now another way
with to load Apache without a monitor
would be to just access in those
services so just go here in the Start
menu and type sir this is and the
service is going to show up equal
comment this window is going to pop up
with a bunch of services and the Apache
should be right here
and you can also start start stop and
restart Apache from the services window
so that's another way of restarting
Apache and every time you guys are going
to be modifying your Apache
configuration file or your PHP dot ini
remember that Apache will need to be
restarted every time you do that so your
settings to take effect and we're
actually going to test that out in a
little bit here okay now that my Apache
is running I can close this so we're
pretty much ready to test if PHP is
working with Apache right now so here's
how we're going to do it I'm going to go
back to my web files folder which is
located on C local
both right and your guests folder might
be different depending where you set
your document due to that I talked about
and I have my all my web files in here
let me just delete the style for now and
this is the root directory where where
Apache is going to be loading from so
let's create a file to test PHP is
indeed working in Apache you get I'm
going to click all the way here in this
corner o
curve and didn't see you that anyway
here's the here's that folder and see
localhost sorry I forgot to drag this
back up here alright so what we're going
to do here is create first of all
navigate to your web web files folder
where all your files are going to be
loaded from in Apache and now we're
going to just I'm going to right click
all the way here go to new and then I'm
going to select the text document right
at the bottom you guys can see but
you'll have that text document and this
creates a new text file and I'm going to
name this file info dot PHP and I'm
going to click yes now again make sure
that your folder and your view options
the hidin extensions for known file
types is unselected that way you're
going to be able to create different
files with an extension like PHP anyway
let's go ahead and open the file with a
notepad and then type the following PHP
code now these are this is an opening
tag for PHP and this is a closing tag
which tells the browser that were coding
in PHP and then we're going to insert
this very simple function in here called
PHP info and we're going to save this
file so this is just a function that
tells us what kind of a PHP version
we're running and Apache and all those
other configurations so I'm going to
save the file and exit and now we're
ready to test PHP and Apache together
our Apache is running and everything is
configured so we're going to open up the
browser and type localhost and of course
this file shows up because that's the
index H that HTML has been pulled I'm
going to go further slash info page P
which is the file in the root directory
that we just created press ENTER and
voila we got our PHP working and it
tells you which version of PHP you're
running and then a bunch of other
configuration settings that you can look
over but this is this definitely tells
us that PHP and Apache are working now
before I let you guys go let's just do
one more thing we're going to modify our
PHP dot ini file so I'm going to go back
here and my C Drive X is the PHP folder
and then I'm going to open up this PHP
configuration file with a notepad and
then I want to enable one of the
extensions and first of all we need to
uncomment the we need to enable loading
of the extensions from their directory
so we're going to go to edit find and
just type ext double quote fine next
it's going to find the extension
underscored there the semicolon here
this tells PHP that to ignore this line
so we want to uncomment it so that PHP
can start reading this line and our
extensions are located in the ext
directory by default and we don't need
to specify it all the full path PHP
already knows is going to be pulling it
from your directory and PHP folder so
we're coming to this line now PHP knows
where to load the extensions from and
I'm going to go to edit find again and
I'm going to type curl which is a very
common extension
now you're probably going to be using
uncomment this line as well and now the
PHP is supposed to load curl library
from the extension folder and so this is
just to test out and see that our PHP
ini is working and so let's go ahead and
file save close out the PHP dot ini and
now we're going to go back to the
browser and we're going to get type
localhost again in the browser and go to
our info that the HP file and then we're
going to hit ctrl F to search and I'm
going to search for curl now this
doesn't mean anything here it doesn't
mean the curl is loaded it's just some
information about curl but if I press
fine again and boy oh okay sorry I
forgot to restart Apache yeah okay let's
go ahead and I'm gonna go to my sway
fashion editor and I'm gonna left click
on it go here restart so that was a
perfect example actually I'm glad I did
that
I made that mistake because you guys can
see that the settings didn't take effect
unless we start Apache so now that their
appendages were started I'm going to go
back here to our settings I'm just going
to refresh this page fresh make sure
it's refreshed ctrl F search for curl
again and bam there it is now the PHP
that ionised settings have worked it's
loading curl it's pulling it from the
extension directory and it's loading the
curl extension so we know that we now
know how to modify our PHP that I knife
file and whatever settings that you guys
need you can always modify PHP dot ini
and you can also create a shortcut
somewhere where it's easily
guessable I personally have my
configuration files in this menu here
settings there's the Apache
configuration file and there's the PHP
PHP dot ini so I can easily and quickly
access them and of course course don't
forget to restart Apache every time you
modify PHP dot ini otherwise this this
changes aren't going to work so that was
it you guys now have the latest version
of Apache and PHP seven running on your
computer in the next video I'll show you
guys how to install MySQL so you can
start working with databases and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
