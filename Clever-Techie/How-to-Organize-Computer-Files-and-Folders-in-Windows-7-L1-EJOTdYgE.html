this video I'm going to show you guys
the best way to organize your files
folders and shortcuts so that you can
avoid an enormous amount of frustration
and save a lot of time by knowing
exactly where all of your information is
stored and also you're going to know
exactly where to save all the data that
you download from the internet and all
kinds of new files and documents that
you create yourself so I've broken down
this video lesson in two steps first of
all you're going to create this very
simple excuse me
toolbar that you see here at the bottom
with all these large icons so that we
can have a very quick and easy access to
all of our most frequently used programs
and you're going to have these programs
open up on top of our toolbars so that
don't get cluttered with our toolbar you
see how they're showing up on top here
so if I open Excel here for example it
shows up right there on top instead of
showing up here so it's just a lot
easier that way and it keeps things
organized so that's the first part and
the second part is I have this sort of a
expanding menu created here and let me
just show you an example of how it works
I go to finance investing precious metal
silver images charts as you can see all
of my information is very nicely
organized so if I wanted to pull up my
silver charts all I have to do is just
go to that menu and I know exactly where
all these charts are because I've
organized them by categories and I don't
even have to navigate and you know do
any kind of a
clicking this literally takes seconds so
if I wanted to access all these charts I
would just click on this charts folder
open and then I will have all my charts
silver charts for viewing available here
and I'm going to close that and what I
want you to just keep in mind here is
this icon heart icon it's a really an
empty folder and it's just to indicate
that we have a favorites menu here it
doesn't really do anything by itself is
just an empty folder so it's just
something to keep in mind for now so
let's go ahead and get started and
create this simple toolbar first let's
go to our documents open up documents
and create a folder called apps so we're
going to go to new folder apps and I
already have this folder created here so
I'm just going to open it now
in this folder what we're gonna do is
we're just going to simply put all of
our favorite programs shortcuts in here
now let me show you guys the quickest
way possible to create a shortcut so you
just click on the windows icon here and
then you type the name of the program
for example Photoshop and it's going to
show up in the search results and then
what you do is just hold down the left
mouse button and drag it over and then
release the mouse button and boom it
will create a shortcut right there so
that way you don't really have to
navigate to the actual directory where
program is you can just type any name
that of the program that you use most
frequently and then just drag it over
here just like that
that's once you have all of your
shortcuts that you need you can go ahead
and close this folder and then we're
gonna go ahead and first of all let's
let me remove this menu here
okay so I've removed the menu so just go
ahead and make sure that your taskbar is
unlocked by right-clicking on it and
unchecking the lock taskbar then
right-click on it again go to toolbars
new toolbar and navigate to the folder
where we have created the apps folder in
the documents so I'm going to go to
documents click just click on apps
folder once and then select folder this
will put the apps folder here in the top
right corner now before you do anything
else this is probably how you have it
set up right now all down a second I
also got to remove this toolbar this is
probably how you have it set up right
now so what we got to do is expand this
taskbar by pointing our mouse on top of
the edge here so that we have a resize
icon and then we're going to hold the
left mouse button and drag it to the top
don't drag it all the way because that's
going to cover half of your screen just
drag it over once and that's all we need
now now that we have our apps toolbar
here we're just going to go ahead and
again make sure that you have your
cursor as a resize in this case it's a
diagonally resized cursor and go ahead
and drag it to the left and as you're
dragging to the left also drag it down
so that it goes right underneath of your
open programs just like that if you
don't have any programs that's fine it
still should go down here
just like that so that you have your
shortcuts at the bottom now that we have
that we're going to modify this shortcut
toolbar a little bit go ahead and right
click anywhere on the toolbar just make
sure you don't click on any of the
shortcuts just click anywhere outside of
the shortcuts so I'm going to right
click here and then I'm going to uncheck
show title and I'm going to right click
again and I'm going to uncheck show text
now we have a bunch of small little tiny
icons and I'm going to right click on
the toolbar again I'm going to go to
view and I'm going to select large icons
and that will create our awesome looking
shortcut toolbar for quick and easy
access to our most frequently used apps
and the apps are going to the open apps
are going to show up right on top of our
toolbar which is a very awesome way and
it's neatly organized alright just a few
more things before we move on to the
expanded menu you can just drag these
icons and if you want to move it you
just drag it anywhere but make sure when
you're dragging it before releasing you
are the icon is positioned in between
the other two shortcuts so that we have
this little arrow pointing to the right
at the right bottom corner of the
shortcut that way you'll get it right so
don't do this don't don't drag it on top
of the other icon drag it in between and
that way you can easily move any icon
around and whatever you prefer you know
if you if I personally like to put all
my most frequently used programs here to
the left
you may prefer them on the right you can
just arrange them in any way you want by
doing that
another thing is if you install some
kind of a new program right and it after
installing it it shows up here on your
desktop you can just directly drag it to
your toolbar just like that and release
and then it's going to show up here on
your toolbar and then you can just
delete it from your desktop to keep it
clean and that's it for this tool bar
let's now move on to the expanding menu
toolbar and I'll explain exactly how to
create that okay first of all we're
going to go to we're going to go back to
click on Windows and go to documents
folder and you're going to create a
folder named favorites and I'm actually
going to create hold on I'm just going
to create a folder named favorites too
but because I already have one here I
just want to show you guys exactly how I
created so just create a folder named
favorites okay now remember that heart
icon that I talked about that showed up
here at the bottom left corner to
indicate that we have a favorites menu
there well this is what we're gonna do
first first we're going to create an
empty folder and you can name it
anything I'll just maybe the underscore
but it can really be anything and then
we're going to we're going to hold shift
and we're going to right-click on the
folder we're going to open folder
location and then we're going to
right-click on this folder click
properties go to customize change icon
and then you can select any of these
icons anything you want I prefer using
that heart icon that you've seen earlier
so I'm just going to go to my icons that
I have here
and it's just a bunch of icon and it's
like a collection of different icons
that I've collected over some time and
I'm just going to select my heart icon
because that's what represents favorites
to me
click OK apply and now we have this
empty folder heart icon that's going to
show up here in the corner now I'm going
to show you guys exactly how I organize
all of my information and you may choose
to organize your information in a
different way but this is the best way
possible that have found that works for
me and I'm sure it will work for you
guys as well so first of all we're going
to create super category folders now
what are super super category folders
well they're any kind of topics that are
very general like health you know health
is a very general type of topic and you
can have other topics underneath that
topic for example exercise weight loss
meditation nutrition basically all
everything that's related to health can
be under that folder and it's a very
general type of topic another one could
be finance some other one could be fun
career and you can really come up with
your own this is just the way I do it
here so let's just use these for for now
then I'm going to number them and I
prefer to number them based on the
priority in my life like health is the
number one priority in my wife let's say
career is the second priority in my life
finance money is third priority in my
life and let's say fun is a fourth
priority so that way you really know
what your
I already Tsar as well and knowing your
priorities is a really good way of
organizing information as well it will
help you organize your data and also let
you know what like where you're going in
life and what your goals are so now that
we have these super categories we can go
ahead and also create a few
subcategories so like I said we can have
exercise here and we can have nutrition
for example and these are what I call
super sub categories because they fall
in under a super category okay so you
can also do the same thing for these
other suit main categories
and that's how pretty much I organize my
information by topic now let me also
show you how exactly I organize not only
topics not only topical folder
organization but also I'm going to show
you how I organize all the data under
those categories so let me show you what
I mean because I don't want to confuse
you guys I'm going to go back to my
documents and let's create a folder and
name it folders new folder and name it
folders just like I have here
folders I'm going to open it in the
empty folders named folder named folders
I have this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 folders now
these categories is you're going to put
these under your main category and
subcategories that we've just created
and the reason I have these is these are
data categories you can pretty much save
anything using just
these folders if you think about it any
kind of information pretty much falls
under any of these folders so if you
have some kind of software that's
related to your topic you would just put
it in your tools if you have a video
that you liked that relates to a topic
for example health or weight loss you
can put it in the videos if you have any
kind of Excel spreadsheets that will go
in here any kind of documents notes Word
docs would go in here then you kind of
books or audios or even PDF guides you
have an images folder where you can just
put any kind of image or chart related
to the topic so you can pretty much see
how every one of these folders is
responsible for containing a specific
kind of data so that you know exactly
where to look and the reason I have
folders I mean the reason I have a
folder main folders with these empty
folders in it is so that I can easily
copy all of these so let's go ahead and
do that let's first of all create all
these folders that you see here
audios books Docs guides and it just
spreadsheets tools and videos then we're
going to select all of them by dragging
and selecting right click copy and then
we're going to go back to our documents
and open up the favorites folder that we
created earlier now I already have well
nevermind let me show you the folder
that I'm working on with you guys first
so what we're going to do is we're going
to paste all those folders that we just
copied in every one of these categories
we're going to paste it in the main
category as well as subcategory folders
so we're just going to go ahead and
paste here paste here nutrition paste
here
and we're going to go back career paced
finance and just do this for every
folder that would create it and once
we're done with that let me show you
something I'm going to open up our
health category you see how we have all
these folders here as well as these
subcategories well if yours you have
some kind of a data like some kind of
image that you're not sure you know you
don't you're not sure if it falls under
either of these categories exercise or
nutrition you can basically just put it
in any of them
these folders because it will still be
related to health so if you don't know
if it's specifically related to
subcategories you can just use any of
these folders here to store that
information store that data piece and if
you do know where it falls on there for
example you have some kind of a
spreadsheet and some kind of a exercise
routine that you're going to follow you
can just go to exercise spreadsheets and
have this excel file or spreadsheets
stored in this folder under exercise
spreadsheets so hopefully that makes
sense and hopefully you guys understand
why I created these folders to store a
specific type of information in them so
that later on when from the example that
I showed you about silver like I knew
exactly where it was because it was like
let me show you here if I go to back to
my actual favorites folder where I
already have this created you can see
that I actually have all my all of my
main categories so one of the main
categories is finance then I have these
main sub categories and for example
let's go to investing
and then I have more subcategories under
that you can have as many subcategories
as you wish and I'm going to open up
precious metals again I have
subcategories silver and then you know
at the bottom of this kit subcategory if
you look at the top here favorites
finance investing precious metals silver
I just have my folders that we've talked
about earlier and that's all I have here
I don't have any more subcategories
because silver is pretty much you can
really have any kind of subcategories
below that and here I have guides I have
data I have images charts I have a bunch
of charts here I can look at so it's a
very awesome way to organize information
and hopefully you guys will find it
useful now you can also create other
folders and they don't really have to
follow this kind of pattern you know if
you if you just have a games folder I
just put some games in there I don't
really have any kind of other I don't
have any of these folders here because
well I could if I wanted to learn more
about these games you know but I don't
really feel like it our I just don't do
it and so I don't really care that much
about gaming I just play for fun so but
you can easily have all that then I just
have a bunch of random notes here so
it's really up to you if you want to
create some other folders in your
favorites and these these main
categories is just my own way of store
information and you guys can definitely
do it your way but that's how I do it
and it really it works really well
now that we've have our favorites folder
we're finally ready to create that
expanding menu that I've talked about in
the beginning okay
so we're gonna go we can just close this
favorites folder now
and we can let's go back to the taskbar
and right click on it and go to toolbars
new toolbar go to our documents
navigate to the favorites folder just
click on it once select folder and now
we have our toolbar here and what we're
going to do now is we're going to
position our mouse pointer so that we
have this horizontal resize icon and
we're going to hold the left mouse key
and drag it all the way to the left keep
dragging keep dragging keep dragging
until it switches to the left of our
apps toolbar just like that it will
switch over to the left and now you can
see that we have our apps toolbar here
on the right so what we're going to do
now is drag to the left again position
your mouse cursor right here in this bar
drag over and drag up to the left all
the way to the left until we can't drag
anymore then you're going to have this
favorites word so we're just going to
click anywhere outside we're going to
click on actual toolbar we're going to
right-click on it we're going to go to
uncheck show text we're going to
right-click again uncheck show title now
we're going to go ahead and drag even
more so that this little icon is all
that's showing and then we're going to
right-click on the toolbar once more
go to view large icons and boom look at
that now all we have is this nice little
icon that with a prominent empty folder
that we've created earlier to indicate
that we have a favorites menu here so if
we click on this right pointing arrow
here our menu will expand so now all
that's left is right click on our
taskbar and lock the taskbar and Wow
look at that now we have all of our
information neatly organized and when
have all of our favorite applications
here and we can just have very easy and
quick access to all our information and
let's see okay one last thing that I
wanted to show you guys here is you can
go to click on windows type icons click
on show or high common icons on the
desktop and you can go ahead and uncheck
a computer icon or recycle bin if it's
still showing on your desktop so just go
ahead and uncheck whatever icons are
still showing you on your desktop and
click OK now you have a very clean
desktop and you have all our favorites
applications and a very easy to easy way
to access all your information lastly I
want to show you guys one last thing
here if you go to open up your documents
you'll see this navigation pane here on
the left side of your window you can
also create these shortcuts to the
locations and I like to have my shortcut
to the favorites folder and if we go to
My Documents you can just drag this
folder over here and then it will create
this shortcut to that location so that
way we can have a very easy way to
navigate through our folders as well
another way to cycle through your
windows is to hold alt tab and then you
can just cycle through all these windows
or you can hold down the windows key
press tab and cycle through your windows
in that way you can also mouse over the
folder that's opened and you just need
to mouse over it you don't need to click
on it and then you can just browse
through all the folders that are open
so I'm just showing the others because
it's it'll make it easier to navigate
through all your folders and have a very
quick access to your information and one
last thing is this I'm going to zip up
all these icons and I'm going to have a
link at the bottom of my video for all
these icons which can make make it
easier to organize things because these
icons are really cool I've been using
them here in my menu as you can see here
at the bottom and they really can make
it easier to access information and
that's what the video is about it's
about organizing your files folders and
shortcuts and I really hope that this
has been helpful for you guys let me
know in the comments if you have any
other ideas and what you think thank you
for watching hey guys it's me again a in
last video I forgot to show you
something else about this expanded menu
when you create it and you try to expand
this menu you might have a little delay
until the sub subfolder shows up so
there might be like a 1 to 2 second
delay and that could be a really
annoying so we're going to fix that
right now I'm going to press on the
windows icon go to computer right-click
properties
we're going to go to advanced system
settings under the Advanced tab in the
performance we're going to click
settings and then all we have to do is
uncheck fade or slide menus interview
that's what's causing that little delay
so if you have a checked uncheck it
click apply click OK
ok again close this window and now you
shouldn't have any kind of delay when
expanding this menus here that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
