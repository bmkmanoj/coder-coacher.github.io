tikki and in this video we're gonna
learn about booster for table classes
now booster for added new table classes
that we can use to build good-looking
responsive tables there are also some
changes in the way tables are style
compared to bootstrap 3 as well as prior
releases of bootstrap 4 so I'll make
sure to point out all the differences
and highlight new features so I've
created this basic HTML table templates
without bootstrap styling so all we have
to do is apply bootstrap classes to
these tables and watch the magic happen
alright first let's go ahead and get the
latest version of bootstrap by going to
get bootstrap dot-com and let's click on
a download button as you can see the
latest version at the time of making
this video is bootstrap version 4 beta 3
I'm gonna go ahead and scroll down here
to bootstrap CDN copy the source code
and paste it inside of the HTML head tag
of our HTML project and now we're ready
to work with bootstrap let's go ahead
and apply table classes to see how they
work for a basic table with padded cells
and horizontal dividers we can apply
bootstraps table class to the table
element class equals table and as you
can see this expanded our table by
adding a lot more space between the
columns with padded cells as well as
horizontal dividers making our table a
lot more attractive now let's move on to
the dark table you can use the table -
dark class to invert the colors so that
it has light text on dark background now
make sure to keep the original table
class that we created in the first
example so I'm gonna go ahead and scroll
down here and add the original table
class as well as table - dark to our
table and now we have a dark table now
the dark tables are new in booster for
prior to beta to release this required
table - inverse class and now this class
has been replaced with table - dark in
the latest beta release now let's move
on to the stripe tables so for
alternating background colors on their
own so we can use bootstrap table
- stripe class gonna go ahead and add
the original table as well and table -
stripe and now we have a cold looking
stripe table the next class is called
border table we can use table - border
to add borders all around the table let
me go ahead and apply the style to the
first two tables that we created to see
this class in action so I'm gonna go
ahead and go back to our HTML source
code and scroll up to the first table
and add table - bordered to the first
table and table - bordered to our dark
table as well and now as you can see
that beans has added the borders around
all the cells as well as the entire
table in both of these tables now let's
move on to table head colors let me show
you two classes for highlighting table
headings the tea hat - dark glass as a
black background to the table headers
and teeka - like glass adds a grey
background to the table headers now you
want to make sure to apply this class to
a tea had HTML element instead of the
actual table so first I'm gonna go ahead
and apply the basic table class to both
tables in which we're going to be using
this header classes and then I'm gonna
add tea headlight to the header and
teeka dark to the second table header so
let's go back to our HTML source code
gonna go ahead and add classical's table
first and then class equals T head light
to the first table header and then I'm
gonna scroll down here add class equals
table and class equals table dark to the
second table header gonna go ahead and
go back to the browser and now you can
see that bootstrap has added a white
table header and a dark table header to
our tables alright so let's move on to
responsive tables now now the responsive
tables will create horizontal scroll
bars when viewed on devices below the
given breakpoint now if you want to
learn more about creating responsive
layouts watch my previous video on the
bootstrap for great system okay I'm
gonna go ahead and add table -
responsive to our next table here
I'm gonna add the original table class
and then table - responsive and now what
I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna reduce
the window size and as you can see at a
certain breaking point bootstrap has
added a horizontal bar at the bottom of
our table making it responsive and
that's how responsive tables work now
booster f4 allows you to add the table -
responsive classes to the actual table
HTML element while bootstrap 3 tables
require that you add the class to a
parent div element so I just wanted to
make that clear for you guys now let's
move on to contextual classes now we can
use the contextual classes to color
table rows or table cells and as you can
see I've created a table with all the
class names along with the corresponding
color of that class so now all we have
to do is add these classes to our HTML
code to see the result starting with a
table - primary I'm gonna go back to our
HTML source code and add class equals
table primary to the first table row I'm
also gonna go ahead and add the class
equals table to the entire table next
one is tables secondary so I'm just
gonna go ahead and add all these classes
to the table rows right away now we want
to make sure that we're adding these to
our table rows instead of table cells
even though these also work on table
cells if you want to experiment with
that go ahead and go back to the browser
and I think I've added tables secondary
to the table cell which is fine and you
can see how we can apply these two rows
as well as table cells and that's how
contextual classes work now in bootstrap
3 it doesn't use the table
- prefix for its contextual classes so
for example bootstrap 3 uses primary
without table - prefix other than that
both versions use the same 5 contextual
class is called active success info
warning and danger now let's move on to
the next class for this table I'd like
to show you background utilities to
achieve similar effects as we just did
on
our light table because in the dark
table a regular table background
variants are not available however you
might use background classes instead to
achieve similar effect the background
classes are darker and have more
saturation making them brighter than
regular contextual table classes and as
you can see I've created a similar HTML
table here indicating the class name so
we're gonna go ahead and add these
classes to our table and make it dark as
well okay so I'm gonna go ahead and add
class equals table and table - dark -
this class to our table and then I'm
gonna go ahead and add BG primary to the
first row primary PG success BG warning
and finally last - + PG danger and the
last one BG info and those are the
background classes for dark tables now
the last class I wanted to show you guys
is called table or hovers and I forgot
to demonstrate that one so let's go
ahead and go back to our first two
tables and apply this table - hover
effect to those tables table hover to
the first one and table hover to the
second table as well and you can see
that blue strip has added this really
cool hovering effect
when we mouse over our tables and that's
how easy it is to create beautiful
tables in bootstrap for if you enjoyed
