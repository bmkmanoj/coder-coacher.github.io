in this video we're going to be using
MySQL workbench to model and create a
MySQL database okay so you can see the
model opened up here what we're going to
be doing is creating a database and
tables which will hold all the
information from from the IMDB internet
movie database website the movies table
is going to be in the main table which
will have all the information about the
movies then we'll have a director's
table stars and genres to hold all the
information about those guys and then
we're going to have three joining tables
which is going to be our many to many
relationships because many movies can
have many directors and directors can
have many movies many movies can have
many stars and stars can have many
movies as well as movies can have many
genres and genres can have many movies
so that's why we have the many many
relationship between all the three
tables and the main movies table now if
you don't know what I'm talking about
in the previous video we created a
script code I mean we created a yeah
regular expression script to parse out
or scrape internet movie IMDB comm
website and here's the complete script
you guys can go ahead and download the
source code from the description of this
video
and I've actually modified it a little
bit and I made it so that all the data
is provided in a nicely formatted array
and then all it data is returned and
this whole thing is a big function so
here's an example of how you would use
it you can store everything in a data
array we call the function you specify
the year start as well as a year end and
then the page start and page end then we
can print our our data okay just before
you guys start using the script it's
kind of a hacking thing that we're doing
by creating the script that will parse
out the imdb.com website and if you do
it too much they might not like it and
they might actually ban your IP if you
overdo it
so when you're just testing out the
script
careful with how many pages you specify
here start very small so this is why I'm
only specifying two pages to scrape to
show you guys how this works
okay so let's go ahead and see what
happens here when I run the script okay
so it's it's going to load the as a
script is loading it's going to parse
out all the records and then it's going
to display this big array I'm going to
go to view page source and you can see
how the array is organized very nicely
it's got all the movie information along
with the title ear image etc so now
we're ready to work with this array and
and we're ready to create the actual
MySQL database that looks like this
okay so MySQL workbench is a free
program you guys can download it and I'm
going to I'm going to go ahead and open
up the workbench here and create a new
connection by clicking on this plus icon
I'm going to name my connection
localhost for the username I'm going to
live it as root and press them in store
in Vault button and enter my password
then I'm going to test the connection
and it should say successfully made the
MySQL connection at this point I'm going
to click OK I'm going to double click on
this connection to connect to it and
then I'm going to go to file new model
necessary we're going to be modeling our
database I'm going to double click on an
ad diagram and it's going to have this
toolbar on the left side and these are
all the tools we can use to model our
database so we're going to click on this
icon down here which says place a new
table to place our first table and then
I'm going to double click on this table
and a new box will pop up with where we
can name our table as well as specify
all the column names ok so I'm going to
name this table movies and then under
the first column name I'm going to enter
ID I'm going to expand this box a little
bit so you guys can see this better and
this is going to be our unique
identifier so
and it's going to be the primary key
which is going to autoincrement
so make sure the primary key checkbox is
checked make sure that not null is
checked make sure that the auto
increment checkbox is checked as well
okay so at this point in order to figure
out what the column names are we already
have we're ready know all the
information that we're going to be
needing so I'm just going to refer back
to this model here and in order to know
what all the fields are so we got a
title here an image URL and I'm going to
go ahead and enter those right now title
here image URL I'm going to go back to
the image and certificate runtime IMDB
arraying so I'm just going to keep going
back and entering always description
meta score votes and drawers okay so now
that we entered all the column names
we're ready to specify what the data
type will be I already have that so for
the title we're going to have a varchar'
year is going to be an INT image URL is
going to have a bar chart which is going
to be 255 characters so we're going to
specify that over here in the data types
okay so the year is going to be int and
the image URL is going to be a little
bit longer I think because well if we go
to back to this data here you can also
refer to all the data in this array and
you can see that the image URL is in
fact a little bit long so we want to
account for that okay so next field is
going to be certificate and it's going
to be a very small text so
we want to leave it as 45 characters now
the wrong time we actually want to have
it as int because that's going to be an
integer the amount of seconds or rather
the amount of minutes the movie runs
I am BD IMDb rateing
that's going to be a float because it's
going to be a fractional number so
that's the way they store it now the
description is going to be text because
it's a description of the movie so it's
going to be a paragraph or more of text
meta score is just going to be int votes
is going to be int and Ross is going to
be int as well and I'm going to delete
this extra column here okay so the
description is text Metascore intros in
grass end okay so now that we have all
of our fields for the movies let me see
I'm going to go ahead and close this and
expand them if I click on the table now
I can go ahead and drag this little box
here to expand it and then it's going to
show what the actual movie table looks
like now and we actually want to make
the title unique because we only want to
have unique movie titles in our movies
database so I'm going to double click on
the movies table again I'm going to
expand the window here and for the title
I'm going to say I'm going to check this
checkbox which is unique and also it's
going to be not know now the year and an
image URL should also be not null
because those are the values that I'm DB
always has all the rest you can leave it
as that as as null values because
sometimes all those see what they're
going to be null okay at this point I
think our movies table is done so I'm
going to go ahead and save this file
under movies and maybe movies okay all
right so now that our movies table is
complete I can we can also create a
directors which is only going to have
that
i D named about we can create the stars
which is going to have exactly the same
thing and then the genres which is also
going to have just the name okay let's
go ahead and create those three tables
now okay so go back to our diagram and
click on the table to create a new table
double-click click on this table and
name in directors under ID we're going
to have a primary key make sure it's out
of incremented create another column
name name name and about just to make
sure name is going to be a varchar and
about it's going to be text
okay so vowels can be a text and I'm
just going to leave we're just going to
leave name as 45 characters because I
don't think there's any name that's
going to exceed that and I'm just going
to say the name is going to be not null
and unique as well check the unique box
okay so so now we can also create
another table called stars and it's
pretty much going to be the same thing
is going to be really similar to
directors I'm going to double click on
it name it stars create the ID primary
key Auto increment not null name
varchar' and about text not know for the
name and unique the name okay so that's
done and then the final table is going
to be in sonorous I'm going to double
click on that name is onerous create the
primary key ID again make sure its
primary key not null and auto increment
and for the field name for the column
name just going to have one name and
name it name
and for the for the text I'm also going
to leave it as varchar' 45 and make it
not null and unique okay at this point
all of our tables are complete now we're
ready to specify what the relationship
is going to be between these tables
because like I mentioned in the
beginning of this video many movies can
have many directors many movie many
movies can have many stars and many
movies can have many genres which means
it's a many-to-many relationship and in
order to create a many-to-many
relationship in MySQL workbench and this
is what makes it really awesome on the
tool bar over here let me just expand
this a little bit so it becomes visible
okay so okay you should be able to see
now so on a toolbar down here you can
see Jesus okay okay so you can see this
icon here which says place a new and
Colin M identifying relationship so what
you do is click on this icon to create a
many-to-many relationship then you click
on the movies table and then you click
on the table on the target table for
example directors at this point is going
to create a new table named movie head
directors and you have successfully
created and many to many relationship
between movies and directors and it's
really that easy ok next up I'm going to
create I'm going to do exactly the same
thing click on this icon again then
click on the movies and then stars
that's going to create a many to many
relationship between movies and stars
and then do the same thing with genres
and now we have successfully created the
many to many relationships between
movies directors movie stars and movies
genres now I'm not sure why it's naming
it movies has directors I prefer to name
it
movies directors because directors can
have many movies so it's like directors
have movies as well and do the same
thing with the movies stars and movies
genres double click on it
rename it to movies genres and at this
point let me just check to make sure we
have everything if I go back here so at
this point we have successfully modeled
and created our diagram now let's
actually physically create it in the
database so the last step here is to
make sure you save this diagram by going
to file save model and name it whatever
you want and then you're going to click
on this database tab and then for word
engineer which is just a fancy way of
saying we're going to create this
database now on our localhost and then
you want to you're going to have this
window here at the bottom I'm going to
click Next click Next again click Next
again next and then is it's going to say
forward engineering progress and all
these boxes should be checked
that means the database has been forward
engineered and finished successfully you
can close this window now and then you
can either use your command prompt or
open up the minus QL word MySQL PHP
myadmin
getting confused with all those names
ok so PHP myadmin I'm going to log into
it I'm just going to make sure the
database has in fact been created under
the database you should see movies oh
whoops
ok so I know what happened here let me
let's fix it and it's going to be really
fast so under under the model here um
okay so you can you should see the
catalog tree here go ahead and
double-click on it and it should say my
DB rename it to the movies database and
also go ahead and create the movies
database create database movies you can
do that in command prompt or you can
also do that in the PHP myadmin by going
to databases and then create database
just enter the name then click create
okay so now that the database has been
created we can forward engineer the
script again and it should work now
forward engineer click next next next
next and looks like it's successful go
back to the PHP myadmin
and all the fields are there so let's
test it out and click on the movies
table structure all those fields are
there and go back to the movies database
and you can see all the tables have been
created and you can play around with it
and check to make sure all the columns
and database data types are correct and
as you can see all of our relationship
tables have been created as well and
that's how you create and model the
database using MySQL workbench if you
guys found this video useful please go
ahead and like share and subscribe and
please make sure to watch the next video
where we're going to be inserting all
the data that we're scraping from the
from the IMDB database and we're going
to be inserting all this data the inside
the database that we just modeled so
we're going to create the script for
that and make sure you don't miss that
until next time Claire we take you out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
