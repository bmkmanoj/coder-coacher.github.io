tikki and in this video we're going to
cover PHP variables in more detail just
a quick review variable names must start
with a dollar sign followed by the
variable name and the variable name must
start with a letter or an underscore we
assign a value to the variable using the
equal operator and we end the statement
with a semicolon variable names in PHP
are case-sensitive alright let's do some
coding here open up with PHP tags I'm
gonna first of all define a constant
named BR and place the value of it as an
HTML tag BR because I'm going to be
using this throughout the video okay and
then I'm going to define some variables
all these variables are going to going
to have a string value just going to put
console names as my values okay so all
of these three variables are different
variables because variable names in PHP
are case-sensitive and this is an
example so you guys can clearly see that
they're in fact different so this is the
output and as you can see Atari Sega
Nintendo they're all outputting
different values because they those are
different variables which hold all these
different values
okay so that's how that works and now
let me just give you an example of
function inside the very inside the
variable value so you can do something
like this and square root is a is the
square root of a number and you can use
that function inside the value and then
that would output four because that's
the square root of four we can also use
something called a ternary expression
and if you don't know how that works and
here's a quick overview so first we have
a conditional expression here on the
left side followed by the question mark
if that condition evaluates to true then
expression 2 is going to be our value
otherwise
expression 3 is going to be the value
which is false and those two are
separated by the Colin
okay so we can say something like age
equals 33 and then let's assign the
result to a variable called eval let us
say eval equals and then we're going to
run that through the ternary logic
expression you're over 21
okay there's your drink and then the
Kullen in case expression is false here
not all denied and then output the eval
and now will be equal to you're over 21
years your drink because H is greater
than 21 so that's another way to assign
value using a ternary expression now let
me show you guys something called a
variable variable so variable variable
is something as when we use a variable
name in place of the variable name when
we assign when we create the variable so
for example for example our variable
name holds the value of second and so
this will be the same thing as writing
Sega equals whatever value is there
because when we write to double to
dollar signs the value of the name is
placed inside of this inside of this
variable and so this will be the same
thing as writing Sega equals 16-bit
console so now we have a new variable
called Sega
now we can go ahead and output that and
we use the BR text here and it's a
16-bit console and now that we can see
we have a second variable okay so that's
how that works
also when if we had an array named
planets with a bunch of different
planets we can also use variable
variable so if we place planets and
specify the key like to here this would
be the same thing as writing and
actually assign a valley to it since
Mars was the Roman got over so this
would be the same as writing Mars equals
Roman god of war because we're
specifying the array in place of the
variable name and then we use the key
index two which is equal to Mars
so that would be Mars dollar sign Mars
equals got a word so that's another way
of creating a variable variable with an
array now let's go over referencing real
fast referencing you can think of it as
making a copy of the source array so if
we create a variable named copy and then
we use the end operator followed by the
variable name which is our source
variable and remember name because Sega
so copy is also going to be equal to
Sega now okay let's create a br tag so
here now wait hold on a sec
actually lets out with Mars here because
just to show you an example Roman god of
war is Mars just so you see that we have
a new variable Mars okay cool
and then so I created the copy variable
and that I create a reference to the
name variable now the copy is going to
have second as Valley because we
referenced our original source which has
a value Sega okay so now if we changed
the source variable to something else
like Xbox one for example our copy would
also change so if I print out copy it
will be equal to Xbox one so you can see
that whenever we change the source our
reference variable is also going to be
changed so that's how that works now if
we unset the source using the unset
function that variable would no longer
exist so if you try to print it out we
try to print out the source variable
notice undefined variable which is what
expected but if we output the copy the
copy would still exist so just keep in
mind that whenever we change the value
of the source variable the copy that the
reference variable also changes but when
we unset when we delete the source
variable the copy the reference still
lives on so that's how referencing works
now just a few functions to show you how
the variables can be manipulated so
unset is one of the ways to basically
undefined or unset the variables now if
I had the variables some arrays here
let me just paste them this is a this is
associative array or she ativ and this
is a numeric here below and okay so
let's print them both out first of all
and then
and print our numeric and I'm also going
to use the pre tags to make it nicely
format it otherwise they're kind of hard
to read in the output so it do this real
quick
okay so these are my arrays here the
first one is an associative array and
the second one is a numeric with numeric
index keys and I can use the function
called unset - just like we used it on
the variable we can unset specific array
keys so I can say unset named and then I
can just pick a key like car for example
and then car key would be unset if I
actually okay yeah let me just unset it
here and then as you can see the car key
disappeared from from from the array
output so that's how that works
and we can do this on the numeric array
as well we can unset unset numeric
example say three and now we're done set
our number 12 which was the value of the
key three so that's how we can use the
unset on the arrays now we can also use
a is set function to check if the key is
set and we can do the ternary operator
and say you have an income if it's set
otherwise you don't have any income
and print that out you have an income so
echo if is and basically what it does is
it checks if the income key exists
inside the array named and if it does
then the true value is set to 2 the
output otherwise if we unset named
income then we're going to have then
we're going to have you don't have any
income so if I comment that out you have
an income okay so that's how his set
works and we can do this on a bunch of
different key names as well as variable
names now there's also some functions to
determine the data type of the array
like for example echo is array you can
check if the if the variable is array
and then do the same I'm an array I'm
not an array here okay I'm an array
because that variable is an array just
do the VRTX here real fast okay cool
all right so is error checks if it's an
array and there's a bunch of other
functions to determine the value type of
all the variables is array is float is
int is object is Bowl and is string now
the get type will get us the type of
that variable so if I did echo get type
named that would be an array okay and I
just want to keep using his BR tags so
if you guys can read it easily here okay
array and if get type or something else
like like name which is a string
variable
that would be a string type string so
that's how you get the data type of the
variable and these are pretty useful
this will be pretty handy later on as
you start getting more familiar with PHP
encoding okay lastly I just want to show
you guys the scope inside a function and
outside so we had a function this would
be local scope meaning only variables
variables that are created inside this
function function are only going to be
accessible inside a function unless they
are defined as global and to define them
global we use a global key and then we
can assign a value to the global it goes
I'm all over the place okay so if I try
to access the local variable outside the
function I'll get a notice undefined
variable because that variable is only
accessible inside the local scope it's
not accessible in a global scope which
is outside the function however if I try
to access in the global variable which
was defined as global you would say oh I
first have to call the function yes I
forgot to call the function my bad
so call the function and now the
variable local is undefined but the
global is is defined so it's outputting
the value of the global variable because
we define it using the global keyword so
that's how variable scope works and this
concludes this video I hope you like I
hope you guys found this useful if you
did please share and like it's really it
would be really appreciated
ok thanks for watching this video I'll
see you in the next one till then clever
take you out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
