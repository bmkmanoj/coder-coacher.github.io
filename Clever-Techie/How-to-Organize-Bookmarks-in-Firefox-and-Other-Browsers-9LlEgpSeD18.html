video we're gonna learn how to organize
our bookmarks in a browser and I'm going
to use Firefox but this can be easily
done in any other browser first of all
this organizing technique is based on
the same exact concept which we use in
the organizing of the files and folders
so if you watch that video this will be
very easy to follow but even if you
haven't still going to be pretty
straightforward so first of all number
one step of organizing the bookmarks in
a very efficient way is to create the
most important categories that are
applied to your personal life for
example you can see how I've created my
categories here health career personal
finance GED which stands for general
education fund security miscellaneous
cooking and I've numbered all these
folders by their respective priority so
health is the number one priority in my
life and that's why I put it as number
one and then followed by career personal
and so forth when you create these
folders just think of a topic that's
very important in your life and just
just something general like health I
mean health is pretty important to
everybody's life I'm sure but you can
create whatever categories that you wish
and go ahead and number them in their
priority which in the order that you
want next I have this folder here it's
and it's the folder called folders so
let me show you here if I go to
bookmarks show bookmarks I created a
folder here which is named folder under
the main bookmarks toolbar category
under this
under the folder folders folder I have
all these subfolders and these are these
are all empty folders now what are these
these are basically any kind of a
category information that you'll find
online will fall under these categories
either you're reading an article you
know you found a book that you want to
read it Amazon you want to download some
software so and I think websites is the
most use folders the most frequently
used folder because you know you find a
new cool blog or something like that you
want to bookmark it BAM you put it in
your your website's folder under health
for example so anyway let me show you
why I created these empty folders here
because you're not actually going to put
information inside of these folders
instead you're going to I'm going to
select all of these follows ok just
select the first one hold shift click on
the last folder right click copy to copy
all these folders and then go through
each in one of these categories you
should have all these created these
folders created here like I talked about
and paste them inside everyone on these
folders so we just copied these folders
again and we're going to paste them
under each and every one of these main
categories that we have here so you can
see that these all these folders are
under health see articles here downloads
websites etc and go ahead and once
you're done with that we are pretty much
done with them with the most important
technique here so I'm gonna go and exit
out and I'm gonna show you something
here for example if I my if I stumble
upon some
of a health article that's important to
me I can just first of all I can just
put a website in this and this websites
under health
so next time I'm thinking about reading
some kind of a health article out and
just access I know exactly where the
article is by opening up web sites
folder in under Health section and
articles I chose to arc organize all
these articles by subcategories because
there's just so many there's just so
many health related topics out there
that you know it's it's a lot easier not
to have articles all in one place so you
can do the same thing you can create
subfolders under these main folders here
and you can even add additional folders
that are related only there is only
specific to the to the main category for
example markets I mean that's only
related to health like markets where I
get health food so I save them all here
under the markets folder and which is
created also I have a fitness folder
which is a subcategory of health so and
as you can see here I haven't pasted all
these subfolders yet but if I get
interested in fitness so much that I
want to explore it more then I'm going
to of course go to my bookmarks go to my
folders copy all of these all these
folders here copy go to health fitness
and I'm going to paste all these
organizational folders here so that I
can better organize my my fitness
content if it's getting out of hand so I
can just put that inside the articles
and then this video here here YouTube
channel I can put it here and I'm not an
article so BAM this fitness folder is
very neatly organized now now that I go
here articles I can just access all
these article
and I want to wish that video here
should be here there we go there's a
video here so you can just experiment
with it if you don't know where you're
going to save a specific type of
information you can always create
miscellaneous folder and just create
some random subcategories here it
doesn't really need to be neatly
organized this is how I have mine here
and let me show you something else under
finance for example if it gets a little
finance is a very general topic so for
example if I'm interested in investing
as you can see I have a lot of other
folders here besides the main
organizational ones so I would go to
invest I'll create a subcategory called
investing and investing it's also a
general category so I have a bunch of
other subfolders under investing and so
you can create these you can keep
creating these subfolders but in the end
when you when you know you would really
want to explore a specific topic for
example precious metals if I want to go
after silver say then I could also paste
those organizational folders under that
specific topic so you can see how I've
combined the categories and
subcategories and the organizational
folders together to create this very
nice organizational way to quickly
access my information so if I wanted to
I'm thinking about silver and then I can
just go to investing well first I'll go
to finance last team
I know it's precious metal silver then I
would want to look up some reports and I
would just you can really see this here
but let me expand it do this again
molesting precious metals silver reports
and then I can just access all these
here under the reports silver so just
play around with us see what works for
you you don't really have to follow this
kind of an organizational folder exactly
you can create your own but I found that
most content on the Internet falls under
falls under these categories here but
you can all just create your own and use
subcategories if the topic gets to
generally you want to break it down to
another subcategory so that's pretty
much it I hope this was helpful
this was clever techie signing out see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
