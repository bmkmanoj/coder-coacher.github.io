this video I want to show you how to use
our hotkey program to increase our speed
and productivity while using windows
here's what we're going to do we're
going to increase productivity by
launching our favorite programs and
switching between them using windows
activate feature of autohotkey and we're
also going to review most useful and
common windows and browsers hotkeys and
use that in combination with other
hotkeys custom hotkeys for maximum
productivity now let me just show you
what I mean real fast
I've set up my other hotkeys already and
I'm going to press ctrl shift F and that
launches Firefox if I press ctrl shift D
they'll launch notepad and I can start
taking notes
if I press ctrl shift C they lunch
Google Chrome and I can do whatever I
want here I can search for stuff now
that was me launching programs that I
use the most
now what I mean by window activation is
this if I hold down the windows key and
press D that will activate my win
notepad window and if I hit Windows F
they'll bring me back to Firefox and I
can do the same with windows C which
will bring me back to Google Chrome so I
can just quickly switch between all
these windows and I'm actually going to
show you guys a very practical way at
the end of this video of how I
personally use the simple hotkeys to
speed up my own productivity on windows
anyway let's get started let's go ahead
and install download and install
autohotkey by going to this website aah
script org slash download and you want
to get the Installer and once it's
finished downloading open the file
and you want to go ahead and install it
I obviously already have it installed so
you should have the install text here so
just go ahead and click on that and
install so once you once that install is
you're pretty much ready to use it go
ahead and open notepad and in notepad
we're going to create our first
autohotkey script what you want to do
first once you have your notepad open is
go to file save as and when saving the
file as you definitely want to select
all files because we're going to save it
with a lot of hotkey extension and I'm
just going to save the file to my
desktop and name it script that a HK
make sure you can have any name but make
sure it has dot HK extension that's how
autohotkey is gonna know that we're
creating a new autohotkey script and
click Save once you're done now I've
prepared a very simple script that we're
going to paste in here let me just grab
this little script here and I'm gonna go
over the script real fast and tell you
guys what it means because once you
understand this little script you're
going to be able to create your own
hotkeys so first of all the semicolon
here means that a hotkey script is going
to in grow ignore the following line so
this is just every line that starts with
a semicolon
including this line here and this line
is just for us users to understand
what's going on autohotkey is not going
to do anything with this so anyway the
this carrot is going to be interpreted
as a control key the plus sign is going
to be interpreted as a shift key
exclamation mark is going to be our Alt
key and the number sign is going to be
our Windows key
so these are just for creating our own
custom hotkeys now in order to let's
first figure out how to launch a program
so as you can see here I've set up my
hotkey with a caret followed by a plus
so what does that mean well that means
ctrl + Shift keys press simultaneously
because the caret is a control key and
the plus sign is a Shift key there this
hotkey makes up control shift D and
that's how I run notepad so every time
you set up your own custom hotkey you
want to follow it up with a colon colon
and then the keyword run followed by a
space and then you would put full
destination to where the program
executable is located and I'm just going
to show you guys real quick how that's
done if I I'm using Windows 10 right
here and if I just type notepad and then
I I right-click on it I can go to open
file location' and that will tell me
where the shortcut is located and then
you can just shift hold shift and right
click on the shortcut and you can copy s
path and just paste it into your script
here and you want to remove those double
quotes as well now it's okay to link to
run the hobby shortcuts but as you can
see I actually added the path where the
executable is located so it's better to
create the path to the executable
because your shortcuts can change over
time so just make sure that you know
where the executable is located and just
paste it here depending on whatever
program you want to run
all right once that's done this is how
you launch your custom program this is
going to work I've tested it and the
next thing is how to activate a a
program window like I showed you guys
earlier where I was switching between
windows so I've set it up with a Windows
key followed by a letter so it's very
simple and this really helps because
Windows has already pre-made a hot key
which is a Windows key and then you can
use arrows to position your windows
around the screen by using their windows
snapping feature so you can have a split
window side by side and at the same time
while you're activating those windows
you can actually position them which
gives you a very convenient way of
managing all your windows and I'm going
to show you what I mean
later in this video so anyway as you can
see the number sign is our Windows key
followed by D which means windows key D
and then Colin Colin and then the
special command of autohotkey script
called window activate which activates
the window and then you want to type you
want to type space followed by the name
of the window and when you open notepad
for example you can see it's window name
right at the top of the window here and
just to be sure our hotkey script comes
with a special program called window spy
if you open up windows pi which is a
program that comes with installing when
you install a hotkey
you can see here it's got a window title
and if I click on notepad window at the
top it's gonna show what the window name
is and you can see note that is here now
this might have been obvious because you
have actual notepad text show up here in
the window
but if you for example open up Google
Chrome
that's not very apparent because there's
no chrome anywhere in here but if you
have your window spy open and you
activate Chrome window you can see that
Google Chrome is the name of the window
so all you have to do if you wanted to
activate Google Chrome is just match
this chrome text and that's it so that's
how you activate the window you just
type this your shortcut followed by
colon colon win activate space and then
the name of the window now you might
have noticed another line that doesn't
have a semicolon here which is a special
command in autohotkey script which is
set title match mode reg X column now
you don't really have to understand what
it does but what it does is just matches
the window name and we want to have that
command in here if we want this to work
so that's about it
let's just go ahead and test the script
out now you want to go ahead and open up
your script that HK and I already have
it open but I'm just going to close it
here real fast just to show you guys
what I mean I want to right click on it
and I want to go ahead and run script
and that's how you activate your script
now if I press ctrl shift D my notepad
opens up because that's the key hotkey
that we have set up for notepad and if I
for example go back to Firefox and then
I test the window activation feature
that we just set up by pressing Windows
key D that will activate notepad so we
know that launching notepad works and
activating window
well notepad window also works so now
I'm just going to close it and
if you go here to your taskbar you can
see that your script that HK is running
and you can right click on it and edit
the script and that's how you would edit
your actual script by adding more
shortcuts commands whatever you want to
it another thing that I really recommend
is that you guys actually add the script
to your startup folder let's see here
yeah don't forget to reload out a hot
key script every time you modify it and
you want to watch out for any conflicts
when you create your own custom hotkeys
to make sure that they don't conflict
with other pre-made windows and other
hotkeys so just test out your hotkeys to
make sure they don't do anything before
you add them to your autohotkey script
and reload your autohotkey script by
going here and moving your mouse over
the script at HK right clicking on it
and clicking reload script okay so let's
go ahead and put our script at HK into
the windows startup folder so you just
want to cut or copy your script at HK
and you want to locate your windows
directory which is windows startup
directory which is a folder that lets
Windows know where what kind of programs
you want to start when windows starts
because you want to run your script when
windows starts and have all your hotkeys
ready to go so this is a directory see
users your username AB data roaming
Microsoft Windows Start menu programs
start up it's a very long directory but
just go ahead and navigate to it
let me see here startup many programs
then startup and as you can see I have
my script here in this directory alright
let's see what's next now every time
Windows starts you're gonna have that
script launching from the startup menu
so you have to run it every time you
start Windows and let me just show you
real quick what kind of a very useful
hotkeys that I use most of the time I
mean there's a ton of them but I'm gonna
show you guys the most useful ones for
example if I go to Firefox you can press
ctrl T and that will open up a new tab
you can press ctrl W to close the tab
that's very useful and if you keep
pressing ctrl W that will just close
Firefox and if I open Firefox again and
the window is activated I can just press
ctrl L and then we will bring my
activation of the window to the address
bar and then I can just start searching
or something so ctrl L is a useful
hotkey to go right ahead and start
searching so those are the browser
hotkeys that I use then the windows key
combined with left and right will snap
windows to the screen so you can have
all kinds of split screen windows
side-by-side and you can minimize and
maximize windows and that's a very
useful hotkey to have when activating
windows with that autohotkey script and
i recently switched the windows 10 and
they let you do a 4-way windows split
and it's a very useful
featured to have and it's actually the
only reason I switch the windows 10
which allows you to have those four
windows splits especially if you have a
large monitor so anyway
Alta 4 will close any program and then
finally I want to show you guys how I
actually use autohotkey script combined
with Windows Keys to maximize my own
productivity so here we go alright let's
see here this is the actual script that
I'm running right now and as you can see
I've done the same thing that I've just
explained to you guys I just added a
bunch of other programs for activating
my windows and then I've added a bunch
of other programs to launch my programs
and I just added this text here which is
going to be ignored by autohotkey and
this text here just so I know what it
does now it might be useful for you to
actually you know when you're creating a
hotkey it's pretty useful to create a
letter which matches the program's first
letter name you know here I have a
Windows a that activates action outline
which starts with a letter A here I have
win activate Kindle which K matches the
K and etc you know Firefox window
windows F will activate Firefox windows
C will activate Chrome which starts with
AC etc but you're not always going to
have this many letters especially if
you're using a lot of programs so for
example here I have a Windows Q which
activates command prompt the windows C
was already taken by Chrome here so it
really doesn't have to match and I find
it just more useful and I can memorize
it better if they do match but if you
run out of hotkeys you can do anything
you want you can do something like you
know I've done here like I I've done
windows d4 notepad because it ends with
a D so just make it easier for yourself
and then the same thing with launching
the programs I usually like it to have
matching letters the ones that I use for
window activation I also use them for
launching programs you know and these
all match like the same letter that I
used to at launch the program I use them
to activate the window alright finally
I'm going to show you guys how I use all
this to maximize my productivity in a
practical way like what I do with this
in real life alright so one example that
you might be doing is people might be
learning how to program on the on their
computer right and what do you need when
you actually program here I have this in
my notes well you use an IDE where you
actually do the programming you use a
book where you learn from you use a
browser for the output to see what your
website might look like after you
program it you use a console which is a
command prompt to input commands and
modify you what your program does and
then what I like to do is I like to
document everything that I learned from
the programming by using my notes by
using a program called action outline
and I like to document everything that I
learned because I have a really bad
memory all right let me show you guys
what I mean I'm gonna press ctrl shift e
to launch Adobe Acrobat and I'm going to
position this window to the side here
I'm also going to press ctrl shift are
to launch rubymine which is my IDE where
I program things and I'm going to open
up this Ruby on Rails book while Ruby
mine is launching and let me just close
Firefox here real fast so I can
show you guys I'm going to close all
this stuff to okay
all right so now my my Ruby mine is it's
not active so I'm going to press windows
R and my IDE just got activated where I
code so I'm going to position it to the
right by pressing Windows and then the
right key so I have these two windows
side by side it's uh it's really useful
if you have a large monitor and don't
worry if you don't see the text on
screen this is just to see where all the
windows are okay so so I can be reading
this book here and do my programming
here and what I also mentioned is I'm
going to hit control shift Q to launch
the command prompt and I'm going to
navigate to my program directory which
is a sample app and this is just to show
you guys how I can arrange the windows
you don't have to be a programmer and
you don't have to understand any of this
code obviously so now I have my IDE at
the top I have my command prompt here at
the bottom and it's very nicely aligned
I can also control shift F hit control
shift F up enough Firefox and now what
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
follow I'm going to position this window
here at the bottom and this window so
here I have a four-way split which I was
talking about Windows 10 all right now
I'm going to launch the app by going
back back to the command prompt and as
you can see I can also actually switch
between all these windows I don't know
if you can tell or not but I'm actually
switching between them right now I have
my Firefox window activated and right
now I press Windows
II and I have my my PDF book activated
right now press Windows R and I'm back
to my to my coding
IDE where I tie my code and now if I
press Windows Q I'm back to my command
prompt now you can actually click on all
those windows and do the same thing but
I prefer to use hotkeys especially if
for example I'm reading a book right and
then I wanted to see what my program
looks like and I don't want to do the
four-way split I just want to have my
book open and take up the whole
horizontal height of the screen I can go
back to the Firefox easily by pressing
Windows F that will bring me back to the
Firefox and then I can press control L
to go back to the browser bar localhost
3000 and that will open up my app and I
can see what it looks like so this just
gives me a lot of flexibility between
switching the through the windows
opening up my favorite programs
you know when I'm learning I told you
guys that I like to take notes well I
just press ctrl shift a and I open up
action outline and I have my Ruby on
Rails notes here which I can just go
over here and you can see I have my all
my Ruby on Rails notes and I haven't
nicely organized here so I can also just
press ctrl shift a to open up action
outside whatever I need to take notes as
I'm learning from the book and as I'm
typing these commands I can just do all
of this very easily without the hassle
of like going and trying to find where
the window is and all of that stuff I
can open up the notepad
and just switch between all those
windows very quickly leading to a very
productive way of learning how to
program and these are all the other
applications that I use and you guys can
go ahead and just feel free to add your
own lastly I just want to show you here
let's see where did I put it
let's go back here just again what the
hotkey means you know you can set up
your own hotkeys with ctrl shift alt and
Windows key and there's plenty of
documentation about action uh about
autohotkey script so just feel free to
use Google if you want to do something
advanced but that was it for this video
and I hope you guys found it useful and
I really hope it will increase your
productivity and speed up the way you
use Windows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
