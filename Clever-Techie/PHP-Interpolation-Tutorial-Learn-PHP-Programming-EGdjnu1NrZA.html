and in this video we're gonna cover PHP
interpolation what is interpolation well
it's a way to access arrays and the
methods and properties inside double
quotes so I've broken them down in four
categories first is a preferred way then
there's valid alternatives then there's
the only way and finally there are all
they invalid ways to access properties
etc so let's go over to the preferred
method first so if you have an array
with a single associative key and
there's no spaces in that associative
key you must enclose the whole thing in
curly brackets now next if you have just
an numeric array with a numeric key then
you don't need any curly brackets for
that and that's that only applies to
single single dimensional arrays now
this is a really cool one here if you
have an object and you're trying to
access a property name you don't need
any curly brackets and this is the one
that I've just found out about as I was
making this video I thought that you had
to enclose those in curly brackets
before and as it turns out you don't
have to so this is just a really clean
way of accessing property names of your
objects so next there's a valid
alternatives okay so this one I also
didn't know about so if you have a
associative single dimensional array you
try to access the associative key name
you actually don't have to enclose it in
the quotes in the single quotes in this
case and PHP manual
that's what they say you don't have to
enclose that in in any quotes however it
can get a little messy later on and if
you try to print this out outside of
double quotes it's not gonna work also
if you have a space in your associated
key that's also not going to work out so
I still prefer the preferred method of
enclosing the associative key inside the
curly brackets inside the double quotes
when you have a single associative array
key
okay so if you have a numeric key you
can also enclose that in curly brackets
but these curly brackets are optional so
I prefer this way here and also under
valid alternatives we have our property
names you can also enclose them in curly
brackets but they're also optional as
I've just found out okay so the third is
the only way you can access you can
access the properties and in this case
we're trying to access object method and
you can access object method if you
enclose it in curly brackets however
that's not true for regular functions as
you can see down here I've concatenated
the function with the dots with the
concatenate operators so when it comes
to object methods you can enclose that
in curly brackets but when you when I
when it comes to functions you must
concatenate it okay next up we got an
associative single dimensional array
with space which you must enclose in
curly brackets and for any
multi-dimensional arrays just remember
that we have to enclose all
multi-dimensional array keys in curly
brackets whether they're a numeric or
associative
okay so function names you must
concatenate and constant you also must
concatenate constants you can just put
them inside the double quotes with curly
brackets or in any other way
okay so invalid methods here you can see
that I've I've printed the array with an
associative key outside the double
quotes which is not gonna work you're
gonna get an error here
up next is a constant enclosed in curly
brackets which is not gonna work as well
next is a function name enclosing curly
brackets which is also not gonna work as
you can see the text highlighter is
interpreting at the values as just
strings next up we got an object
properties which are enclosed in single
curly brackets that's invalid next we
have a method call which is
enclosed in curly brackets that's not
gonna work as opposed to method
properties next up we got a
multi-dimensional array which is not in
closing curly brackets that's not gonna
work and up next we got a array which is
which gotta which is a multi-dimensional
array that has a string key followed by
the numeric key which is enclosed in
curly brackets now that is a tricky one
because you can use a single dimensional
array without enclosing the the key in
single quotes but when it comes to
multi-dimensional arrays you can't you
absolutely must include enclose the
random key word here in single or double
quotes otherwise it's not gonna work
okay next up we got an associative array
with a space in it that's not gonna work
so you must enclose it in curly brackets
and next up we got a numeric
multi-dimensional arrays which we also
must enclose in curly brackets and
finally we got these two which this is
another way of accessing your keys
outside of the array you can actually
use curly brackets instead of square
brackets but it's not gonna work when it
comes to enclosing when it comes to
accessing them inside a double quotes so
I definitely recommend using square
brackets when accessing all array keys
outside of double quotes so you guys can
go ahead and download this sort of a
cheat sheet to your computer and I hope
it's gonna help you out if you like this

I'll see you next time clever take you
