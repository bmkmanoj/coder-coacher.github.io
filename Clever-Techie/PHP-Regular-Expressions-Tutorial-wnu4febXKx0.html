tikki and in this video we're going to
learn PHP regular expressions okay so
this is a cheat sheet that I've created
here and I'm going to refer to it
throughout this video and if you guys
want to download a full resolution of
this image I have included a link in the
description of this video so if you like
to download it go ahead and do so
okay so first of all I've let's go to a
website called rag X 101.com and this is
an awesome website that I've just
discovered where you can practice
regular expressions and regular
expressions you can think of them as
basically wild cards on steroids so
they're just patterns for matching a
text and it's really useful if you're a
web developer and if you don't want to
match some content on websites you can
easily do so with regular expressions as
well as mention any other content at all
so so for the test string I've included
this test string in the description of
this video as well and this is just a
bunch of text that I've found where we
can use the sex to practice using
regular expressions on so I'm just going
to refer to this cheat sheet and we're
going to go over some of these
quantifiers character classes groups and
ranges meta characters as well as flags
so we're going to go over all this stuff
and I'm going to explain what most of
these things mean so let's go ahead and
get started here okay so the dot matches
any characters so if we simply put dot
here it's going to match all the
characters on here and if I put star is
going to match all the thing together so
basically what the star is is just zero
or more so in this case if we put any
character full followed by zero
or more this is something that matches
basically all the contents so if you
have a website or any other content
placing a dot and a star will match
anything and you've probably seen
something like this which is a wild card
dot and a star followed by the txt for
example when if I open up a notepad here
and I go to file open you're going to
see down here in the text documents this
is exactly the exact regular expression
that's down here which is a star and a
dot followed by the THC which means it's
going to match all the files with
extension dot txt and there's another
one down here which basically says match
any extension at all and the star is
exactly what that means and match
anything so all right so that's how you
match anything and let's see here
okay so plus just means one or more so
there has to be something to be matched
whereas star it can be can match nothing
or more then the question mark is when
things get a little interesting okay so
let me show you the difference between
the two so if I wanted to match these
strong tags like for example if you have
a if you have content on website and for
some reason you want to match all HTML
tags here is what you might do you might
want to do this right so this is what's
called this is called a greedy
quantifier because what I will do here
is it will start with a little opening
angle bracket here and and then you will
what were you doing is basically your
expecting to match all the content and
then and then basically you're trying to
match this strong tag here but instead
this thing is greedy so it's going to go
ahead and match all the thing until it
sees that the ending angle bracket here
and that's why it's called greedy
because it will match it will consume
all the content in between these the
this angle bracket and this angle
bracket here and if you wanted to make
it lazy your paddock you simply put a
question mark here so now you can see
that it's matching the HTML tags like we
wanted them to and it's also doing that
here so that's the difference between a
greedy and lazy matching or greedy and
lazy quantifier and that's what the
question mark does and usually I always
use dot star followed by the question
mark to make it non greedy but there are
cases where you do want to use the
greedy one as well okay let's go ahead
and continue here all right so X if you
put the X I mean if you put the number
inside the curly brackets that will mean
match it exactly this many times and if
you put a number and followed by the
comma you can say X or more times and
then you can also have between x and y
which is X and then comma Y so you can
say 1 2 comma 5 and then will match any
digit between 1 and 5 so just to give an
example here let's go back here and okay
so if I wanted to match digit which is 3
which is basically a three-digit number
so here I put a digit so the backslash D
matches a digit if we go back here under
character class you will see that for
back slash digit is a digit and I
followed that with the curly brackets 3
which it matches exactly which matches
the number or whatever exactly this many
times
this will match any three-digit
character and this is exactly what it's
doing here it's matching all the
three-digit characters now if you notice
down here or on the right you have a reg
X options and the global one is turned
on so the global one will basically
match all the matches on on our string
so if I I just removed it if I remove it
it's only going to match the first one
but we do want to match all of them so
we're going to turn the global one on
and if you see here on the flags that
will also include the G which is a
modifier or you can call it a flag which
will match all the the matches that are
found and it'll keep going until match
saw them alright so this how we match
digit and if you wanted a number between
for example 1 &amp;amp; 3 you can also do that
it'll match all the numbers between 1 &amp;amp;
3 and that's how we do that or you can
say one or more that's that will match
all the numbers between because they're
all start with 1 and if we did something
like this 5 or more it will match all
the numbers from 5 or more and this
counts as a 1 number here because well
because it's not separated by the space
or anything like that ok let's move on
here are whitespace characters we just
use a use a backslash s and now we'll
match all the whitespace characters here
and it's matching them right now then
all the non wise based characters which
is a capital as this all the characters
except the whitespace and then all the
digit characters which we've already
done there will be a backslash D all the
non digit characters are matched with a
capital D and then there's word and non
word this is the world and the world
will also match the numbers as well but
we will not match special characters and
spaces so they'll keep that in mind and
all the reverse of that is a non-word
character which is all the special
characters and spaces okay so next one
is groups and ranges so we're going to
go over a few of those okay so we
already know what that any character
means which is a dot will match anything
and then if we put characters inside the
round brackets and then separate them by
by V I don't know what this character is
called but it it's just a let's call it
its take right now I'm not sure what
it's called
hold on okay well I just call this
separator Oh an alternator at this
position effectively truncate the entire
pattern okay so I guess okay an
alternator it's called an alternator
okay so if we had something like this
here a or be a alternator B so it just
means or so as you can see it's matching
B and a or a and B a or b and it's
matching all of them here okay that's
cool that's exactly what we want it okay
if we do a B or C they'll match all the
a B and C so you can use that as if you
wanted to match for example hello or
world can do so you'll match hello and
world you can manage the whole words as
well as well as just characters okay
that makes sense next one is a match
single character that is a or B or C so
inside the square brackets it's called
the character class so if you had this
and we wanted to match some of the
numbers here this is how we list them so
this one would list this will match all
these characters that are inside the
character class inside the square
brackets here next we can have a
negative range so if we put a little
caret here inside the square brackets it
will match
everything besides those characters that
are inside the square brackets and it
will come really useful as we start
parsing some website content later on
okay so next one is a range and the
range will do exactly what it says it'll
match all the range between a and Z so
that's why it's matching all the letters
here we can also capitalize that and
they'll match all the capital letters
which have here that's exactly what it's
doing and it's mentioned some other
letters that we capital letters that we
have throughout this test string okay so
next okay so the digits we can put 0
through 9 close the character class and
they'll match all the digits we can test
it out and see if matches 0 2 3 and
that's exactly what it's doing here ok
so next is the meta characters which
must be escaped so if you're going to be
using any of these characters and you're
going to want them if you're going to
want to match any of these there have to
be escaped with with a backslash so for
example if I wanted to match a dollar
sign I would have to escape the dollar
sign with backslash so that's exactly
what it's doing here because otherwise
it's a special character for example the
dollar sign is indicates the end of the
string here and if we wanted to match
the round brackets for example will also
have to escape that as well because
round brackets okay so I haven't gone
over gone over the round brackets yet so
what the round brackets mean is
basically we capture our match so you
can see here if I roll over the mouse
cursor over the hello world I mean hello
word it's saying Group one so that's how
we capture it in group one and it's
showing it here if we wanted to capture
another group we'd create a matter
round bracket and capture that as well
now the world will be in the capturing
group too which is exactly what it's
saying here and and etc so the more you
use round brackets the more capturing
groups you can have and this will make
more sense as we actually start
programming and designing the script in
PHP and the groups that are matched will
actually be stored inside of an array
and they'll make more sense later on so
you guys can play around with this make
sure to download this cheat sheet and
just go ahead and play around with this
text and see if you can do some unique
matches and just start getting used to
using these regular expressions to match
whatever you want and make sure to check
out the next video where we're going to
be doing something practical we're
actually going to be matching let me
show you here if I copy this URL here
we're going to go over some of these
we're going to go to IMDB comm which is
a movie a review site and we're going to
match all these movies along with their
names reviews description all the stars
and directors and we're going to match
all that using regular expressions and
then later on we're also going to save
that all in a database and display it
and in our own website okay I hope you
guys found this video useful if you did
please like share and subscribe and I'll
see you next time clever techie out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
