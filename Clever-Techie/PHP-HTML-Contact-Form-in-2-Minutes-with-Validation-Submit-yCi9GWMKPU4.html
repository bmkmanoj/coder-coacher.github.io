in this video we're gonna create a
contact HTML form just like this one
with complete PHP validation rules and
email submit in just about two minutes
let's go ahead and get started right
away
go to our website called code pen dot IO
and click on the search button here and
then search for contact form and by
doing that you're gonna get a bunch of
contact forms let's click on the fourth
one in the list called html5 contact
form copy HTML into the form that PHP
file and and let's go ahead and copy CSS
into form that CSS file also let's
modify form CSS a little bit by
including air and success messages
classes and all so I'm gonna go ahead
and modify the PHP file itself by adding
some code here so I've included the CSS
file I've also included a form process
that PHP which is gonna have a lot of
validation rules also I've told the form
to call the server PHP self variable
which is a variable that calls the page
itself and I've provided the error
message variables as well as a success
message at the end for the values I've
set all the default values to the post
variables that are going to be returned
with the post of the form and this part
is now complete and for the form value
for the form process validation rules
I've copied it over from w3 schools comm
with a slight modification I've added
the phone number a regular expression as
well as the actual message to send with
PHP mail function when all the messages
when all the error messages are gonna be
empty and I've also gonna have a
modified PHP ini file to include SMTP
host with a port number 25 as well as a
send mail from email which is the email
that you should be sending from at this
point the form is complete let's go
ahead and give it a test run
by running this form and completing all
the fields here and for the message I'm
just gonna copy and paste this message
here click Submit
and message sent thank you for
contacting us is the success message as
expected let's go ahead and open outlook
Express here click on send and receive
