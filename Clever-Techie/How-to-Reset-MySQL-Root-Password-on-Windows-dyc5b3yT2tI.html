techie and in this video I'd like to
show you how to reset your MySQL root
password alrighty well the first thing
we're going to have to do is press the
Windows key type services go to services
and we're going to go ahead and find the
MySQL process usually called MySQL 5 6
or right click on that service and stop
the process alright once the service has
been stopped you can go ahead and close
this window for now then we're going to
create a text file with the SQL command
which will reset our root password
preferably create the text file on the
root directory of your drive so I'm
going to create the file on my G Drive
root directory and let's name the file
reset txt then open the file and just
type this command with me use my SQL
column update MySQL user set password
EKOS password and then your new password
I'm just going to use my pass but you
obviously type your own password where
user equals root flush privileges
semicolon so type it exactly as it is
but use your own password in this string
here then save the file close the window
next we're going to have to navigate to
our MySQL bin directory - all located on
see Program Files
- QL MySQL server 5.6 bin once you're
inside your MySQL bin folder hold down
the shift key and then right click
anywhere in the empty space of the
directory and go ahead and open the
command window here
that way the command prompt is going to
open with a directory already set now
keep the command window open for now and
let's go ahead now we're going to have
to find our my ini file which is usually
located on C on the program data folder
now if your program data folder is not
visible because it's an invisible folder
go ahead and press on the view here
options View tab and then make sure the
show hidden files and folders folders
and drives checkbox is checked and then
press ok and now the program data folder
should be visible go ahead and open the
program data folder navigate to MySQL
folder - ql server 5.6 and then the mind
that i nine-fold file should be inside
that folder now once we're inside this
folder let's go ahead and type that
might not ini at the end of this
directory and then copy the whole thing
to the clipboard copy now you can go
ahead and close this window and go back
to the command prompt and finally here's
the command we're going to have to type
to load the reset file and tell - Cal
where our might at ini file is located
so it all comes together and resets our
password okay so type mysqld default
defaults file equals double quote and
then right click to paste the the whole
thing that we just copied close the
double quote and then initialize file
equals G reset or wherever you store
your reset text file on your computer
now use your arrow keys on the keyboard
to go back and escape the forward
slashes under this MySQL that I&amp;amp;I
director here otherwise it's not going
to work
and then just go back to the end of the
string and press enter.now if everything
worked out you should have the same
thing showing up here starting as
processed - QLD whatever version
starting as processed the next thing
we're going to have to do is go to our
test task manager and kill this process
at this point your MySQL root password
is already reset but we're just going to
have to kill the process that we just
created which is the MySQL d executable
process and then just right click on it
and add tasks now we're going to go back
and press the Windows key go back to
services and we're just going to restart
our original - ql5 6 process clicking
start and at this point your MySQL pass
or root password has been reset now to
test this out just go ahead and login
with your root password and I'm going to
type new pass and that don't work
because what did I use for my password
let's see here real quick oh ok my pass
try it again
my pass ok and I'm in ok this is a video
how to reset your root password hope it
worked for you guys please like this
