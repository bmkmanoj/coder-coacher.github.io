ticky and in this video we're gonna
learn about PHP if statement and ternary
operator okay so this is a basic syntax
of an if statement we have an if keyword
followed by the conditional expression
and if that expression evaluates to true
then the following code will be executed
inside these curly brackets here then we
have an else if and this is a second
conditional expression and if that
expression evaluates to true then the
following code inside those curly
brackets will be executed in this case
if age is equal to 21 it's gonna echo
out or print out your 21 years old in
the first case it's gonna print out your
over 21 of course and finally if none of
these conditions evaluate to true so if
both of these conditions are false then
the else case will be executed and it's
gonna print out your not 21 yet okay so
that's if statement syntax that's pretty
much all you need to know now let's let
me give you a practical example because
I want to show you something else
okay so let's define a variable and
assign an integer to it okay so the
basic the most fundamental syntax for
the if statement is as follows
would I have to create any kind of else
if or else cases we can just create a
simple if statement all by itself just
like that and that's it so if if the
answer is 42 then it's going to print
out the ultimate answer is 42 so if I go
to the output that's what it's doing
it's printing out the ultimate answer is
22 and of course if the answer is
something else it's not gonna print out
anything and in this case the program is
going to continue executing as if
nothing happened so that's a if
statement if you wanted to use it all by
itself now of course if you wanted to
introduce a new condition in case the
condition is false then you would use
else
in this case you can print out another
message and that's the text that will be
printed out if the condition is false
and then the the program is going to
continue executing
okay so else if is another statement
that we can add for evaluating yet
another condition so you can say today's
your lucky day okay so first of all it's
gonna look let's set our variable to 13
and so it's going to go and test if
answer is equal to 42 if that's false is
gonna jump to the next else if statement
and in that case if the condition is
equal 13 that's the code is going to
execute and if i refresh the page
today's your lucky day that's the text
that's been printed out and if none of
these are true then of course gonna do
the same thing and jump back to the else
statement and execute that okay so
that's if else if and else cases all
combined together now we can also have a
nested if statement and in fact you can
have as many if statements within other
if statements basically nested
infinitely but let me just show you what
I mean here so if I said I'm not a
variable if I called another and
variable truth and set it to one I can
do something like okay let's create
another if statement inside of this
first if statement so you can say if
truth then echo you speak the truth
and whenever we use if statement
conditional expression in this manner
the if state is going to assume that
this variable is either evaluated to
true or false so it's going to assume
the variable is a boolean in this case
truth is equal to 1 so the expression is
true so that's the text that's gonna be
printed out okay
else echo that is a lie in case in case
our expression is false it's gonna print
out that is a lie okay so let's see what
happens nothing happens because our
answer is not 42 okay now it's 42 the
ultimate answer is 42 you speak the
truth so let's insert our BR tag here
for make it look better okay so is the
answer 42 yes it is is is truth equal to
1 yes it is and it's printing out you
speak the truth so that's that's the
text that we get and of course we can
also go ahead and paste that in here and
it'll do the same thing in case our
answer is 13 and let's actually set the
truth to 0 now and so today's your like
a day that is a lie and in fact number
13 is a lie it's not really a lucky
number okay so that's an if nested if
statement for you and finally let me
actually show you how to create a
alternative if statement syntax so if
you had a PHP file I'm gonna create a
new file a real quick here I'm actually
gonna create a yeah I'm gonna create a
new PHP file what am I doing here okay
just call it new or PHP in HTML
so if I had some HTML here I'm just
gonna copy and paste this code here so
if I had HTML this this alternative if
syntax is basically what you do is
remove those curly brackets and replace
them with a column and else and I mean
and if for the closing curly bracket and
a column for the opening curly bracket
so you replace those and in place of
these curly brackets he also insert the
Collins so it's just an easier and
cleaner way to write PHP if you wanted
to insert the code inside of HTML okay
so that is it for the if statement now
let me quickly cover the ternary
operator I'm gonna delete all this code
heel here okay okay so the easiest and
the best I think way to memorize and
ternary operator is this is this true
yes or no so if this expression is true
we follow that by the question mark the
yes is gonna be executed otherwise no is
gonna be executed so if I define and
variable are you okay
equals true and then I can say message
equals are you okay
question mark yeah I'm good
else leave me alone okay so you can see
how this is sort of like speaking
English PHP is pretty close to English
language so we have our you okay
variable which is set to true and in
case it's true it's gonna print out yeah
I'm good otherwise the expression on the
right side of the column is gonna be
executed which is leave me alone so yes
if if the if it's true or no just like
in the synth
that I showed here okay so let's test it
out a chrome message yeah I'm good
so is our expression true yes it is yeah
I'm good is printed out so let's set it
to false and now it's printing out let
me alone
so this is just a quick way to have it's
sort of like if an owl statement and
that's a short way and then it's a short
way to write it and it can be really
handy so that's it for this video you
guys that was if statement as well as a
ternary operator I hope you like this
