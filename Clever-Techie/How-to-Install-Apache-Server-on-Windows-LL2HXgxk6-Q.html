tikki in this video we're gonna learn
how to download and install Apache on
windows 7 so first thing we're going to
open up a browser and go to Apache
lounge comm I'm going to go to the
download section scroll scroll down a
little bit
Apache 2.4 binaries VC 14 they have two
of them here one is for windows 64-bit
and the other one is for windows 32-bit
if you don't know which operating system
type you have let me show you how to
find out go to Windows Start menu click
on that computer right click properties
this window will show up about your
system information scroll down here
until you say system type and mine is a
64-bit operating system but you might
have a 32-bit so since I have a 64-bit
I'm going to close this window here and
go back to the browser I'm going to get
the 64-bit version
now before we download this file VC 14
means it was compiled in the latest
visual c++ redistributable for visual
studio 2015 and that's the file that's
the patchy version you want to install
if you want to also install a PHP 7
which is also compiled in VC 14 now if
you want to earlier release of for
example PHP 5 you would get an earlier
version of a DC 11 and you would click
here and download VC 11 instead but I'm
going to be installing the latest
version of PHP 7.0 which is the best so
I'm going to grab this file here now
before I do let's actually grab the
visual
c++ redistributable for visual studio
2015 by clicking on this link here it's
going to send us to this page we're
going to download it
oh and they also have them in 64-bit
version or a 32-bit x86 stands for
32-bit version of Windows 7 now I have a
64-bit I'm going to select that one
click Next and I'm gonna save the file
gonna click on it run and I already have
it installed so I'm not going to install
it but you guys go ahead and install
there distributable on your computer I'm
gonna close this window here and let me
go back to this file and click on it and
save now it actually takes some time to
download it two minutes whatever so I'm
just gonna cancel it because I already
have it downloaded and I'm gonna go
ahead and open up my downloads folder
scroll all the way down and this is the
file that you guys should have
downloaded if you chose the 64-bit VC 14
and here you can see I have other files
that I've experimented with here but
this is the one that I'm going to use
and I'm using win RR to extract and zip
to extract zip files on my computer and
I highly recommend WinRAR it's a very
fast and easy to use application for
extracting zips and also creating new
archives so if you guys don't have it go
to I recommend that you go to rar soft
calm and go to the download section and
just download the latest version of
WinRAR depending on which operating
system type you have it's not a
requirement that because Windows comes
with default zip extractor but I like
when
are much better so again I'm going to
select this file and I'm going to choose
extract files and I highly recommend you
guys extract folder the batch folder to
your C Drive I mean you can extract your
anywhere else but it's just easier to
access so I'm going to click ok and it's
going to go ahead and extract all the
Daiichi files just going to wait a
little bit alright now I'm going to go
to my C Drive and bam
batchi 24 this is the Apache folder with
all the patchy files in it now let me
show you something some configuration
settings here the Apache configuration
file is located in this conf folder so
I'm going to open the folder and I'm
going to locate this httpd.conf file
this is the Apache settings file where
you set all the settings for Apache and
we're going to right click on it open
with and we're going to go ahead and
open it with notepad and this text will
show up with a bunch of Apache sayings
in it now the only things that we need
to check is make sure that server root
is set to C Apache 24 or whatever you
installed extracted your Apache files
and it should be set by default to this
directory and make sure that the listen
port is 80 and lastly we're going to
scroll all the way down until we find
document root and directory okay so
these two directories here are the
default directories for Apaches web
files and the web files are files like
PHP JavaScript HTML basically any kind
of web files that you'll be running from
your computer once patch is working this
is a default folder located at patch 24
HD docks but I like to keep my web files
under
you localhost and if you guys want to do
the same thing just create the localhost
folder on your C Drive but you can also
leave these defaults so I'm going to go
ahead and save that's all the settings
that we need to do here for now and if
you didn't change anything if you left
everything default you can just close
out without saving and I also recommend
that you guys create a shortcut to this
configuration file and place it
somewhere where you'll be able to easily
access it because we're going to be
you're going to be modifying some
settings of Apache in the future
inevitably and you can just paste it on
your desktop but I personally have it
here in my in my expanding menu under
settings and I conveniently have all
these settings files underneath this
menu including the Apache configuration
settings and you guys can learn how to
create this kind of cool menu I in my
other video called organizing files and
folders on Windows 7 but anyway let's go
back to Apache folder on the C Drive and
open up the bin folder and within the
bin folder you'll see a patch in monitor
exe and let's go ahead and right-click
and open the Apache monitor once you
open the Apache monitor you'll have this
icon show up at the bottom right corner
of your screen and we can go ahead and
right click on it and open a passion
monitor now the Apache monitor is just a
very convenient way to see if the
Apaches offline or if it's online right
now this red icon indicates the Apaches
offline and it also tells us which about
your version we're running so we're
going to go ahead and click start and
that's going to start the Apache and now
it's
running now before we do the last final
step I highly recommend that you guys
also create and shortcut for a batch
monitor because once you modify some of
the setting files
hold on here okay here I just create a
shortcut of the Apache monitor bite
create a shortcut and once you modify
some of the settings in it in that batch
settings file we're going to have to
always restart Apache so this will be a
very convenient way to access the Apache
monitor so we're going to cut going to
go ahead and cut this shortcut and we're
going to place it in our startup folder
I'm going to scroll all the way down
here find and locate the startup folder
right click on it open and this will
open up the startup folder and we're
just going to paste the passion monitor
here and this folder now the reason I
did this is that because every time
Windows starts from now on a patch
monitor will open and it's going to show
up at the bottom right corner of our
screen like I showed you guys before
right here and we can easily just right
click on this or we can even left click
on it and this will open up a very quick
menu for stopping starting and
restarting Apache which is very
convenient alright so the last step is
to check if a patch is actually working
so I'm going to go ahead and open up the
browser and go ahead and type localhost
in your browser and you should see this
pop up it works and that means a patch
is working now the Apache is actually
accessing this file which is an
index.html from that document root
folder that you've specified earlier
mine was C localhost
because I modified it as you remember so
it's pointing here to this root
directory and it's pulling up this
index.html file which contains the
following HTML and the text it works so
yours might be in a different directory
depending on where you set your document
root directory to but that's it
Apache is all working and you got your
configuration settings set up and now in
the next video I will show you guys how
to install the latest version of PHP 7.0
which just came out recently and we're
going to make it work with this latest
version of Apache so I'll see you guys
in then in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
