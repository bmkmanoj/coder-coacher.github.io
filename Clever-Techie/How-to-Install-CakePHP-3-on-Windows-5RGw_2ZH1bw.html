and in this video we're gonna learn how
to install CakePHP 3.1 on windows before
we begin let me just give you a quick
overview of what the
model-view-controller framework is which
is what CakePHP is as you can see in
this chart I created it's got a Model
View and a controller and you can think
of the controller is your primary source
code and it's priorities are to interact
and communicate with the models and pass
the model data over to the views the
model is like your database and data
storage where all the data is going to
be pulled by the controller and the view
is going to be the presentation layer
consisting of HTML CSS images JavaScript
etc so it's just a template with all the
graphics and this is what the end user
is going to see and it's a primary job
of the view is to present the model data
and the controller source code in a
nicely formatted way I'm gonna go back
to this chart later on but this should
give you a good overview of what the
Model View controller
framework is now let's get started and
install a cakephp 3.1 okay so I'm just
gonna go ahead and go to this official
take PHP guide and the first thing we're
gonna do is scroll down here and install
the composer so for Windows systems you
can download composer to Windows
installer here just gonna go ahead and
click on this link and scroll down a
little bit and click composer setup 3.0
now what the composer is is just a
dependency management tool for PHP and
what is gonna do is install all the
necessary cakephp files for us so which
is gonna go ahead and run it and just
click Next I'm not gonna install show
menus click Next and you want to
navigate to the directory where your PHP
is installed where your PHP that
executes
while is click Next now I'm just gonna
wait a little bit till the composer is
installed and once since once the
composers is installed we're basically
ready to download and install a CakePHP
and from the CakePHP website here it
just tells you to
if the composer it is installed globally
just type this line followed by the app
name and that's exactly what we're gonna
do here since our composer is installed
globally we're gonna go ahead and fire
up the command prompt and you want to
navigate to the directory where you have
all your web files and it's going to be
your most likely it's gonna be your
Apache HD Doppler mine my folders they
see / localhost and that's where I keep
all my web web files here now what I'm
gonna do is paste that line and if you
want to know what all these commands are
I've broken it down for you and this in
this file here and I'm going to include
the link to this file and the
description of the video if you want to
go over and figure out what all these
commands meet but basically we're just
gonna type our appling and i'm gonna
name it first app and just gonna press
enter and that should download all the
necessary cakephp files into our
localhost directory and create the first
app folder with all the application
files in it so we're just gonna wait
here a little bit and you should be
getting these messages saying that the
cakephp is being installed
take a little while here so what it's
doing is just downloading all the
application files and the main core
CakePHP library just like it says here
wants to compose it finishes downloading
applications skeleton and the core
J PHP library you should have
functioning CakePHP application
installed by composer be sure to keep
the composer in probably okay and here
set the folder permission you want to
say yes so just press ENTER and then
will default to yes so after that is
done you can close now actually keep the
command prompt open and go ahead and
navigate to the directory where where
you have downloaded cakephp mine is a C
localhost and as you can see here the
first app folder showed up so I'm just
going to open it and boom all the K PHP
files are here now let's just go over
the directory structure real fastly yes
have a better understanding of what all
those folders mean if I go to if I could
go to back to the command prompt and
navigate to the folder that we just
created first app and type dear which is
a list was the directory and as you can
see there's a bin folder in here so
let's go ahead and navigate to it and
once you're inside the bin the bin
folder go ahead and type cake so once
you type cake you should have all these
you should have the take HP version
showing up and you can also see the
directories so that app where your app
lives is the SRC directory and you can
see that right here and that's where
your Model View and controller primary
source code is going to be hence the
name SRC standing for source code now
the root directory is your app folder
directory and finally the core is like
the core cakephp library where all the
khd functions
libraries and classes live is this
folder here and you can also see here in
the vendor cakephp CakePHP and also if
you if we go back here to the main
website and here I got a link here
somewhere into the directory structure
it's gonna show you like all the
directory structure and what all of
these mean
but the primary folders that we're gonna
be concerned with are the config SRC web
root and the bin folder so the config is
where we're going to be configuring our
database and routes the SRC is again the
model-view-controller that's going to be
your primary source code and that's
where we're going to be doing most of
the coding web root is where we're gonna
have all our publicly reachable files
like CSS JavaScript and images and the
bin is where the cake baked commands are
and this is the directory that we're
gonna be running our cake console
commands to generate code automatically
so let's go ahead and configure the
database first and for that we can open
up the command prompt and connect to the
- kale console and create an empty
database so with your command prompt
open connect to your - ql console and
just go ahead and create database first
oh well my database already exists but
yeah just go ahead and create the empty
database and then we're gonna go back to
the to the configuration folder here and
our first app config and you want to
open up the app dot PHP file which is
the file that's going to have the
database configuration
now it's got other configuration
settings here as you can see the file is
pretty big so just hit control find in
your IDE and look for my SQL now once it
found in my SQL keyword this is your add
data sources is where your database
configuration file is so we're just
going to replace these database username
and passwords with our real database
configuration so my database name is
first app and my my user is root and my
password is clever taking in one two
three
control asks to save the file and that
way database configuration file is now
complete it should now successfully
connect to the database and we're gonna
test it out in just a second now let's
see what else we got here
okay so we want to enable these
extensions in our PHP dot ini file so
let's go ahead and open up the PHP that
I nine I'm assuming you guys already
have PHP and the patch in last ql
installed if you don't check out my
other videos I have all the videos on
how to do that so I'm going to navigate
to my PHP folder and then open up PHP
dot ini file and I want to go ahead and
search for one of these extensions in D
string and just verify that all these
extensions are uncommented the and E
string extension and PHP int l and open
SSL so just make sure they're all
uncommented why not already uncomment it
so I'm just gonna close this after after
you've done that make sure you save the
file and also restart your Apache okay
so let's see what else we got restart
Apache okay well we're ready to give a
cakephp a test run
now in the development mode so go ahead
and navigate to your first app root
directory and and we're just gonna type
actually you want to stay in a bin
folder I'm sorry and that from the bin
folder you want to type cake server and
what this will do is this is not gonna
run the take PHP on your Apache this is
going to utilize cakes PHP internal web
server and it's going to run it at
localhost Colin 8
I'm just gonna go to this URL here I
want to host age 675 was it and boom
look at that cake PHP is all setup and
ready to go yo TMP directory is right
about logs directors writable ok PHP
version is good all the extensions are
enabled and it's able to connect to the
database so great you're ready to run k
PHP in the development mode now if we're
gonna run it with the Apache here we're
gonna do something different here we're
gonna exit out of this so just press
ctrl C to terminate the badge job and I
exit out of the cakes PHP built-in
server and there's a couple of
configuration files we want to do an
Apache before we run it in the
development mode I mean production I'm
sorry
and so go ahead and open up your
httpd.conf which is a tacky
configuration file I'm gonna navigate to
my file here that G config HTTP like a
comp and you want to make sure you have
these settings here you want to search
for the directory or in search for
follow send links in your Apache
configuration file I
want to make sure that you have these
settings here you know just copy it type
it exactly as as you see here for the
directory settings and also you want to
make sure that if we write module is
being loaded so just make sure this line
is uncommented here and that's it yep
okay so you want to say that and again
restart your Apache and now we're ready
to go ahead and check out our app in the
actual production mode so let's let's
test it out right now localhost navigate
to the directory where your your Apache
files are installed and type on first
app if that's the name of your
application hit enter and everything
should look just like just like it look
in the development mode so everything is
being it's been connected to the
database all the directories are ready
to go and set up and all the PHP stuff
is good to go as well now from this
point you guys are that's it
cakephp is installed and you don't need
to do anything else I'm just going to
show you a couple of optional steps here
which is we're actually going to import
a table full of records into our
database and it's gonna be really easy
easy to do or what you're gonna do is
just download this u.s. cities that CSV
file which is in the description of the
video and we're gonna basically connect
to our database and we're getting copy
and paste this code and make sure that
we provide a directory for our file that
we downloaded and this will just import
all the records from this database CSV
file automatically so let me just guide
you over that
a little fast here okay I'm gonna go and
open up my folder where I have this file
just to show you guys it's here and
basically what it is is just a CSV file
with a bunch of with a bunch of city
records and and you know it's got the ID
the city name the state name and the
population of the of each and every city
along with a growth of the population
okay so we have an empty database and we
have the CSV file here's a very easy way
to import it just note the directory
where you have downloaded the file and
replace a directory you know right here
and you're in the string and make sure
you use the forward slash instead of the
back slash otherwise it won't work once
you have done that if you made sure that
you know you're pointing to the
directory where your file has been
downloaded you just want to copy this
whole code copy and then we're gonna
connect to our MySQL database again and
just go ahead and paste just right mouse
click here Oh before you do that you
wanna use the database so just go ahead
and use your database name see the
database has changed and now face the
code and as you can see all the records
have been import from that file now to
test it out real fast and make sure that
records have been imported we're just
gonna go select from US cities which is
the table name and we're gonna win in
210 we don't want to select or 1000
records and as you can see all the
records are are indeed there so our
database has been created and we have
also created the table name US cities
and the top 1000 US United States cities
have been imported into the database so
we're now ready to work with this
database table and all this data ok so
just keep your
just exit out of the console but keep
the command from open for now and right
now what we're gonna do is utilize the
canned
cakes bake tool to generate the
controller and also the view also known
as a template and this is really easy to
do just go ahead and again navigate to
your bin folder and just type cake bake
controller and this is gonna give us the
name of the controller we can bake so as
you can see here possible controllers
based on your current databases US
cities so that's what we're gonna do
cake bake controller US cities press
enter and automatically the controller
has been generated for us we're also
gonna do the same exact thing for the
template for the view I'm gonna type
cake plate template your city center and
the view has been generated as well now
to view the actual thing we're gonna go
here first app US underscore cities
which is the name of our motor
controller
gonna hit enter and look at that cake
has automatically generated the
controller and made all these
functionality for us it's also pulling
then the data from then from our table
and presenting it in the view which is
which is a template that we just
generated and you can go ahead and view
each individual record and view all the
records you can also delete a record you
can edit it and all these templates have
been generated automatic automatically
for us so you can just see you can add a
new city and that will all work so you
can just see how powerful cakephp can be
with just those baking commands and this
is just a glimpse into the into its
power
and I'm gonna go ahead and that create
another video and explain how the NBC
works and how going into the depth of
how PHP CakePHP works as well
this was just an installation video and
I hope I hope it's been helpful that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
