tikki and in this video we're going to
learn how to install MySQL on windows 7
and make it work with PHP so if you
haven't watched a video on how to
install PHP and MySQL in Windows 7
please do that first so let's get
started here open up the browser I'm
gonna go to dev dot MySQL dot-com
/downloads slash my SQL and we're going
to download MySQL community server I'm
going to scroll down here now here's the
latest mysql installer and it says it's
a 32-bit and 64-bit installer but when
we click here on download and scroll
down we get it's only showing 32-bit
right so they have a note about that
they actually say no MySQL installer is
32-bit but blue it will install both
32-bit and 64-bit binary so the actual
version of your MySQL will be either
32-bit or 64-bit depending on your
operating system but the install itself
really doesn't matter so it's a 32-bit
version and we want to get the mysql
installer web community five point six
point twenty six MSI and the difference
here in file size is so dramatic because
they installer the web just stands for
basically what it means is the Installer
is going to download MySQL server from
the Installer from within the Installer
and if you download this it will just
download MySQL server right away I found
that it's faster to download install
MySQL from within the Installer
so I'm going to hit download to download
my scale install install our web
community and then you're going to have
to create the account by clicking on
sign up and just filling out this form
here make sure you enter your email and
your true email because you're going to
get a confirmation link so we're going
to trust that you guys know how to do
this I already have an account so I'm
just going to log in signing in download
and this download is very fast this will
take time at all gonna go ahead and run
it and I'm just going to guide you guys
through this installation process it's
gonna wait a little bit till this loads
until Windows configures MySQL installer
community and it's definitely taking
longer than I thought
all right there he goes
okay gotta get this window and I have a
workbench installed but what you want to
do is go to add except terms freedom
course next let's expand the MySQL
servers expand
let's go server click on that span and
this is a 64-bit and so I study two-bit
so just get the one you need and press
this arrow now it's added for the
products installed click Next and I'm
just going to install it to the default
path click Next again oh it already
exists okay whatever I'm just going to
say yes play download exit
cute and that was very fast so now it's
just installing it and just going to
wait two nights complete next ready to
configure next and I just leave all
these settings default next and this is
the password that you're going to be
using to connect to MySQL so you
definitely want to memorize it or write
it down somewhere
looks like a bowl okay and just click
Next and yes you wanna figure it as why
SQL Server as Windows service and start
mascot service system startup click Next
and it's quick execute and if everything
works out
everything should be successful if this
were some reason doesn't work if the if
the server doesn't start
I recommend 8 when you restart windows
and do this whole thing over again
because that happened to me and
rebooting Windows work so you're going
to finish everything is successful
configuration complete next and finish
and now we should have I'm going to
close this this we're just going to
verify that - ql service is running and
i'm gonna go to my start and you can
type services go to services and find
mysql 56 and it is started so MySQL is
now running on your machine now what I
recommend you guys do is add MySQL to
your environment variables path that way
you're going to be able to access MySQL
server from a command prompt which will
be very convenient and handy so here's
how to do it go to start and actually it
also comes with a command the newest
version comes with a command line this I
think it's a new feature so if you click
on that and you tie up the password that
you created earlier
boom it's connected to MySQL from the
command prompt and it's going to say
diversion and everything so that means
you have successfully connected to MySQL
and everything is working so you can
either use this command line that it
counts with but if you want to set it up
so you can run it from the command line
when you show you how to do a real fast
type environment and go to in edit
environment variables for your account
and then find scroll down until we find
path we're going to edit that and we're
going to add the path of MySQL
executable and for that go to the
directory where MySQL has been installed
should be on mine is on C Drive Program
Files and MySQL MySQL server 5.6 go to
the bin folder and you want to copy this
this path so go ahead and copy because
that's where the MySQL executable file
is close that and make sure you go to
the end or to the front of this let's go
to the n actually n-type semi colon
which is a directory separator and paste
the path to the MySQL that executable
and click OK click OK again and then we
can test out this everything is working
from the command prompt type MySQL - you
root - P press ENTER type the password
and it should be connecting to the MySQL
and now we are we can connect to MySQL
from the command prompt so that's how
you add it to the command prompt
let's move on here last thing that we
need to do is make my square my SQL work
from the php.ini so go ahead and open up
your PHP I and I wherever you install
PHP go to your PHP directory - on C PhD
and I'm going to edit PHP @ i9 ini and
I'm going to search for my SQL I and
it's going to find these extensions here
you're going to want to uncomment this
extension here so just remove the
semicolon if you have a semicolon front
of it remove it also remove this semi
call in front of PHP MySQL I and I also
recommend uncommenting this one the
MySQL PDO because some of the frameworks
and scripts use MySQL PDO and this is
just another way of connecting to MySQL
so just uncomment those three lines
those two and this one make sure you
save your PHP ini file and you can close
it and then you definitely want to
restart Apache on you can do through the
monitor but I'm just going to access my
services and click on Apache and restart
that is going to restart Apache close
the window close this and and now we're
just going to create a test script to
make sure well first of all let's just
see if the batch extension is loading
we're going to open up the browser here
go to localhost browser localhost and
I'm going to access my PHP that info
file which has which has a PHP info
function in it
and then I'm going to search for MySQL
and if you guys have this shown up with
a bunch of MySQL information that means
- 2 L is loading successfully so you
should have MySQL MySQL I MySQL Envy and
PEO MySQL those all should be loaded
because we just saw a comment on Lola's
MySQL lines so the extensions that are
being loaded in PHP now lastly let's
just create a script to make sure that
we can connect to MySQL from PHP I'm
going to go to my local host and if you
guys miss my other video is just let me
show you this is the code that's inside
that your PHP file ok and create a new
file in MySQL in the localhost or your
web files go and create file called
MySQL dot PHP and then just put the
following code inside that file and I'm
gonna put on I'm gonna put that code
below this video so you guys if you
don't want to type this you can just
copy and paste this whole code and just
type your look localhost exactly like
that root for the username and then type
the password that you have set up
earlier I'm just going to do this off
screen and type my password I'm going to
save the file and exit and then lastly
let's go ahead and see if this script is
working for gonna go to localhost again
and type MySQL dot PHP hit enter and you
guys should have this message connected
successfully and that means you guys are
running Apache MySQL and PHP and
everything is working perfectly together
so there you have it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
