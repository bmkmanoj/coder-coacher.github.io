tikki and in this video we're gonna
learn how to create a carousel in
bootstrap for a carousel is a slideshow
for cycling through a series of pictures
build with CSS and a little bit of
JavaScript as usual don't forget to
include jQuery and both bootstrap CSS
and bootstrap JavaScript now the first
thing we're gonna do is to create the
main div for our carousel and I'm gonna
give this carousel an ID of magic
carousel which we're going to reference
later when we create the indicators and
previous/next controls next we're going
to add to bootstrap classes the first
one is going to be carousel which simply
says that this div contains a carousel
and the second one is slide which will
add a CSS transition animation effect
and make the next item slide into view
the second attribute that we're going to
use is data write with a value of
carousel and this is telling bootstrap
to begin animating the carousel
immediately when the page loads okay so
this is our main div carousel now we're
going to define another div which will
hold all of our carousel items and list
them horizontally I'm going to create
this div here and apply a class name to
it called carousel inner and we're also
gonna use a role attribute and apply
listbox
value okay and now we're ready to create
our carousel item divs which will hold
the images and captions so this div is
just simply gonna have class called
carousel item and now inside of the
disturb we're ready to put the put in
the actual image which is going to have
two classes so image class equals D
block
which is used to align the image
properly and the second one I'm gonna
use is w - 100 which sets the width of
the image to 100 next we're going to
define a source for the image
destination in my case it's IMG
cindergorilla
dot PNG I'm also going to add an alt
attribute to the slide and call it first
slide now we're also going to create a
caption for this carousel by adding
another div just underneath the image
with a class named carousel caption
which is self-explanatory just tells
bootstrap that is going to have a
caption inside of this div and inside of
this div I'm gonna put an h3 tag for the
heading of the caption which is going to
be Cinderella and a paragraph with a
short description I'm just gonna say
first slide alright at this point I'm
just gonna copy and paste this code five
times for the carousel item because I'm
gonna have five slides just gonna align
these divs properly so keep it neat and
organized and now I'm just gonna replace
all the values who had different ones so
this one's gonna be second slide so it's
gonna be third slide fourth and fifth
I'm gonna replace the image names
Rapunzel
this one's gonna be Snow White
next one is Red Riding Hood and the
final one is unicorn I'm also going to
replace these names here and replace the
slide name the second slide ones third
slide Red Riding Hood there's the fourth
slide and finally Unicorn is our last
five fifth slide one last thing to add
here is active to one of the carousel
items so I'm just gonna add it to the
first one and now let's go ahead and see
what the carousel looks like and this is
our carousel so far let's see if it
starts sliding the next and it does so
the carousel is working so it's
automatically sliding next picture item
into view the next thing we're gonna add
is the previous and next controls which
are links so we're going to create a
tags and I'm gonna go ahead and add
these right after the last carousel item
so let's go ahead and create the first a
tag this one is going to have a carousel
control previews and for the href we're
gonna reference our magic carousel main
don't forget the pound in front of it
it's gonna have another attribute called
role equals button
and data slide previous okay now we're
going to add to span classes inside of
this link which will hold the text and
the icon the first one is gonna have
class name carousel control trees icon
just gonna be empty and the second span
class
is gonna have a class named SR only
which indicates that this text is gonna
be showing up here is for screen readers
only so the only thing that's gonna be
showing up is the icon and for the next
all I have to do is copy this whole code
and pretty much replace their work
previews with next so place next next
next and next okay let's go ahead and
test to see if everything works here our
previously next controls and everything
is working great now the last thing
we're gonna add are the carousel
indicators and if I go back to the
completed carousel and view it here you
can see these indicators at the bottom
of the carousel which tell us which
current carousel item we're currently
viewing in order and you can also click
on these to take it to the next and
previous carousel items so we're gonna
put the carousel indicators inside of
the main div and just outside of the
inner carousel list box it's gonna have
an ordered list with a class called
carousel indicators inside of our order
lists we're going to place list items
with an attribute data target which will
target our
the carousel which is pound magic
carousel another attribute we gonna use
is called data slide 2 which specify
which slide to go to when clicking on a
specific indicator and it starts its
count at 0 for the first carousel item
almost gonna set this class to active to
start our carousel at this indicator now
I'm just gonna copy and paste this 4
times going to delete the class active
from the rest of them and change the
values incrementally by 1 now let's go
ahead and view the carousel all right
you can see the indicators showing up at
the bottom here and you can click on any
of them to take us to that specific
carousel item the previous/next controls
are working and our carousel is complete
and that's how you make a carousel in
bootstrap for I hope you guys like this
