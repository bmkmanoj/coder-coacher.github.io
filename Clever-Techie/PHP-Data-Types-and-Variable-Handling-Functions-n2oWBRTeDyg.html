video we're gonna cover PHP datatypes
and variable handling functions so in
PHP variable data types can be broken
down in three different categories
scalar composition special okay so the
scalar is a single unit of data and this
includes variables like string which is
text integer which is a whole number
float which is a fractional number and
boolean which is a 0 or a 1 and it could
also be represented as true for 1 or
false for 0 next we got composite which
is an array or an object and the array
basically holds multiple values like you
see here separated by the comma and the
object refers to the instance of the
class so if we have a class named movie
for example we can then say object
equals new keyword and then the class
name and that will create the object
instance of that class so that's how we
create an object datatype finally we
have a special and under special we have
a null which is basically means nothing
or no value at all and another one is a
resource which can hold special values
like database connections open files etc
so these are the most common data types
you're gonna encounter in PHP now let's
actually create some of these variables
and now we can play around with them so
the first one I'm gonna define is a
string variable and so this is just
gonna be information about a matrix
movie I think it's a good way to
demonstrate all kinds of different data
types in PHP so this one is gonna be
float I'm gonna define awesome it was
true and it's a boolean and then I'm
gonna create an array and this one is
gonna be an associative array and it's
gonna have actor names and the roles
they played in the movie and so I'm just
gonna put a couple of them in here
morpheus carry in okay that's enough so
that's gonna be our associative array
and data type is gonna be array then I'm
gonna create a class movie and create an
object matrix using the new keyword
followed by the class name which is a
movie and that's gonna create the object
instance of the class and define a null
one and finally let's define a resource
and this one is gonna refer to the Open
File just kind of specify the directory
where this text file is located it can
be any text file and so this one is
gonna become a resource okay now let's
go ahead and cover some of the variable
handling functions and the reason I want
to show you this is because there's a
lot of variable functions or variable
handling functions in PHP which give you
all kinds of information about datatypes
and other information about the
variables and as you can see the first
one is a get type and it does exactly
what it says it gets the type data type
at the variable then then we have a is
set which checks if the variable has
been initialized on set destroys a
variable and then you can just download
this this little cheat sheet or table
here and just check out all these other
variables and play around with the
variables that we have just defined but
I'm gonna create a loop now and I'm
gonna use get type variable to get the
information about all the variables that
we have just created to get the data
type but before I do that I'm actually
going to define a new variable and it's
gonna hold all these
in it using an array so I'm gonna define
a variable named data and then I'm gonna
say array and I'm just gonna put all
these variable names inside of this
array then we're going to use a for loop
to loop through all these variables
inside of the data array and I'm gonna
use a get type function to get the data
type of these variables okay so let's
create a for loop and I'm gonna use a
function named count to count how many
elements are inside the array so we know
when when to stop looping and then I'm
gonna echo out and use the get data
function
I think yep Oh get type get type and
then I'm just gonna say data I to get to
the variable and now let's go ahead and
see what happens I'm gonna open up the
browser here oh fast
navigate to PHP data types okay so it's
printing out all data types let me just
use a br HTML tag so we can read it a
little easier okay so it's printing out
all the data types of those variables as
you can see the first one is a string
which is this variable here the matrix
second one is an integer which is the
release here and it's got all the
information about all the other
variables that we've defined and you can
see that it's getting the right type
type of data type of those variables
okay so that's pretty much it for the
data types and you can go ahead and play
around with all these other functions
and I'm just going to demonstrate a
couple of the
right now just gonna say if for example
is array so that's gonna check if the
data type of the variable is an array
and if it is is just gonna print out the
array data using a print our function
and then another one let's say else if
is numeric or I'm just gonna say if if
is numeric so that's going to check if
the data type is a number I'm gonna say
something like numeric value detected
and then print out the actual variable
information or the value of the variable
and can also include the BR tag at the
end it's easier to read okay so let's
see what happens now let's go ahead and
go back to the output and now as it's
looping it's detecting the integer and
then insane numeric value detected
because it's a number and sprinting the
value of the variable and then the float
one is also numeric so it's also
detecting that and then it's also
detected the associative array and then
it printed the whole thing out here so
you can see how you can play around with
all these function names and get a bunch
of information from the variables VAR
underscore dump is a really useful one
because it provides additional
information about the variable and the
empty one is a very useful one because
it checks if that variable exists or if
it is null you can use unset to
basically destroy the variable or unset
a key from the array and you can check
for all kinds of different data types
and it's really useful to do that while
programming so go ahead and play around
with these download this cheat sheet and

you guys and if it was please like share
