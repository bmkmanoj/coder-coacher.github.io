tikki and in this video we're going to
learn how to create an HTML form with
PHP validation and email submit let's go
ahead and get started right away I'm
going to open up the browser and go to a
site called code pen dot IO if you
haven't heard about this awesome website
it's like a paradise for web developers
you're going to absolutely love it okay
so once you're on the home page go ahead
and click on the search button at the
top right corner of the screen and type
form or contact form which is where
we're going to be creating this video
and you're going to get a result of
seven thousand six hundred forty two
pens found for contact form so you're
going to get a result of all kinds of
different forms available for you to use
I'm going to let's go ahead and pick the
form number four which is a blue form
here called html5 contact form just
click on it and this is what the pen it
looks like basically gives you raw HTML
CSS and JavaScript in this case there's
no JavaScript but this is exactly what
we need because we're going to be
creating PHP validation rules so and at
the bottom here you can preview how the
actual form looks like looks pretty good
to me
so what we're going to do here is just
copy HTML and I'm going to go back to my
NetBeans project and I've created a
folder here called form I'm going to
right click on it and choose PHP file
and name the file PHP form or just a
form that PHP and I'm going to go ahead
and paste all that HTML inside of this
file so that's going to be form that PHP
where the actual HTML form is going to
live also I'm going to create another
file in the same folder called and this
time is going to be cascading style
sheet file that CSS I'm just going to
name it form also and is going to be
named form that CS
says I'm going to do it all this these
comments here go back to the browser and
copy the CSS from the pen
paste the code inside the CSS file and
save it at this point we got all the
code we need from code pen so I'm just
going to go ahead and close that and
right now let's go ahead and preview
what the form looks like in the browser
so this means this is what it looks like
right now because the CSS has not been
loaded right now so from our form that
PHP let's include a CSS file using a
link tag link rel equals stylesheet H
ref equals form that CSS because form
that CSS is located in the same folder
as our form that PHP file in this case
and then for the type I'm going to say
text porter slash that CSS and close the
tag now the form that CSS should be
included and go back to the browser and
voila we have a form we have a contact
form which is ready to be used okay so
if I try it submitting this form right
now as you can see uh at at the right
hand side of the screen there is a
message being popped up please please
fill out this field and html5 which is
what we use in here comes with it's all
with its own validation rules basically
and it's validating those input fields
using the required keyword as you can
see all these fields include the
required keyword and it's also going to
validate those input fields using based
on what kind of type that field is in
this case it's an email so it's going to
validate and it's gonna if I enter a
wrong email address hold on
let me fill out this stuff here so if I
enter a wrong email address is going to
give me a message box about the email
address being invalid but I don't like
these because first of all the phone
number like the type tel is not included
it's it doesn't work on all the
browser's it just works in Safari and I
don't know we're just going to create
our own PHP validation rules anyway so
let's go ahead and get rid of these
required fields those those message
boxes also seem to pop up so in some
random places on the screen and I'm not
sure how to change that
I just haven't played around with it
much and for the type of the fields
let's just enter text because we don't
want any html5 validation rules and add
this type equals text for the text area
as well and then let's go ahead and go
ahead and create another file called
form underscore process that PHP in the
same folder this is going to be the file
which will process the form and it's
going to have all the validation code
and emails submit code as well now if I
hope in this file here you can see
there's already a bunch of code in it
and I've included the link to the in the
description of this video where you can
download this file with all this code in
it now let me just test something out
before before we submit I'm going to use
a die function so that this code is not
executed yet and before we do that we
need to make sure that this file is
being called from our from our HTML form
page so for the action we're going to
say I'm going to include a PHP tag here
and close it and I'm going to say server
PHP self okay so what this function does
or what this global variable does is
it's going to call the page itself so
all the PHP code that's on this page is
going to be executed when the page is
called well right now you see that
there's no PHP code on this page and we
want to call this form process that PHP
file so we're going to do here at the
top is we're going to include that file
using include function just like that
easy as pie so now when this page is
called it's going to call itself and
it's going to include form underscored
process that PHP and this is all the
code that's going to be included right
now there's nothing in it and because I
used died construct so it's not going to
execute anything for now I just want to
you guys to see what's inside the this
variable called this global variable
called post and then yeah just the post
so okay so if I go back to the browser
and refresh the page you can see that
and everything is working as expected
basically the form has been submitted
and it's calling itself and the file
form process is being included but right
now there's nothing being submitted
because because all of these fields the
the post doesn't know about them so in
order for us to let the post know about
those fields we need to name our fields
using keyword name so just like that
we're going to name all of our fields
let's use double quotes so name is going
to have a name of name and then the
email going to name it email and just
add name the phone number phone and
let's name the website stain a website
URL and finally message is going to be
the name for our message field okay I'm
going to ctrl save that go back to the
browser and let's go ahead and refresh
the page and reload the whole thing now
I'm hold on one second what's going on
here name equals name okay okay let me
delete this died function maybe that's
what's happening okay yeah because
because nothing has been submitted yet
so I'm just going to enter my name here
my email phone number and my website
click Submit and now you can see that
all these and this array has been
printed out with the with our variables
and values at the top here so everything
is working as expected
we have our post and we're just printing
out printing the post out right now to
see what to have what values and
variables it has okay so let's go ahead
and let me explain what's going on here
and in this code so first of all we want
the error messages to be displayed on
the form right after the input fields so
in order for us to do that we're going
to add span tags here right after the
right after the input fields and I'm
going to say span classical's error
which is going to be especially
formatted span for the error messages
and then the PHP tags and right now okay
so let's go ahead and add all of these
after the input fields and the variable
name for the email is going to be email
error variable name for the phone number
is going to be phone error and the
website is going to be URL error okay so
here's what's happening right now we're
setting all these variables to an empty
string because when the form is being
displayed we don't want these error
messages to appear right away so that
they they are these variables are being
printed out right now but they're empty
because the form hasn't been submitted
yet once the form has been submitted
which is what we check for here in this
and the special global variable called
underscore server using the request
method string parameter once the form
has been submitted which is which is
what this is saying
using the method post then do all the
validation and before that all of our
errors are empty because nothing has
been submitted yet and they're being
printed out as empty strings on our form
which is exactly what we want so we're
not getting any error messages here okay
so next we also create these empty
variables which is going to have which
is all the variables that are going to
contain the actual content that has been
submitted and okay so next let's let me
go through all these validation rules
real fast so when the form is submitted
which is what we're checking for here
using the method post we want to check
if the name is empty if the name is
empty we're just going to say name is
required and that's going to be the
value of the variable name error and
it's going to be displayed here right
after
right after the name error right after
the inputbox
name and it also checks the email if
it's empty and it checks the phone if
it's empty and that's it so those are
the three fields that are that can be
left blank so if I try to submit the
form now you can see that the name is
required emails required and phone is
required and all the variables are being
set correctly to name is required email
is required and phone is required values
and if I check form that PHP this is
exactly what's happening here it's been
outputted so when the form is submitted
we check if it has been submitted using
post method and then we check if it's
empty if it is set the value to name is
required email is required and phone is
required so hopefully that makes sense
let's move on here okay first of all I
copied all most of this code from
w3schools comm and it had this test
input function as well so this is what
the test input function looks like
basically it strips out some unnecessary
spaces and slashes and it also converts
it also escapes all this special HTML
characters which is a good practice I
guess and it does that to all the fields
so you can see how the test input
function is being called and on every
field here and here and here and then
the last thing if everything looks good
if the name has been entered then the
regular expression is checking if
there's only letters and white spaces in
the name and if there's like a number in
the name it's going to say only letters
and white spaces allowed so that's how
that works and everything else is
basically the same thing here we use the
filter VAR function and filter validate
email which is just another way for
validating an email address using built
in PHP function called filter bar for
the phone number w3schools didn't have
this one so I had to find it at stack
over
whoa calm and this is an awesome regular
expression for matching a phone number
and it does exactly that it just matches
the phone number in different formats
and then finally the URL also has this
pretty complex regular expression that
you don't have to really understand and
it displays invalid URL if it has been
entered in an invalid way invalid URL so
that's how all that works and finally
there is a message which is we don't
want to check if the message has been
that if the message is invalid because
we want to see any kind of message okay
so for the in the form that CSS let's
actually create a class called error and
I'm going to set the color to just the
color to red and then all the error
message is going to be red now because
we're setting the class to error here in
the span class so it's just easier to
see the error messages okay so at this
point the form process is being executed
and all the validation rules are working
great now I've also wanted to include
okay so let me show you something if if
the fields have been entered correctly
but one of them for example email is
invalid and I click Submit what happens
is all the fields are emptied out we
don't really want that all right
I just prefer all my information to stay
intact when one of the fields is invalid
so we're going to create a new we're
going to get add value to our input
fields and inside the value which is
going to say we're just going to output
the name the variables that are being
entered here which are being set to the
empty string but those are the variables
that are going to have information of
the post once they're submitted so
so I'm going to do this add this value
to all these input fields here after a
name and message as well okay so this is
going to be named email it's going to be
named phone and URL and message
okay so let's test it out now so as you
can see all the variables that are still
there even after we resubmit our form if
we enter all the valid information
except the URL for example it says
invalid URL but all of our other fields
are being printed out because we're
setting the values to those variables
that have been submitted using post here
and here and here etc okay that's how
that works at this point all the
validation rules are working great and
we're pretty much ready to submit our
form so let's go ahead and add the code
to submit the form now okay so we still
want to be inside the post statement
because we only want to submit the form
once once the post once the form has
been posted so first of all we're just
going to check if all the errors are
empty to make sure there's no error
messages so I'm just going to go through
all of them and say if name error equals
empty and email error equals empty and
phone error equals empty actually it's a
double equal sign I'm sorry okay
and URL error equals equals empty then
we want to send our message so if all
the error messages are empty we want to
go ahead and proceed with the sending
the actual email okay so let's go ahead
and construct a message body you're
going to create a variable named message
body and set it to empty and then I want
to unset the post submit because there's
nothing there's not going to be anything
in it and then let's go ahead and create
a for each loop to loop through the post
just like that and then I'm going to use
the message button this is a concatenate
operator concatenate a string operator
and I'm going to just enter all the key
and value inside of this inside of the
single variable called message body so
it's going to go through the array and
find all this keys and values and it's
going to put everything in one single
variable called message body as a string
okay next is the actual sending out the
message and all the content is ready
here first of all if you're doing this
on a local host you want to make sure go
ahead and open up your PHP that an eye
file so I'm going to open that up here
and you want to search for SMTP for the
SMTP in your PHP ini file you want to
make sure that this value is correct if
you're doing it with localhost you want
to contact your local host I mean your
ISP and make sure find out what your
SMTP outgoing mail server value should
be they should tell you that also the
port is usually 25 and the send mail
from should be your email address so
once you set all that in PHP that I nine
by the way if you're not doing it on a
local host you know all this information
is going to be available with your at
your web hosting company okay but once
you do that if you're doing it on a
local host you want to go to services on
their windows and you want to go ahead
and restart the apache let's go ahead
and restart apache just going to take a
little bit okay once that's done we are
ready to use PHP mail function to send
the actual email so we're going to
create a variable name to and enter the
email address of the person where we
want to send the email to subject equals
I'm just going to name it form submit
contact form submit and next is a mail
function which takes in three parameters
to subject and message body and we
already have all these variables
available and actually if if this
function is successful if the mail has
been sent we also want to display a
success message we're going to create a
variable named success and say message
sent thank you for contacting us and now
we also want to reset all of our field
values back to empty because it's good
practice to reset the form field values
once the form has been submitted okay so
that's that's looking good now let's see
let's see if it works now oh actually
for the last thing here I want to create
a variable success here and also for the
form that CSS let's go ahead and add the
success class - just to modify the
success message a little bit and for the
color I want to set it to this color
here text-align:center font-weight:bold
and font size 14px okay so that's going
to be our success message I'm going to
completely reload the form mail and get
an error message of course what's going
on here come on
Oh success equals I think I miss the
echo operator okay so now there's a
blank form and I think we have
everything ready to go to send a test
message so go ahead and enter all the
field information I'm going to enter a
fake phone number
don't try calling this one website URL
and message hello hello
clever techie I would like to subscribe
to your YouTube channel
okay let's submit this form and for some
reason our success message is not being
printed out okay because we forgot to
add the success message here in our PHP
form or HTML form so we're going to say
span class equals success
and close the span actually let's put it
in a div tag instead and here we want to
echo out the success variable okay let's
let me reload the form and do this again
hello
clever keiki how would you like to
subscribe your YouTube channel okay
submit the form and now we're getting
the message message sent thank you for
contacting us and all the fields have
been reset to empty string which is
exactly what we want it and I'm going to
open my outlook here press receive
message and Borla message is sent
hello clever techie I would like to
subscribe to your YouTube channel so the
message is being sent successfully and
the success message is being displayed
so everything is working the validation
fields are working and all the other
error messages work and all the values
of the fields work as well and
everything when all the errors are empty
it's sending out the message to the
email which we specified I hope you guys
found this video useful if you did
please like share and subscribe and I'll
see you next time clever take it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
