tikki and in this video we're going to
learn about REST API which stands for
representational state transfer
application programming interface
okay so let's first look at the
representational state transfer now some
of the simple questions that might come
up when you're first starting to
understand REST API is what is being
represented exactly what is a state and
what's being transferred okay so let's
look at all these words individually and
I hope I can explain what they all mean
okay so the word representational means
there is a transfer of representations
of resources and the resources can be
pretty much anything that can be named
on internet like user a list of users a
photo or a list of photos comments posts
articles page video books
profile etc to understand how exactly we
get a representation of resources let's
look at how everyone interacts with
webpages why client-server model and the
HTTP protocol and we're going to get
back to this chart @dm this video and
I'm going to explain what all this is at
the end okay so here's the HTTP protocol
okay you guys should be familiar with an
HTTP protocol every time you type a URL
in a browser you're sending a request to
the web server and the web server
responds with a resource so what's
important to understand here is every
time you type a URL in a browser or
click on a webpage link you're sending a
request for a specific resource or
resources from a web server and what's
their response and delivers the request
your resource to your browser as in a
formal web page or whatever format that
the resource is in now this
second important point to understand is
that webserver doesn't actually deliver
the resources it doesn't actually send
you the database that it has but rather
a representation of that resource in a
format that is readable for example HTML
or image so think of actual resources
physical things located on a web server
database or stored in web in a web
server hard drive and representations of
those resources as copies in either
readable format for human being like
HTML or image or easy to work with
formats for programmers like JSON XML
and other formats it's also helpful to
think of the whole web as a bunch of
resources remember that we always
request the resource when clicking on a
link or type in a URL no wonder that the
URL stands for Uniform Resource locator
so let's take a closer look at the URL
now ok so if we go to this URL or
actually here you can see that the
protocol is HTTP which is just the
secure HTTP protocol followed by the
hostname which is clever techie comm and
then we have a path to the resource
along with its name so let's go ahead
and type in this URL into the browser
clever technique com4 /img flowers Lily
JPEG and here we are presented with a
representation of the resource in an
image format and if I check the headers
here on the response headers I can see
that the content type is in fact an
image so that's a representation of the
Louis J DG resource in an image format
now I've also created a HTML page and if
I go to Lily dot HTML this resource is
now presented in an HTML format and if I
check the headers in fact on the content
type response headers you can see that
the content type is in fact tags flash
HTML and we have some other information
about the resource like title
gorgeous lily flow'r so that's the
representation of the resources and the
server responds with a representation
resource in whatever format that
resource is in and that's what the URL
is for it's a Uniform Resource locator
and every time you click on a link or
Rio or enter the URL in the browser you
get resources now now that we understand
what the word representational means
let's look at the word state so to
continue from the Claire we take an
example think of clever techy as one big
application so when you end on a clever
take a website this is one state of the
application you get a bunch of links to
other pages and and you have a logo and
categories presented so that's one state
of application whenever I click on a
link for example here the application
state changes and now we're presented
with another resource which is a page
with all the other content of that
resource and as we click through all
these different pages the application
chain state keep changing the
application state changes to one state
to the next and that is what the state
means in the representational State
transfer now the transfer when the
resource gets transferred from the web
server if we look at the URL again when
the resource gets transferred so we send
a request for the resource and we get a
representation back and whatever formats
resources presented this is what is
meant by the word transferred however it
can also refer to the transfer the
application state when we click on the
next link and get transferred to another
page so at this point we're ready to
understand the whole rest architecture
and this is what the whole thing looks
like ok notice that I've added the verb
plus URL and under verb we'll have get
post put and delete now we of course we
don't have to type those verbs in a web
browser when we're requesting a resource
those are just actions that describe
what what
kind or what type of HTTP requests we're
sending to the web server okay so the
most common one is get so whenever I go
to and type clever techie calm if I
check the headers on top here you can
see that the that the verb is in fact
get and every time I click on a page
that's a get request now and that's the
most common one whenever you click on a
link it's usually you're sending a get
request now the post on the other hand
is used when when you submit some kind
of information when you send a tweet out
when you log in with user and password
or when you subscribe to a newsletter
and as you can see here on the left side
I have a newsletter subscription and
let's go ahead and I'm going to go ahead
and test this out right now I'm going to
enter my name and email and click send
it to me now and I'm going to I'm going
to be redirected to this welcome page
and now if I check the headers you can
see that the method is post because we
have posted information and that's the
method that ways that was used by the
application okay so let's get in post
and the HTTP verbs now now that we
understand how the rest works let's look
at the rest api okay so as you can see
here the rest api is made up of a rest
api endpoint URL this is where the
actual URL is located the API URL is
located then we follow that by the
method and parameters
so the think of the API its sense for
the application programming interface
but you can think of it as a bunch of
useful methods or functions and the
parameters are the parameters that we
can pass on to these methods just like
in a programming language to get what we
want out of it so in this example you
can see I'm using a Flickr comm API
which is an image gallery site I'm using
their method to get information
about a specific photo named Flickr that
photos that get info and for the
parameter I'm using photo underscore ID
and I'm specifying the idea of the photo
and the server is going to send back a
response which is going to be the
representation of the resource in all
the available formats now when we're
using REST API it's important to
remember that we're not going to be
getting HTML as a response because
that's not going to be very useful in a
programming whenever we're writing our
own programming applications and these
are the most common formats that we're
going to be seeing the representation of
the resource
whenever sending a REST API request ok
so that's how the REST API works now
let's actually look at let me show you
an example of the REST API request so if
I go to Flickr comm services API this is
their API documentation and if I scroll
down here on the request formats you can
see rest and they give you the endpoint
URL and how to actually send the request
they also have a bunch of functions or
API and methods on the right hand side
but to make things easier I'm actually
going to go to a cool site called API G
comm forward slash console and this is a
website that already lists a bunch of
available api's if you check this
checkbox here or scroll box I'm going to
go ahead and under API I'm going to
check I'm going to select Flickr and
under the API and methods it's going to
list all the of their methods
just like listed in their documentation
and under photos I'm going to find the
one to search for a bunch of photos
which is Flickr that photos that search
so that's the method and you can see
that it added the endpoint URL along
with a method now let's specify some
parameters or arguments as you can see
the AAP
is it required and this is so that that
you can track how many requests we're
making to their API so that we don't
spam it to death so usually you have to
sign up for the account but I already
signed up and I'm going to use my API
key here and you guys feel free to use
this API if you feel like typing it
otherwise sign up with flicker a yahoo
account because the Alko is the one that
owns flicker so that's going to be one
of our parameters as you can see it
added this parameters here in the URL
finally actually for the format I'm
going to input JSON which is the format
that we're going to be getting the
response in and for the text I'm going
to enter Lily to keep the valentines
flower theme going here and finally
don't forget to change this HTTP to
HTTPS otherwise it's not going to work
because it's supposed to be secure and
then click send now we got the response
back with HTTP 200 okay code which means
everything went well and if you scroll
down it's going to have a bunch of this
JSON code which goes on what seems like
forever but if you triple click on it
and copy then you can open up the
notepad and you can paste the whole
thing in a notepad so what we get here
is a bunch of results with information
about the photos about Lily photos that
we just searched for and the reason it's
in this strange-looking format is
because this makes it a lot easier to
implement in our applications as we're
going to be programming and using this
API and that's what the REST API is for
is for implementing into the
applications but if you guys want to
understand what's going on here a little
bit more you can actually paste this
inside of a online JSON parser so if you
go to json dot parse clear that online
that FR you can paste this code here and
get rid of the
the closing bracket here and just get
rid of a part as well so just delete
that and now we get presented with the
JSON which is a lot easier for us to
read so this is just a way to understand
all the gibberish and presented by the
JSON response a little bit better and
you can see that we have information
about the photos we have a photo ID we
have an owner ID we have a secret key as
well as the title of the photo so we can
use this code to plug it into into our
application and start working with it
so that's how we make a get REST API
request now let me show you how to make
a tweet so if you select Twitter under
the api's here it's going to change to
the Twitter API and of course whenever
we send a tweet out via post method it's
going to require authentication so under
authentication I'm going to select oh
the first one and then sign in with
Twitter I'm going to authorize the app
and it has logged in to my Twitter
account now I'm going to select under
tweet I'm going to select the statuses
update that JSON which is the method
used to post tweets and then I'm going
to say happy Valentine's Day under this
status and I think that's pretty much
all you need click send HTTP to con it
okay that means the tweet has been sent
let's go to Twitter comm to see if that
worked and I'm going to click on my home
home page link let's see I'm going to
click on my end there you go happy
Valentine's Day the tweet has been sent
successfully using the REST API
so that's pretty much it for the rest
API I hope you guys found this video
