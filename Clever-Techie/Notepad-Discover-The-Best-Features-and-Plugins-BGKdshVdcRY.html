bad tikki and in this video I'm gonna
show you guys what I think are some of
the best features of notepad plus plus
first of all I've divided this video in
five different categories just so that
you guys can have an overview of what
I'm going to be talking about for a
while number one is I'm gonna talk about
aesthetics what makes code look better
in notepad plus plus number two
shortcuts number three I'm gonna talk
about file management and this is a
section that will take most time of this
video number four I'm briefly going to
mention the MPP FTP plugin and lastly
I'm gonna show you guys how to run a PHP
script directly from notepad plus plus
with just one hotkey alright so let's
get started first of all go ahead and
download note that was once I mean if
you don't have it installed and
downloaded can't really follow this
video you gotta have notepad plus plus
on your system so just go ahead and go
to their website and download it I trust
you guys know how to do this I already
have my notepad plus plus installed so
I'm just gonna open it up here and this
is what you get when you first open up
note that plus plus it's about a book
got a bunch of icons here and at the top
it's got the menu now let me open up a
file which I've prepared for this video
called file that PHP and immediately
upon opening a PHP file you can notice
you can notice the difference here I
mean it's just so much more pleasant to
look at because I save this file as PHP
and I have the PHP tags here notepad
plus plus
immediately recognize this as PHP code
and highlighted the code using this
embedded our built in code highlighter
so you can see that the functions are
involved and they're very easy easily
identifiable and you can tell where the
strings are where the variable names are
etc I mean it just looks a lot more
easier now if I copied and pasted this
and regular note but it'll just look
like this just plain text so it's just
more pleasant to look at plus plus plus
it comes with more themes if you go to
settings style configurator and under
select theme you can choose a bunch of
different themes whichever one you like
and let me just cycle through all of
them here real fast all right you get
the idea just pick the one you want the
one that looks better looks best for you
I personally created my own and this is
what Mike Leavitt icky
theme looks like and if you guys want
this I'm including a link where you can
download clever techy XML which is the
theme file and if you choose to use it
you're gonna have to open up your
notepad plus plus roaming directory and
under app data usually that's the file
path there'll be in the C users your
username have data roaming and then
you'll see a bunch of application
folders on the roaming and you just
navigate an open notepad plus plus open
up the themes directory and paste clever
technique XML in this directory and just
keep this folder open for now we're
going to do some more configuration
later on just go ahead and minimize this
one
though and then after you have pasted
the XML file go ahead and close notepad
plus plus and reopen it and now go to
settings style configurator and clever
techie will be right there under the
select theme menu you also want to
change font name under font styles to
console us and the font size has to be
twelve in order for it to look like this
alright so what else do we have here if
you click on this parenthesis it
highlights the closing parenthesis same
goes for the curly braces and then just
makes it a lot easier to manage these
curly braces and parentheses because
sometimes you can get confused with
these and you can't find the other one
where the other one maybe you forgot to
close one of them and you just this
highlighting just makes it a lot easier
to identify them and the second thing is
if you double click on a variable name
it will highlight all the variables that
are in that file so if I click on user
name highlights all the user name
variables password it does the same
thing also I like this highlight of the
line you know which line you're working
on and how it highlights that specific
line and that is pretty much all I have
for the aesthetics I mean this code
looks much better to me than this and
the highlighting functionality really
alone this alone makes it words that
using notepad plus plus as opposed to
your regular notepad if you are a coder
and let me just show you real quick how
HTML is going to look like it's pretty
simple but you can create your own if
you go to settings style configurator
you can just create your own custom
color schemes
or any language that you program in and
you can modify clever techie theme to
whatever colors you would like so that's
it for aesthetics now let me show you
some shortcuts some useful shortcuts
because there's a ton of shortcuts in
notepad plus plus but let me show you
some useful ones okay if I'm at the
start of the line here I can press end
and that will jump me to the end of the
line and if I press home you'll put me
back to the start of the line and if I'm
at the start of the line and it press
control-shift
delete that will delete the whole line
and I'm just gonna undo it and I'm gonna
go back to the start of the line and if
you press control D that will duplicate
the line as many times as you press so
that is pretty handy and useful you can
also let's see here you can oh yeah one
of the most useful shortcuts that I use
is control f2 and that when you press
can when you're on a line and you're
press ctrl F 2 it will create a bookmark
by indicating this blue icon on the side
on the left side of the screen and you
can later come back to that bookmark by
just pressing F to see how it just came
back here so if I had it like a bunch of
code and usually I do let me just show
you how useful it can be and suppose I'm
working on something here and I wanted
to come back to that bookmark I would
just press f2 and would jump right back
to it and you can create as many of
those bookmarks as you'd like as long as
you're on the line and you press ctrl F
2 it will create a motor bookmark for
you and you create you can create
another one here and then you just press
f2 and press f2 again and it's going to
cycle through all those bookmarks
and to remove a bookmark you just stay
on the line where you have the bookmark
and press ctrl f f2 again and now I'll
remove it so I'm going to go back and
remove all of these and let me just
remove all this redundant code okay I
think and now and around here yep okay
I'm just going to save this file and you
can also cycle through the brackets if
I'm if I selected this bracket here you
can see the pointer blinking right there
and if I press control B you'll put me
where the closing bracket is so the
cursor is right there so it's pretty
useful to jump between the curly braces
and know exactly where you have them it
just makes it coding a lot faster and
easier now that's it for the shortcuts
on my part um now I'm going to show you
guys the most useful feature of notepad
plus plus which is file management and
file a notepad plus plus is a very
powerful application when it comes to
file management you can create you can
open multiple files and have them in
multiple tabs you can cycle through
those tabs you can close many tabs at
once you can also save the session of
all of your open files so that you can
real quickly reopen them later you can
bookmark your sessions so that you can
conveniently access them from your
bookmarks and you can also have a plugin
where you can navigate through all your
files and unfold errs and create new
ones and edit them just like you would
on in Windows Explorer and it just has a
lot of those features and I'm gonna go
over them right now first of all before
we do let's go ahead and download a
plug-in called
explored by going to plugins and under
plug-in manager show plugin manager just
going to show a bunch of plugins I'm
going to highlight one of these and
press e and that will jump to the
plugins let's start with letter E and
I'm going to select Explorer check the
check box install would you like to be
would you like to restart notepad yes it
will restart notepad and now you have
the Explorer plugin go to plugins and
you have Explorer showing up here now
just select the Explorer and on the left
side hand side of your window you're
gonna have Explorer show up now this
window on the first window is the
directory window and the second one
below it is where all the files are so
if I go to my say localhost it will show
all the folders and files under that
directory so it just kind of works like
if you are navigating through your
computer on Windows you can just easily
do this here and it's sort of a same
thing where if you're working on a new
project you can always create a new
folder by right-clicking on the folder
that you want to create it in and go
into new folder or example I'm going to
name it project 1 and now I have project
1 folder here and I can start creating
some some PHP files in this folder so
it's really easy to manage your files
that way and navigate through them you
can also edit them you can just right
click and it will give you all the the
options that you can do to modify and
create new files and etc so that's the
first cool feature now let me show you
something else here
if I go to my if you have a lot of files
or a work on for example I have a bunch
of scraping scripts here that they just
happen to do pretty much the same thing
but a little bit differently I'm gonna
go ahead and select all of them by
holding out shift key and I'm going to
open all these files open and multiple
tabs that's another cool feature of
notepad plus plus is that when you open
multiple files it will put them in these
tabs just like it would in a browser and
you can cycle through all them you can
also press ctrl tab and it will open up
this handy little window and you'll know
exactly where all those files are
located and what the names are and
they'll be right in front of you if you
don't feel like scrolling them through
those files using these arrows here you
can also go to window and check out all
these files here and cycle through them
and lastly you can go to Windows and
even check out the file type you know
you can sort by file type you have
different file extensions you can look
and see which directory those files are
and the name of the files and you can of
course activate one of these and it'll
go directly to that file so those are
the multi tab that's the multi feature
now another really useful one is called
sessions so if I'm working on a bunch of
multiple files here and I want to save
that session so that next time I don't
have to go in and you know go to my
local host Cribs selecting all these
files opening them if I wanted to say
that in a session I would go to file
session name the session something like
scrape scripts and then I would create a
link which would also be named spray
scripts and I like to save a session
file in the same directory where my
files are located but of course it's not
necessary to do that so you can save
your session anywhere on your computer
for example under my document sessions
would be a pretty good organized idea
anyway I'm going to save that session
I'm going to click OK and now I'm going
to close all these files by
right-clicking on one of those tabs and
this is another cool feature you can
close all but this and then will close
all of them but the current open file
and then I'm going to close that as well
so it's a very quick way of closing
those files also and then I'm going to
open the session by going back to to the
scripts folder which is already open and
then I'm gonna sort and I'm gonna open
up scrape scripts session by
double-clicking on it now wait that
didn't work never mind I can this opens
up what's actually inside the file and I
want to I want to use file open scrape
scripts this is how you want to open the
sessions um oh no no no I messed up here
all right sorry about that you go to
file load session that's the proper way
to do it I'm sorry and then I'm gonna
double click on the scripts and then
that worked it opened up a bunch of neat
those scrape script files that I had so
so that that's how the way the sessions
work and you can have as many of them as
you want obviously and if you want it to
neatly organize them there is another
feature for that as well and it's called
favorites
if you click on this heart icon here
it's going to open up your favourites
full window and you can click on any of
these folders files web links and
sessions it can right click on it and
you can add existing session you can
save current session or you can create a
new group to organize your session by so
I'm just going to go add current session
and maybe new session new session oops
link scrape screws okay okay and then
this is the same session as a let me
just delete some of these here
you eat you lead because I already
created them earlier and I'm gonna go to
properties and rename now on to scrape
scripts so now I have my scrape script
session in my favorites and I can easily
access it them I can even expand the
session and look what kind of files are
in it and let me try something here
actually let me close all these tabs and
double click on this and voila that
actually works if you double click on
the session here from your saved
sessions that will open up all your
files as opposed to trying to open a
session here like I tried before that
will actually give you the code but ok
so hopefully you guys grasp that idea of
how powerful these features are
including multi-tab sessions favorites
and be using explorer so that's pretty
much it for file management now let me
show you another feature that is very
useful which pertains to files and that
is a under search you'll find find in
files and you can use this awesome
feature too
through the whole directory for a
particular text and you can either find
it or you can replace it so I'm going to
search for some text here in my local
host scripts folder for example and I'm
going to hit final and it's going to
scan the whole scripts folder and
apparently there's a bunch of photos and
so I'm going to cancel okay
I'm going to close that let's do
something else finding files you can
just look through this website here
final and 0 found lip okay you get the
idea you can search through the files in
a directory and you'll find whatever
text you're looking for as a matter of
fact let me try looking through the
files where I have them let's just scan
this folder that I created here can if I
can find it there is just going to
search for PHP so I know it's found for
sure okay here we go this is what I was
looking for it will show you the window
and it will tell you which line has been
found in in which exact file it's in
right there this is the directory the
file is the contents of the file you can
go ahead and minimize that file you can
minimize its contents you can check out
the next file and minimize that and then
it will show you all the files where the
text instance has been found and it's a
really handy and useful feature
and in the same way of course you can
replace any kind of text within a
directory and they'll save you a ton of
time you can also use regular
expressions which I'm not going to go
into here but that will let you create
more advanced find commands and create a
kind of find what you're really looking
for but I'm going to go into that and
then another video so that's it for file
management and next what I'm going to
talk about is MPP FTP which is a
built-in plugin I'm going to close all
these files here and I'm going to go to
plugins MPP export now wait what am i
doing MPP export now I'm going to go to
plugins plugin manager and then I guess
I have to install it and PP FTP is the
plugin that you want and I think you
guys should already have it installed
maybe I uninstalled it by accident I'm
just going to install it here and I'm
gonna go to plugins and ap FTP show and
PP FTP window and I already have my
house set up here but the way that you
would create it is just by pressing this
gear icon and going to profile settings
and then you would add new to add the
host and then we'll ask you for the name
and just I I entered Bluehost
because that's the name of my host and I
entered the host name which is the IP
address port username and password and
then we can go ahead and connect to the
host and now it's connected to the the
FTP server I can go ahead and open up my
public HTML documents and check out one
of my domains which is tree outline now
if I open that domain
in a browser just to show you guys how
this MPP FTP works real fast out line
comm is a domain that I'm hosting in
Bluehost as you can see I have a fresh
copy of WordPress here and all these
WordPress files are showing up and I'm
going to open up WordPress config
configuration file and here you can see
the database name username and password
so I'm going to change password to
something else and I'm going to I just
hit ctrl s to save the file and that's
all you have to do everything is
automatic automatically updated on a
server I'm going to go back to the
browser and refresh now it's not able to
establish a database connection because
I change the password so I'm going to go
back and I'm going to change it back and
I'm gonna go to file save just so you
guys see it go back to the browser
refresh and now it's working
so that's just to show you how easily it
is how easy it is to modify these files
and how quick it is you know I mean it's
pretty handy having this MPP FTP
connection where you want to modify
files the only limitation here is that
it's a real pain you can really upload
multiple files so for that you would
probably use something like FileZilla
but if you want to quickly access your
server check out what files are there
edit some of them this is the best way
to do it from within notepad plus plus
all right so that's pretty much it for
the most features the last one that I
want to show you guys if I you're your
PHP code ER and you'll find this one the
most like the most useful of all and
that is the ability to run a PHP script
from within notepad plus plus now by
default you can't really do that if I
open a PHP file here
for example this file that I had earlier
and I go to run run PHP in Firefox well
that works because I already have it set
up but if you guys I already added this
functionality here called run PHP in
Firefox and I can even press f6 and the
PHP script is der is loaded from
localhost so I know PHP is being
executed because of this command but you
guys don't have that so if you go to run
lunch and Firefox this is where you're
going to get you're going to get a bunch
of PHP gibberish code and it will try to
access your file directly from the hard
drive so let me show you how to do this
first of all we're going to go ahead and
create a script inside your web files
directory mine is under C localhost and
this is your Apache server or document
root directory were where you have all
your PHP scripts go ahead and create a
file called Reggie reg dot PHP in your
root directory of that folder and let me
show you what's inside of this file
you're gonna have to type this code here
and I'm also going to provide a link in
the description of this video and you
guys can go ahead and you know just
access that link and just copy and paste
the code here in the Reggie reg that PHP
if you don't feel like typing just make
sure you type exactly as it is I'm not
gonna go and explain what all this means
just trust me on this one
alright I'm gonna close this file and
assume you guys are done
type in all this and I'm going to close
this file as well and the last step oh
well another step that we need to do is
remember that folder that I told you to
keep open if you don't have it open go
to see users your user name AB data
roaming notepad plus plus now here's
what we're going to do we're going to
modify the shortcuts that XML file but
if we modify it directly it's not gonna
work if you open it here and you modify
something like let me just delete
everything here and save I'm gonna close
and I'm gonna open it hold on I'm gonna
reopen it I'm going to open it again as
you can see all the settings are intact
nothing changed so in a similar way if
we add another line here it's not going
to work either so here's how to do it
rename your shortcuts that XML to
something else like edit then open it
with notepad plus plus and then you're
going to want to add this line right
here that I already have this whole line
I'm also going to include a link where
you can download this line so you can
copy the whole thing but let me just
scroll through slowly if you guys want
to type it
so it's line 10 here and command name
run PHP in Firefox is the text I'm gonna
show up right here and then you want to
set up your own hotkeys I just use f6
which is key 117 and I put control no
four control no four alt and no four
shift
I just want to press f6 and I want to
execute the PHP script from Firefox and
this is how okay so just go ahead and
type it exactly as you see it here make
sure you enter localhost I ready reg dot
PHP and all this other text is exactly
is it showing up here
then you want to after you're done you
of course want to save the file and you
want to close it and you want to close
notepad plus plus now as you can see
another shortcuts that XML showed up
here so you want to delete that we no
longer want the old shortcut that
shortcuts the XML we're going to delete
it and we're going to rename this one
back to shortcuts that XML now if we
edit this you're going to have that new
line that you've added and you should
I'm going to reopen notepad plus plus
again I'm going to close this file I'm
going to open whatever just open
whatever PHP script that you want to run
mine is in the notepad plus plus filed
at PHP now you should have run PHP in
Firefox under run and I'm just gonna
click on that and if you did everything
right you'll have your code executed and
everything and and now you can execute
any kind of PHP code from within notepad
plus plus by just using a single hotkey
I'm just gonna press f6 here and them it
loaded the PHP script so that was just a
quick overview actually some of the best
features or not that was class and I
hope you guys you guys find it very
helpful and this was clever techie I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
