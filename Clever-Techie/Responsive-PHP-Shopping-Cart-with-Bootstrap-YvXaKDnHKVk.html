techie and in this video we're gonna be
creating a responsive PHP shopping cart
with bootstrap this water shopping cart
is going to look like it's going to
display product images titles and prices
we're gonna be able to add as many
products as we like to our shopping cart
by modifying the text field down here
we're gonna display order details or a
product name quantity price and a total
for each individual product as well as
the grand total for all the products
combined that are in a shopping cart we
can also remove products from the
shopping cart by pressing the remove
button and down here at the bottom we're
gonna display the checkout button our
shopping cart is going to be responsive
so if I drag the window here at a first
breakpoint it's going to reduce the
image sizes at a second break point is
going to display our shopping cart in
two rows and finally at a last breaking
point it's going to display one column
making it responsive for tablets as well
as cell phone devices and if I scroll
down here you can see that the order
details table has become scrollable
making it responsive as well so that's
our responsive PHP shopping cart with
bootstrap let's go ahead and create it
so the first thing I want to show you
guys is an overview of all the steps
that we're gonna be completing I've
created this outline in Microsoft
OneNote which is a free program that you
can download and this just gives us an
overview of all the steps that we're
gonna be completing and we can keep
track of how many we have completed by
checking off this empty box
right next to all the individual steps
we can also write pseudocode which makes
it easier to solve programming problems
and organize our code better later on so
as you can see there are six main steps
we're gonna be completing we're gonna
create the shopping cart database with a
products table then we're gonna insert
data into our products table then we're
gonna display products we're gonna
display order details which is gonna be
the main part of our program then we're
gonna add a remove button next to each
product and finally we're gonna display
checkout button if the shopping cart is
not empty
I also included a link in the
description of this video where you guys
can download this file so the first step
is to create a shopping cart database
and products table which is what we're
gonna do right now so I'm gonna go ahead
and open up the command prompt and I'm
gonna connect to the database then I'm
gonna create the database by typing
create database cart then I'm gonna open
up the browser and go to PHP myadmin
that I already have open here and check
if the database has been created and as
you can see I have created card database
which is empty right now so the next
step is to create products table there
are many ways to do this I have already
typed up this code to create products
table so I'm just gonna go ahead and
copy this and go back to PHP myadmin
I'm gonna paste it here in the console
of PHP myadmin then I'm gonna press
control enter and execute the Kure at
this point our products table has been
created and we're now ready to insert
our product data into the table so in
order to fill out a products table I'm
gonna do exactly the same thing I did
for the actual table I'm gonna go ahead
and copy this insert statement and paste
it back into PHP my admin console I'm
gonna hit ctrl enter to execute the Kure
and at this point our products table has
been filled with the actual product
names images and prices now if you guys
are gonna be copying this insert
statement just make sure that your PHP
file and and image files are in the same
folder otherwise it's not going to work
because you'll have to specify the
actual path names to the files and this
is how I have my PHP files along with
image names they're all in the same
folder
okay so at this point we have created
the database and products table we have
also inserted data into our products
table the next step is to display our
products and when we complete this next
step which is displaying our products
our shopping cart is going to look like
this so it's going to display product
image product title and product price
along with all the Add to Cart buttons
next to each individual product so let's
go ahead and get started on displaying
products now as you can see underneath
display products we have three sub steps
that we're going to be completing and
the first one is to connect to the
database and run MySQL query to select
all products from our table then we're
going to loop through all the product
results to get the data of each
individual product and finally we're
going to display product data inside of
our Add to Cart form with image name
price quantity text field and Add to
Cart button now before we start coding
HTML and working with bootstrap CSS
I just want to complete these two steps
with pure PHP and later on we're gonna
start working on formatting so let's
complete this step first with PHP and
connect to the database and run MySQL
Kure to select all products from the
products table as you can see I've
already created a new PHP file here
named cart that PHP I also have a card
that's CSS which is gonna be our C
cascading style sheet file to format our
shopping cart I also have index dot PHP
which has completed shopping cart code
just so that I can show you guys what
the completed shopping cart is going to
look like throughout this video and I
also have completed CSS as well so these
are the two files that we're gonna be
working with here car dot PHP and car
that CSS okay so let's go ahead and
connect to our database first and then
select products from our table okay so
I'm just gonna open up the PHP tag and
then connect
to the database I'm gonna store
everything inside a variable called
connect using a function called MySQL i
underscore connect which takes in four
parameters the first one is localhost
username which is root password make
sure to use your own password and the
database name which is card in our case
then we're gonna create the curie string
and store it inside the curie variable
and our statement is going to be
selecting all the products from our
products table so select all products
from products order by ID ascending so
now that we have the connection and the
Curie we actually have to execute this
Curie and store everything inside of our
result variable so we're gonna use a
MySQL a Curie function which takes in
two parameters the first one is a MySQL
connection and the second one is the
Curie okay so now that we have our
connection and we have executed the
Curie we're going to check to make sure
that the products table is not empty so
we're just gonna say if result and we're
also gonna check if the result is more
than zero with MySQL I Nam Rose function
so if my sqli num rows the result is
greater than zero
continuing running at this point we're
ready to loop through all the product
data we're gonna use a while loop and
store everything inside of a product
array and we're gonna use a function
called MySQL I fetch associative result
so this is this loop is just gonna look
through all the data that's inside of
our result and
is gonna store everything inside of an
associative array and we can also print
out each individual product right now
inside the while loop just to see what
we have so far so we're gonna use a
function called print our product and
then view the result in a browser and
products let's go fetch mmm
select from products order oh I have a
mistake in my keyring refresh I'm gonna
go to view page source and as you can
see I have all the product data and now
we're ready to work with all these
products and start formatting them so
I'm gonna go ahead and go back to
OneNote and check off these two steps
here and the last one to complete our
displaying products is going to be
display product data inside of the card
form and along with all the product
image name price quantity and add the
card button which is the formatting part
that we're gonna be doing right now so
the first thing I'm gonna do here is
declare doctype HTML then provide some
basic HTML tags for the title I'm gonna
name this page shopping cart working and
then then I'm gonna go ahead and include
two style sheets the first one is going
to be bootstrap CSS so I'm gonna say
link rel equals stylesheet' href equals
bootstrap CSS URL and same thing for our
custom card that CSS stylesheet href is
going to be card CSS for now car CSS is
empty but we're gonna be working with it
later I just want to make sure that
we've included our bootstrap as well as
a custom CSS for now now the next step
is we're gonna be printing out all of
our product data inside of a body tag so
we want to go ahead and copy this PHP
and paste it inside of this body tag
here we also want to go ahead and end
PHP with a closing PHP tag
okay next up is we want to make sure
that we're printing out all the products
inside of a bootstrap container which is
going to basically contain the whole
code within this container and so we're
going to go ahead and create this new
div tag just after the body tag so div
class equals container container what I
make sure we end this tag just before
the body tag down here okay so we want
to be printing all of our product data
inside of the while loop because this is
where we're accessing all of our product
data including price name etc so we want
to go ahead and and PHP code here and
reopen it down here because we're gonna
be printing more HTML I'm also gonna go
ahead and change the syntax to shorthand
by replacing these opening curly
brackets with a semi with a Colin and
I'm gonna replace these closing brackets
with the end while and end if statements
just because it looks nicer and it's
easier to organize our code like that
okay so inside of this while loop we're
gonna be accessing all our product data
and we want to be printing all of our
product data inside of bootstrap columns
these columns are going to be responsive
and they're gonna be changing their size
based on the screen size resolution for
our example we're gonna be using two
column names small and medium and this
is how we're gonna be accomplishing it
so we're gonna create a new div class
equals call sm4 and call md3 I'm gonna
explain what this means right now before
we want to make sure that we end this da
eat
and it's still inside of our while loop
okay so what this means here SM and MD
are our breaking points so if I go to
bootstrap website you can see that it
says small devices and this is our SM
what what these SMI letters mean so
media break point SM is going to be at
576 pixels and media breakpoint MD is
going to be at 768 pixels so what this
means is bootstrap is gonna change our
column names to this number when the
screen resolution changes to 576 for
small devices and it's going to change
our column width to number three for
screens that are seven 768 pixels and up
okay hopefully this makes sense here
actually let me show you something else
so this is a completed shopping cart and
if I go ahead and change the screen
resolution to 800 you can see that the
column name has changed as well and if I
open up web developer tools and go to
inspector I can click on one of these
columns and then select one of these
columns here so I'm selecting these this
product course sale crystal case and so
if I change this column name here to 4
for example you can see that the size of
this column has changed to a bigger
width so that's how that works and you
guys can go ahead and play around with
it just to experiment and see how that
works ok let's go back to our code so
now that we're inside this responsive
bootstrap CSS column we're ready to
actually print out our form as well as
as well as only the other product
information so I'm gonna go ahead and
type form method is going to be post
we're gonna be posting all our product
data and for the action we want to make
sure that we have that we provide a URL
which contains our Product ID because
we're gonna be accessing our Product ID
so that we know which exact product is
being added to the card so I'm gonna say
the page name which is index dot PHP and
and then question mark action equals ad
that's gonna be our action name and then
the second variable I'm gonna separate
with an ampersand and provide ID equals
our product ID and for that I have to
actually reopen the PHP tag and then
close it again
then I'm gonna close the string with a
double quote and close the HTML tag and
something it's not right okay so inside
of the PHP tag I'm gonna print out the
actual Product ID just like that hmm
okay got to delete this double quote
here okay so if you remember from our
print our statement I'm actually gonna
do this again here product I'm gonna
print our product so that I can show you
guys how this works I'm gonna go to view
source and so this is our array that we
accessing and you can see that the
product ID is our associative name ID
and that's how we're gonna be accessing
all of our product IDs so that's what
we're doing here when when we are
printing out the Product ID inside of
the URL so that we know which exact
product we're gonna be accessing can you
go ahead and close this form tag okay so
next up I want to make sure that all the
products are nicely formatted so we're
gonna create another div
and name it products and this is a class
that we're going to be creating later on
inside of the card that CSS so that our
columns look nice now we're ready to
print out product image name and price
so for the image I'm gonna say image SRC
equals and then provide the actual
product image name which is product
image which is actual this is the path
where a product is located so he's gonna
print it out inside the image source and
then for the class I'm gonna say I am GE
responsive sure we gonna end this here
for the class I'm gonna say image
responsive mm-hmm fix this here and what
this is going to do is it's going to
resize our image to a different size
based on the screen resolution something
is not right here okay I forgot to end
this okay okay so image - response is
just gonna change make our images
responsive by changing their size based
on the screen resolution next up is the
name of the product and this one I'm
just gonna put it inside the h4 and say
class equals text - info and what this
is gonna do is is just gonna change the
link color to blue so if I go back to
bootstrap website you can see that they
have a bunch of different text colors
and text info is gonna change it to
infil ink which is blue so it's going to
look like this okay so that's what that
means and inside of the h4 tag
I'm gonna go ahead and open up the PHP
tags once again and print out product
name
okay it's not looking good so far but
let's go ahead and print out product
price next
okay so h4 for the product price I'm
also gonna be printing it out inside of
the h4 and I'm gonna put the dollar sign
here and then open up the PHP tags as
usual inside of the PHP tags I'm gonna
say echo product price so now we have
our product image name and price next up
we want to have the quantity of the
products that we're going to be adding
to the cart and this one is going to be
changeable so we want to be so we want
to make sure that it's inside of a text
field so we're gonna say input type
equals text we're gonna name it quantity
so we're gonna be able to access this
variable later on in our code for the
class and this is another bootstrap
class
it's called form control and it's gonna
form a tower a text field in a really
good-looking way for the value it's
going to be default value I'm gonna say
one okay so now we have all our product
data but we don't have a way of
accessing our product name and price
because we're just printing them out as
HTML inside of our form so we want to
make sure to add two more hidden text
field types so that we able to access
these variables inside of our code later
on so I'm gonna say input type equals
hidden and for the name is going to be
product name and the value is going to
be the actual name of the product so I'm
gonna go ahead and open up the PHP tags
and print out product name
so that way we're gonna be able to
access our product name and price inside
of the variables once the form has been
submitted I'm gonna do the same exact
thing for the price so I'm just gonna go
ahead and copy this product name here
and replace the name to price here as
well as here okay so now we're gonna be
able to access all the variables once
the form is submitted and the final
thing inside of our form is going to be
the Add to Cart button so that the form
can be submitted so we're gonna say
input type because submit name this one
Add to Cart
for the bootstrap class I'm gonna say
BTN BTN info and this one is just gonna
style our button really nicely for the
value I'm going to say Add to Cart which
is going to be the actual text of our
button now I can see how this thing
looks like in a browser and it looks
terrible let's see
Oh responsive okay so that's that's
what's gonna happen if our images are
not responsive to refresh the page and
gonna go ahead and delete this print our
statement and as you can see we're now
printing out all of our product images
titles prices as well as text fields and
add card buttons now I'm gonna go ahead
and add a little bit of a margin to our
Add to Cart button just so it has a
little bit of space between the text
field so I'm gonna say style equals
margin top 5px okay so now we have a
little bit of space in here
and we're now printing out all our
products and the last part we're gonna
do here is we're gonna add some custom
CSS to our card that CSS file so that
the columns look a little bit nicer okay
so I'm gonna go ahead and go to card
that CSS and if you remember we created
this class equals products so this is
exactly what we're gonna be working on
in here so we're gonna create a new
class named products and first we're
gonna add a border to our column with
1px solid and the color is gonna be
basically gray we're also gonna add
background color which is also gonna be
a gray background
we're also gonna add that border radius
which is going to be you know which is
going to make our border rounded 5px
gonna add padding to add a little bit of
spacing as well as margin bottom let's
see what this looks like now if i
refresh in the page and as you can see
our product products look a lot nicer
now now if you guys don't understand
what some of this CSS means you can
always just open up the inspector tools
you can click on each individual column
and and navigate to products over here
and you can go ahead and unselect all of
the CSS that we just created and it's
going to change CSS by removing it and
adding it again so you can just play
around with it and see what it does you
can see that it's adding round borders
and background color you can see where
we're adding padding and we can see
where the margin has been created as
well so now our products are all being
printed out really nicely and we are
done with that part of the of our
project so we can go back to our OneNote
and check off
display products so we're done with
display products and now we're ready to
work with display order details okay so
the first part are displaying order
details is we want to make sure if the
Add to Cart form has been submitted then
we want to make sure that the session
shopping cart exists if the shopping
cart exists we want to create a numeric
product IDs array which will attract
array keys and match them to product IDs
this will make more sense as we get into
coding this part of our project but
basically what this means is we want to
create a numeric array because our
session is going to be an associative
array and there won't be a way to match
array keys to product IDs which is what
we need to correctly add and delete
products from the shopping cart so we're
gonna create a counter to keep track of
how many products are in the shopping
cart so that we know what the arrow key
is for the next product then we want to
add next product to exist and shut
accession shopping cart array using that
counter as next array key on the other
hand if the shopping cart doesn't exist
we just want to create a session
shopping cart array with submitted
product data using the first array key
which is 0 then we want to calculate
individual product total we want to
calculate grand total for all the
products and we want to display all the
order details on the page including
product name quantity price total and
grand total ok so now we're ready to
start coding this part and the first
thing we're gonna do is check if the add
card form has been submitted let's go
ahead and do that right now
some I want to go ahead and then open up
the PHP tags and listen this whole code
is going to be on top of all of our code
that we have already created first of
all I want to start the session with a
session underscore start function and
I'm also gonna create a new array many
product IDs this is gonna be an empty
array for now and we're gonna be using
it later on in our program
okay so first thing we want to do is
check if Add to Cart button has been
submitted so I'm gonna say if filter
input input Post Add to Cart which is
the name of our button down here then we
want to proceed so what this function
does here is it basically checks if add
the card variable has been set so this
is how we check if the button has been
in fact submitted so we're done with
that part and we can check this off here
and next we want to check if the session
shopping cart exists so we're gonna say
if is set session shopping cart just
like that then we want to proceed with
the next part of the program on the
other hand if the shopping cart doesn't
exist so we wanna add else then we want
to do this part of the program okay I
actually want to do this part first
because it's very simple and you guys
can see what's going on before we move
on to a more trickier part of of this of
this code so let's go ahead and take
care of the else where our shopping cart
doesn't yet exist okay so what we want
to do here if the shopping cart doesn't
exist is we just want to create a new
session variable or rather array with a
starting key 0 so let's add some
commentaries here so that we know what's
going on if the shopping cart doesn't
exist create first product with Araki
zero and over here we're gonna be
creating array using submitted form data
starting from p0 and fill it with
valleys okay so let's go ahead and
create our session shopping cart so I'm
gonna say session name it shopping cart
and I'm gonna provide the arrow key 0
which is the first array key and then
I'm gonna say array and inside of this
array we're gonna be accessing all the
form data that's been submitted to this
form so the first one is going to be ID
of the product so ID filter input this
one is gonna be accessed from the input
get because as you recall we have
provided this action URL with a product
ID and this is inside of a get variable
rather than post where all the other
values are gonna be accessed because
it's inside of this action URL so this
one is an input get okay
then we're gonna be accessing our name
of the product which is been submitted
inside of the input post and the same
thing for all the other variables or
values product price same thing it's
been exit from post and finally the
quantity of the product
and now we have all of our shopping cart
or product information inside of our
shopping cart session so I can actually
test this by printing out this session
array that we have just created just to
see what's going on so far though before
we do that I actually want to create a
new custom function so that it prints
out HTML tags pre which is gonna display
our array in a very nicely formatted way
so I'm gonna say function name the
function pre R which is going to take in
our EPS array and then what its gonna do
is it's just gonna print out the pre
tags so the opening pre tag that is
gonna print out the array using the
regular built-in print our function and
then I want to close the pre HTML tag
down here that I just want to replace
this with pre R so that we use our new
custom function also we want to make
sure that our session is empty so we
want to make sure to use a function
called session destroy' otherwise there
might be some other variables inside of
our session so now I'm gonna go back to
the browser and see what this looks like
okay at this point our array is empty
but if I click on add to cart on what
are the products you can see that our
session array has been created with all
the values inside of the session
starting with array key 0 and as you can
see with the pre tags it's printing out
the array in a nicely formatted way so
that we can see what's going on right
away
so now we know that this part of the
code is working so we can go back to
OneNote and check off this step okay now
let's move on to the part where if the
shopping cart exists
and we were also already completed the
shopping cart exists okay so for this
part we want to make sure to create a
counter that's gonna keep track of how
many products are in the shopping cart
so that we know that the Araki so that
we know the Araki for the next product
so this is what we're gonna do right now
okay so inside of our shopping cart
where it exists this is what we want to
do I want to create a new variable
called count and we want to use a simple
function called count which is going to
count our session array shopping cart to
see how many products are in it and
that's how simple it is so now we have a
counter and we're gonna use it in place
of the arrow key to so that we know
which product key to use which array key
to use for the next product that's been
added to the cart okay so I'm gonna
comment this and say keep track of how
many products are in my shopping cart
okay we're done with this part and now
we want to create a numeric product IDs
array which will tracked array keys and
mesh them to product IDs this part is
necessary because our session shopping
cart array is an associative array as
you can see here and it's very difficult
if not impossible to match this array
key to the product ID in this way so
what we're gonna be doing is creating a
new array called product IDs which is
gonna be a numeric array with arrow keys
and product IDs only and we're gonna
accomplish that with a function called
array column so this array that we
created earlier we're gonna say product
IDs equals array column session shopping
cart
and we want to provide our the air a
column takes in two parameters the first
one is an array and the second parameter
is the column which will want to isolate
from the array okay so I'm gonna add a
comment and say create sequential array
for matching array piece to product IDs
and I'm gonna go ahead and print out
this product IDs array here so that I
can explain it a little bit better I'm
gonna comment out session here a comment
out session destroy' got to go back to
the browser refresh the page
Add to Cart okay so you can see that for
now our program is only allowing us to
add one product to the card but that's
basically what it's doing so it's
isolating product ID and it's matching
it up with air a key which is the first
array key which is zero so that's how
our product IDs is going to look like
and this is just for knowing which exact
product is being added to the card and
providing correct array key for that
product okay so next up we want to make
sure that the product being added to the
card does not already exist in the array
so we're gonna say if not in array with
an exclamation mark filter input input
get ID
so this is gonna check if if the if the
product with this ID already exists in
in the shopping cart array and if it
doesn't exist it's going to proceed with
the program and here we want to do the
same thing as we did inside of our
doesn't exist statement so I'm just
gonna go ahead and copy this whole part
it's gonna be a little bit different in
place of the of the Araki 0 here I'm
just gonna put count just like that and
now what it's gonna do is it's going to
count how many products are in our
shopping cart and it's going to use that
count for the next arrow key so that it
knows which product is next and we know
which arrow key is going to be next as
well ok so that's it for that part and
the last one that we want to do is what
we want to do in case if the product
already exists in the shopping cart
session variable and we simply want to
increase the quantity of the the
quantity key of that product that's in
that's already in the shopping cart we
don't want to be reading the product
again to the shopping cart session and
already in order for us to do that we
want to create a new loop and look
through our product IDs so we're gonna
say I equals 0 I'm gonna create a for
loop but I equals 0 and then count
product IDs I plus plus so what we're
doing is we're just looking through all
the product IDs here and we're gonna say
if product IDs equals
the product has been added to the cart
so if the product ideal which is already
existing inside of the product IDs
AIRAID is going to match up with a
product which has been submitted from
the forum inside of a get variable if
that happens then we know that product
already exists in the shopping cart so
we simply want to increase the quantity
key of our session shopping cart and
that's exactly what we're gonna do here
so session shopping cart I quantity plus
equals filter input input post quantity
so what this is doing here it's making
sure that the arrow key is is the same
and it's also using the quantity which
is the quantity of the product and then
I'm using plus eCos which is basically
adding quantity to the existing quantity
of the of this key and the quantity has
been added is the quantity that's going
to be provided from the form and
basically it's going to add that
quantity to the existing key so just to
comment it a little bit so that we know
what's going on add item quantity to the
existing product in the array also over
here match pair a key to ID of the
product being added to the cart and
product already this increased quantity
okay so our session should be working
now let's go ahead and test it out let's
add one of the products in the cart in
Eric specs these two parameters one
given let's see okay let's go ahead and
fix that I forgot to specify the actual
product IDs here yeah because we're
checking if the product ID exists inside
of our product IDs array so make sure to
add this area here okay let's go back
and see what's going on
undefined variable product IDs line 27
product product IDs okay should be
working now so let's go ahead and print
our our session to see what's going on
and as you can see our session has all
the products that I've just been adding
to the session so I'm gonna go ahead and
add some more products and now that
product has also been added to the
session and as you can see all the
products are inside of our session
variable and the quantity for Corsair is
4 right now and if I click on it again
the quantity is now 5 so we can see that
that part of the pen program is working
as well okay so you can go ahead and
experiment with this and see how that
works and hopefully this makes sense
and now this part of the program is
completed and we can go ahead and go
back to OneNote and check off all these
checkboxes here so the main part of the
program is completed and now we we just
have to calculate the individual product
total calculate the grand total for all
the prod
and finally display all this information
on the order details page so let's go
ahead and get started on that okay so
for this part of the program where we're
gonna be calculating individual product
total calculating grand total and then
display an order details on page
including product name quantity price
and total and grand total I actually
chose to copy and paste the completed
code on the page because the code is
actually very basic but it would take
forever to type and I want to save some
time in this video and if you guys are
gonna be pasting this whole code make
sure that you're still inside of the div
class equals container otherwise it's
not gonna look good so this is the new
code that I've pasted here and I'll
explain what's going on here right now
okay so first of all we're using a class
bootstrap class called table responsive
so that when our shopping cart is really
small the table is going to be
scrollable as you can see here okay so
that's what that does it's a really nice
feature for of bootstrap next we're
using a regular class table and inside
of this table we have our table headers
which are which is this part here and
then we're looping through our session
array which is our array that we have
created earlier in the video so I'm
gonna add some more products to the
session so this is the area the shopping
cart area that we're gonna be looping
through in order to display all this
quantity price and total along with
product name data okay so we're looking
through the array make sure that it's
not empty then we're creating a new
variable called total which is going
which is what we're gonna be using to
calculate grand total of all the
products then we're creating a for each
loop to look through our shopping cart
array
and now we're accessing all those all
those values inside of our shopping cart
array and we're just printing them out
so we'll print it out product name
quantity price so that part is what's so
this is the product name here quantity
and price which is exactly what's inside
of our shopping cart session variable
next we are calculating the total for
the individual for the individual
product by multiplying quantity by price
and we're using a function called number
format to format this number nicely and
this is what's being printed out here
next up is the remove button which is
this red button here and we're gonna be
hand coding this part later in the video
but for now we're basically using an
action called delete so that we know or
what kind of action is being it's been
submitted so that we know to remove the
product from our session and we're
printing out product ID in the same way
that we have done in our form over here
where the product has been added to the
cart so basically that's how we know
which product to remove from the cart
and for the bootstrap CSS we're using
BTN - danger which is what's making this
button red down here we have that turtle
that we have to that we set to zero
previously and we're just adding more
turtle to the existing turtle by
multiplying the product quantity by
price and that's how we create grand
total for all the products which has
been printed out at the bottom here okay
so that's it for all the data this is
where we actually printed out the grand
total and we're using a line right to
align this number to the right side of
the screen finally we have a check
button and this button we only want to
display if the shopping cart is not
empty so we're checking if the shopping
cart is not empty and we're making sure
that the shopping cart contains more
than zero products and only then we're
printing this button with a custom CSS
and as you can see here in car that CSS
I've also chosen to pace the remaining
CSS here and this is just gonna be a lot
more productive because you guys can
play around with this with inspector
tools in a similar way we've done with
the columns and you can go ahead and
check out this you can go ahead and
check out this check out button and this
is all the CSS that's been created for
for this button so you can go ahead and
play around with that by removing the
background color alignment of the text
padding and you can see what all the CSS
does to the bottom to the button instead
of typing all this code okay so that
completes that part of the program so we
can go ahead and come check all the
check boxes here along with a display
checkout button and the last part that
we're gonna do is we're gonna remove is
we're gonna add the remove button to
next to each product as you can see the
button has already been added now we're
just gonna have to hanko this part of
the program by simply removing or
unsetting the product from the session
so we're gonna look through the session
shopping cart variable and match it with
a get ID of the product that's being
deleted then we're gonna unset our a key
of the product and a session variable
and finally we're gonna reset array keys
in a session of the product car so that
the mesh for the product IDs array
alright let's go ahead and do that right
now okay so the first thing we want to
make sure is the that the link with the
action delete has been clicked which is
this URL down here so that we know that
the user actually wants to remove the
product from the cart so we want to make
sure to check
for action delete alright let's go ahead
and do that right now okay so we're
gonna say if filter input and put get
action equals delete and that's how
we're gonna check that the user has
clicked on that action next we're gonna
look through our session shopping cart
look through all products in the
shopping cart until it matches with get
ID variable okay so down here inside of
our delete URL you can see that the
product ID is provided so we're just
gonna take this Product ID and match it
with our shopping cart idea the product
so that we know which product to remove
all right so let's create a for each
loop to look through our session
shopping cart as key product so now
we're looping through our shopping cart
array and now we're gonna check if the
product ID matches with our get ID that
the user is trying to delete so if
product ID equals get ID and that's how
we're gonna know one second
if product ID okay so okay so we're
looking through the product IDs and
we're matching them with a get ID that's
been provided from the actual URL of the
product that's been deleted and so now
we know which product to remove from our
shopping cart so we're gonna use a
simple function called unset session
shopping cart and we're gonna unset the
key of that product so that's gonna
remove the product from the shopping
cart when it matches with a get ID
commenter remove product from the
shopping cart when it matches what they
get ID okay so now this is gonna remove
the product from our session and lastly
what we want to do is we want to reset
session era keys so they match for the
product IDs numeric array otherwise when
our products are deleted from the cart
they're no longer gonna be matched with
the with a session so we want to reset
session array keys so they match with
product IDs numeric array and this is to
make sure that the right products are
being added and deleted to the card
otherwise it's gonna mess it up and in
order to resort our shopping cart we're
gonna use a function called array values
so we wanna say session shopping cart
equals array values session shopping
cart
and just like that is gonna resort our
array it's gonna sort our arrays so that
all the keys match with product IDs
array over here okay we can now go ahead
and test that out by open up the browser
you can refresh the page and try to
remove one of the products and it says
use of undefined constant ID online 5051
let's go ahead and check out what's to
see what's going on oh okay
make sure this is a string here now
let's go back to the browser Add to Cart
add all the products to the cart test
out the remove button and everything is
working you can also resize the window
to see that our cart is in fact
responsive and as you can see everything
is working and our shopping cart is now
complete so you can go ahead and check
off all the remaining check boxes in our
project and our response to PHP shopping
cart with bootstrap is now complete
