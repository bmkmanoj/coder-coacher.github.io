ticking and in this video we're going to
be creating your responsive navigation
bar in CSS and HTML which is going to
look like this and if I go to developer
and click on responsive design mode this
is what the menu is going to look like
on the model devices and as you can see
here at the top the show menu button has
been showed up and I can click on it to
show and hide the menu and the reason we
want to include that is because space is
limited on the model devices so we want
to provide that extra functionality for
our users if I reduce the screen size is
going to collapse the menu automatically
and I can keep reducing the screen size
and it's going to look good on all the
mobile devices and this is as responsive
as a menu can get so let's go ahead and
create the menu now so what I've done
here is I've created two files
index.html and style that CSS and the
reason I have these windows split like
this is when we're going to be creating
our Styles I want to make sure you guys
understand how we're selecting all the
HTML elements using our cascading style
sheets which is the important part what
goes inside those CSS selectors is
pretty easy to understand and I'm going
to just go over that really fast but I'm
really going to explain how we're
selecting all HTML elements okay so
let's go ahead and type up all the HTML
first first of all we want to make sure
that we're telling the browser we type
in an HTML 5 by typing doctype HTML and
then just typing up all of our basic
HTML elements who can name this on this
navigation menu then we want to include
the style right away by using a link tag
that with relative stylesheet and a
traffic of style that CSS ok here is
where we want to include the meta name
viewport tag and the meta name viewport
is supposed to be included on all the
web pages that are responsive and I'm a
w3schools here
and this is exactly what they say so
just go ahead and copy this HTML and
paste it into your index of HTML or go
ahead and type this line yourself and if
you scroll down here on our web page
they show how the web page is going to
look without the meta tag and what it's
going to look like with a meta tag so
just make sure you include it on all the
responsive web pages say you're
designing okay so now that we're done
with that we're ready to create our menu
let's go ahead and create the menu now
so the main menu links is going to have
five items so it's going to have home
about portfolio news and contact okay so
those are all the main links under about
we're going to have two drop-down links
so make sure you're within that list
item element and then create two new
look two new links under portfolio we
want to have three links so I'm going to
include those and you guys can include
as many links as you like of course I'm
just using this as an example okay so
all of our links are created also I'm
going to specify what the main just
going to tab this to make it look better
and this is our main ul tag so I'm going
to say ID equals menu for our main menu
and for the drop-down links I'm going to
call this class hidden because these
links are going to be hidden initially
makes sense to name them hidden okay
next up above the menu is where we want
to create that show menu button and the
show menu button is going to consist of
the label and a checkbox so it's going
to be our label for show menu plus
equals show menu and then we want to
type text which is again show menu close
the label and then we're going to have a
check box input type equals check box ID
equals show menu role equals button okay
the reason we have a label and a check
box is because using the label we're
going to apply CSS style to make our
label look pretty and whenever we click
on this label
since we use the four attribute and we
have a check box which has an ID show
menu which is the same as here clicking
on the label is going to show the check
box it's gonna I'm sorry it's going to
check the check box so our label is
going to look like a button and we're
going to hide the check box using the
CSS that way it's going to appear like
our like we have a button and we're
going to show the menu by clicking on
the label button so here's what we have
so far and if I click on the label here
you can see that it's checking it and
unchecking that check box later in CSS
we're going to detect this checked box
property and we're going to show the
menu and hide the menu when the check
box is unchecked
okay so that's it for the HTML now let
me go ahead and expand the style here
and now we're ready to create our style
so so far I have the background image
for the style and that step is optional
okay so now we're going to go over all
of our ul and Li elements and apply
styles to them
so the first thing we want to do is
strip the URL of adding and list styling
and we select our first tag which is the
main UL and I just want to show you guys
more of HTML ok so this is the main tag
that we're selecting ul and list list
style type
nond let's say nan margin:0 padding:0
and position:absolute we also want to
create a horizontal list with spacing
for our list item elements so here is
just Li so this is the Li that we're
selecting we're selecting all allies
display:inline-block flows to the left
and margin right 1px let's see what it
looks like so far and so far it looks
pretty messed up but now we're going to
style our actual main menu links and
it's going to look a lot better in order
to style our main menu links we have to
select the a element so an AAA element
in site is inside the li element so
that's exactly how we selected Li a so
Li and then a which is the link element
inside of the list item and I'm just
going to copy this whole CSS inside of
it don't worry too much about I mean
this is really easy to understand we're
applying all kinds of styles to the list
link element and if i refresh the page
here here's what our list item links is
going to look like if you guys want to
play around with this you can go ahead
and open the inspector tools and click
on this icon here and you can roll the
mouse over all these elements and then
click on one of them
and here on the right hand side it's
going to show you all the CSS that we
just applied to it so you can uncheck
all these checkboxes and it's going to
remove the CSS that is applied to it so
you can easily see an experiment with
all these tags and see what every one of
these properties due to the style of our
HTML so these are all elements go ahead
and play around with them to understand
them better and this inspector and web
developer tools is a great way to
understand what's going on with CSS and
HTML ok let's keep going here so we have
created the style for the I'm going to
add a comment so this is a style for
menu links next up let's create a hover
State for the top-level links so that's
whenever we roll the mouse over our main
links it's going to change a background
color so hover State for top-level links
and we select the harbor property by I
mean we select the mouse over property
by using a hover keyword and li kullin
hover and then the a element so this is
going to select the L I mouse over and
then we selecting the a link element
which is inside the mouse over of li
element okay so here we just want to
change the background color to another
color 1 9 C 5 8 9 okay let's see what
we've done okay so that's exactly what
it's doing what we what we specified is
changing the background color of the
mouse aware of the li element okay let's
apply a style for our job down links now
style for job down links and the way we
select our job down links is first of
all we got to make sure we're in a hover
we're in the mouse over of the main list
I am here
and then we follow that by the UL li and
a because because this is where the
drop-down links are so we have a li
mouse over which is hovered and then we
have a ul Li and a and that's exactly
how we get to our job down links yeah
that's how exactly how we get to the job
down links and here I'm also going to
just copy and paste this code and that's
it for the job down links now let's
let's also add the hover State for the
job down links so that there also have
their own background and color other
space for a job down links so we we do
the same thing as we did here but we add
the Hubbert selector and then we just
say the background equals 1 9 c 5 8 9
which is the same background and color
is white okay let's see what we got so
far and here you can see that that's
exactly what we wanted so but now all
these links are showing up so we want to
hide the job down links initially
otherwise our menu is looking pretty
ugly so let's go ahead and hide the menu
drop-down links right now hide drop down
links until they are needed
okay and the way we get to the job down
links is just Li ul and then display
display:none so that's we're just going
to hide all the links if i refresh the
page you can see that all the job down
links are hidden ok next I want to make
sure that all the drop down links are
vertical and this is just going to style
our job down links so that they look
neat so block and float:none I also want
to make sure that
centered in the job downlinks and we
want to prevent tax wrapping on drop
down on drop down links so again li UL
li a is how we selected and then we
apply all the with utter min width
equals 100 px padding:0 20px so this is
all just to make our links all our drop
down links look good
ok let's see what we got so far ok
they're not showing up yet but we're
going to add that style to show the
links in just a little bit actually
let's go ahead and add that style right
now display the drop down on hover okay
this is a sort of a tricky part but I'm
going to explain how it works okay so
first of all we're inside the UL and li
a:hover so UL li a:hover so oh it's okay
ul Li a and then hover so it's the main
mouse-over of the main link like about
so once we're there we want to show the
drop down links and the way we do that
is we use a plus selector and then
follow that by our our class which is
hidden and that's going to show the
whole hidden UL class that's underneath
our main links hidden and also we want
to include the hidden hover as well
because otherwise it's going to hide the
mouse over of the hidden element so just
include both of them and the plus
selector is basically if you go to
w3schools is going to say select and
style every element that are placed
immediately after another element and
that's exactly what we're doing here and
then we just want to say display
block and that's it that's all we want
to do now let's see what happened if i
refresh the page okay the hover is not
showing oh okay so I forgot the dot here
so you saw a perfect example of what
will happen if we didn't include this
part here okay so now all the links are
showing up and they look good so let's
keep going and under patting I think
yeah messed this part up okay now they
look good all right cool
okay let's keep going here what do we
got next
okay so for the let's start working on
the show menu button now so we want to
hide this checkbox so it's invisible
first of all because we don't really
need that checkbox we just we don't need
it to be visible on a page okay so let's
go ahead and hide checkbox and the way
we selected is input and then inside the
square brackets type equals checkbox and
that's how we select the checkbox I'm
going to say display hold on so that's
going to create our invisible checkbox
and next is the cool part is where we
actually we show the menu when invisible
checkbox is checked so that's why we
created the checkbox in the first place
so we want to say input type equals
checkbox and then column checked and
then kill this menu display block okay
so here's what we've done is we're
selecting checkbox and then we're using
the selector : checked to make sure that
the checkbox is checked and then the
tilde works in a very similar way as a
plus it's just going to say everything
that's underneath that checkbox which is
our main menu here
it's going to be is going to select that
menu and apply in the following CSS to
that HTML so that's how that works
and let's go ahead and see what happened
here okay so now now I can show you how
this works yet so let's go ahead and
actually create the style for our main
menu for our menu label which is show
menu and I'm going to go ahead and paste
all the CSS of the main menu here so so
this is all the CSS for the label of the
menu which is going to look like a
button
so it's this we're applying the CSS to
this HTML right here okay fire fresh the
page nothing is going to happen because
right now the menu is not being
responsive because we haven't included
the responsive style yet so when we add
all the responses stuff all this menu
stuff is going to make sense for you
guys so let's go ahead and let's go
ahead and add the responsive Styles
which is the last part that we need to
do responsive styles and for that we
want to use the media selector and then
media screen and max max width and the
max width is where we want our menu to
collapse into a responsive menu and now
we want to apply some CSS to the job
down links or so we want to make sure
there appear inline position static
display:none we also want to create the
vertical spacing for our links because
they're going to be displaying
horizontally I mean they're going to be
displaying vertically instead of
horizontally so we want to add some
vertical spacing so our list items
margin bottom one PX and we also want to
make sure that all our links are full
width so they stretch across the whole
screen
ul Li and L a a li a with 100% and
that's going to select all of our all of
our list items and links as well and
make them 100%
finally here's the best part of it all
this whole video we're going to show the
menu using a simple show menu selector
class that we created display block and
this is going to show our menu button
which we're going to use to show and
hide the menu on on the model devices
when the menu has collapsed into
responsive menu and we also want to hide
the background because the background is
going to look weird in the small mobile
devices okay that's it for the CSS let's
go ahead and see what the menu looks
like if I click on the mobile device
here it's going to show our menu button
that we've created and now let's click
on it and the menu shows up and it looks
good so that's how we create a
responsive menu in HTML and CSS if you
