tikki and in this video we're going to
learn about PHP sessions what our PHP
sessions well it's a way to access
information across multiple pages and in
PHP this information in sessions is
stored inside a variable named
underscore session it's a global
variable so unlike cookies where the
information is stored on the user's
computer in a text file sessions in
sessions that information is stored
inside a global variable ok so I have a
folder here named sessions and I'm going
to create a new file and I'm gonna name
it one that PHP the way we start a
session in PHP is using a function
session start at this point the global
variable underscore session becomes
available so we can now set our session
values so we can say for example and you
can treat the session you can think of
the session global array global variable
as an array so we can set a new named
keene called user name and set it to a
value we can also set in some other one
which is what I'm gonna do here named
role and at this point let me just use
my function to print out the array in a
better way and I'm gonna say pretty our
session print out the array and I'm
gonna open it and as you can see the
session variable array is being printed
out and everything is working as
expected
now we can also say on this page session
variables have been set because the BR
tag
and okay so on this page you are setting
our session variables now in order for
us to check if the session is working on
other pages I'm gonna create another
page and I'm gonna name it - gonna be -
that PHP and I'm gonna create a HTML
link link into that page go to that PHP
and on this page on every page that you
have - that you're gonna be accessing
your session variables on you also have
to use the function session start
otherwise you're not gonna have access
to the global session variable and at
this point the information is gonna be
available to us on this page as well so
we can test that out by printing out the
session array and I'm gonna go ahead and
run one that PHP now which is the first
page where we set in the session
variables session variables have been
set and if I go to - that PHP as you can
see that session keys and values are
still available because well we have
successfully set the session and now
we're accessing them on the second page
so that's how sessions work and that's
as simple as that
now we can also modify session variables
for example I can say session user name
because do you use reality I can say set
it to another user name and then we can
print the session again that's what
happens and I'm gonna go ahead and open
up one that PHP click on the link and
now you can see our original values as
well as the new value so that's how you
modify session variables easy and let's
see here
lastly if you wanna end the session you
use a function called session this
underscore destroyed at this point our
session will be destroyed so if I run
this file here
named to that PHP as you can see the
session keys are not available anymore
because we have destroyed the session
and if I go back to one which is where
we are setting our session variables and
then go to page two then all of our keys
and values have become available so by
using session destroy' you destroy the
session and erase the session array as
well so that's how sessions work if you
