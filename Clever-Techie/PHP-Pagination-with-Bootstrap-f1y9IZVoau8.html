tikki and in this video we're going to
be learning about PHP pagination okay so
this is a diagram that I've created to
explain things a little bit better and
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be going over this paginating
class which creates the pagination links
and what I've done here is I've
incorporated the pagination class here
in the movies listing page this is what
the final result is going to look like
it's got all of our movies and it's
listing five of them per page because
that's the amount that's the limit that
I'm specifying here so I keep I can just
keep clicking on its random pages and as
you can see it's printing five different
movies per page I can go to the last
page and it prints out the last three
movies here and I can go to the first
page I can go to next page I can go to
previous page and it all works
now here you may have noticed I have all
the variables and I'm displaying their
values just so you guys can understand
what's going on here a little bit better
okay so first of all you should go ahead
and download the modified version of the
displaying movies which utilizes the
paginating class and you should also go
ahead and download the paginate class
itself so you can follow along this
video okay let's go ahead and get
started so first of all whenever we're
creating a pagination you got to realize
that we're basically what we're doing is
we're limiting the amount of the amount
of data that we want to display on page
so that is done with a limit keyword in
MySQL the first number that followed
after the keyword limit is the starting
row from which to start selecting our
records from and the second number is
the total rows to select per Kure so
that's what is shown here is showing the
row that we're selecting from which is
45 and then it's so I can in total five
records including 45 itself and it's
giving us that result message so if I
went to PHP myadmin
and I selected from the movies table and
exactly that Curie forty five and five
and I press go you can see that it's
selecting movie ID forty six to movie ID
fifty and the reason it's not forty five
is because my SQL starts to count from
zero so if I go back into the SQL and I
just select from movies so you guys can
understand what I'm talking about here
it's selecting the rows and you can see
that the rows number is zero but the
record ID of the starting row is one so
just a subtle difference and just keep
that in mind for now okay let's go ahead
and go over the pagination class so
first of all we declare all the private
variables and they're private because
we're not going to be accessing them
outside of class they're just for
internal class use so we got our MySQL
connection
we got the limit which is the number of
records to show per page we got our
current page the Kure in a string we got
the total amount of rows and we got our
starting row okay so we declared all
those private variables and next
function or method is the construct and
the construct is called whenever we
instantiate a new object so whenever we
call the paginate class here that
constructor is called here and it takes
in two parameters the first one is the
MySQL connection which we make here and
the second one is a curie which is the
security here which basically what it
does it just selects all the movies okay
that's the constructor and here we go
ahead and we'll run that Curie's and we
also we get the total amount of rows or
return which we're going to be using
later to figure out how many pages total
we're going to have on our pagination
okay so the next method is get data and
this is where the main thing thing
happens is basically what it's doing is
limiting the amount of data that we're
going to be displaying so it takes in
two parameters the first one
is the limit and the second one is page
then we store those in their variables
and we can also specify all so if we
specify all is just going to return all
the records and they're all going to be
printed out without the actual
pagination else we keep going and here's
where we figure out the row to start and
the amount of data to limit and we
subtract one from page because to
account for that MySQL described
discrepancy and then we multiply it by
the limit because that's how many pages
we're going to have which is how many
movies we're going to be displaying on
the page so if I pull up a calculator
just to explain this a little bit better
for example if I'm on page 10 I subtract
one from it I get a nine and then I
multiply it by the limit which is how
many movies were displaying per page and
I get a 45 which is the exact number
that I would get if I ran the Kure that
I've previously ran like this limit 45 5
and that's going to display the movie 5
movies starting from ID 46 so that's how
that works
and this is also I'm specifying this in
a diagram and this is the row start and
here you can see that page minus 1 times
the limit which is exactly what we're
doing inside the class so this visual is
just so you guys can understand this a
little bit better you can download this
chart and just stare at this stare at it
a little bit longer until you until you
understand what's happening ok so we
create a security here and that's how we
figure out how many records to display
per page and then we store everything we
run the curie and we store everything
inside the results array and then down
here we call an STD class which is a
class to create a new empty object
and then we store all of our data and
return it as an object what's important
to note here is that results data is
where we're going to be accessing
because that's what's going to store all
of our rows because here we're storing
inside the results array and then here
we're storing inside the result data by
providing results which we stored
earlier okay so this is getting all of
our data and that's how all that works
and now we're ready to create the links
so let's go ahead and go over that okay
so first of all what it does here is we
can also specify all and in that case is
just going to return nothing so it's not
going to print any pagination but if we
didn't specify all of course then we're
going to do all this heavy lifting here
and create the links and here's what I'm
going to go in-depth and explain how all
of these links here are created okay
here we go so first of all what we're
doing is we figuring out the last page
by getting our total which we figure out
a little bit earlier by writing that
over there and we divide that by the
limit so what happens here if we have
998 results in this case and we divide
that by our limit which is how many
movies were showing we're going to get
the last page which is 100 99.6 but we
use a sale function which rounds up the
number to 200 and the exact number that
we get here which is last and it's going
to be 200 so if I go back to the browser
that's our last number here so basically
it's the last page okay so we took care
of the last page next up next hour we
figure out the start link number and the
end link number so if I go back here and
I click on some random page so this is
this would be the start link number
which is 186 and 196 would be the end
link number so that's just how just so
we know how many links to print out on
our pagination and if we go back to the
diagram you can see that start and the
way we create start is page - links so
if we're on the current page in the
pages 10 and our links is 5 then 10
minus 5 equals 5 and that's how we get
our starting link count in a similar way
we get 15 by simply adding links to the
queueing page so it's 10 plus links
equals 15 and that's how we get the end
we need that because later on we're
going to use a loop to print out start
to end and that's how we print out all
the link numbers that you see here so
that's what it's doing here is figuring
out what the links start is and in
figuring out what the link and is now
the reason we want to check if links is
greater than 0 is because if we are on
the first page we're not going to be
printing any links that are on the
left-hand side so it's just going to
look like this and that's the reason why
it's doing it in a similar way if we're
on the last page with it not going to be
printing any links on the right-hand
side because that's the last page and
that's why it's only showing links on
the left-hand side on the other hand if
I go back to some random page it's
printing links on the left-hand side and
it's printing links on the right-hand
side so basically we're checking for
that here using a ternary operator and
we're doing it for the last page as well
so now that we've taken care of our
links here what we're doing is we're
printing out all the debugging variables
that you see here and you can keep
looking at these and you can see that
the start is 186 and and this on a 9 96
which is our end and start links and
here's our 5 which is the limit which is
how many movies were printing per page
and here's the amount of links and you
can look at all the data and just keep
referring to it as I as we go along here
okay next up we just print out the HTML
UL tag with a bootstrap class and then
what we're doing here is we're checking
in if the current page is one and if it
is we want to disable the previous page
link which looks like this triple arrow
thing so so if we go on a page one you
can see that this triple arrow previous
page is disabled because there's no
previous page to go to and if I go back
to another page then all of a sudden
it's enabled so that's what's happening
there we basically disable it if we're
on page one next up we build the actual
previous page link and the way it's done
is okay so first of all if we're in page
one we don't want to be linking anywhere
so you can see here that if I'm on page
one and I keep clicking on it it's not
going anywhere
now if we're on another page we want to
basically subtract one from this page to
get to the previous page so if we're on
page five and now we're going to page
four and if I keep clicking on it it's
going to reduce page by one so what it's
doing is just subtracting one from it
and this is exactly what's happening
here so here in page -1 easy as that
okay so then we just add everything to
HTML by concatenating it to the string
and we're going to later return that
HTML here and that's how we're going to
be printing out all those all those
links okay here what's happening here is
we're printing the triple dots before
the previous link so so that would be
these guys here and you can see they
just showed up as I click on the next
page that's because there are it's
indicating that there are more pages
here
and the way we're doing it is basically
we're saying if the starting link is
more than one then we want to be
printing out print out the first page
link okay next up we got we're printing
all the numbered page links and this is
where all the main thing happens where
we're printing out all the numbers start
to end and that's how all these numbers
here are being printed out so so we we
set the I to start and we keep looping
through all those links until the end
which is so it's going to be in this
example it's going to print 5 to 15
which is all the numbers here so that's
exactly what's happening in this loop we
have a start and we have an end and we
keep looping until the end and then also
we highlight the current page by we
check if we're on the current page and
if we are then we set the class to
active and that's the reason it
highlights the current page in blue if
not then it's just going to print I
which is the current page number okay so
if n is less than last moving along here
then we want to we want to print these
triple dots and we also want to print
the last last page number which is 200
here and if we're in the last page it's
not being printed out anymore and the
dots are gone as well and instead this
is the active page so the reason we want
to be printing it out separately is
because basically to let the user know
that there's a lock page and make it
user friendly in a similar way where we
printed our first page all right let's
keep going here so next up we got if
page is last then we want to disable the
next link so this thing is going to be
disabled and also we want to make sure
that
we're not linking to it and that's
exactly what we're doing here okay and
otherwise we want to increase the page
by one so if I go back here and go to
random page that's how the next thing
works it just keeps increasing the page
by one in a similar way where we created
the previous page where it's page minus
one and let me see if I missed anything
so you guys can keep looking at this
cheat sheet if you miss something and
you want to figure out how things work
as you can see I have the last variable
here and I have for the previous at page
minus one for the next half page plus
one just like we talked about and the
start link is created once again with
page- links the end link is created with
page plus links here we have a
restarting row and the amount of data
we're selecting that's how all that
works and that's how it all comes
together
finally we concatenate the next page to
HTML and then we return the whole thing
to our to the output which is how we get
all of our links printed okay so you can
see that I've incorporated this page in
edit class here and what I'm doing is of
course I'm creating a MySQL connection
and then I'm creating a Curie to select
all our movies and then this is the
important part here it's basically
passing the variables that you see over
here which is limit and page and we get
the limit which is five and a page
starting page which is one and here we
just set the amount of links to display
per page so if I set this number to 10
we're going to get 10 links per page and
now suddenly get all those links and I'm
just going to reset it back to 5 then
I'm calling the paginating class and get
data function which stores everything
inside of our results now remember it
stores everything inside the results
data so if I print out this results data
here
Oh No hold on a second what all results
results splurt okay so you can see that
it's it's got all the movie information
and that's exactly why we're looking
through that array down here you can see
that I'm looking through the results
that over here okay so that's it for the
pagination I hope this was useful for
you guys and if it was please like this

you next time clever take you out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
