techie in this video I'm going to
explain bootstrap for grid system which
is the best framework for creating
responsive websites now bootstrap for
grid system has five classes for
different screen resolutions ranging
from 576 pixels to 1200 pixels so I've
created this chart so we can understand
how each class behaves and I've labeled
each class with a different color the
pixel size for each class indicates that
with breaking point of the screen size
at which the columns are going to expand
the horizontal or collapse to a single
vertical column as the size resolution
is reduced below the specified width so
if you watch the largest column down
here which is a class 4 extra large
screen devices as I drag the window
below the screen resolution screen width
of 1200 pixels you can see that the
columns collapse into a single column
and as I expand it back the columns are
then expanded into a horizontal column
once again so if you watch the next one
which is the large column 992 pixels
which is labeled by orange as I drag the
window size below 992 pixels the columns
collapse into a single column and as
they expanded back they expand the
horizontal once again and that's going
to be the same behavior for the rest of
the classes if you watch the medium
column it collapses into a vertical
column as I drag the screen size to 768
and less and finally the small column
which is green is going to collapse
after 576 pixels the last column which
is designed for extra small devices
labeled by blue at the top is never
going to collapse because it's designed
that way for all the devices that are
below 576 pixels so as I expand the
screen size back the first one that's
going to expand is a small one then
medium/large and finally extra-large as
I expand the screen size back to 1200
pixels and above
okay now let's look at the source code
of this chart and I'll explain what the
column would actually mean so this is a
source code for the chart that I - that
I just showed you and you can see that
I'm including the bootstrap for alpha
which is the latest version of bootstrap
I'm also including a custom CSS which is
just the slight modifications that I
made by importing the custom font
creating a border for our div so we can
see the chart and also making the font
white off the headers so first of all I
want to show you guys the headers
because I've used five different classes
for of bootstrap for creating these
headers so the first one is primary BG -
primary BG - success BG - info BG -
warning and BG - danger and if we go to
the bootstrap documentation you can see
that all these classes are different
color and that's why it's showing up as
different colors on our chart so I just
wanted to show you that real quick and
so first of all for creating the columns
we first have to include them inside a
div class named row and that's how the
columns are grouped inside that row so
the first one is the one is designed for
extra small devices which is this blue
column up here and as you can see I have
four identical columns inside of that
row and here I have four div tags each
with a call - three and the number here
indicates the actual column width I
actually also put a text inside of that
column so that we can know what kind of
size that column is as we're looking at
the chart also remember that inside each
row all the columns added together have
to add up to number 12 otherwise if I
for example delete this last column and
refresh the page we're gonna have empty
space instead of a column so make sure
to have number 12
and if you look at the rest of the
columns they all add up to that number
so the small one 3 plus 6 equals 9 plus
3 equals 12 for the medium one I have 12
identical columns each with a size 1
which all add up to number 12 for 992
pixels I have 6 columns each size to
which all set up to number 12 and
finally extra-large 9 plus 3 equals 12
so just remember that when you're
creating a columns inside a row make
sure that they all adapt to number 12
now the next one I wanted to show you is
the small column and here I actually
incorporated two different classes and I
mix them together so if we look back to
the chart here watch this small column
labeled by green as I reduce the screen
size back to small you can see that the
middle column expands to a bigger width
and as I drag it back about 576 pixels
all the columns are then resized to
identical width so that's how we can
actually mix in the classes and you can
have as many mix-ins as you want for
different screen resolutions okay so
that's the small one and you can see
that I've created these column sizes
here so for the small device you can see
that the middle column has expanded the
number six which is why it's showing six
here and three on the sides and for the
medium size they're all identical
labeled with number four and again
they're all adding up to number 12 next
one is the medium column and here I just
have 12 different columns all with size
one which all adapt to number 12 as well
and if we look at the chart you can see
all these columns here next one is
column large and here I have six
different columns each with size two and
finally the extra large column I have
two columns one size 9 which is a lot
larger than size 3 and that's exactly
what we can see here if I expand it back
you can see that the column 9 is a lot
bigger than 3
and so what's a little bit confusing
when you're first learning this is that
you can associate the class names like
large with a column number so the LG
doesn't have anything to do with the
actual column width it refers to the
breaking point at which the column is
going to expand or collapse and all the
numbers are going to be identical for
all the classes when it comes to column
width and also remember that each class
scales up so you don't need to specify
any larger classes if the column sizes
are going to remain the same so for this
blue one up here if I already have these
identical columns sized which are all
identical size and I want the rest of
the columns to remain the same size as I
expand the screen we don't need to
specify more classes for that they all
scale up to the same size so this has
been the bootstrap for great system
