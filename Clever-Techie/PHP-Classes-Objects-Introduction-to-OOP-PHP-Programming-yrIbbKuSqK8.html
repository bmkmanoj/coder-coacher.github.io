tikki and in this video we're going to
learn about PHP classes and objects
first of all let's review the syntax of
classes and objects real quick so we
define the class using the class keyword
followed by the class name and inside
the curly brackets we have properties
and methods of the class so properties
is just another word for variables and
that's what we call properties is what
we call variables inside the class and
methods is what we call functions inside
the class so you can think of a class as
just a collection of properties and
methods and that's all it is and if we
wanted to access our property inside the
class we would use a keyword this
followed by the object operator operator
also known as a dart I'm just going to
call that a dart from now on and you do
the same thing for me if you wanted to
access the method name as well now
outside the class we actually
instantiate the object using the new
keyword followed by our class name and
at this point when we do this the object
of the class has been instantiated and
that means the object is going to
inherit or basically obtain all the
methods and properties of that class so
we can use the dart operator again or
all the or the object operator to access
all those properties and methods with
the object okay so let's move on and
let's let me define a simple class
called game class game curly brackets
now inside the class I'm going to define
a bunch of properties and just one
method so first of all let every game is
going to have a price every game is
going to have a name every gate game is
going to have a photo or cover picture
and I'm also going to define a variable
name directory
they're there and I'm going to specify a
default value where and this is this is
the directory where all like game
pictures are going to be located at okay
so at this point we have a valley class
let's just define another function or
not a function and method and this
method is going to print game
information to the screen so right now
at this point it doesn't really do
anything but let me just show you how to
instantiate the object so if I had if I
had a game variable and I said new game
at this point out the game would become
a game variable would become an object
of the game class game is the object
type of game class and I can start
setting some of these properties to the
actual game so I can say something like
game object operator name equals via
shock infinite gain dart price equals
$14.99 game dart photo equals and this
is the jpg name off the photo which is
inside that game's folder and so here
I'm just giving you an example of how
you would set these properties outside
the class for the actual object so
inside the print function I can now say
echo this name echo this price and echo
this photo actually this directory first
and then this photo
okay at this point let's see what
happens here if I call that method
outside the class game dart print game
should output some information yeah okay
so it's printing out all that
information but let me just define a
constant that I usually define called BR
and it's just going to have a be our
HTML tag in it now for the constants
it's a little different we don't use
that this keyword and a dart object
operator instead we do this we do self
and then double colon and then the
constant name so there's just a
different way to access the constants
within the class
okay so okay concatenate okay so now you
can clearly see how all those properties
values that I've set outside of the
class I've been printed out within this
function that I also called outside the
class using our object named game okay
so that's that's how that works this is
a classes and objects now if we wanted
to let's see well first of all let's
format this a little bit better and I've
already have this code prepared here so
I'm just going to paste that and okay so
what's happening here is I just pretty
much use the same thing but as you can
see if we are going to be accessing
property names if we're going to be
using properties inside double quotes we
got to use the curly brackets so
otherwise you have to use concatenation
and here for the image first accessing
the directory which is the games here
and then I'm following that by the photo
which is bias
by shark - infinite dot jpg and that
makes up the directory name and also
followed by follow that by the constant
and at the end I have a dollar sign and
the price of the game and and the div
with the ending div tag and that prints
out our first game so that's a pretty
cool way to just access the reason I
wanted to show you this is because I
just want you to understand that class
works as a template and outside of the
template we have the actual object which
is like the real thing in the real world
so if the game is a template then
Bioshock is the actual game that lives
inside the real world that people can
actually people can actually play that
has a name price and photo and all the
good stuff all right so if we kept going
here and create it on another game for
example let's do the witcher 3 all we're
doing is we're just using the same
object name but we're setting different
values for our new game now and see
photo equals the witcher 3 jpg is where
the image is located and then use the
same method to print out new information
and our new game has been printed out to
the screen as well so all I did here as
you can see it we did have to
instantiate a new object we use the same
game object we just change the property
names to new values and then we call the
print gain function to print all that
good stuff back to the screen now one
last thing that I want to show you guys
is is what it what's called a setter
function so we can keep going and just
create different values for for our new
games but we can also shorten this code
by setting all these variables basically
automatically
so let me show you an example of that
public function set game and then the
game is going to take this function set
game is going to take in three arguments
name price and photo and I'm going to
set all these properties inside this
function by using this and object
operator and setting them to the actual
to the actual values provided so this
way is just going to shorten our code
which this if I now do game and then set
game so use that method and I set the
new game name to overwatch price is
going to be 40 499 and the image is
going to be overage that JPEG so now
what it does is calls this method set
game and then it sets all these
properties for us so we'd have to do
this outside of the object so you can
see how you can do the setting inside
the class itself as well as outside so
it's it's just like a different way of
setting your properties within the class
as well as outside of class and then if
we print the game now it's printing our
game overwatch and all of our games are
being printed out so that's it for this
video on PHP classes and objects if you
guys found a useful please like share
