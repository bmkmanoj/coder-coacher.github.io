50 flowers of a certain species here is
the e CDF from those measurements from
what you have learned you can compute
the mean of those 50 measurements and
I'll annotate it on the e CDF with a
vertical line that is useful but there
are millions of these flowers on the
planet can you tell me the mean petal
length of all of the flowers of that
species if I measure another 50 flowers
I get a similar but quantitatively
different set of measurements can you
tell me what value I would get for the
mean petal length if I measured yet
another 50 flowers we just don't have
the language to do that without
probability probabilistic reasoning
allows us to describe uncertainty so you
can't tell me exactly what the mean of
the next 50 petal links you measure will
be you could say that it is more
probable to be close to what you got in
the first 50 measurements than it is to
be much greater we can go ahead and
repeat the measurements over and over
again we see from the vertical lines
that we expect the mean to be somewhere
between 4.5 and 5 centimeters this is
what probabilistic thinking is all about
given a set of data you describe
probabilistically what you might expect
if those data were acquired again and
again and again and again this is the
heart of statistical inference it is the
process by which we go from measured
data to probabilistic conclusions about
what we might expect if we collected the
same data again your data speak in the
language of probability let's do a few
exercises exploring these ideas and then
we'll come back and learn how to start
speaking this probabilistic language</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
