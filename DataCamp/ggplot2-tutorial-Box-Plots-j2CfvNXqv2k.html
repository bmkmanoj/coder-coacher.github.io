first class of specialized plots what I
like to call statistical plots actually
all the plots we've made so far can be
called statistical plots since data
visualization operates at the
intersection of design and statistics
however in contrast to the plots we've
seen previously these are more well
suited to an academic audience we're
going to look at two very common plot
types for visualizing the distribution
of continuous data box plots and density
plots we returned to box plots in the
case study where we develop a new
statistics layer to produce a two
dimensional box plot box plots were
bridging described by John Tukey in his
1977 classic text exploratory data
analysis so actually they are not that
old he described them as a way to
visualize the so called five-number
summary let's begin with the continuous
variable typical descriptive statistics
for the location and spread are the mean
and standard deviation as shown here
this is okay if our data is normally
distributed which we dealt with in the
best practices chapter of the last
course recall that the mean and standard
deviation may not be the best
representation of the data in particular
if we have extreme values that result in
a skewed distribution that's because the
mean and standard deviation are not
robust so they'll be influenced by
extreme values an alternative robust
system describes the minimum the first
second and third quartiles and the
maximum thus the five-number summary
here the measurement of location and
spread is the median which is the second
quartile and the interquartile range
that is the IQR which is the difference
between the third and the first
quartiles this is what is shown in a box
plot which you can think of as a robust
equivalent of showing the mean and a
standard deviation the difference is
that here are some we consist of five
values so we get a better impression of
the distribution of the data set we get
an impression of the skew because each
of the four segments the two outer
whiskers and the two parts of the inner
box reflect 25% of the data there is a
further subtle point two box plots and
that is the ability to show extreme
values as distinct features an extreme
value is defined as poly
outside the range 1.5 times the IQR
either below q1 or above q3 this is
called the fence and is shown here as a
dotted blue line this is one definition
of an extreme value we can also change
this threshold although typically there
is no reason to do so however you should
be aware that the fences can be adjusted
and the default also depends on the
software to understand how the fence
works we'll use the same data set we've
been working on so far but we'll pull
the maximum value colored as a blue dot
on our dot plot here further and further
away from a starting position causing
the data set to slowly become positively
skewed any value that surpasses the
fence will be drawn as a daunt the box
plot is also updated the whisker is
drawn up to the highest observation
within the fence
it doesn't matter how many values are
outside the fence or how far away they
are they all get represented as dots the
whiskers never extend beyond the fence
if you're not clear about how the plot
is drawn you can actually get a very
wrong view of the data distribution many
people who commonly use or encounter box
plots are not aware that the mid line is
the median and not the mean no are they
aware that the dots represent extreme
values that are part of the data and
therefore should not be disregarded so
use these plots with caution
ok let's take a look at the box plot
genome and ggplot2 and some other
problems you may encounter with box
plots in the exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
