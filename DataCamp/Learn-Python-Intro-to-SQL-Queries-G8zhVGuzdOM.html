do anything within the database it can
select data insert new data update
existing data and delete it it can also
be used to create alter and delete
tables and columns the first sequel
statement we'll learn is the Select
statement which provides the basic
method of extracting information from
your database the general syntax of a
select statement is select columns from
tables with conditions for example we
can select the pop 2008 column from the
people table we can also select all the
columns from the people table with an
asterisk let's execute this last query
we'll begin by importing create engine
and creating an engine next we'll
establish a connection by using the
connect method on the engine then we can
define our select statement and pass it
to the execute method of the connection
this gives us an object that we can use
to fetch the results which will be
assigning to the variable results proxy
then we can tell results proxy to fetch
all of the results via the fetch all
method now results will contain all of
the data from our people table let's
pause for just a moment and look at the
object that the execute method gave us
that object is called a result proxy and
could be used in a variety of different
ways to get the data returned by our
query when we use a fetch method such as
special on a result proxy we get a
result set that contains the actual data
we asked for in the query this
separation between the result proxy and
the result set allows us to fetch as
much or as little data as we desire and
we'll explore this more in a later
section let's learn how to work with a
result set in this example we're using
the results from the prior query we'll
start by getting the first row the
results by using an index of zero by
printing the first row we can see the
data it contains if we want to know what
columns are in the row we can find out
by using the keys method finally we
print the value of the state column from
the first row by using the column name
as an attribute on the row object in the
prior query example we wrote a normal
sequel statement as a string
however manipulating a string to build
more complex statements can be very
overwhelming the beauty of sequel
alchemy is that allows us to assemble
these complex statements in a pythonic
way pythonic refers to code that adheres
to the idioms of pythons common
guidelines and expresses its extent in a
highly readable manner
sequel alchemy also hides the difference
between database types so that we can
focus on the data we want to work with
instead of the differences we might
encounter in each database table let's
rebuild the same query using seaguar
kamee the first three steps of creating
an engine and establishing a connection
will be the same after that we need to
initialize our metadata and reflect the
table as we did in the previous section
then in line 7 we build our select
statement now hang tight we'll talk more
about this in a second finally we
execute the statement and fetch all the
results the sequel alchemy Select
statement works the same as a sequel
select statement and in its most basic
form takes a list of column or table
objects for example statement equals
Select list of census will select all of
the columns of all of the rows in the
census table sequel alchemy generates
the same sequel statement we wrote by
hand we can see that by using the print
function on the statement which outputs
select star from census now it's your
turn to write several sequel queries
both is raw sequel and in the more
pythonic way using sequel alchemy will
be continuing to use the US Census
database let's practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
