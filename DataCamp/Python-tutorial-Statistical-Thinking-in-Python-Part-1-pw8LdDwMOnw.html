thinking in Python you will learn
powerful concepts and tools to help you
get the most out of your data my name is
Justin boyce and I am a lecturer in the
division of biology and biological
engineering at the California Institute
of Technology I am dedicated to
empowering students and researchers in
the biological sciences with
quantitative tools particularly data
analysis skills the end goal of the
analysis of a data set is to be able to
draw conclusion to make judgments based
on the data this is the realm of
statistical inference thus any data
scientist must have a strong statistical
grounding to get the most out of their
data they also must have a computational
framework to do the statistics ours is
Python based in this course and its
sequel you will learn the relevant
conceptual and computational tools to
have that grounding you will learn the
basics of exploratory data analysis also
called EDA you will learn to plot your
data in instructive ways using Python
and how to interpret such plots you will
also learn how to use a variety of
summary statistics to make sense of and
communicate meaningful information about
your data we will wrap up by working
with probability distributions how they
arise from stories that occur in the
real world and you will come out being
able to simulate stories in their
distributions using hacker statistics in
the sequel to this course you will apply
all of these new techniques to parameter
estimation linear regression and
hypothesis testing the sequel culminates
with you using your newly learned Python
based tools to do your own analysis on a
real data set of scientific pertinence
you will analyze actual measurements of
the beaks of darwin's finches from the
Galapagos I'll see you in the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
