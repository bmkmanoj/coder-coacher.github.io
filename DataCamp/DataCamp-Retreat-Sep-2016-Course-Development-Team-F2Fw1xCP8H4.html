development team here at data camp I'm
Laura I'm a course developer at data
chem my name is hugo van anderson and i
engineer the python curriculum at data
camp a top counter would want to work
for data camp for a number of reasons
first is the ability to work with
state-of-the-art instructors and
developers on communicating data science
and development issues that they're
incredibly passionate about our team
builds great data science courses with
the best instructors in the world it's
literally my job to talk with the best
minds in data science the best minds in
the art community for me this is kind of
a dream job a typical day for me starts
out with me jumping out of bed excited
to do what what I'm going to do the
first few months working at data camp
were mostly about creating my own course
so you pick a topic that you're already
passionate about that ideally fills a
gap in our curriculum so that's a really
great way to get up to speed with the
course development process to learn all
about the different tools that we use to
build courses so what I do now basically
is get in touch with the best
instructors in the field and guide them
to the course creation process we agree
on of course I would like to know what
will be covered in the course then the
next step is creating the exercises for
the course which is the exercises you
can see in our platform and the last
part in the process is basically
recording the videos in our recording
studio I decided to work for data camp
because I was already deeply invested in
educating scientists in with respect to
data analysis and statistical methods
you create a course and you get a lot of
emails about what we can do better what
everyone likes about data camp reaching
over half a million people already and
Counting is incredibly attractive I
wanted to work the data camp for a while
so I applied and I got the job although
there were a lot of online learning
companies focused on programming but
data comes the real deal for data
science we're an early-stage startup
we're growing quickly the future is is
quite promising the data camp culture is
is fantastic I didn't I I constantly
look forward to working with a bunch of
interesting curious and slightly odd
people being a course developer at data
camp requires you to
of your finger on the pulse of the data
science community constantly it really
pushes you to not only be strong
technically but to build a really strong
network within the data science are in
Python communities what we're looking
for is people who are excited about the
data science space who have that
technical background but also a passion
for teaching and a passion for
connecting with other people in the
community if you want to work as a data
scientist in the future you're
definitely getting involved in all all
aspects that can push you in that
direction our aspiration is to be the
best possible place to learn data
science online what that means is having
not tens or hundreds but thousands of
data science courses you're not going to
be short of work anytime soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
