customize plots in our that's already
pretty nice however you might have
noticed that all these examples were
limited to the plotting of a single
source of data for example the histogram
of a data frame column or a scatter plot
of two variables but what about a
histogram next to a box plots in the
same graphical window or a scatter plot
with a linear regression line on top of
that in this last video I'll give you a
sneak peek into all the possibilities to
create multiple plots or to add more
information to your plots we'll be
working with the shop data sets it
contains 27 observations of a company's
sales figures in relation to the amount
of money spent on advertising the number
of nearby competitors the current
inventory and the overall size of the
districts have a look at the structure
suppose now that you want to get a first
idea of the correlation between the net
sales in the sales column and the other
four variables adds comp in and size
list we could build four separate plots
but it can be a good idea to create a
grid of plots to compare the
correlations more easily the easiest way
to do this is by specifying the
graphical parameter MF row with the bar
function remember from before that you
could use the bar function to list all
the graphical parameters like this but
you can also use it to set graphical
parameters let's set the MF row
parameter to a vector containing two
times two to tell our that you want to
build four subplots on a 2x2 grid
nothing really happens it'll become
clear once you start building some plot
stone let's start with net sales versus
ad spending the plot shows up in the top
left corner if you now also plot sales
versus scrump
it appears next to it adding the third
plot to relation with the inventory and
the fourth plot that shows the relation
with the size of the district we end up
with four figures you saw here that the
plots got added in a row wise fashion if
you instead specify the graphical
parameter MF goal and set of MF row with
the same specification
and do the four bolts again one by one
you'll see that the graphs are edits in
a column wise fashion
this vector C 2 2 denotes that you want
to have a layout of 2 rows and 2 columns
in this order to reset the graphical
parameters such that our plots a single
figure per layout you can set either MF
row or MF goal to a vector that denotes
that you want to one by one grid if you
now plot something again it looks like
it did before
apart from specifying the MF row or MF
call parameters using the bar function
there's also the layout function that
allows you to specify more complex plot
arrangements this function expects a
matrix in which you specify the location
of the figures on the output device have
a look at this matrix grid that
specifies locations that three figures
can take if you pass this matrix to the
layout function and do three plot calls
afterwards you'll see that the first
figure spans the entire width of the
first row of the layout you can go
pretty far with customizing your layouts
but that's something for more advanced
visualization courses to reset this
layout you can simply call this command
to specify a one by one layout or you
can again use the MF goal or MF row
parameters to reset the grid resetting
this layout afterwards every time you
have been adapting the graphical
parameters can be quite tedious another
of an easier way is to copy the old
graphical parameters to a new variable
first like this if you then do your
customization for example setting the
overall color to red and make a plot you
can easily clean up afterwards by
restoring the old graphical parameters
if you now do the same plot again the
red color is gone apart from building
layouts to show different plots next to
each other you can also choose to stack
different graphical elements on top of
each other as if you are adding layers
to the same plot let's see how this
works for an example let's first try to
plot the sales versus the advertisement
spending with some basic customization
can you still tell what the meaning is
of all these different parameters next
let's try to build a model that model
sales based on advertising
spending with the LM function the LM
function returns in a lamp object which
contains the coefficients of the line
representing the linear fit you can now
use these coefficients to plot a
straight line on the plot the a blind
function helps us out this function can
take the coefficients of a straight line
as a vector or a separate values the lvd
arguments stands for line width here
instead of building a new plot with
simply align the previous products kept
and the straight lines added to the plot
this is a great way of adding more
information to your plot next to AB line
you can also use functions like points
segments lines and text to supercharge
your plots you'll learn all about them
in the exercises most of them work out
of the box only for the lines function
it's important that you pass the data
points in the right order if we simply
use lines on the ads and sales columns
the lines connecting the points will be
all over the place
you have to use the order function to
get a ranks vector just like you did to
order data frames if you now rebuilt the
plots with the AB line and the lines
function that uses reshuffle data points
it looks much better
notice from this last example that once
you add something to your plots such as
the mess of lines going from left to
right you cannot remove it anymore
plotting in our works like painting
things on a canvas you can take it off
again if you want to remove elements
you'll have to start over with a block
generating function like plots and
generally add more layers to it with the
functions I've just introduced with this
new knowledge on how to build multiple
plots on a grid as well as to add
different layers to the same plot a
thinker totally ready for the final set
of exercises of this introduction to our
course thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
