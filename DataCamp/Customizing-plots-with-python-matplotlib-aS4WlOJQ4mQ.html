correct plot that makes the message very
clear that's the real challenge for each
visualization you have many options
first of all there are different blood
types and for each plot you can do an
infinite number of customizations you
can change colors shapes labels axis and
so on the choice depends on one the data
and to the story you want to tell with
this data since there are so many
possible customizations the best way to
learn this is by example let's start
with the code in this script to build a
simple line plot it's similar to the
line pot we've created in the first
video but this time the year and pop
lists contain more data including
projections until the year 2100
forecasted by the United Nations if we
run the script we already got a pretty
nice plot it shows its population
explosion that's going on will have
slowed down by the end of the century
but some things can be improved first it
should be clear which data we are
displaying especially to people who are
seeing the graph for the first time and
second the plot really needs to draw the
attention to the population explosion
the first thing you always need to do is
to label your axis let's do this by
adding the X label and Y label functions
as inputs we passed rings that should be
placed alongside t axis make sure to
call these functions before calling the
show function otherwise your
customizations will not be displayed if
you run the script again this time the
X's are annotated great we're also going
to add a title to our plot with the
title function we pass the actual title
role population projections as an
argument and there's a title so using X
label while a blunt title we can give
the reader more information about the
data on the plot now they can at least
tell what the plot is about to put the
population growth in perspective I want
to have the y axis start from zero you
can do this with a white text function
the first input is a list in this
example with the number zero up to ten
with intervals of two if we run this the
plot will change the curve shifts up now
it's clear that in 1950 there were
already about 2.5 billion people on this
planet next to make it clear we're
talking about billions we can add a
second
argument to the white dicks function
which is a list with the display names
of the ticks this list should have the
same length as a first list the ticks
zero gets the name zero to take two gets
name to be to take four gets a name for
B and so on by the way B stands for
billions here if we run this version of
the script the labels will change
accordingly awesome finally let's add
some more historical data to accentuates
population explosion in the last 60
years
on Wikipedia I found a real population
data for the years 1800s 1850 and 1900 I
can write them in list form and append
them to the pub and year lists with the
plus sign if I now run the script once
more three data points are added to the
graph giving a more complete picture now
that's how we turn an average line plot
into a visual that has a clear story to
tell over to you now head over to the
exercises gradually customized World
Development bubble charts and become the
next Hance rustling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
