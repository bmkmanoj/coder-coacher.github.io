visualization with ggplot2 my name is
Rick Aveda and I'll be the instructor
for the series for the past four years
I've been training scientists in a
variety of subjects plans on how to
better understand and use visualizations
and I'm very excited to provide this
course at data camp so what is data base
data visualization is an essential
component of your skill set as a data
scientist
DataViz is statistics and design
combined in meaningful and appropriate
ways that means that on the one hand
data vis is a form of graphical data
analysis emphasizing accurate
representation and interpretation of
data but on the other hand data base
relies on good design principles to not
only make our plots attractive but also
meaningful by meaningful I mean that
good design aids in both the
understanding and communication of
results on top of that there's an
element of creativity since at its heart
data base is a form of visual
communication it's important to
understand the distinction between
exploratory and explanatory plots
exploratory visualizations are easily
generated data heavy and intended for a
small specialist audience for example
yourself or your colleagues their
primary purpose is graphical data
analysis explanatory visualizations are
labor-intensive data specific and
intended for a broader audience
for example publications or
presentations they are part of the
communications process as a data analyst
your job involves exploring your data
but also explaining it to a specific
audience good design begins with
thinking about the audience sometimes
that just means ourselves let's go
through a short example consider this
data set containing the average brain
and body waves of 62 land mammals from
the mass package we're interested in
looking at the relationship between
these two continuous variables so the
most obvious first step is to make a
scatter plot like this one so we begin
to explore our data which reveals an
expected positive skew on both axes this
isn't surprising since there are two
mammals the African and Asian elephants
with both very large brain and body
weights we can extend our plot by
applying a linear
model but given the nature of the data
you can probably already imagine that
this is a pretty poor model because a
few extreme values have a large
influence a long transformation of both
variables allows for a better fit
although we began with a rough
exploratory plot that informed us about
our data and led to a meaningful results
now we're ready to share our results as
an explanatory plot don't worry if you
don't understand all this code at the
moment by the end of the series
we'll have covered all the concepts used
here another example of the usefulness
of data visualization as a data analysis
tool is this classic example from
Princess Anne's comb first published in
1973 when we imagine a linear model as
presented on the synonymous of plot we
imagine that we are describing data that
looks something like this which would be
a fairly accurate representation however
the same model could be describing a
very different data set for example
showing a parabolic relationship where
this model would be much better suited
to the data at hand or it may be
describing data in which an extreme
value has a large effect which becomes
clear when the outlier is removed and
sometimes the mall may be described in a
relationship where in fact there is none
at all because of some obscure extreme
value which may very well be false here
for different data sets are described by
the same linear model if we relied
solely on the numerical output without
plot in our data we'd have missed
distinct and interesting underlying
trends these examples should give you an
idea of what we set out to do with
visualizations although it's clearly
based on statistics and graphical data
analysis visualization is a creative
process that involves some amount of
trial and error in this series of
courses we're going to see some familiar
data sets such as the classic iris data
set we're going to understand how to
Explorer data from many different
perspectives and use visual tools like
color appropriately
we'll also understand how the structure
of our data helps us to make meaningful
comparisons we'll also use a variety of
data sets built into our such as the
vocab data frame in the car package to
understand common pitfalls and best
practices such
as what is the best pont type for
accurately representing the nature of
our data once we have a solid
understanding of these concepts we're
going to go through a case study using
the California Health Interview Survey
these are some examples of the pots
we'll make at the end of the second
course using this population health data
I hope this introduction has shown you
that database is not just about making
pretty plots but that it is an integral
part of your skill set as a data
scientist
we'll cover database in detail from a
theoretical and practical perspective in
three courses the focus will be on the
grammar of graphics as implemented by
the ggplot2 package
alright let's review these concepts in
the next exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
