scientist a data camp and today we're in
the recording studio with David Stouffer
welcome glad we recorded a course on
ARIMA modeling with our today so another
time series course I think it's going to
be great we're very excited about this
and since you're here today I thought I
could ask you a couple of questions that
our users might be interested in so
maybe the first thing I would ask you is
for the people that don't know you it
would be good if you just give a short
introduction on who you are and what you
do okay so I'm a professor of statistics
at the University of Pittsburgh I'm the
editor or co-editor of a few journals
one on time series analysis one Journal
of forecasting the annals of the
Institute of statistical mathematics and
maybe something else I remember okay so
I spread myself in on that and then I
have two books on time series one
nonlinear and one on nonlinear so the
course is based on the linear book okay
well yeah I'll ask you more about the
book later but maybe a good question
next is how so how did you get into
statistics like how did you start okay
so as an undergraduate I was a math
major and the requirement was that you
had to have a long sequence and one
thing you had to specialize in one thing
that's like analysis or differential
equations and just by chance I chose
statistics because it was available in
convenient and it's true
so then the professor came in there was
like the second course in time series
that the professor came in there were 10
people in class when he came in he
kicked the the trashcan across the room
and started teaching like way over our
head okay so the next class there were
only two people left so then me and this
other guy and so then we change the time
of the course
and we sat in his office and he taught
statistics and that was completely over
my head and I said I don't understand
this and he goes well you've had linear
algebra and calculus right and I said
yeah and he goes then you can understand
it and so and then actually I started to
that's how I got so basically he taught
over our heads okay and that's how I got
is justice that's because I liked it
okay Ken turns ooh that's actually the
way I teach now but I'll tell anybody
that I teach over your head you have to
come up okay good so so okay or
obviously so I mean very much into
statistics so why did you decide to
create this course for data camp well it
seemed like a good opportunity to know I
so I got this call from and a very nice
person and she said would you like to
create this data campus and I thought oh
that would be nice okay great well well
happy to hear because the more people
that know top stories the better that's
true more books also that's true that's
true
so okay in fact about the book so you
wrote the book time series analysis and
it's applications with our examples so
what triggered you to write this book
and what King a little bit can you tell
us a little bit more about about your
book so that that book there was a bob
Shumway already had a text on time
series and he was asked to revise it and
he couldn't do it okay and so he asked
me if I wanted to and I said okay I'll
try so that's how it started so our
collaboration started that way okay so
the original Shumway book already have
the are examples oh no no that was like
before maybe just at the time when
people had like basic IBM pcs like 80s
or even XPS on their desktop with
blobbies no hard drive okay so that book
had an IBM so on the book on the front
it says IBM disk included they even
floppies were called IBM
yeah yeah and then and so he wrote it in
what's it called dish wait what's a I
forgot what the Microsoft Visual Studio
it was bit like basic
okay now coding okay okay and so now
there was no hard there was no s+
nothing like that okay we've been be MVP
I think that's what people use that's
not even around anymore I don't think
from UCLA okay yeah that didn't laughs I
think fath sorted yeah okay okay so I
sued them okay so you did a
collaboration with Bob some way who were
other good mentors for you or and what
were two qualities of these people so I
like people who could sing really well
and what's he super and the nd dad now
in statistics or fish or related fee
hominid people yeah so so bob was a good
mentor the thing that I liked about Bob
was he always had these great problems
so he worked he did a lot of consulting
and had these incredible problems that
were difficult to solve so that sort of
showed me that you can't just be alone
and think up the problems you have to go
out and you know see what people are
doing and then the problem sort of comes
out all right all right so very applied
well or start from an application right
and then rather than you thinking of a
message being that what people come to
you and ask you questions okay okay um
so would you told us about the other
programming languages so how did you get
into our so why did you choose because
you is that you collaborated on the book
and then you included the our example so
why did you choose our um I'm so people
were using most people were using s plus
and then about that time s plus was not
free it splits bought out by a
Bini and you know they were charging a
lot of money and our was new so it was
just sort of a natural okay I'm an
extension to you for okay well yeah
makes make sense so I think my final
question to you would be what would you
advise aspiring well statisticians or
what advice you have for people just
starting to learn well maybe in
particular time series analysis so I
think that the best thing is to have a
good math background to know the
calculus to know some differential
equations and know complex analysis
things like that it makes it a lot
easier because time series is is
stochastic processes so you have to know
about you know stationarity and things
like that
second-order processes and maybe a
little bit of stochastic calculus so
that kind of helps I think a math good
math background is what you did okay
good well thank you very much Arthur in
the Graduate oh thank you for being here
thank you guys bye bye kids</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
