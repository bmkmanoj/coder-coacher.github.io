from all sorts of file types flat files
such as txt s and CS fees other file
types such as pickled files Excel
spreadsheets and MATLAB files you've
also gained valuable experience in
querying relational databases to import
data from them using sequel you've
really come a long way congratulations
however all of these skills involve
importing data from files that you have
locally much of the time as a data
scientist these skills won't be quite
enough because you won't always have the
data that you need you'll need to import
it from the World Wide Web say for
example you want to import the wine
quality data set from the machine
learning repository hosted by the
University of California Irvine how do
you get this file from the web now you
could use your favorite web browser to
navigate to the relevant URL point and
click on the appropriate hyperlinks to
download the file
but this poses a couple of serious
problems firstly it isn't written in
code and so imposes reproducibility
issues if another data scientist wanted
to reproduce your workflow she would
necessarily have to do so outside Python
secondly it is not scalable if you
wanted to download 100 or 1000 such
files it would take 100 or 1000 times as
long respectively whereas if you wrote
it in code your workflow could scale as
reproducibility and scalability are
situated at the very heart of data
science you're going to learn in this
chapter how to use Python code to import
and locally save datasets from the World
Wide Web you'll also learn how to load
such data sets into pandas dataframes
directly from the web whether they be
flat files or otherwise then you'll
place these skills in the wider context
of making HTTP requests in particular
you'll make HTTP GET requests which in
plain english means getting data from
the web
you'll use these new request skills to
learn the basics of scraping HTML from
the internet and you'll use the
wonderful Python package beautifulsoup
to parse the HTML and turn it into data
now there are a number of great packages
to help us import web data herein you'll
become familiar with the URL Lib and
request packages will first check out
URL Lib this module provides a high
level interface for fetching data across
the world wide web in particular the URL
open function is similar to the built-in
function open but accepts universe saw
Resource locators URLs instead of
filenames
let's now dive directly into importing
data from the web with an example
importing the wine quality data set for
white wine don't get jealous in the
first interactive exercise it will be
your job to import the red wine data set
all we have done here is imported a
function called URL retrieve from the
request sub package of the URL Lib
package we assign the relevant URL as a
string to the variable URL we then use
the URL retrieve function to write the
contents of the URL to a file wine
quality white dot CSV that's it now it's
your turn to do the same but for red
wine in the following interactive
exercises you'll also figure out how to
use pandas to load the contents of web
files directly into pandas dataframes
without first having to save them
locally happy hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
