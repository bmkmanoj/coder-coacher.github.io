function behaves differently for
different types of input for example if
you pass it a logical vector it returns
the number of occurrences of Drew's
falses and na s in the input by contrast
if you pass a numeric vector you get the
mean and some quartiles having different
behaviors for functions under different
kinds of input is called function
overloading its main purpose is to
simplify your code if there was no such
thing as function overloading then there
will be a lot more functions to learn
yes three system exists entirely to make
this problem easier it does this by
splitting a function into two parts a
generic function and method functions
for each class summary is an example of
their generic and another widely used
generic function is print the print
function controls how variables are
displayed in the console let's take a
look at the code for the generic print
function as you can see print is really
simple it's only one line long this is
typical for an s3 generic all the
function needs to do is call use method
with its own name that is print is
passed to use method as a string there
are two conditions that you must follow
for s3 methods
firstly the name of each method must be
the name of the generic than a dot then
the name of the class of variable for
example the print method for data object
is called print date likewise the
summary method for factoring X is called
summary dot factor and the unique method
for arrays is called unique dot array
secondly the arguments to the method
must include all the arguments to the
generic for example the arguments to
print are X and the ellipsis or dot
argument
the arguments to print date are the
arguments to the generic with an extra
max argument the ellipsis argument
allows other arguments to be passed from
one method to another a full
understanding of how it works is beyond
the scope of the course for now you just
need to know that is good practice to
always include an ellipsis argument in
both feed generic and the methods all
the methods corresponding to a generic
are completely independent for example
here's the code to print dot function
you don't need to worry about what it
does and here's the code for print date
as you can see it's completely unrelated
because s 3 requires dot to separate the
name of the generic and the class of the
input it's usually a bad idea to include
other dots in the names of your variable
verbal names separated by dots are
sometimes called leopard case don't use
this naming convention better
conventions are lower snake case which
uses low case words separated by
underscores or lower camel case where
the first word is lowercase and
subsequent words start with a capital
letter
to summarize s3 classes let you overload
functions by splitting them into
generics and methods s3 works by
defining a strict naming convention of
generic dot class the arguments to each
method must contain the arguments to the
generic and both generic and method
should include a dot argument it's
usually better to avoid having a dot in
the name of your functions lowest mate
case or lower camel case are preferable
now let's try some examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
