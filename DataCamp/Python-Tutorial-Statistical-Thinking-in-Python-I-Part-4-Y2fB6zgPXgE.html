probabilities of discrete quantities
such as die rolls and number of bus
arrivals but what about continuous
quantities a continuous quantity can
take on any value not just discrete ones
for example the speed of a train can be
forty five point seven six kilometers
per hour continuous variables also have
probability distributions let's consider
an example in 1879 Albert Michelson
performed 100 measurements of the speed
of light in air each measurement had
associated some error with it conditions
such as temperature humidity alignment
of his op dates etc change from
experiment to experiment as a result any
fractional value of the measured speed
of light is possible so it is apt to
describe the results with a continuous
probability distribution and looking at
mikaelsons numbers shown here in units
of mega m/s or thousands of kilometers
per second we see that this is indeed
the case what probability distribution
describes these data I posit that these
data follow the famous normal
distribution to understand what the
normal distribution is let's consider
its probability density function or PDF
this is the continuous analogue to the
probability mass function the PMF it
describes the chances of observing a
value of a continuous variable the
probability of observing a single value
of the speed of light does not make
sense because there is an infinity of
numbers say between two hundred ninety
nine point six and three hundred point O
mega meters per second instead areas
under the PDF give probabilities so the
probability of measuring that the speed
of light is greater than 300,000
kilometers per second is an area under
the normal curve parameterizing the PDF
based on mikaelsons experiments this is
about a three percent chance since the
pink region is about three percent of
the total area under the PDF to do this
calculation we were really just looking
at the cumulative distribution function
or CDF of the normal distribution here
is the CDF of the normal to
tribution remember that the cdf gives
the probability the measured speed of
light will be less than the value on the
x-axis so reading off the value at
300,000 kilometers per second we see
that there is a 97% chance that a speed
of light measurement is less than that
so there's about a three percent chance
that it is greater we will study the
normal distribution in more depth than
coming exercises but for now let's
review some of the concepts we've
learned about continuous distribution
