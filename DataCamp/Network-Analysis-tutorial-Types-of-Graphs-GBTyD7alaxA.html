little bit deeper into the network X API
and introduce a few more concepts that
you can use in network analysis Network
X allows us to model different types of
graphs for example there are social
graphs like Facebook which are
undirected graphs undirected graphs are
named as such because they are comprised
of edges that don't have any inherent
directionality associated with them with
Facebook for example when one user
befriends another the two are
automatically connected with an edge
this is most commonly drawn as aligned
with no arrows between two circles if we
explore this in the ipython terminal you
can instantiate an empty graph in
network X using an X graph and ask for
its type undirected graphs have the type
graph on the other hand
Twitter's social graph is a directed
Network this is because of the nature of
how users interact with one another
for example one user may follow another
user but that other user may not follow
back as such there's an inherent
directionality associated with the graph
if we explore this in the ipython
terminal you can instantiate an empty
directed graph in network X using and XD
graph if you query for its type it will
return a digraph object we can also have
graphs in which there are multiple edges
permitted between the nodes for example
we may want to model trips between bike
sharing stations each trip may be one
edge between the pair of stations if we
explore this in the ipython terminal we
can likewise instantiate a multi graph
using an XML Tigres if we check for its
type it will be of the multi graph class
and likewise for the multi digraph
object sometimes for practical reasons
may be two memory intensive to model
multiple edges per pair of nodes and so
one may choose to collapse the edges
into a single edge that contains a
metadata summary of the original
for example we may want to collapse
these three edges into a single one and
give them a weight metadata with the
value three indicating that it was
originally three edges between the pair
of nodes let's go through one final
concept the idea of self loops self
loops can be used in certain scenarios
such as in bike sharing data where trip
begins at a station and ends at the same
station one of the exercises you will
encounter will leverage what you've
learned so far about the network X API
to find edges that are self loops in a
graph alright let's move on to the
exercises now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
