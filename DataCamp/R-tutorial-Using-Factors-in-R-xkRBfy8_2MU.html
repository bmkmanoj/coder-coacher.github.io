statistics you'll have heard about
categorical variables
unlike numerical variables categorical
variables can only take up a limited
number of different values otherwise
puts a categorical variable can only
belong to a limited number of categories
as ours does distich of programming
language it's not a surprise that there
exists a specific data structure for
this to factor if you store categorical
data as factors you can rest assured
that all the statistical modeling
techniques will handle such data
correctly a good example of a
categorical variable is a person's blood
type it can be a B a B or Oh suppose you
have asked eight people what their blood
type is and record it information as a
vector blood now for art is not yet
clear that you're dealing with
categorical variables or factors here to
convert this factor to a factor you can
use the factor function the printout
looks somewhat different than the
original one there are no double quotes
anymore and also the factor levels or
responding to the different categories
are printed are basically does do things
when you call a factor function on a
character vector first of all it scans
through the vector to see the different
categories that are in there in this
case that's a a B B and O notice here
that are sorts the levels alphabetically
next it converts the character vector
blood in this example to a vector of
integer values these integers correspond
to a set of character values to use when
the factor is displayed inspecting the
structure reveals this we're dealing
with a factor of four levels the A's are
encoded as one because it's the first
level a B is encoded as to be s3 and os4
but why does conversion well it can be
that your categories are very long
character strings each time repeating
the string per observation can take up a
lot of memory by using the simple
encoding much less space is necessary
just remember that factors are actually
integer factors for each integer
corresponds to a category or a level
as I said before are automatically
infers the factor levels from the vector
u passes and order them alphabetically
if you want a different order in the
levels you can specify the levels
argument inside a factor function if you
compare the structures of blood factor
and blood factor to you'll see that the
encoding is different now
next to changing the order of the levels
it's possible to manually specify the
level names instead of letting our
choose them so pause it for clarity you
want to display the blood types as BTA
BTA b bt b and BTO
to name the factor afterwards you can
use the levels function similar to the
names function to name vectors you can
pass a vector to levels blood factor you
can also specify the category names or
levels by specifying the labels argument
inside the factor function I admit it
it's a bit confusing for both of these
approaches it's important to follow the
same order as the order of the factor
levels first a then a B then B and then
o but this can be pretty dangerous you
might have mistakenly changed the order
to solve for this you can use the
combination of manually specifying the
levels and label arguments when creating
a factor with levels you specify the
order just like before while with the
labels you specify a new name for the
categories
in the world of categorical variables
there's also a difference between
nominal categorical variables and
ordinal categorical variables the
nominal categorical variables have no
implied order for example you can't
really say that the blood type O is
greater or less than the blood type a oh
it's not worth more than a in any sense
I can think of trying such a comparison
which factors will generate a warning
telling you that less than is not
meaningful however there are examples
for which such a natural ordering does
exist consider for example this t-shirt
vector it has goats ranging from small
to large here you could say that a large
indeed is greater than small for example
right of course our provides a way to
impose this kind of order on a factor
thus making it an order to factor inside
a factor function you simply set the
argument ordered to true and specify the
levels in ascending order can you see
how this less than signs appear between
the different factor levels this
compactly shows that we're dealing with
an ordered factor now if we now try to
perform a comparison this call for
example we see that it evaluates to true
without a warning message this time
because a medium was specified to be
less than a large before you can start
with the exercises let's shortly wrap up
on factors first of all factors are used
to store categorical variables in our
seconds these factors are simply integer
vectors that affect our levels
associated third you can change the
factor levels using the levels function
or by using the labels arguments inside
the factor function and last but not
least our allows you to make a
difference between orders and unordered
factors thus catering to both nominal
and ordinal variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
