extra features recall that the original
microwave from the last chapter had four
pieces of functionality you could open
and close the door
set the power level and cook some food
this fancy microwave has all of the
functionality of the original microwave
but it also has buttons to cook
beverages pizza or baked potatoes if you
wanted to find in our six class for the
fancy microwave you could just copy and
paste the definition from the original
microwave and then start adding new
features
unfortunately copying and pasting is a
really big source of bugs and is usually
a sign that you're writing bad code if
you change the definition of the
original microwave you really want a way
for those changes to be automatically
mirrored in the fancy microwave our six
achieves this through the concept of
inheritance let's take a look at how it
works
here's the pattern for an our six class
to create a class that inherits from
this class you use the inherit argument
the classes that inherit from the
original are called child classes the
original class is called the parent of
the child classes here you see a child
thing that inherits from the thin class
all of the data and functionality of the
parent class is passed on to the child
that is all the fields from the private
public and active elements so without
defining anything extra the child thing
already has two private data fields and
a method you can add any additional
functionality that you like to the child
now the child class has everything that
the parent has and an extra method the
important thing to remember is that
inheritance only works in one direction
if you're a parent this will probably
sound familiar
children take everything from their
parent but
doesn't get anything back when you talk
about the relationship between
microwaves you can say that a fancy
microwave is a microwave but the
converse doesn't hold it wouldn't be
true to say that any microwave is a
fancy microwave this translates in how
into how classes are ascribed to our six
objects the class of thing is a
character vector of thing and our six
that is the thing object inherits from
thing and it inherits from our six the
class of the child thing also includes
child thing to summarize you can
propagate functionality from one class
to another using inheritance this is
achieved by using the inherit argument
of our sixth class the child class gets
all the data fields and functions from
the parent class but the converse is not
true that is the parent class does not
inherit the traits of its child now
let's try some examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
