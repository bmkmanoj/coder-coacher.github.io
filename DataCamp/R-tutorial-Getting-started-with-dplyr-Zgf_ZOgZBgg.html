were sure contains simple insights that
you just couldn't access I'm not talking
about the sorts of information that you
can discover with machine learning or
modeling algorithms just simple things
like new variables summary statistics
group differences and so on
most data sets contain more information
than they display in deep hires a
package that can help you access that
information
deep hire introduces a grammar of data
manipulation five simple functions that
you can use to reveal new variables new
observations in new ways to describe
data you can also use these functions to
subset your data and do group wise
operations and deep liar is fast very
fast the key pieces of deep hire are
written in C++ which means you get the
speed of C with the ease of R this
course will show you how to use deep
hire like an expert you'll learn to use
deep liars grammar of data manipulation
to solve any data related tasks that you
can think of along the way you'll learn
how to think about and manipulate the
structure of data you'll also learn used
appliers table structure and the piping
operator two features that can save you
tons of time you'll even learn how to
use deep hire to access data stored in a
database which provides an easy way to
work with data that is too big to fit in
are all at once with deep hire r is
literally faster bigger and better i'll
be your guide through the deep hire
package my name is Garrett grow Lamond
and I'm a data scientist at our studio I
work closely with Hadley Wickham the
author of deep liar and I spend much of
my time teaching people how to use the
wonderful tools that Hadley makes as
well as the tools that my other
colleagues at our studio make I've asked
Hadley to join us at the end of the
course so if you work your way through
all the exercises you'll have a chance
to hear Hadleys own thoughts on the deep
liar package but before we can do any of
that you'll need to set up your our
session to use deep liar let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
