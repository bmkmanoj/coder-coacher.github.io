the last lecture where we had a hundred
wine experts rate the overall quality of
eight different wines for red wines for
white wines and again higher scores
indicated higher quality now we might
want to ask well which country had the
highest overall wine rating that was
important to us as we were doing this we
wanted to see how this would come out
and just for the record to be clear we
did this completely randomly so my
assisted dahveed who is from France and
I we to be fair we just said let's
generate this completely randomly so
that we're not biased and so that we
don't insult people around the world a
funny thing happened dahveed actually
did this he generated random numbers he
came back to my office with a really sad
look on his face and he said France lost
and we really have to do this randomly
and I said yes we do have to do this
randomly so let's look at the overall
rankings if we just want to look at the
average and let's just stick with the
Reds for now here are the means that we
calculated from the data that we
generated so the mean for the
Argentinian Malbec was sixty six point
seven three the mean for the Australian
Shiraz was eighty one point seven six
the mean for the French red I forget
what the french-fried was was seventy
point nine seven and for USA it was a
Cabernet with seventy six point three
eight so in this simulation Australia
won okay again this was completely
random we did not fix this but how do we
calculate the mean and hopefully this is
review to you but again this is a this
is supposed to be an introduction very
first course in statistics so if you're
not familiar the way we did this is we
we plug the numbers into R but if we
wanted to do this by hand all we would
have to do is take all the ratings from
the 100 wine experts just put them in a
column
some that entire column and then divide
the sum by the number of ratings so
that's the formula right here so it's
the formula for the mean or average is
just the sum of all the scores divided
by the number of scores
okay so just some of X over N is the
mean and these are the means for the red
red wines across those four countries
now let's consider the white wine so
which country won with respect to the
whites again this was totally random
I didn't bias this even though I had a
favorite in the race and that favorite
one so the US the Rieslings from upstate
New York yeah
the camera man's waving yay again this
was not this was not biased this was
totally random just slightly won right
so it would it just slightly beat out
Australia and France for the overall
average ranking but again let's get back
to the topic of this this segment its
measures of central tendency the mean or
average is the most popular measure of
central tendency it's a very common
summary statistic I think most of you
are familiar with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
