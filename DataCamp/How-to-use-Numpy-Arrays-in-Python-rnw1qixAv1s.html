previous video if you ask for the type
of these arrays Python tells you that
your numpy dots and the array numpy dot
tells you it's a type it was defined in
an umpire package and the array stands
for M dimensional array the arrays NP
height and NP weight are one dimensional
arrays but it's perfectly possible to
create two-dimensional three-dimensional
heck even 7 I mention arrays let's stick
to two in this video though you can
create a 2-d numpy array from a regular
Python list of lists let's try to create
one memory for all height and weight
data of your family like this if you
print out an P 2d now you'll see that it
is a rectangular data structure each sub
list in the list corresponds to a row in
a two dimensional number array from MP
2d dot shape you can see that we indeed
have two rows and five columns shape is
a so-called attribute of the NP 2d array
that can give you more information about
what the data structure looks like also
for 2d arrays the number rule applies an
array can only contain a single type if
you change one float to be string all
the array elements will be coercive
strings as well to end up with a
homogeneous array you can think of the
2d numpy array as an improved list of
lists it can perform calculations on
your race like I showed before and you
can do more advanced ways of subsetting
suppose you want the first row and then
the third element in that row you select
a row unique index 0 inside square
brackets to then select the third
element you can extend the same call
with another pair of brackets this time
with the next two like this basically
you're selecting the row and then from
that row do another selection there's
also an alternative way of sub setting
using single square brackets and a comma
this call returns the exact same value
as before the value before the comma
specifies a row the value after the
comma specifies a column the
intersection of the rows and columns you
specified or returned once you get used
to it this syntax is more intuitive and
opens up more possibilities suppose you
want to select a height and weight of
the second and third family member you
want both rows so you put in a column
before the comma you only want the
second and third
column so you put in the indices one two
three after the comma remember that the
third index is not included here the
intersection gives us a 2d array with
two rows and two columns similarly you
can select a weight of all family
members like this you only want the
second row so put one before the comma
you want all columns so you use a colon
after the comma the intersection gives
us the entire second row finally - Dean
umpire race enable you to do element
wise calculations the same way you did
it with one Dean umpire race that's
something you can experiment with in the
exercises along with creating and sub
setting - Dean umpire ease exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
