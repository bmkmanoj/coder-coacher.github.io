graphs that we use in statistics but
they're very useful and very informative
so it's just a type of grass used to
display a distribution so you might
think why start with histograms there
are lots of fancier graphics that we can
start with but a histogram is nice
because it helps us to overcome our
natural tendency to rely on summary
statistics and this is just a natural
thing as an analogy think of just
stereotyping it's very easy to
stereotype individuals who are part of a
group because you can rely on your sort
of summary statistics of that group to
make an inference about an individual
but as we know we shouldn't do that if
we want to get to know individuals
within a group we want to look at the
entire distribution we want to look at
everybody within the group before we
calculate those summary statistics or
jump to those conclusions the summary
conclusions about a group so here's a
quick example of a nice normal
distribution plotted in a histogram so
we're gonna look at a lot of histograms
in this segment and throughout the
course they'll always take on the same
form so on the x-axis I'm plotting
whatever variable it is that I'm looking
at in this case it's the example is body
temperature present measured in degrees
Fahrenheit and on the y-axis all I have
is frequency it's just the number of
people in this distribution in this
sample that have this particular body
temperature so in a second I'll do this
in Celsius because I know we have an
international audience but in in
Fahrenheit normal body temperature is
about 98.6 degrees that's what most
people go with so if you look we're 98.6
degrees is right about
here so yeah it's right about the
average this this group runs a little
hot you might say so that's a nice
normal distribution a characteristic of
a normal distribution is if I wanted to
sort of smooth this I could draw a curve
over it it has this nice bell-shaped
curve to it and the way to spot a normal
distribution is to look for that
signature bell-shaped curve and it's
symmetrical around the mean or around
the average so you can see there's just
a the the number of cases beyond the
mean is about equal to the number of
cases below the mean
so it's symmetrical and has this nice
normal bell-shaped curve here's the same
exact data just plotted in terms of
Celsius so now on the x-axis you see
we're just plotting temperature measured
in degrees Celsius again it's a normal
distribution we did these graphics in R
and you you've seen are a little bit and
are just bins these differently so you
can see the width of these bins are
different and again you can set that if
you remember using the our function hist
and the argument breaks you can change
that if you like but this is just the
same exact data plotted in in Celsius
instead of in Fahrenheit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
