favorite examples I developed last year
because this happened in in New York
City which is where I live and it
happened in professional basketball in
the u.s. in the NBA this is a guy called
Jeremy Lin who was not that big of a
star not a star at all actually he's not
really a top basketball player in the US
but all of a sudden he got the chance to
play for the New York Knicks
so there's Jeremy Lin in Madison Square
Garden
that's right there in the middle of
Manhattan just a couple of blocks from
where I live
so I got caught up in what the media
called linsanity Jeremy Lin suddenly
took the NBA by storm because he started
scoring a lot of points so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna look at Jeremy
Lin's points per game over that time it
was during the winter of 2012 so what I
can do is I can look at Jeremy Lin's
points per game across just let's just
pick out a ten game stretch of that
season in 2012 and if you start at the
bottom actually you'll see there's just
two points per game in that one game and
that was typical of what Jeremy Lin was
doing before the one of the star players
on the Knicks was hurt and Jeremy Lin
had the opportunity to play so Carmelo
Anthony who's one of the stars of the
New York Knicks he was hurt Jeremy Lin
got the opportunity to start and his
first opportunity to start he scored 25
points and then the next time he he he
started he scored 28 points and so on he
scored 23 and I think it was around here
when he scored 38 that linsanity totally
set in in New York City and we got all
excited that we thought the Knicks were
gonna win the NBA championship never
happened not happening again today as I
film this the NBA
Game seven championship is happening
tonight here in the US and the Knicks
aren't in it but back to the the topic
of this lecture we have Jeremy Lin's
points per game across ten games we can
get summary statistics from this right
so we can get what was his average
across this this segment or this section
of the season so what was this average
across these ten games and that's a
common statistic and a lot of sports so
points per game or say goals per season
if you're looking at football
internationally or hockey here in the US
is also big right now so we could get
just average points per game but I also
might want to know and it's an important
statistic to look at if you're looking
at sort of the quality of players is how
variable are these players across a
certain stretch of games so was Jeremy
Lin consistent across these ten games or
was he sort of all over the place having
a good night one night a bad night the
next night so first let's calculate the
mean that's just the sum of all the
scores divided by N and I did that down
at the bottom of the screen here to get
the mean I just summed that column of
points per game the sum of that column
is 227 we're averaging over ten games so
it's 227 over 10 or 20 2.7 so during
that 10 game stretch Jeremy Lin is
averaging 22.7 points per game that's
the mean that's a measure of central
tendency but we want to know about his
variability over those 10 games so the
way to calculate variability is variance
and standard deviation the first thing
we want to do is for each game we want
to calculate what's known as a deviation
score and that's this column these are
deviation scores so to get a deviation
score I do
take how many points to Jeremy Jeremy
Lin score in one game and compare it to
his average so in this first row I can
take 28 and subtract his average twenty
two point seven and I get five point
three so he was deviating from his
average about five point three he was
five point three above average that
night and so on I can calculate each
deviation score the whole point of
variability is getting sort of an
average deviation now I can't take the
average of this column because it sums
to zero so if I sum that column I would
get zero and divide by ten I'd have zero
so instead what we'll do is we'll square
each deviation score that's this last
column is the deviation scores squared
that gets rid of sine so then when I sum
the squared deviation scores I can
divide by n and that gives me variance
so this last column I've just taken each
deviation score squared it and then sum
all the squared deviation scores to get
nine hundred and twenty two point one if
I divide by ten that gives me ninety two
point two one so to summarize those
results his average points per game or
mean was twenty two point seven the
variance standard deviation squared was
that ninety two point two one it was the
sum of squared deviations divided by N
for short we're gonna call that sum of
squares divided by n if we take the
square root of that then we get the
standard deviation nine point six by
taking the square root that brings us
back to the units that we started in
remember we had to square everything to
get rid of sine when we went from
deviation scores to squared deviation
scores so this last step we take the
square root that brings us back to the
unit's we were in which is
points-per-game what this is saying is
on average he was fluctuating about ten
points per
is that really accurate not really he
wasn't really fluctuating about ten
points per game once he had the
opportunity to start right
the standard deviation is nine point six
because I included that one game where
he only scored two points he didn't
start that game if we don't include that
then his standard deviation will go down
before I do that I just want to point
out some notation again I'm gonna use em
for me SD for standard deviation SD
squared 4 variance that's also known as
mean squares for the mean sum of square
or mean squared deviations so mean
squares sum of the squares these are
important definitions to know going
