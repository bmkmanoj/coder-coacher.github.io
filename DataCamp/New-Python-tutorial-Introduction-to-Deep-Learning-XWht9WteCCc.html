contributor to the Charis in tensorflow
deep learning libraries imagine you work
for a bank and you need to build a model
predicting how many transactions each
customer will make next year your
predictive data or features like each
customer's age bank balance whether they
retired and so on we'll get to deep
learning in a moment but for comparison
consider how a simple linear regression
model works for this problem the linear
regression embeds an assumption that the
outcome in this case how many
transactions a user makes is the sum of
individual parts they starts by saying
what is the average then it adds the
effect of age then the effect of bank
balance and so on so the linear
regression model isn't identifying the
interactions between these parts and how
they affected banking activity say we
plot predictions from this model we draw
one line with the predictions for the
retired people and another with the
predictions for those still working we
put current bank balance on the
horizontal axis and the vertical axis is
the predicted number of transactions the
Left graph shows predictions from a
model with no interactions in that model
we simply add up the effect of the
retirement status and current bank
balance the lack of interactions is
reflected by both lines being parallel
that's probably unrealistic but it's an
assumption of the linear regression
model the graph on the right shows the
predictions from a model that allows
interactions and the lines don't need to
be parallel neural networks are a
powerful modeling approach that accounts
for interactions like this especially
well deep learning the focus of this
course is the use of especially powerful
neural networks because deep learning
models account for these types of
interactions so well then perform great
on most prediction problems you've seen
before but their ability to capture
extremely complex interactions allows
them to do amazing things with text
images videos audio source code and
almost anything else you could imagine
doing data science
the first two chapters of this course
focus on conceptual knowledge about deep
learning this part will be hard but it
will prepare you to debug and tune deep
learning models unconventional friction
problems and it will lay the foundation
for progressing towards those new and
exciting applications you'll see this
payoff in the third and fourth chapter
your write code that looks like this to
build and tune
deep learning models using Kerris to
solve many of the same modeling problems
you might have previously solved with
scikit-learn
there's a start - how deep learning
models capture interactions and achieves
these amazing results will modify the
diagram you saw a moment ago here
there's an interaction between
retirement status and bank balance
instead of them separately affecting the
income we calculate a function of these
variables that accounts for their
interaction and use that to predict the
outcome even this graphic oversimplifies
reality where most things interact with
each other
in some way and real neural network
models account for far more interactions
so the diagram for a simple neural
network looks like this on the far left
we have something called an input layer
this represents our predictive features
like age or income on the far right we
have the output layer the predictions
from our model in this case then of the
predicted number of transactions all
layers that are not the input or output
layers are called hidden layers they're
called hidden layers because well the
input and output correspond to visible
things that happened in the world and
that can be stored as data the values in
the hidden layer aren't something we
have data about or anything we observe
directly from the world nevertheless
each dot called a node in the hidden
layer represents an aggregation of
information from our input data and each
node adds to the model's abilities to
capture interactions so the more nodes
we have the more interactions we capture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
