data camp and I'll be your instructor
for this course most of the time when
you work with our you use a functional
programming style that is you start some
data to manipulate it you apply a
function this returns some new data then
you apply another function and you
repeat this and till you get an answer
with a functional mindset you typically
start by thinking about what you want to
function to do next you worry about the
objects to get passed into the function
that is the argument to that function
and finally you worry about the objects
that come out the other end that is the
return values object-oriented
programming has a different approach in
it you start by thinking about the
objects that you have to work with in
this case a teapot and then you think
about what data you need to describe the
object for a teapot you might want to
store the total capacity and how much
liquid is currently stored in the pot
next you think about the functionality
of that object the main purpose of the
teapot is to pour tea so you'd add a
pour function in object-oriented
programming functions are known as
methods there is no special method type
of variable in our so throughout the
course whenever you hear the word method
it just means a function but used in an
object-oriented context you've already
come across many of the object types
that are available in R for example you
seem numeric logical and character
vectors as well as factors data frames
and lists in total there about 20 types
of objects available in R the exact
number depends on how you count them
these are all the basic building blocks
that you need for data analysis there
are two variable types here that become
important for object-oriented
programming lists and vironment because
these variable types can contain other
variables you can use them to create
many other more complex types
think of it like Legos in this case you
have twenty types of Lego block but you
can use those blocks to build an
infinite number of more complex
structures before we begin a word of
warning a lot of the time
object-oriented programming is necessary
or even desirable for data analysis most
of the time you want your data to be
stored in a data frame and you should
use functions that take a data frame
manipulate it and return another data
frame that is the functional programming
approach this is the philosophy of the
tidy verse packages most notably deep
liar after you've finished this course
take one of our deep liar courses to see
the alternate approach so when should
you use object trying to programming it
works best when you have a limited
number of objects you completely
understand the behavior of this is true
industry specific data analysis for
example the bioconductor project has
over a thousand are packages for
analyzing biological data particularly
genomics sections of a genome occur in
many contexts here so many bio conduct
packages make use of a genomic range
object by reusing this object throughout
bioconductor the behavior is predictable
across many packages another example is
accessing data through web application
programming interfaces or api's in this
case there is a limited number of
responses that the website can provide
and you can define objects to store
these responses a third example is
graphical user interfaces or gooeys many
of the languages use to build gooeys
such as java or c sharp are
object-oriented for a GUI again there
are a small number of well understood
objects that you need to consider like
buttons or text boxes or shape boxes
this screenshot is from a shiny app
which means that it's a web
we built in our what you may notice
about all three examples is that none of
them really involved any data analysis
just to make it really clear
object-oriented programming is brilliant
for building tools for data analysis but
bad for data analysis itself in fact
there is no data analysis in this course
at all instead the focus is on learning
important coding skills to summarize
with functional programming you think
about the functions first and then how
you use them on your data with
object-oriented programming by contrast
you think about the data structures
first and then worry about their
functionality for general-purpose data
analyses the functional style is more
appropriate an object-oriented style is
preferable when you have a limited
number of complex objects now let's try
some examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
