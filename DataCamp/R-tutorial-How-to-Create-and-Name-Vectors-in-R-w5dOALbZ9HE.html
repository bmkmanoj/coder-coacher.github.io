in this video I'll be talking about
vectors a vector is nothing more than a
sequence of data elements of the same
basic data type remember the atomic
vector types I discussed before you can
have character vectors numeric vectors
logical vectors and many more first
things first
creating a vector in R you use the c
function for this which allows you to
combine values into a vector suppose
you're playing a basic card game and
record the suit of five cards you draw
from a deck a possible outcome and
corresponding factor to contain this
information could be this one of course
we could also assign this character
vector to a new variable drawn suits for
example we now have a character vector
drum suits we can assert that it is a
vector by typing is dots vector drawn
suits likewise you could create a vector
of integers for example to store how
much cards of each suits remain after
you drew it 5 cards let's call this
vector remain there are 11 more spades
12 more hearts 11 diamonds and all 13
clubs still remain if you print remain
to the console it looks ok but it's not
very informative how does somebody else
know that the first value corresponds to
spades
wouldn't it be useful if you could
attach labels to the vector elements you
can do this in R by naming the vector
you can use the names function for this
let's first create another vector suits
that contains the strings spades hearts
diamonds and clubs the names you want to
give to your vector elements now this
line of code sets the names of the
elements in remain to the strings in
suits if you now parents it's to the
console you'll see that the suits
information is accompanied by the proper
labels great if you don't want to bother
with setting the names afterwards you
could just as well create a named vector
with the one liner you can use the equal
sign for this inside the C function
notice that here it's not necessary to
surround the names spades
hearts diamonds and clubs with double
quotes although this also works
perfectly fine in all three cases result
is exactly the same under the hoods our
vectors have attributes associated with
them what you did when you set the names
of the remain vector is actually setting
the names attributes of the remain
objects the STR function that compactly
displays the structure of an R object
shows this you'll have plenty of fun
creating and naming vectors in all sorts
of ways but before I let you do it there
are two more things I want to discuss
with you
first of all remember the variables
you've created in a previous chapter
these variables such as my apples equal
to 5 and my oranges equal to the garage
strings 6 at some points are actually
all vectors themselves are does not
provide a data structure to hold a
single number or a single character
string or any other basic data type
they're all just factors of length 1 you
can check this by typing s dot vector my
apples which is true and is not factored
my oranges which is true as well that
these variables are actually vectors of
length 1 can be checked using the length
function this contrasts with the other
vectors we've created in this video the
drawn suits vector for example has
length 5 the last important thing is
that an R a vector can only hold
elements of the same type they're also
often called atomic vectors to
differentiate them from lists another
data structure which can hold elements
of different types this means that you
cannot have a vector that contains both
logicals and numerix for example if you
do try to build such a vector or
automatically performs coercion to make
sure that you end up with a vector that
contains elements of the same type let's
see how that works with an example in
contrast to recording the suits you draw
from a deck of cards suppose now you're
recording the ranks of the cards you
might want to combine result of drawing
8 cards like this creating a vector
wrong ranks if you now inspect this
vector you'll see that numeric vector
elements have been coerced 2 characters
2
end up with a homogeneous character
vector this is also what the class
function from before tells us the fact
that our handles this for us
automatically upgrading logical to
numerix and numeric characters when
necessary along the way it's useful but
it can also be dangerous so be aware of
this if you want to store elements of
different types in the same data
structure you'll want to use a list but
that's something for later now it's time
to step up your bedding game in the
interactive exercises have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
