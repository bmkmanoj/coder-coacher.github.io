already bumped in to the columns and
draw sums functions the call sums
function for example took the sum of
each column and then sort result in a
vector
apart from these major specific math
functions we can also do arithmetic with
matrices remember how you could do all
the typical arithmetic operations on
vectors again it's exactly the same for
matrices all computations are performed
element-wise ever heard about that other
classic trilogy the Lord of the Rings as
for Star Wars you can build a matrix of
box-office revenue for both us and
non-us regions the information is saved
in the matrix l TR underscore matrix
which has been constructed as follows
these are astronomical numbers worth
talking about millions of US dollars
here what if you wanted to convert this
to euros at the time of writing 1 euro
converts to 1 point 12 US dollars so to
convert the figure so euros we'll have
to divide figures by 1 point 12 we can
simply use a division operator as if we
were performing the division on a single
number or performs the operation
element-wise each element is divided by
one point 12 this works just the same
for multiplication summation and
subtraction say for example that the
theaters worldwide claimed fifty million
dollars on the box-office revenue how
much is left for the Lord of the Rings
concern itself then we simply subtract
50 from the lotr matrix operating on
matrices with single numbers looks
pretty straightforward and this also
actually holds when you are performing
calculations with two matrices suppose
that instead of demanding the same sum
of money for every release theaters
worldwide ask for 50 million for a first
release 80 for a second and 100 for the
third we could build a matrix say
theatre cuts with the same dimensions as
lotr matrix that looks as follows if we
now subtract theater cuts from lotr
matrix we see that subtraction was
performed element wise the
figures for the two towers lowered by 80
while the figures for The Return of the
King were lowered by hundred
makes perfect sense right now what would
happen if we use a vector containing 50
80 and 100 to subtract from the Lord of
the Rings matrix let's try it out the
result is exactly the same that's
because once again are performed
recycling now realizes that the
dimensions of the matrix and vector
don't match therefore the vector is
extended to a matrix of the same size
and is filled up with the vector
elements column by column the matrix
that is does actually subtracted from
the lotr matrix is the following this
matrix is the exact same one as we built
manually before so result is the same
again blindly trusting our that it
performs recycling just the way you want
it can be quite a dangerous practice you
should be fully aware of how this
recycling is actually happening if you
are familiar with linear algebra you
might wonder how matrix multiplication
would work well in our multiplication is
simply performed element wise suppose
you want to convert to u.s. dollar
figures to euros with the exchange rate
at the time of your release you can
again create a new matrix this time with
the amount of euros you should pay for
one dollar now we can simply multiply
the Lord the rings' matrix with the
rates matrix again every calculation is
done elements by elements the top left
figure has been multiplied by one point
11 while the bottom-right figure was
multiplied by point 82 to end this last
video on matrices I want to stress once
more that matrices and vectors are very
similar they simply are data structures
that can store elements of the same type
the vector does this in a
one-dimensional sequence while the
matrix uses two-dimensional grid
structure both of them perform coercion
when you want to start elements of
different types and both of them perform
recycling when necessary
similarly vector and matrix arithmetic
are straightforward all calculations are
performed element wise that's all folks
to wrap up on matrices in the following
exercises and I'll be awaiting you to
explain all about factors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
