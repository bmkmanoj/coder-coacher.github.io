is also known as a language for
statistical computing data is the center
of any statistical analysis so let me
introduce you to some of ours
fundamental data types also called
atomic vector types throughout our
experiments we will use the function
class this is a useful way to see what
type of variable is let's head over to
the console and start with true in
capital letters true is a logical that's
also at class true tells us logicals are
so-called boolean values and can be
either true or false
well actually na to denote missing
values is also a logical but I won't go
into detail on that here true and false
can be abbreviated to D and F
respectively as you can see here however
I want to strongly encourage you to use
the full versions true and false next
let's experiment with numbers the values
2 and 2.5 are called numeric cenar you
can perform all sorts of operations on
them such as addition subtraction
multiplication division and many more a
special type of numeric is the integer
it is a way to represent natural numbers
like 1 &amp;amp; 2 to specify the numbers
integer you can add a capital L to them
you don't see the difference between the
integer 2 and the numeric 2 from the
output however the class function
reveals this difference instead of
asking for the class of a variable you
can also use the is dolt functions to
see whether variables are actually of a
certain type to see if a variable is a
numeric we can use the is dot numeric
function it appears that both are
numerix to see if a variable is integer
we can use is dot integer this shows us
that integers are numerix but that not
all numerix are integers so there's some
kind of type hierarchy going on here
last but not least there is a character
string the class of this type of object
is character
it's important to note that there are
other data types in are such as double
for higher precision numerics complex
for handling complex numbers and raw
two-star raw bytes however you will have
tons of fun working with numeric s--
integers logicals and characters and
remainder of this introductory course so
we'll leave these alone for now there
are cases in which you want to change
the type of a variable to another one
how would that work this is where
coercion comes into play by using the S
dot functions one can coerce the type of
a variable to another type many ways of
transformation between types are
possible have a look at these examples
the first command here Commerce's the
logical true to a numeric false however
coerces to the numerix 0 we can also
cause numeric stop characters but what
about the other way around
can also coerce characters to numerix
share you again you can even convert
this character string 4.5 to an integer
but this implies some information loss
because you cannot keep the decimal part
here but beware conversion as in
converting data types it's not always
possible let's try to convert the
character hello to a numeric this
conversion outputs an NA a missing value
or doesn't understand how to transform
hello to a numeric and decides to return
and not available instead you already
have the essentials on what r is how to
use its basic features and what are the
most important data types you will
encounter on your our quest now head
over to the exercises and i'll see you
in the next chapter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
