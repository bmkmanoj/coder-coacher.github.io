computed summary statistics of
measurements including the mean median
and standard deviation but remember we
need to think probabilistically what if
we acquired the data again what do we
get the same mean the same median the
same standard deviation
probably not in inference problems it is
rare that we are interested in the
result of a single measurement or data
acquisition we want to say something
more general Michelson was not
interested in what the measured speed of
light was in the specific 100
measurements conducted in the summer of
1879 he wanted to know what the speed of
light actually is statistically speaking
that means he wanted to know what speed
of light he would observe if he did the
experiment over and over again an
infinite number of times unfortunately
actually repeating the experiment lots
and lots of times is just not possible
but as hackers we can simulate getting
the data again the idea is that we re
sample the data we have and recompute
the summary statistic of interest say
the mean to resample an array of
measurements we randomly select one
entry and store it importantly we
replace the entry in the original array
or equivalently we just don't delete it
this is called sampling with replacement
then we randomly select another one and
store it we do this n times where n is
the total number of measurements v in
this case we then have a resampled array
of data using this new resampled array
we compute the summary statistic and
store the result resampling the speed of
light data is as if we repeated
Michelson set of experiments we do this
over and over again to get a large
number of summary statistics from the
resampled data sets we can use these
results to plot an e CDF for example to
get a picture of the probability
distribution describing the summary
statistic this process is an example of
bootstrapping which more generally is
the use of resampled data to perform
statistical inference
to make sure we have our terminology
down each resampled array is called a
bootstrap sample a bootstrap replicate
is the value of the summary statistic
computed from the bootstrap sample the
name makes sense it's a simulated
replica of the original data acquired by
bootstrapping let's look at how we can
generate a bootstrap sample and compute
a bootstrap replicate using Python we
will use mikaelsons measurements of the
speed of light first we need a function
to perform the resampling the numpy
function random choice provides this
functionality conveniently like many of
the other functions in the numpy random
module it has a size keyword argument
which allows us to specify how many
samples we want to take out of the array
notice that we choose 5 it chose 5 3
times the function does not delete an
entry when it samples it out of the
array now we can draw 100 samples out of
the mikaelsons speed-of-light data this
is a bootstrap sample since there were
100 data points and we are choosing 100
of them with replacement now that we
have a bootstrap sample we can compute a
bootstrap replicate we can pick whatever
summary statistic we like we'll compute
the mean median and standard deviation
it's as simple as treating the bootstrap
sample as if it were a dataset now it's
time for you to do some bootstrap
sampling yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
