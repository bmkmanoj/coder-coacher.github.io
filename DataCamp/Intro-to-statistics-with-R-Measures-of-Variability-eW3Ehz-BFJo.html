point of summary statistics is we can't
always show our audience or when we're
writing things writing up research for a
publication in a journal or an article
in a newspaper on or on a website we
can't show all those histograms for all
our variables
it just becomes too much information for
the audience to digest so we often want
to just give some talking points some
summary statistics and the most common
summary statistics are measures of
central tendency and the most common one
of those is the mean or average but you
might want to do median in the case of
extremely skewed distributions but it's
also really important as you start
getting into statistics and really
important for the rest of this course to
think beyond just the mean or measures
of central tendency and think about
measures of variability variance is
going to be a really important concept
as we move forward so it's important
that you understand how to calculate
standard deviation and variance and it's
important that you understand
conceptually what standard deviation and
variance mean and what they convey
finally it's important that you know the
following formulas and that you could
just do these by hand of course we're
gonna do all our calculations using the
our software it's less error-prone and a
lot faster and and convenient right but
you should just know how to do these off
the top of your head so again hopefully
this one was review if it's not just
give yourself some practice on it so the
mean is just the sum of all the scores
divided by the number of scores and then
I gave you this one formula for standard
deviation and variance this first one is
used for descriptive statistics and
that's still all we're dealing with is
descriptive statistics we're just
describing what's going on in a sample</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
