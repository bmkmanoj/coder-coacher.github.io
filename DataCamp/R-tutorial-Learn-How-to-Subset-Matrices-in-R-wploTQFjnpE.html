in which you want to select single
elements or entire parts of a matrix to
continue your analysis with again you
get you square brackets for this but the
facts that you're dealing with two
dimensions now complicates things a bit
have a look at this matrix containing
some random numbers if you want to
select a single element from the matrix
you'll have to specify both the row and
the column of the elements of interest
suppose you want to select the number 15
located at the first row and the third
column we type M open brackets 1 comma 3
close brackets as you can probably tell
the first index refers to the row the
second one refers to the column likewise
to select the number 1 at Row 3 and
column 2 we write the following line
works like a charm
notice that the results are single
values so actually vector is of length 1
now what if you want to select an entire
row or an entire column from this matrix
you can do this by letting out some of
the indices between square brackets
instead of writing 3 comma 2 inside
square brackets to select the element at
row 3 and column 2 you can leave out the
tool and keep the three comma parts now
you select all elements that are in Row
3 namely 6 1 4 and 2 notice here that
the result is not a matrix anymore it's
also a vector but this time one that
contains more than one elements you
selected a single row from the matrix so
a vector suffices to store this one
dimensional information to select
columns you can work similarly but this
time the index that comes before the
comma should be removed to select the
entire third column you should write m
open brackets comma 3 close brackets
again effect results this time of length
3 corresponding to the third column of M
now what happens when you decide not to
include a comma to clearly discernible
'm and row indices let's simply try it
out and see if we can explain it so
you simply type em and then for inside
square brackets result is 11 how did our
get to that well when you pass a single
index to subset a matrix our simply goes
through the matrix column by column from
left to right the first index is then 5
the second one 12 the third one 6 and
the fourth one is 11 in the next column
this means that if you pass em 9 you
should get four in the third row in the
third column
correct there aren't a lot of cases
which using a single index without
commas is useful but I just wanted to
point out that the comma is really
crucial here
in factory subsetting you also learned
how to select multiple elements in
matrices this is of course also possible
and the principles are just the same say
for example you want to select a value
14 and 8 in the middle of the matrix
this command will do that for you you
select elements that are on the second
row and on the second and third column
again result is a vector because one
dimension suffices
beware however you can select elements
that tone-deaf one of row or a column
index in common if you want to select
eleven or Row one and column two and
eight on row two and column three this
goal will not give the wanted results
instead a sub matrix gets returned that
spans the elements on Row one and two
and column two and three these sub
matrices can also be built up from
disjoint places in your matrix creating
a sub matrix that contains elements on
Row one and three and columns one three
and four for example would look like
this now remember these other ways of
performing sub setting by using names
and with logical vectors these are just
as well for matrices let's first have a
look at sub setting by names
we'll have to name the matrix for that
of course in fact sub setting my name
works exactly the same as by index but
you just replace the indices with the
corresponding names to select eight for
example you could use row index two and
column index three our user row names
are two and column names see you can
even use a combination of both
just remember to surround a row and
column names with quotes selecting
multiple elements and sub matrices from
a matrix is straightforward as well to
select elements on Row r3 and in the
last two columns you can use this line
finally you can also use logical vectors
again the same rules apply rows and
columns corresponding to a true are kept
while those corresponding to a false are
left out to select the same elements as
in a previous call you can use this
commands the rules of factory cycling
also apply here suppose that
you're only passive vector of length -
to perform a selection on the columns
the column selection vector gets
recycled to false true false and true
giving the same result as before as you
can see there's nothing new under the
matrix um apart from the additional
dimension when you compare two vectors
all different techniques to perform
subsetting and all the technicalities
remain the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
