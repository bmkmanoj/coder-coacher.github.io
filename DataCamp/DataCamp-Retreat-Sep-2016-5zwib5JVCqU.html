my name is Jonathan I'm the CEO of data
camp hi my name is Wes I'm the director
of marketing at data can do to
digitalization companies in every
industry are sitting on piles and piles
of data you know what the problem is
they can find people to turn that data
into insights they can find so called
data scientists and that's where data
cam comes in what makes data camp unique
is the online interactive learning
platform that focuses on data science
and we work with the best instructors in
the field currently we have over a half
a million users on our platform and we
expected to double in the next six
months and our course library will grow
to over a hundred fifty courses we have
a mix of professors from universities
such as Duke University of Washington we
collaborate with well-known companies in
the space like our studio continuum and
we work with the best psychics
developers libraries developers such as
Aldi Wickham metal and Brian van them
some of the traits we look for in
candidates are a passion for our
teaching a passion for data science and
really just someone that isn't afraid to
take risks we have great benefits
everyone when they start gets a MacBook
Pro or air and five hundred dollars to
buy the equipment they need we also do
catered lunches in our offices as well
as corporate retreats every six months
we offer students courses on any data
science technology as well as any data
science and methodology we teach our
students how to manipulate data how to
import data how to visualize data how to
build statistical models as well as
machine learning models dynamic reports
and dashboards
we're dead again for business we build
out this great tool to use the Eric amp
into the corporate environment so it's
really aimed at data oriented teams what
they can do is on top of all the course
content the interactive learning
environments that you have potata can do
now also have access to your own company
portal you can set assignments deadlines
you can create your own interactive
exercises for your teams and that's all
using the data control group feature one
thing that's really cool about data camp
is that anyone can go on and create
their own course using our platform we
have specialized apps that help you
create your own course they create
interactive exercises for other people
to take a few years ago is teaching our
in statistics at the University and at
that point in time interactive learning
platforms like
school code Academy team treehouse
became very popular they had a very
fresh approach to making the online
learning experience more engaging and
interactive in contrast to Coursera and
edex where students just passively
consume information but the problem we
saw was nobody was really focusing on
building the best interactive learning
experience specifically for data science
and at this point in time data science
is such an important field there are
millions of people who have to be
trained in data science and have to
become more data savvy so data camp was
started as a company to cater solely to
people who want to improve their data
science skills and our goal is really to
build the best learning experience
specifically for the data science
industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
