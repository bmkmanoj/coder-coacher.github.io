the investment bets the larger the
weight of an asset in the portfolio the
more influential it will be in
determining the future value of the
portfolio when studying this impact
investors typically do not analyze the
change and the investment value in
absolute terms but in the relative terms
this leads them to compute simple
returns defined as a change in value
over the period relatively to the
initial value the simple return is thus
the final value minus the initial value
divided by the initial value as an
example suppose the initial value is
$100 the final value is $120 then the
return on that investment equals 20%
obtained by taking the difference
between 120 and 180 it by 100 in the
slide I show you how we can apply this
definition for computing portfolio
returns this involves three steps first
for the initial date we need to compute
the total value invested as the sum of
the values of a different investments
second for the final date we have to sum
the final values of the individual
investments to obtain the final
portfolio value then we can compute the
portfolio return as a percentage change
of the final value compared to the
initial value as an example let us
consider a two asset portfolio that
invests $200 to nest one and $300 in
asset to the ant value is $180 and $330
if we sum the values we find that the
total initial value of the portfolio is
$500 while the total final value is five
hundred and ten dollars it follows that
the simple return on the portfolio is a
$10 change in Val
you divide by the initial five hundos
invested which gives us a return of two
percent this advantage of this
calculation method is that it does not
show how the portfolio weights determine
the portfolio return let us therefore
consider a different formula in which
the portfolio return is computed as the
weighted average of the returns of the
underlying assets its calculation
proceeds also in three steps first the
initial weights of the positions are
computed secondly the return on each of
the individual positions is determined
then in the third step the portfolio
return is computed as a sum over the
products between the initial weights and
the corresponding returns in the slide
you see how to apply this formula to
compute the return for our example
portfolio with two assets we first
compute the initial portfolio weights
since the initial value of the first
asset is $200 and the total value
invested is $500 the initial weight of
asset 1 is 40% the remainder of 60% is a
weight of acid tomb then in a second
step we need to compute the returns for
each of the assets for s1 we obtain that
the individual return is minus 10% while
for acid due the return is plus 10%
finally we can combine those results and
compute the portfolio return by summing
over the weights multiplied by their
respective returns the first term is a
weight of 40 percent times the return of
minus 10% which gives us minus 4% the
second term is a weight of asset - 60 %
times at which its return of 10% which
gives us plus 6% adding - 4 % + + 6 %
gives us the portfolio return of plus 2%
which is exactly the same number as
obtained before
the next interactive exercises put this
theory in practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
