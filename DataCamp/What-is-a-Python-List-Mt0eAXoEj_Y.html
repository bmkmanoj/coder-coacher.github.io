data types on the numbers sides there's
a float represent a real number and the
end represent an integer next we also
have SDR short for string to represent
text in Python and bool which can be
either true or false you can save these
values as a variable like these examples
show each variable then represents a
single value as a data scientist it will
often want to work with many data points
if you for example want to measure the
height of everybody in your family and
starts information by them it would be
inconvenient to create a new Python
variable for each point you collected
right what you can do instead is store
all this information in a Python list
you can build such a list with square
brackets suppose you asked your two
sisters and parents for their height in
meters you can build a list as follows
of course also this data structure can
be referenced to with a variable simply
put a variable name and equal sign in
front like here a list is a way to give
a single name to a collection of values
these values or elements can have any
type they can be floats integer
boolean's strings but also more advanced
Python types even lists it's perfectly
possible for a list to contain different
types as well suppose for example that
you want to add the names of your
sisters and parents to the lists so that
you know which height belongs to who you
can draw them some strings without
issues but that's not all I just told
you that lists can also contain lists
themselves instead of putting the
strings in between the numbers you can
create little sub lists for each member
of the family one for Liz one for Emma
and so on now you can tell Python that
these sub lists are the elements of
another list that I named fam to the
little lists are wrapped in square
brackets and separated with commas if
you now print out fam two you see that
we have a list of lists the main list
contains four sub lists or dealing with
a new Python type here next to the
strings boolean's and integers and
floats you already know about the list
these calls show that both fam and fam
to our lists remember that I told you
that each type a specific functionality
and behaviors
associated well for lists this is also
true Python lists hosts a bunch of tools
to subset and adapt them but let's take
the step by step and have you experiment
with list creation first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
