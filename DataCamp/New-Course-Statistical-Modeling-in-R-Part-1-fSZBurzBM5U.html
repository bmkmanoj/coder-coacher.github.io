Danny Kaplan the author of this course
I'll be the instructor in these data
camp video segments and I'll be behind
the scenes in the interactive exercises
that follow each video statistical
modeling is one of the most important
aspects of dealing with data a
statistical model is a kind of summary
of data the summary can be a way to
encapsulate patterns and data some of
these models are what's called machine
learning the summary can be a way to
translate from existing observations
into conclusions for instance
classifying a sales prospect as strong
or weak or a wine as excellent or poor
very often models are used to untangle
the many influences that can shape an
outcome quantifying how each influence
contributes and models are an essential
part of the process for quantifying the
strength of evidence for a conclusion
provided by the available data people
who are new to statistical modeling
often asked me what's the difference
between plain statistics and modeling as
you'll see statistical modeling refers
to a set of concepts and techniques that
give you more power to analyze complex
systems and situations than traditional
methods such as the t-test taught an
introductory statistics as you know if
you've had an introduction to statistics
a t-test is one method for addressing a
simple question our two groups different
the t-test is kind of like a skateboard
there's nothing wrong with a skateboard
but it has very limited use statistical
models to run with the analogy or like
helicopters they can get you from place
to place like a skateboard but let you
go much further and faster and they're
better at dealing with travel over
rugged terrain those situations where
traditional techniques just won't get
you where you need to be true sometimes
skateboards are used in rough
circumstances but this often results in
a painful and pointless conclusion okay
a statistical model is neither a
skateboard or a helicopter those are
just metaphors
so what is a model my favorite
definition and certainly the most
helpful one is this a model is a
representation for a purpose
representation means the model stands
for something often some thing or
process in the real world the purpose is
central without knowing what the model
will be used for you can hardly design
an appropriate model here are a few
everyday models each is a representation
the blueprint stands for a building the
doll represents a child the model
airplane represents an aircraft and each
of these representations is useful for
some purposes but not for others the
blueprint is useful for seeing how space
can be subdivided or consolidated but it
is not useful for figuring out say how
sound in the building will reverberate
the model airplane is useful for showing
how the various parts of the plane
engine wings tail are related but it's
not useful for safety testing we build
models because they are much more
convenient than the real thing for
carrying out the purpose for which the
model is intended it's infinitely easier
to add a new wall in a blueprint than it
is in a real building a mathematical
model is simply a model built from
mathematical stuff numbers model
formulas equations and so on
a statistical model is a special kind of
mathematical model it is informed by
data and is often built to predict
future events or to test out hypotheses
about how the system being model
actually works in this course you'll
learn how to design train and use
statistical models this will of course
involve data but since a model is a
representation for a purpose it's
important that you have always in mind
what purpose your model is intended to
serve so that you can build a model
that does the job it's meant for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
