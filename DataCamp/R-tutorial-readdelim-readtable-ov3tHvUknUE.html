retail CSV which is an RF function that
specifically exists for importing CSV
data however flat file data doesn't come
as comma separated values alone another
common format a flat file data is that
data delimited file like this states of
txt with the same data as before to
import it will need read up to limit
this time as usual you simply specify
the path to the file and also that we
want to import strings strings and not
as factors works like a charm
if your data comes in this typical comma
separated or tab delimited format your
life is easy and importing the data is a
walk in the park if it's not you'll have
to do some more customization work say
we have the same States data again but
this time the values are separated by a
forward slash instead of commas or taps
in a file States to txt how to go about
this retail CSV and read out the limb
won't do you much good in this case here
you'll want to use reads dots table it's
the main importing function in the
utah's package allowing you to read in
any file in the table formats and create
a data frame from its the number of
arguments you can specify for this
function is huge so I won't go through
each and every one of these arguments
instead let's have a look at a retail
table call that import states - dot txt
and try to understand what happens as
usual the first argument is the path to
the file you want to import the header
argument is something that we haven't
seen before if you set this to true you
tell our that the first row of the text
file contains the variable names which
is the case here read of table sets this
argument to false by default which would
mean that the first row is always read
as motivation even if it's a row of
variable names next set is the arguments
that specifies how fields in a record
are separated for our file here the
field separator is a forward slash like
this finally there's again the strings
as factors arguments which we set to
false again because we want to import
strings as strings
results looks just as with one's nice
apart from the arguments we discussed
here are also ways to specified column
names and column types among others get
some practice on them in the exercises
