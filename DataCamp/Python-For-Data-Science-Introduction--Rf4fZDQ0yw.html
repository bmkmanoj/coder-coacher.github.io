host for introduction to Python for data
science it's a long name but that's to
stress something this is not just
another Python tutorial instead the
focus will be on Python specifically for
data science by the end of this course
you'll know about powerful ways to store
and manipulate data and to deploy cool
data science tools for your own analyses
you will learn Python for data science
through video lessons like this one and
interactive exercises you get your own
Python session where you can experiment
and try to come up with the correct code
to solve the instructions you're
learning by doing all receiving
customized and instant feedback on your
work Python was conceived by head of our
awesome what started as a hobby project
soon became a general-purpose
programming language nowadays you can
use Python to build practically any
piece of software but how did this
happen well first of all Python is open
source it's free to use
second it's very easy to build packages
in Python which is code that you can
share with other people to solve
specific problems throughout time more
and more of these packages specifically
for data science have been developed
suppose you want to make some fancy
visualizations of your company's sales
there's a package for that or what about
connecting to a database to analyze
sensor measurements there's also a
package for that currently there are two
common versions of Python version 2.7
and 3.5 and later apart from some
syntactical differences they are pretty
similar but as support for version 2
will fade over time our course is
focused on Python tree to install Python
tree on your own system follow the steps
at this URL
now that you're all eyes and ears for
Python let's start experimenting I'll
start with the Python shell a place
where you can type Python code and
immediately see the results and data
Cam's exercise interface this shell is
embedded here let's start off simple and
usse Python as a calculator
let me type 4 plus 5 and hit enter
python interprets what you typed and
prints the result of your calculation 9
the Python shell that's used here is
actually not the original one we're
using ipython short for interactive
Python which is some kind of juiced up
version of regular by
that will be used later on a Bartram
interactively working with Python you
can also have Python run so called
Python scripts these Python scripts are
simply text files with the extension dot
py it's basically a list of Python
commands that are executed almost as if
you were typing the commands in the
shell yourself line by line let's put
the command from before in the script
now that can be found here in datagrams
interface the next step is executing
scripts by clicking submit answer if you
execute the script in the data camp
interface there's nothing in the output
pane that's because you have to
explicitly use print inside scripts if
you want to generate output during
execution
let's wrap our previous calculations
print calls and rerun the script this
time the same output as before is
generated great putting your code in
Python scripts instead of manually read
typing every step interactively will
help you to keep structure and avoid
retyping everything over and over again
if you want to make a change you simply
make the change in the script and rerun
the entire thing now that you've got an
idea about different ways of working
with Python I suggest you head over to
the exercises use the ipython shell for
experimentation and use the Python
script editor to coat the actual answer
if you click submit answer your script
will be executed and check for
correctness have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
