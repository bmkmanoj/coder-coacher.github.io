chose to companies selling a similar
product still the analysis showed that
the value of the stocks can diverge over
time so how to decide between those two
companies flip a coin
no in most cases the rational decision
is not to invest in either one or the
other but to reduce our risk by holding
a portfolio that is invested in both of
them this is called diversifying your
risks so how good is your portfolio
diversification to answer this question
you need to investigate how the
portfolio investments are spread across
the different assets this is done by
computing the portfolio weight of each
asset this means that we compute a ratio
between the value of one investment
relatively to the total value of all the
investments in the portfolio suppose for
example that there are and different
investments each with their own value VI
then the weight of investment I equals
VI divided by the sum of the value of
all the investments in the portfolio the
corresponding arc was simple suppose as
values as a vector holding the values
invested in a different assets then the
corresponding weight factor is simply
that vector of values divided by the sum
of course this vector sums to unity and
chapter 4 we will see how to optimize
the choice of portfolio weights in the
meantime it is important to know that
several approaches exist to set the
portfolio weights a first approach is to
concentrate the investment bet and one
risky asset this approach is speculative
and very likely to be inefficient when
all assets are similar in terms of risk
and reward a better approach is to aim
for perfect diversification and to
invest the same amount in each risky
asset this is the so called equal
weighting approach
another popular approach is to set
weights proportional to the market value
of the asset it implies over weighting
stocks of big firms and under rating
stocks of small firms these are only a
few examples of the large number of
possible approaches to define portfolio
weights for us the important clusion to
remember is that to avoid extreme losses
it is definitely not a good idea to put
all your eggs in one basket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
