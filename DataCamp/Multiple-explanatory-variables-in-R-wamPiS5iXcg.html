explanatory variables there can be a lot
to keep track of for instance to
evaluate the model you're going to need
to set a value for each of the
explanatory variables
this in turn involves figuring out what
a relevant value is none of this is hard
for the instance it's often appropriate
to use the mean or median of a
quantitative variable or the most common
group for a categorical variable still
it is tedious if you want to make a
graphic showing the form of the model
function there's even more to do since
you'll want to select several different
levels of each explanatory variable to
include in the plot to streamline the
task the statistical modeling package
provides two helper functions effect
size calculates an effect size for you
the main advantage here is that effect
size scans your data to find appropriate
values for the explanatory variables and
an appropriate step size for the
explanatory variable whose effect size
you were looking for the function takes
two arguments the model you are
examining and a very short formula with
just one explanatory variable on the
right side of the tilde this identifies
the variable whose effect size you are
looking for later in the course you'll
see another advantage of effect size it
lets you find a confidence interval the
other helper function is plot model this
graphs model functions as an example
consider a model of whether a worker is
married based on their education sector
of employment sex and experience on the
job
the conventional format for graphing a
model puts the response variable on the
y-axis in this model that's the
probability of being married the most
important explanatory variable to you
goes on the x-axis of course what's most
important depends on your purpose in
constructing and displaying the model
I've selected the age variable if there
are other variables you want to display
you can use color as I've done here with
sex and you can facet the graph making
small sub graphs here I'm showing two
different levels of Education in the
columns and three different employment
sectors in the three rows of facets so
in this graph there are four different
explanatory variables you can judge for
yourself whether this is overwhelming
you don't want to make the graphics so
busy that it becomes difficult to
interpret the graphs show that older
workers are more likely to be married
that's the general upward slope in the
curves of probability of being married
versus age you can also see that there
are some systematic differences in
marriage probabilities for males and
females for professional sector workers
males are more likely to be married than
females the opposite is true for
clerical workers for service workers
probability is about the same for both
sexes females with more education or
less likely than males to be married in
the professional sector each of these
subgraphs is created by setting the
education and sector variables to the
level indicated in the margin then the
model is evaluated for each sex at each
of many ages you can of course do this
directly with predict the plot model
function does this work for you collects
the result and graphs them let's talk
about how to design such graphs first
the response variable will always be on
the y-axis this honours convention and
helps the viewer of the graph to orient
him or herself if the responses
categorical will plot the probability of
the first level for the y-axis for the x
axis choose the explanatory variable
whose effect you want to highlight for a
quantitative variable on the x-axis the
effect size is the rate of change of the
plotted line in other words the slope of
the line for categorical variables the
effect size is the difference in model
output between two different levels
additional explanatory variables are
used for color and for faceting the
graphic that is subplots for the
different values to specify which
explanatory variable
place which role you use a formula with
the explanatory variables on the
right-hand side the first variable in
the formula will go on the x-axis if
there's a second variable included they
will be displayed as color if there are
third or fourth variables they define
the facets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
