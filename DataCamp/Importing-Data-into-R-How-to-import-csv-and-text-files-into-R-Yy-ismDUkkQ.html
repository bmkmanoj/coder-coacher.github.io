this importing data into our course
imagine this situation a poor colleague
of yours still doing his or her analysis
incest and you want to continue working
on the sass data but inside are you need
an easy way to convert the SAS data into
an art data frame but you can seem to
find the tools to do so well getting to
know these tools is exactly what this
course is for more specifically we will
focus on five types of data data from
flat files from excel files from other
statistical software from databases and
finally data imported from the web each
chapter will focus on each one of these
data formats and you'll learn to convert
all of them into an art data frame and
this first chapter we'll start with flat
files there are typically simple text
files that contain table data have a
look at states at CSV a flat file
containing comma separated values the
data lists basic information or some US
states the first line here gives the
names of the different columns or fields
after that each line is a records and
the fields are separated by a comma
hence the name comma separated values
for example there's a state Hawaii with
a capital Honolulu and a total
population of 1.42 million what would
that data look like an R well actually
the structure nicely corresponds to an
our data frame that ideally looks like
this the rows in a data frame correspond
to the records and the columns of the
data frame correspond to the fields the
field names are used to name the data
frame columns but how to go from the csv
file to this data frame we're in luck
because the standard distribution of our
provides functionality to import these
flat files into our as a data frame
these functions belong to the utils
package that is loaded by default when
you start our the mother of all these
data import functions is the read dot
stable function you can read in any file
in table format and create a data frame
from it
the number of arguments you can specify
for this function is huge so I won't go
through each and every one of these
instead let's have a look at the retail
table call that imports
a CSV and try to understand what happens
the first argument of the retail table
function is the path to the file you
want to import into R if the file is in
your current working directory simply
passing the file name as a character
string works if your file is located
somewhere else things get tricky
depending on the platform you're working
on Linux Microsoft Mac whatever file
paths are specified differently to build
the path to a file in a
platform-independent way you can use the
file dot path function suppose our
state's dot CSV file is located in the
datasets folder of the home directory
you can use file to path like this
because I'm working on a Mac this is
resulting path but for Windows resulting
character string will be different this
path can now be used inside retail table
to point to the correct file like this
now for the header arguments if you set
this to true you tell are that the first
row of the text file contains the
variable names which is the case here
retail table sets this argument false by
default which would mean that the first
row is already an observation next step
is the argument that specifies how
fields in a record are separated for our
CSV file here the field separator is a
comma so we use a comma inside quotes
finally the strings as factors arguments
is pretty important it's true by default
which means that columns or variables
that are strings are imported into our
as factories the data structure to store
categorical variables in this case the
column containing the country names
shouldn't be a factor so we set strings
as factors to false if we actually run
this call now we indeed get a data frame
with five observations and four
variables it corresponds nicely to the
CSV file we started with the rethought
table function works fine but it's
pretty tiring to specify all these
arguments every time writes CSV files
are a common and standardized type of
flat files that's why the yuto's package
also provides the read CSV function this
function is a wrapper around the retail
table function
this means that read CSV calls retail
table behind the scenes
but with different default arguments to
match with the CSV format
more specifically the default for header
is true and first step is a comma so you
don't have to manually specify this
anymore this means that this reads our
table call from before it does exactly
the same as this read CSV call apart
from CSV files are also other types of
flood files take this tab delimited file
state sup txt with the same data to
import it with retail table you again
have to specify a bunch of arguments
this time you should point to the txt
file instead of the CSV file and the set
argument should be set to a tab so
backslash D you can also use a read
total limb function which again is a
wrapper around retail table the default
arguments for header and set are adapted
among some others result of both calls
is again a nice translation of the flat
file to an art data frame now there's
one last thing I want to discuss here
have a look at this u.s. CSV file and
its European counterpart states EU CSV
you'll notice that Europeans use commas
for decimal points while normally one
uses a dot this means that they can't
use the comma as the field limiter
anymore they need a semicolon to deal
with this easily our provides a read dot
CSV to function both the set argument as
the test argument to tell which
character is used for decimal points our
difference likewise for read dr. Lim we
have a readout to limit to alternative
can you spot the difference again this
time only the test argument had to
change let's try to import the state's
EU dot CSV file with the basic retail
CSV function Argos results but as bleary
is not result we want it's a data set
with 5 observations but a single
variable if we try again with read CSV -
it works perfectly fine this time of
course the possibilities of importing
flat files with the use those functions
are practically endless he'll typically
have to experiment a bit to get it right
give it a try in the first set of
exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
