and I'm here today with Joe Hardin we
just finished recording videos for her
new course on statistical inference as
part of our interest at series that's
pretty exciting
so welcome thank you
good so Joe is a morning person so we
started at 6:00 a.m. this morning so
often in Boston which is in California
yep and she's a trooper she actually
flew here last night
and then was up at 6 a.m. or 5 a.m. our
time at this morning so ok interesting
so anyways just wanted to ask a few
questions of Joe today to pick her brain
a little bit while we have her here in
the studio so the first thing I want to
ask is your professor of math and stats
how did you get into statistics did you
start out as a mathematician and then
find your way into stats the other way
around
and why stats so my undergraduate
degrees in mathematics mostly because we
didn't have a stat Department I actually
came to college thinking I wanted to be
an actuary which has some overlap in
relation to statistics but I fell in
love with teaching and I fell in love
with college and the Academy so I
thought to myself how can I continue to
do this for the rest of my life and
statistics was a really natural fit I'd
always been good at math I really loved
the applied problems that that we were
seeing so I did a lot of statistics in
undergrad even though I was a math major
and then I went on to get my graduate
degree in statistics okay cool so what
were some of the applications of stats
that you were excited about that drew
you to the field I actually did my
senior thesis topic in 1995 and on
bootstrapping okay so it was a it was a
project that used I don't even remember
I think it was like a logistic
regression model and so we did
bootstrapping to think about confidence
intervals for the coefficients and
the variability of the coefficients and
so the data was actually data that my my
advisor had had collaborators in the
medical field and so it was real data
and application to a real problem ok
cool so that's something I didn't even
know about you and that's interesting
because the bootstrapping is a big part
of the course that we just work together
yeah so something I've been doing for a
long time and thinking about for a long
time ok I understand it now a lot better
than I did as a senior really why well
part of it was that that we didn't have
quite the technology that we that we do
now so it was hard to simulate it right
exactly so I was using s plus as a
student the precursor to are the
precursor to R that we had to pay for
and so I did simulations and I was able
to kind of generate the intervals and
the variability that we needed but the
the way that that R is written and the
packages that have been created since
that time make it a lot easier to sort
of see what's going on to visualize the
graphics are so much better and just
just really it takes away from the the
work of having to code right so it felt
like a lot of weeds when I was a student
that we were just trying to get these
technical details and less forests of
just understanding the big concepts it
makes sense so for people who don't know
what bootstrapping is you should take
the course and you will know but maybe
just give a quick explanation for
somebody who's never been exposed to
that before so for lots of years we as
statisticians have been able to use
theory to understand variability so how
samples vary from one to the next when
you're taking samples from a population
so for example polling a population to
understand who's going to be the next
president that's right that's right so
we understand you know how one sample
proportion could vary over lots of
samples when the population value is
something different right and
proportions is a great example because
that's one we really understand with the
theory
but there's lots of measures out there
ways that we summarize the data hmm that
don't have theory behind them to
understand how the samples could vary
from one sample to the next given a
population so for those statistics you
know it might be the trimmed mean where
you're worried about extreme
observations on one end to the other you
get some hi-hi some observations that
are really high and some observations
that are really low the trimmed mean is
much harder to say things about
theoretically so instead what we do is
we sample from the original data from
the original sample and it turns out
that this process of resampling from the
original data is a great approximation
for understanding the variability
associated with a statistic that might
not be the traditional statistics we
work with mm-hmm sure so for anybody
who's maybe been through an interest ats
course in the past particularly for
those people who had maybe a less than
optimal experience going through
interest stats in the past because they
were taught to memorize the formula for
B's
yeah or T confidence interval right the
bootstrap is actually another way to
think about confidence intervals right
right right because it's that
variability piece and that's what a
confidence interval
you know buys for you it rise for you
that variability and and ultimately it's
about saying we think that 55% of the
population is going to vote for this
president but of course there's a lot of
uncertainty in there and so this is
about trying to basically quantify how
certain or uncertain we are about that
figure that's exactly right great
okay cool so let's focus in on the r
piece for a second okay
so this course is n R yep you mentioned
that you used to work in S Plus yeah
some years ago so maybe just describe if
you could how you first came to to work
with us plus and what the impact was for
you yeah so I used s plus as an
undergraduate in the early 90s which I
don't think was particularly common
partly because you had to
purchase it mm-hmm at some point before
rs+ sort of went out of business they
did offer free educational licenses but
then I went on and did my graduate work
and my graduate work had had simulation
pieces to it so I was using s plus there
as well and then I started my job my
current job at Pomona College and and
when I started I also had the
institution by s+ licenses but when when
we have students working with a licensed
software it gets complicated in terms of
how do they get that software onto their
own machines how do they get it you know
how do they use the software after they
leave the institution all those kind of
is the institution really ready to
support it forever all that kind of
stuff so when our started becoming more
viable in terms of the help files and
the the user interface I immediately
started using it in my classrooms and so
I use are in all of my classes so my
intro stats to my you know even my
theoretical classes I'll have them
simulating things so that they kind of
understand how the how the theory is
showing up and my students love it
I mean they they will write to me many
years later and tell me they're using
our and their job or their fun activity
that you know they simulate like envy a
pool how likely am I went to win this
poker hand that's that that's neat so
what what do you think it is
specifically as an educator about our or
teaching empowering people to to be able
to program things what do you think it
is about that that has such a positive
impact for students I think that kind of
like my experience as an undergraduate
are is really set up to sort of answer
questions and so when the students come
and they're motivated and they're
excited about solving a particular
problem and understanding the mechanisms
behind those problems I think that I
think that our has just a really nice
interface for for the students to
accomplished with the problem that
they're trying to solve but before you
mentioned like for you and your
experience like being able to like
simulate things and and actually
visualize the output like that had a had
an impact on you right
it made abstract things otherwise I'd
track things more concrete that's right
that's right and and I I agree I think
that's true for our students I think
that the graphics and are outstanding
and and pretty easy for the students to
pick up quickly so so when they're
they're simulating to understand an
abstract concept that visualization is
important when they're when they're just
making graphics of their own data that
visualization is also important yeah and
I think it's a it's an important point
because at the end of the day our is a
tool unless you're a developer and your
focus is the programming itself like our
is a tool and when you're trying to
teach to statistics you want everything
else to kind of get out of the way
that's right okay so that they can focus
on the ideas that you're trying to
convey and not how to program a for loop
example right right all right we're to
get some dots on a page right okay very
cool
so why specifically I think this is
probably pretty good segue but why
specifically did you want to build a
course on statistical inference of all
things well I'm an educator so I teach
at a small residential college and we
have a lot of face-to-face interactions
I see my students all the time I get to
know them really well and that makes
educating a lot easier I know what they
understand I know what they don't
understand
and I can I can address those needs but
I don't really feel like small liberal
arts colleges as fantastic as they are
and as wonderful as I could just go on
and on about I don't know that their the
the education of the future I don't know
you know I think a lot about where
education will be in 20 years or 50
years and certainly I believe that
technology is going to play a big role
and so one of the exciting things about
coming to data camp for me
was to see that other side and to
understand what is the process of
building a course how do you make
choices about what to talk about and how
to preempt the questions that the
students might have because I'm not
gonna see their faces I'm not going to
know what's what's going on sort of
behind the scenes a much different
medium it is I'm not convinced that this
is the medium that will exist in 50
years but but I do think that the things
are changing and that technology will
will be important or will have a big
role yeah absolutely
okay very cool so maybe addressing those
beginners out there are people who are
just getting started with are and
statistics what advice would you have
for them so um so my advice for for my
students which i think is mostly there
they're quite similar to the students on
the data camp platform is to just do a
lot of statistics do a lot of data
analysis I tell my students for example
to you know find some data somewhere
there's lots of good public databases
and api's and catechol competitions find
some data and do an analysis come up
with some cool graphics put it on a blog
get a github site and if you really feel
like you're not quite ready to be
actually analyzing data then do things
like this and take some classes think
about you know we read blogs like simply
statistics or but but there but there
are other other good blogs and and and
just kind of keep trying things I think
that's the best way to kind of think
about whether it's right for you and how
you can contribute go make a bunch of
mistakes and very publicly yeah
absolutely
cool actually sorry I want to go back to
the last question okay so I I'm curious
so obviously we are actively trying to
figure out what the future of education
is well and I and I wholeheartedly agree
with you it won't look the same today
whether it's Pomona or whether its data
camp right it's not going to look the
same today 20 years as it does today
right
so I'm curious if neither of us have a
crystal ball and we're trying to figure
this out every single day that's what
we're doing but what do you think it may
be broadly speaking what are the
characteristics of of a successful
educational system or educational
process that you think we should be
striving toward over the next 20 years
like what is missing today that you hope
to see in the future that we could do
better at we in the collective well okay
I mean you know that I come from a
particular perspective so I'm gonna say
the things which is that I actually
believe that the liberal arts model is
the best way to teach I think that the
the one-on-one interactions and the
research projects that we do and the the
class projects that the students do
where I'm giving them you know really
good feedback on every single paper is
invaluable
it just doesn't scale that's the problem
with it there's no possible way for it
to scale and whether we're talking about
US education or we're talking about
internationally right there's just a
disconnect there so so I wonder how we
can integrate that piece into it and I
know that on some of the other online
platforms they do things like peer to
peer grading peer to peer feedback and I
wonder if maybe that's a piece of it is
some kind of scaling of you know
communicating about ideas that are not
fully formed or ideas that are wrong
you know I'm a huge user of things like
sac exchange right so so that's sort of
that platform of getting good feedback I
mean it's not always perfect but getting
getting good feedback quickly and often
you know I think is pretty important in
a way where other people can actually
benefit from a response that was
directed at your at you question right
my query yeah yeah no I think I think
that's a great that's a great point and
yeah I think realistically it's going to
be a combination of all of these things
in the future there is no silver bullet
when it comes to education technology
has its place
getting toe to toe with other human
beings also has its place
but it will be really exciting to see
how things how things develop over the
next couple of decades because I
absolutely agree with you things will be
different yeah yeah okay okay cool
that's all I had so thanks to you know
and it's been really nice having you
around yeah it's been fun all right
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
