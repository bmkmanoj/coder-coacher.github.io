extensible time series objects that are
designed be flexible and powerful
designed to make using time series easy
at the heart of an excess is a zoo
object a matrix object plus a vector of
times corresponding to each row which in
turn represents an observation in time
visually you can think of this as data
plus an array of times till a straight
will create a simple matrix called
X each row of our data is an observation
in time to track these observations we
have dates in an object called ID X note
that this index must be a true time
object not a string or a number that
looks like time now XTS lets you use
nearly any time class be it of class
date POSIX times time date cron and more
but they need to be time-based here we
are using ours date objects at this
point though we don't have a time series
we'll need to join these to create our
XTS object to do this we call the XTS
constructor with our data X and pass our
dates ID X to order by the constructor
has a few optional arguments the most
useful being T zone to set time zones
and unique which will force all times to
be unique note that XDS doesn't enforce
uniqueness for your index but you may
require this in your own applications
one thing to note is that your index
should be an increasing order of time
earlier observations at the top of your
object and later more recent
observations towards the bottom if you
pass in a non sorted vector XTS will
reorder your index and the corresponding
rows of your data to ensure that you
have a properly ordered time series
looking back to the example you can see
that we now have a matrix of values with
dates on the left they may look like row
names but remember it's really our index
so what makes XTS special as I mentioned
before XTS is a matrix that has
associated times for each observation
basic operations work just like they
would on a matrix almost one difference
you'll note is that subsets will always
preserve the object objects matrix form
choose one or more than one column
always results in another matrix object
another difference is that attributes
are generally preserved as you were
with your data so if you store something
like a timestamp of when you acquired
the data in an X attribute subsetting
won't cause that information to be lost
finally since XTS is a subclass of zoo
you get all of the power of zoo methods
for free
we'll see how important this is
throughout the course one last point
before we break out the exercises
sometimes it'll be necessary to reverse
the steps we took to create the time
series and instead extract our raw data
or raw times for use in other contexts
XTS provides two functions that we'll
cover here core data is how you get the
raw matrix back and index is how you
extract the dates or times simple and
effective now let's get to work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
