a left join you can use it whenever you
want to augment a data frame with
information from another data frame to
use left join first pass at the name of
the data frame that you want to augment
this will be your primary table here we
will augment name by adding to it
information from plays next pass left
join the name of the the data frame that
you want to augment the first width this
will be the secondary table in our case
that will be plays finally give left
join a by argument you should set by to
the name of the key to join on as a
character string our key is named
surrounded by quotation marks when you
click run left join will return a new
data frame that contains all of the rows
in the first data frame in their
original order appended to these rows
will be new values and columns match
from the second data frame if a row in
the first data frame doesn't have a
match deep I will supply and n/a in the
appropriate place as it did for Mick if
a row in the second data frame doesn't
have a match deep I will ignore it
entirely it won't appear in the new data
frame as with Keith what if your key
involves more than one variable for
example what if we want to join our
surname datasets well that's easy to use
multi-column keys pass by a character
vector that includes all of the call
names in the key here we can set by to
the character vector name comma surname
altogether deep liar contains six joint
functions each uses the same syntax as
left join but returns a slightly
different result for example write join
is another deep liar function that does
the exact opposite of left join right
join treats the second data set as the
primary data set as a result it returns
a data frame that contains all of the
rows of the second data set augmented
where appropriate with information from
the first data set here keith is
retained because he's in the second data
set but Mick is not because he is in the
first data set in the next video we will
look at more variations on joins but
first we will practice with the basic
syntax before we do though I'd like to
clarify a term that will come up
throughout the course deep hires to
table functions are designed to work
with data
frames which are the basic structure for
storing multi type tabular data in our
however deep iris functions also work
with tables and deep layer connection
objects you can pass each of these
structures into a deep hire function and
it will return the same type of
structure as the result a table is a
data frame that has been enhanced with
an extra class tables behave like data
frames in every way except one when you
display a table at the command line R
will show you only the portion of the
table that fits in your console window
for example here's how our displays a
contents of empty cars which is a data
frame and here's how our displays a
table version of the same data set the
idea behind tables is that is easier to
inspect a small portion of a data set
then to inspect the entire data set at
once you can always see the entire table
with R's view command and that's view
with a capital v as you will see many
deep liar functions return tables you
can think of them as data frames to
learn more about Tibbals check out the
Tibble package a deep liar connection
object is a deep liar object that
references a table stored outside of our
we don't really need to worry about them
here I just want to make it clear that
when I talk about deep liar functions
working with data frames data tables
data sets I mean all three of these
objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
