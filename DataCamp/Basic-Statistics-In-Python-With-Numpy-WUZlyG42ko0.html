data is getting to know your data in the
first place for numpy arrays from before
this is pretty easy because it isn't a
lot of data however as a data scientist
will be crunching thousands if not
millions or billions of numbers imagine
you conduct a citywide survey where you
ask five thousand adults about their
height and weight you end up with
something like this a 2d numpy array
which I need NP City that has five
thousand rows corresponding to the five
thousand people and two columns
corresponding to the height and a weight
simply staring at these numbers like a
zombie won't give you any insights what
you can do though is generating
summarizing statistics about your data
aside from an efficient data structure
for number crunching it happens at numpy
is also good at doing these kinds of
things for starters you can try to find
out the average height of these five
thousand people with numbers mean
function because it's a function from
the numpy package don't forget to start
with and b dot of course i first have to
do a sub setting operation to get the
height column from the 2d array
it appears that on average people are
1.75 meters tall what about the median
height this is the height of the middle
person if you start all persons from
small to tall
instead of writing complicated Python
code to figure this out you can simply
use numbers median function we can do
similar things for the weight goal in NP
City often the summarizing statistics
will provide you with a sanity check of
your data if you end up with an average
weight of 2,000 kilograms our
measurements are most likely incorrect
apart from mean and median there's also
other functions like orko F to check it
for example height and weight are
correlated and STD for standard
deviation numpy also features more basic
functions such as sum and sort which
also exist in a basic Python
distribution however the big difference
here is speed because numpy enforces a
single data type in an array it can
drastically speed up the calculations
just a side note here if you're
wondering how I came up with the data in
this video I simulated it with numpy
functions I sampled two random
distributions
five thousand times to create a height
and weight race and then used columns
stack to base them together as two
columns another thing that numpy can do
another great tool to get some sense of
your data is to visualize it but that's
something for later first head over to
the exercises to learn how to explore
you're not by race</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
