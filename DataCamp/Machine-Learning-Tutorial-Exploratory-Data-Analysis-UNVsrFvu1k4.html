contains data pertaining to iris flowers
in which the features consist of 4
measurements petal length petal width
sepal length and sepal width the target
variable includes the species of flower
and there are three possibilities
versicolor virginica and su Tosa as this
is one of the data sets included in
scikit-learn we'll import it from there
with from SK learn import datasets in
the exercises you'll get practice at
importing files from your local file
system for supervised learning
we'll also import pandas numpy and
pipeline under their standard aliases in
addition we'll set the plotting style to
GG plot using PLT dot style dot use
firstly because it looks great and
secondly in order to help all you our
aficionados feel at home
we then load the data set with data sets
load iris and assign the data to a
variable iris checking out the type of
iris we see that it's a bunch which is
similar to a dictionary in that it
contains key value pairs printing the
keys we see that they are the feature
names desk which provides a description
of the data set the target names the
data which contains the values features
and the target which is the target data
as you see here both the feature and
target data are provided as an umpire
raise the dot shape attribute of the
array feature tells us that there are a
hundred fifty rows and four columns
remember samples are in rows features
are in columns thus we have a hundred
and fifty samples and the four features
petal length and width and sepal length
and width
moreover note that the target variable
is included as 0 force Atossa one for
versicolor
and two for virginica we can see this by
printing iris dot target names in which
suppose a corresponds to index 0
versicolor to index 1 and virginica to
index 2 in order to perform some initial
exploratory data analysis or
EDA for short we'll assign the feature
and target data to x and y respectively
will then build a data frame of the
feature data using PD data frame and
also pass in column names viewing the
head of the data frame shows us the
first five rows now we'll do a bit of
visual EDA we use the pandas function
scatter matrix to visualize our data set
we pass it our data frame along with our
target variable as argument to the
parameter C which stands for color
ensuring that our data points in our
figure will be colored by their species
we also pass a list to fig size which
specifies the size of our figure as well
as a marker size and shape the result is
a matrix of figures which on the
diagonal are histograms of the features
corresponding to the row and column the
off-diagonal figures are scatter plots
of the column feature versus row feature
colored by the target variable there is
a great deal of information in this
scatter matrix see here for example that
petal width and length are highly
correlated as you may expect and that
flowers are clustered according to
species now it's your turn
to dive into a few exercises and to do
some EDA then we'll be back to do some
machine learning enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
