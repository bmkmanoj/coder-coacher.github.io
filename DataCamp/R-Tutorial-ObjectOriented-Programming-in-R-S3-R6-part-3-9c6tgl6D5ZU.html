data and objects within the same
variable recall the teapot from Chapter
one this contains the teapot related
data fields like the capacity and teapot
functionality like pour and refill
methods the first step in working with
r6 is to create a class generator for
each of your objects a class generator
is a template that describes what data
can be stored in the object and what
functions can be applied to the object
it is also used to create the specified
objects for this reason I like to call
class generators factories for the rest
of the course the terms class generator
and Factory will be used interchangeably
throughout the next three chapters we're
going to look at a real world example of
a microwave oven the class generator is
our microwave oven factory and the
factory is used to create microwave oven
objects let's look at some code
factories are defined using the r6 class
function the first argument to r6 class
is the name of the class by convention
there should be in upper camelcase
the second argument you need to know
about is called private this stores the
object data it's always a list and each
of the elements of the list must be
named here you can see that the thing
has two fields there are two more
arguments named public and active that
I'll describe in later videos the second
step to working with r6 is to create
some objects you can do this by calling
the new method of the factory since it's
a factory you can turn out as many of
these objects as you like to summarize
you need to load the r6 package to work
with our six
you define what the object contains
using the affix class function this
takes a string naming the class which
should be upper camel case data fields
for the object are stored in a named
list variable called private to create
an object you call the factories new
method now let's try some examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
