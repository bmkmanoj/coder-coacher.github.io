different grammatical elements of
graphics let's see how this works in
practice
the grammar of graphics is implemented
in our using the ggplot2 package which
was one of the first packages developed
by the prolific statistician and our
programmer handing Wickham essentially
we construct plots by layering
grammatical elements on top of each
other
and use aesthetic map means to define
our visualizations we are going to go
through each grammatical element in
depth in this and the next course here
I'll introduce a data set which will be
used throughout the videos and we'll go
over some simple examples the first
layer is data obviously we need some
data plot I'm going to several different
data sets in the course videos one of
which is the classic iris dataset
collected by Edgar Anderson in the 1930s
and thereafter popularized by RA Fisher
the data set contains information on
three iris species it's a Tulsa
virginica and versicolor
four measurements were taken from each
plant the petal length and width and the
sepal length and width you're probably
familiar with what petals are they're
the colorful part of a flower sepals are
the outer leaves of a flower they're
typically green but in this case they're
also colorful
there are 50 specimens of each species
the data is stored in an object called
iris there are five variables the
species and one for each of the
properties that were measured the next
layer is aesthetics which tells us which
scales we shall map our data onto this
is where the second main component of
the grammar of graphics comes into play
on top of layering the grammatical
elements it's here that we establish our
static mappings in this case we're going
to make a scatterplot so we're going to
map the sepal length onto the x
aesthetic and the sepal width onto the Y
aesthetic the third essential layer
allows us to choose that geometry that
means how the pot will look after we've
established our three essential layers
we have enough instructions to make
basic scatterplot it's pretty rough so
to get a more meaningful and cleaner
visualization we'll have to use the
other layers the next layer will use is
facets which dictates how to split up
our plot in this case we want to make
three separate plots one for each of the
species under consideration
the statistics layer can be used to
calculate and add many different
parameters for example here we've chosen
to add a linear model to each of the
three subplots
next comes the coordinates layer which
allows us to specify the precise
dimensions of the plot here we've also
cleaned up the labeling and the scaling
of both the x and y axes and finally the
theme layer controls all the non da-dink
on our plot which allows us to get a
nice-looking meaningful and publication
quality plot directly in arm let's
explore these concepts further in the
exercise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
