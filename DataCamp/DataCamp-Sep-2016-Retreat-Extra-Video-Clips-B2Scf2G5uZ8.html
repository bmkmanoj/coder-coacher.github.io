of data cam data camp is an online data
science school we provide online data
science training for the next generation
of data scientists what makes data camp
unique is the online interactive
learning platform that focuses on data
science we have over half a million
students now taking data science courses
on beta-gamma and in the last year our
team has grown from four to 24 people a
very diverse backgrounds with people
that have done statistics linguistics
psychology and even economics what sets
them apart is that they all have this
passion for Education data science and
they have that entrepreneurial spirit
that's really needed in a company like
ours I did it cam you want everyone to
take ownership therefore given our
microservices architecture all over here
all of our engineers are responsible for
one or more applications I'm actually
responsible with my team for everything
related to learning so we do everything
we can to give people the best learning
experience in the application we take
care of internal tools like messenger
community and the API basically I make
internal tools like the teach app and a
teach editor and they will help course
creators our team builds great data
science courses with the best
instructors in the world so what I do
now basically is get in touch with the
best instructors in the fields and guide
them to the course creation process we
have two main offices one in Belgium and
one in Boston United States that being
said we think it's very important that
these teams are very closely connected
with each other that's why we do twice a
year or retreat as you can see behind me
we're now in the mountains of Austria
brainstorming the future of data science
education we have a relentless focus on
results and not necessarily and how
these results are achieved so that's
definitely one of our core values we
also value transparency a lot for
example everyone has access to the
financial details access to the
marketing data and you can see our
growth is evolving as a company our
aspiration is to be the best possible
place to learn data science online what
that means is having not tens or
hundreds but thousands of data science
courses so today we're very active in
our invitin will soon be adding sequel
and after that we can expand more
technologies such as
for example big data or more tools for
business intelligence will be building
case study courses will have new
learning interfaces so that the
opportunities are essentially endless
we're looking for people who share our
entrepreneurial spirits and who get
excited to build something that will
reach millions of people will expect you
to work hard but the flipside is you'll
get a ton of responsibility and have
huge impact from day one so that sounds
exciting definitely get in touch
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
