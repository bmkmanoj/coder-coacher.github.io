and portfolio managers are just lucky we
believe that a portfolio of stocks
selected by a blindfolded monkey is
optimal well I don't and I hope that by
doing this course you will find out how
portfolio analysis in our can add value
to your portfolio management my name is
Chris bird
I am a professor of Finance at the Free
University of Brussels and Amsterdam I
have more than a decade of experience in
solving investment problems using the
art language besides my teaching and
research I also advise investment
companies about best practices and
portfolio management the advisory is
about balancing risk and reward in their
investments my baseline recommendation
is to take investment decisions
seriously and to be aware of the risks
involved in investing but never you buy
a stock or bond at some price this price
will change in the future if it
increases you make a profit if it
decreases you make a loss it's the
expectation of gains that needs to be
balanced against the risk of losses
there are two simple tricks to reduce
the risk of suffering large losses the
first one is to seek portfolio risk
diversification this means that one
should avoid investing in one single
asset but instead invest in many
different assets such a combination of
investments is called a portfolio when I
review portfolios I often find that by
choosing more intelligent combinations
of investments it becomes possible to
increase the portfolio's expected to
return and reduce the risk the second
Golden Rule investing is to always test
the portfolio strategy on historical
data and once you're trading the
strategy to constantly monitor its
performance for this reason data camp is
one of the best ways to learn
full analysis I will teach you the
theory in the videos and provide you
they are instructions to do the
portfolio analysis and practice the
course proceeds in four chapters in
Chapter one I will introduce the basic
variables and put for analysis namely
the portfolio weights and a portfolio
returns the portfolio weights tell you
the percentage of total value invested
in each of the assets the portfolio
returns measured the relative increase
and portfolio value over the period I
will show you how the portfolio weights
and returns are connected and how to do
the calculation in Chapter two you will
learn how to use measures of you are and
risk to evaluate the portfolio
performance we will be using average
returns volatility Sharpe ratio and even
downside risk measures such as the
portfolio at risk and expected shortfall
chapter 3 is about drivers of portfolio
performance I will show you how the
individual risk and rewards of a
different investment in the portfolio
interact with each other to determine
the total portfolio return and risk
finally in chapter 4 I will show you how
to how to optimize the portfolio weights
in such a way that you obtain portfolio
cannot be beaten by any other portfolio
in terms of offering a higher expected
return for the same or lower level of
risk altogether these four chapters
teach you to analyze portfolio returns
in R which is a crucial skill to make
investment profits with does taking
excessive risks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
