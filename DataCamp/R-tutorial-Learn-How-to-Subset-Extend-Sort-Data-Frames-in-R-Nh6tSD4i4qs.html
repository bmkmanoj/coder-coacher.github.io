intersection between matrices and lists
to subset a data frame again thus use
subsetting syntax from both matrices and
lists on the one hand you can use the
single brackets from matrix subsetting
while on the other hand you can also use
the double brackets and dollar sign
notation that you use to select list
elements we'll continue with the data
frame that contains some information on
five persons have another look at this
definition here let's start with
selecting single elements from a data
frame to select the age of Frank Wiz on
row tree in the data frame you can use
the exact same syntax as for matrix
subsetting single brackets with two
in-season sides the row index tree comes
first and the column index two comes
second indeed Frank is 21 years old you
can also use the column names to refer
to the columns of course just as for
matrices you can also choose to omit one
of the two indices or names to end up
with an entire row or an entire column
if you want to have all the information
on Frank you can use this command result
is a data frame with a single
observation because there has to be a
way to store the different types on the
other hands to get the entire age column
this command will work here result as a
vector because columns contain elements
of the same type subsetting the data
frame to end up with a sub data frame
that contains multiple observations also
works out as you'd expect have a look at
this command that selects the age and
parenting information on both Frank and
cats all these examples show that you
can subset data frames exactly as you
did with matrices the only difference
occurs when you specify only one index
inside people in the matrix case R would
go through each column from left to
right to find the index you specified in
a data frame case you simply end up with
a new data frame that only contains the
column you specified this command for
example gives the age column as a data
frame I repeat a data frame not
vector but why so let me talk about sub
setting data frames with list syntax and
it'll all become clear remember when I
told that a data frame is actually a
list containing all vectors of the same
length this means that you can also use
the list syntax to select elements say
for example you type people dollar sign
H the H vector inside the data frame
gets returned so you end up with the H
column likewise you can use the double
brackets notation with a name or with an
index in all cases result is a vector
you can also use single brackets to
subset lists but this generates a new
list containing only the specified
elements take this command for example
the result is still a data frame which
is a list but this time containing only
the H elements this explains why before
this command gave a data frame instead
of a vector again using single brackets
or double brackets to subset data
structures can have serious consequences
so always think about what you're
dealing with and how you should handle
it once you know how to correctly subset
data frames extending those data frames
is pretty simple sometimes you'll want
to add a column a new variable to your
data frame other times it's also useful
to add new rows so know observe Asian's
to your data frame to add a column which
actually comes down to adding a new
element to the list you can use the
dollar sign or the double square
brackets suppose you want to add a
column height the information of which
is already in effect your height this
call R this call will do the trick you
can also use the see bind function that
you've learned to build and extend
matrices it works just the same for data
frames to add a weight column in
kilograms for example you can use this
line if see by it works then surely our
binds will work fine as well indeed you
can use our binds to add new rows to
your data frame suppose you want to add
the information of another person Tom to
the data frame simply creating a vector
with a name H height etc won't
because a vector can't contain elements
of different types you'll have to create
a new data frame containing only a
single observation and add that to the
data frame using our bind let's call
this mini data frame Tom now we can use
our binds to bind people and Tom
together wait what are crows and error
names do not match previous names this
means that the names in people and dumb
do not match
we'll have to improve our definition of
Tom to make the merge successful now our
bind will work as you'd want it to work
so adding a column to a data frame is
pretty easy but adding new observations
require some care last but not least or
also is reordering your data frame this
comes down to reshuffling the order of
the observations in your data frame to
get some more insight in your data
suppose you want to sort the data frame
by age such that the youngest person is
on top and you oldest on the bottom how
it does work a first guess would be to
use the sort function which sorts of
vector into ascending or descending
order let's experiment a bit with this
and sort the H column what gets returned
is an ordered version of the H column
looks nice but it's not really what we
need there's not a clear way in which we
could use these values to change the
ordering of the rows in a data frame
instead of the sort function
we'll need the order function to help us
out let's test the order function on the
H column order returns a vector ranks
with a rank position of each element to
see what this means let's print the H
column and try to reproduce the results
so the lowest value in the H column is
21 it's in third position this index
tree does comes first in the ranks
vector the second lowest value in the H
column is 28 and is in first position in
the H column the index one does come
second in the ranks vector the highest
value is 39 at the fourth position in
the H column this index comes in the
last place and ranks make sense the
ranks vector contains indices that are
now used to perform a selection in a
scramble
order such that result is an order data
frame cool right to sort in descending
order you can set the decreasing
argument in the order function to true
these were just the basics on data frame
sub setting and manipulation know that
there are tons of packages out there
such as data table and deep liar
that will help you manipulate filter
merge and sort your data frames head
over to the exercises and become a data
frame hero</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
