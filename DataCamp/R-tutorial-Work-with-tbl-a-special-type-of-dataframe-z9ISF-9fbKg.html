spending too much time at the airport at
least that's what a Nobel prize-winning
economist once said I'd hate to miss a
flight but I'd also hate to spend too
much time at an airport the h flights
data set can help you avoid both the
data set records every flight that
departed from Houston Texas in 2011 and
that's no mean feat in 2011 Houston was
a major hub for at least three carriers
Continental Airlines Express jet and
Southwest Airlines many other Airlines
flew there too hidden in the H flights
data set are clues about which airlines
are the most reliable for example you'll
see which had the longest delays and
which had the most cancellations the
data is saved as H flights a data frame
that are loaded along with the H flights
package you can look at the data
directly by typing H flights at the
command line but that might be a
bittersweet experience our we'll try to
show you the entire data set which is a
quarter million rows long eventually R
will give up but not before filling your
console and its data buffer with data
ours version of a data deluge deep layer
can help you look at the data set it
provides a new data structure for our
the table a temple is just a special
type of data frame but R knows how to
display it properly to turn H flights
into a table you can run TBL underscore
DF on it now our only displays the
amount of data that will fit in your
console window not only does our cut out
superfluous rows it cuts out superfluous
columns so you don't get that
disorienting wraparound effect the
typical display also tells you the
dimensions of the full data set as well
as the names and data types of each
columns that is not shown the best thing
about this display is that it adapts to
the size of your window if you change
the size of your console window and
rerun H flights our will display a
different portion of the data
whichever portion fills your new window
size if your data set is small enough R
will display the whole thing even if it
feels slightly more than one window if
you'd like to see a more complete
display of the Tibble data you can use
the function glimpse ghulam shows you
the data types and the initial values of
each column in the data set if you don't
like the table format you
change your structure back with
something like as data dot frame I'll
use the table format throughout this
course and I suggest that you do two
Tibbles do more than make your data easy
to look at they also make it easier to
work with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
