Bound Anderson and I'm a data scientist
the data camp
in this course the first of the Python
data science toolbox courses you'll
learn to write your very own functions
and you'll have the opportunity to apply
these newfound skills to questions that
commonly arise in data science contexts
specifically in this video and in the
interactive exercises that follow it you
will learn to do the following defined
functions without parameters defined
functions with single parameters and
defined functions that return a single
value in the next section you'll learn
how to pass multiple arguments to
functions as well as return multiple
values from them let's begin let's first
check out pythons built-in function STR
which accepts an object such as a number
and returns a string object you can
assign a call to STR to a variable to
store its return value while built-in
functions are cool as a data scientist
you'll need functions that have
functionality specific to your needs
fortunately you could define your own
functions in Python will now see how to
define functions via an example a
function that squares a number the
function named square will be perfect
for this to define the function we begin
with the keyword def followed by the
function name square this is then
followed by a set of parentheses and a
colon this piece of code is called a
function header to complete the function
definition let's write the function body
by squaring a value say 4 and printing
the output right now our square function
does not have any parameters within the
parentheses we will add them later now
whenever this function is called the
code in the function body is run in this
case new value is assigned the value of
4 to the power of 2 and then print it
out you can call the function as you do
with pre-built functions square this
should yield the value 16 what if you
wanted to square any other number
besides 4 though to add that
functionality you add a parameter to the
function definition in between the
parentheses
here you see that we've added a
parameter of value and in the new
function body the new variable new value
takes the square of value which is then
printed out we can now square any number
that we pass to the function square as
an argument a quick word on parameters
and arguments when you define a function
you write parameters in the function
header when you call a function you pass
arguments into the function the function
square now accepts a single parameter
and prints out its squared value but
what if we don't want to print that
value directly and instead we want to
return the squared value and assign it
to some variable you can have your
function return the new value by adding
the return keyword followed by the value
to return now we can assign to a
variable num the result of the function
call as you see here there's another
essential aspect of writing functions in
Python docstrings docstrings are used to
describe what your function does such as
the computation it performs or its
return values these descriptions serve
as documentation for your function so
that anyone who reads your functions
docstring understands what your function
does without having to trace through all
the code in the function definition
function docstrings are placed in the
immediate line after the function header
and a place between triple quotation
marks an appropriate docstring for our
function square is returns the square of
a value you've now just learned the
basics of defining your own functions
now it's your turn in the next few
interactive exercises you will try your
hand at defining and using your very own
functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
