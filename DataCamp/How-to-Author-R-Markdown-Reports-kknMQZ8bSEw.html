your results with our it brings together
the best ideas of literate programming
dynamic documents and reproducible
research to help you become a fast and
efficient scientist we thought markdown
you supplement your art code with
narration to create a complete report is
easy to update and work with the code in
this form because the code is all still
there when you're ready to deliver
results
our markdown uses your code to build a
final report this report can be an HTML
web entry a PDF paper a Microsoft Word
document or a slide show our markdown
can build each format from your code
which means that you can distribute
results in multiple ways and if your
daddy got ever changes you can just
rerun your code to build a new report
let's see what this looks like in real
life
this is an our markdown file that I've
opened in the art studio ide our
markdown files are written in markdown
and easy to learn shorthand for writing
formatted text for example the document
here has some bold text a web link and
some section headers the document also
has sections of our code embedded
throughout the text
with the click of a button you can
compile any are markdown document into
multiple types of output you can turn
your document into an HTML file
a PDF
you
a Microsoft Word document
or even a slideshow
you
when you compile your document our
markdown will run the our code chunks in
the document and add the results to the
final output this creates an ideal
format for reproducible research use our
code to create the numbers tables and
figures in your report your report will
contain all of the code needed to
reproduce your results
the narration in the report will make
the code easy to understand and if you
find a mistake or if your data ever
changes you can easily rerender the file
to create an up-to-date report
our markdown reports are very versatile
you can pair them with multiple types of
code not just our and you can add our
elements from the shiny package to
create interactive output for example
this our markdown file uses functions
from shiny to create an interactive
slideshow
