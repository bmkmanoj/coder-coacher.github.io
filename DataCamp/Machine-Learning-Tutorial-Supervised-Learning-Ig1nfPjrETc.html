of scikit-learn you're here to learn
about the wonderful world of supervised
learning arguably the most important
branch of machine learning but what is
machine learning machine learning is the
art and science of giving computers the
ability to learn to make decisions from
data without being explicitly programmed
for example your computer can learn to
predict whether an email of spam or not
spam given content and sender another
example your computer can learn to
cluster say Wikipedia entries into
different categories based on the words
they contain it could then assign any
new Wikipedia article to one of the
existing clusters notice that in the
first example we are trying to predict a
particular class label that is spam or
not spam in the second example there is
no such label when there are labels
present we call it supervised learning
when there are no labels present we call
it unsupervised learning unsupervised
learning in essence is the machine
learning task of uncovering hidden
patterns and structures from unlabeled
data for example a business may wish to
group its customers into distinct
categories based on their purchasing
behavior without knowing in advance what
is categories might be this is known as
clustering one branch of unsupervised
learning
there's also reinforcement learning in
which machines or software agents
interact with an environment
reinforcement learning agents are able
to automatically figure out how to
optimize their behavior given a system
of rewards and punishments reinforcement
learning
draws inspiration from behavioral
psychology and has applications in many
fields such as economics genetics as
well as gameplay
in 2016 reinforcement learning was used
to Train google deepmind's alphago do
was the first computer program to be the
world champion and go but let's come
back to supervised learning which will
be the focus of this course
it's devised learning we have several
data points or samples described using
predictive variables or features and the
target variable our data is commonly
represented in a table structure such as
the one you see here in which there is a
row for each data point and a column for
each feature here we see that our data
set each row represents measurements of
a different flower in each column is a
particular kind of measurement like the
width and length of a certain part of
the flower game of supervised learning
is to build a model it's able to predict
the target variable here the particular
species of the flower given the
predictive variables here the physical
measurements if the target variable
consists of categories like click or no
click spam or not spam or different
species of flowers recall the learning
task classification alternatively if the
target is a continuously varying
variable for example price of a house
it's the regression task in this chapter
we will focus in classification in the
following on regression and no time
naming conventions out in the wild you
will find that what we call a feature
others might call predictive variable or
independent variable and what we call a
target variable others may call the
dependent variable or response variable
the goal of supervised learning is
frequently to either automate the
time-consuming or expensive manual tasks
such as a doctor's diagnosis or to make
predictions about the future say whether
a customer will click on an ad or not
for supervised learning you need label
data there are many ways to get it you
can get a turtle data which already has
labels that you're interested in you can
perform experiments to get label data
such as a/b testing to see how many
clicks you get or you can also use
crowd-sourced labeling data like
reCAPTCHA does for text recognition in
any case the goal is to learn from data
for which the write output is known so
we can make predictions on new data for
which we don't know the output there are
many ways to perform supervised learning
and Python in this course we will use I
could learn or SK learn one of the most
popular and user-friendly machine
learning libraries for python it also
integrates very well with the SyFy stack
including libraries such as numpy there
are a number of other ml libraries out
there have just tends to flow in Chara's
which are worth checking out once you
get down to basics let's now jump into
an exercise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
