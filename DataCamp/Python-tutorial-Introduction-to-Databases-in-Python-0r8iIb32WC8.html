Python my name is Jason Myers and I'm a
software engineer whose area of
expertise is in developing data
analytics platforms relational databases
are the foundation of many applications
and data systems widely used today they
are also extremely common in the world
of data science and analytics relational
databases are made up of tables which
store our data for example here are a
couple tables from the Census database
that we'll be using in this course the
census table on the Left host location
and demographic information along with
population counts from the US census
data
meanwhile the state fact table on the
right holds additional details about the
state's themselves such as the
abbreviation and type of the location
tables themselves consist of columns and
rows the columns of a database to find
the name of an element or field in our
data such as the age column highlighted
here they also specify the data type
such as a string or an integer which
we'll talk more about in a later section
all of the data in a table is stored
within the rows of a table the row
highlighted here contains the population
counts in 2000 and 2008 for newborn
females in New York State tables can
also be related to one another by column
acting as a key or a bridge that tells
it which piece of data it is associated
with in another table
this feature is where a relational
databases get the relational part of
their name here we've highlighted the
state column in the census table and the
name column in the state fact table we
can use this relationship to get
additional information about the
relevant state such as its abbreviation
for any row in the census table the
structure of tables in relational
databases along with how they can be
related as outlined here is known as the
relational model will soon learn how to
extract information from such a database
but first let's test your knowledge of
the relational model with a multiple
choice question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
