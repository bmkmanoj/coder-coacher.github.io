at it we'll need to remember a few
things about pandas first pandas is a
library for data analysis the power tool
of pandas is the data frame a tabular
data structure with labelled rows and
columns as an example we'll use a data
frame with Apple stock data the rows are
labeled by a special data structure
called an index we'll learn more about
indexes later indexes in pandas are
tables lists of labels that permit fast
lookup and some powerful relational
operations the index labels in the Apple
data frame are dates in reverse
chronological order labeled rows and
columns improve the clarity and
intuition of many data analysis tasks
when we ask for the type of the object
Apple it's a data frame when we ask for
its shape it has eight thousand five
hundred and fourteen rows and six
columns the data frame columns attribute
gives the names of its columns open high
low close volume and adjusted close
notice the Apple columns attribute is
also a panda's index actually the Apple
dot index attribute in this case is a
special kind of index called a date/time
index will study date/time indexes and
time series later data frames can be
sliced like numpy arrays or Python lists
using colons to specify the start end
and the stride of a splice first we can
slide from the start of the data frame
to the fifth row non-inclusive using the
dot ILOG accessor to express the slice
positionally second we can slice from
the fifth last row to the end of the
data frame using a negative index
remember it's also possible to slice
using labels with the dot lok accessor
there's another way to see just the top
rows of the data frame the head method
specifying head v returns the first five
rows specifying head two returns just
the first two rows
the head method is particularly useful
because our date frame here has over
8,000 rows the opposite of head is tail
specifying tail without an argument
returns the last five rows by default
specifying tail three returns the last
three rows again tail gives a useful
summary of large data frames another
useful summary method is info info
returns other useful summary information
including the kind of index the column
labels the number of rows and columns
and the datatype of each column pandas
data French slices also support
broadcasting we'll learn more about this
later here a slice is assigned a scalar
value in this case man or not a number
the slice consists of every third row
starting from 0 in the last column we
can see head 6 to see the changes we can
also call info and notice the last
column has fewer non null entries than
the others due to our assigning name to
every third elements the columns of a
data frame themselves are a specialized
data structure called a series
extracting a single column from a data
frame returns a series notice the series
extracted has its own head method and
inherits its name attribute from the
data frame column to extract a numerical
entries from the series use the values
attribute the data in this series
actually form a numpy array which is
what the values attribute actually
yields a panda series then is a
one-dimensional labelled numpy array and
a data frame is a two-dimensional
labelled array whose columns a series
we've seen a few concepts extending what
we already knew including head tail info
index values and series take some time
to practice using these concepts in the
exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
