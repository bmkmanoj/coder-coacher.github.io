class of joints called mutating joints
this name comes from deep liars mutate
function would you use to return a copy
of the data set that has had one or more
columns added to it like mutate the
mutating joins we turn a copy of the
primary data set that has had one or
more columns added to it from the
secondary data set the mutating joins
differ from each other with respect to
which values and rows they return in the
final result you saw in the last video
that left join returns all of the rows
from the first data set along with any
rows that match from the second data set
you also saw that right join does the
exact opposite it returns all the rows
from the second data set along with any
rows that match from the first data set
deep liars last two mutating joins also
complement each other inner join returns
only the rows from the first data set
that have a match in the second data set
is the most exclusive join because every
row in the result must appear in both
data sets so for example here we have
rows for John and Paul and no one else
full join does just the opposite it
returns every row in either data set is
the most inclusive join because it
retains all of the information in the
original tables here we end up with four
rows one each for Mick John Paul and
Keith inner join and full joined use the
same syntax as left join and right join
so will the non mutating joins that we
see in Chapter two note that this syntax
takes the data frame as the first
argument and recall that each of the
joint functions returns a data frame as
a result this means that the join
functions are natural candidates for
writing pipes with the pipe operator if
you've never seen the pipe operator
before it takes the result on its left
hand side and passes it into the
function on its right hand side so this
bit of code would be the equivalent of
this the pipe operator really begins to
shine when you compose multiple
functions together instead of writing a
long nested call you can write a series
of easy-to-understand steps the deep
liar package is built around the pipe
operator and they'll come as no surprise
that it's easy to combine deep liar
functions together with the pipe
including the joint functions for
example we can use a pipe to
all the members of The Rolling Stones
across our data sets to summarize there
are four types of joins that allow you
to augment one data frame with
information from another these are
called the mutating joins and they
include left join which prioritizes the
first data set right join which
prioritizes the second inner join which
only retains rows appear in both data
sets and full join which retains every
road that appears in any data set we'll
practice these joints in the exercises
along with the pipe syntax</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
