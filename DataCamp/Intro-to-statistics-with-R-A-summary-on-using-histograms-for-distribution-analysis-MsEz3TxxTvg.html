histograms to display an entire
distribution because they sometimes
reveal information that summary
statistics gloss over or won't tell us
and many if not most distributions that
we deal with are going to be normal but
some distributions are not normal for
example we looked at the bimodal
distribution where the two classrooms of
kids who were sick the ones who were
treated and not treated we looked at
positively skewed distributions
negatively skewed we looked at uniform
distributions so that was like the white
wine distribution in France
that's uniform or another phrase for
that is platykurtic and the last type
that we looked at was leptokurtic that
was like the white wine distribution and
argentina would that one steep peak is
also called a leptokurtic distribution
and now I just wanted to show you a
couple of advanced visuals or advanced
histograms and if we could zoom in on
these if you could zoom in on the top
and then the bottom since we talked
about longitude and latitude and we've
talked about histograms I wanted to show
just these two very cool graphics that I
just picked off the internet and what
this shows is the world population as a
function of latitude and as a function
of longitude so if you look at the top
graph what we're plotting is you get
this like nice normal distribution
pretty much right what that means is
most people live around the equator and
as you move away from the equator fewer
and fewer people live in those places
the same can't be said about longitude
right so if we look at the bottom graph
we don't get a nice normal distribution
instead we get like a peak here a peak
here what are those Peaks well here this
peak is probably China this
reflects the population in India right
so where you have a normal distribution
of population around latitude centered
around the equator the same can't be
said for longitude the distribution is
not normal the population distribution
is not normal
across longitude</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
