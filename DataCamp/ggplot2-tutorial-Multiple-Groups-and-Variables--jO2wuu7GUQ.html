plots let's see how we can use them when
comparing multiple groups or variables
let's begin with groups by which I mean
levels within a factor variable in this
case is the eating habits of different
mammals the distribution that we are
interested in is the amount of total
sleep time experienced by each mammal up
until this point we would have used a
plot like this which is just jittered
points but we've seen that we can also
use box plots so that's pretty
straightforward I should point out that
although we could use box plots in this
case is not really reasonable since the
insectivore group only has five
observations a problem with box plots is
that they don't show information about
the number of observations we can remedy
this problem by setting the width of
each box relative to the end value for
each group density plots could work in
this situation the advantage here is
that we can overlay multiple density
plots on top of each other so we can
compare distributions more easily which
is pretty nice
however we once again lose information
about the group size since it appears
that insectivores the blue curve is very
abundant to correct for this we can wait
each density curve according to the
proportional number of observations of
each group the resulting plot shows that
herbivores are the most abundant group
and there are very few observations and
insectivores if we want to see multiple
density plots side-by-side we could
facet our plots but there is an
alternative the violin plot is a
relatively new plot type which is
gaining in popularity the violin plot
basically puts a density plot on to a
vertical axis and then mirrors it to
create a symmetrical two-dimensional
shape this can really aid in comparing
different distributions just like with
the regular density plot we should also
consider weighting each group according
to its end value once again we see that
insectivores are not very abundant with
these plots we can compare many groups
within a variable the other type of
comparison I mentioned was to compare
and separate variables for that let's
take a look at a classic example the
eruption time and waiting duration of
the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone
National Park at the outside it appears
as if the main relationship between
these two variables is linear which
would be correct
but more subtle than that the data is
also bimodal on both axes that is you
either wait a long time and get a long
eruption or you wait a short time and
get a short eruption there are
relatively few data points in between
for this we can use a 2d density plot
which appears as something like a
contour plot if you've ever seen a
topographical map the concept is the
same the more concentric a ring is the
higher the density a nice effect here is
to fill in the region's according to
their density we encountered
monochromatic color scales in the first
two courses which I advocated for in the
case of continuous data however the
veridian's color scale has recently
gained popularity and looks for some
advantages of this scale in the
exercises a two dimensional density plot
emphasizes the bimodal nature of this
data set so sometimes it can be quite
useful to consider distributions in two
dimensions will see density plots make a
reappearance when we talk about ternary
plots in the next chapter where we have
three variables another advantage of the
ggplot2 structure is that we can use the
underline statistics with a different
genome so instead of producing a contour
or fill density plot we can calculate
the density by representing the values
using a grid of circles whose size
varies according to the underlying
density okay that's enough discussion
for now let's take a closer look at
two-dimensional density plots in the
exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
