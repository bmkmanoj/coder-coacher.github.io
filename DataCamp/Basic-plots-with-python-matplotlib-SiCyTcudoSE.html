scientist at data gap in this
intermediate Python course will further
enhance your Python skills specifically
for data science you will learn how to
visualize data and to store data and new
data structures along the way you will
master control structures which you will
need to customize the flow of your
scripts and algorithms well finish this
chapter with a case study where you'll
blend together everything you've learned
to solve a cool problem this first
chapter is about data visualization
which is a very important part of data
analysis first of all you will use it
continuously to explore your data sets
the better you understand your data the
better you'll be able to extract
insights and once you found those
insights again you'll need visualization
to be able to share your precious
insights with other people as an example
have a look at this beautiful plot it's
made by the Swedish professor hands
rustling it's talks about global
development have been viewed millions of
times what makes them so intriguing is
that by making beautiful plots he allows
the data to tell their own story here we
see a bubble chart or each bubble
represents a country the bigger the
bubble the bigger the country's
population so the two biggest bubbles
here are China and India there are two
axis horizontal axis shows the GDP per
capita in u.s. dollars
the vertical axis shows life expectancy
we clearly see that people live longer
in countries with a higher GDP per
capita still there's huge difference in
life expectancy between countries on the
same income level now why did I tell you
all of this well because by the end of
this chapter you'll be able to build
this beautiful plot yourself there are
many visualization packages in Python
but a model of them all is matplotlib
you will need a sub package PI plot by
convention the sub package is imported
SP LT like this for our first example
let's try to gain some insight in the
evolution of the world population I have
a list with years here here and lists
with corresponding populations expressed
in billions pop in the year 1970 for
example 3.7 billion people lived on
planet Earth to plot this data as a line
chart we call PLT dot plot and use our
two lists as argument
the first argument corresponds with our
result Alexis and the second one to the
vertical axis you might think that a
plot will pop up right now but button is
pretty lazy it will wait for the show
function to actually display the plot
this is because you might want to add
some extra ingredients to your plots
before actually displaying it such as
titles and label customizations I'll
talk about that some more later on
just remember this the plot function
despite the water plot and how to plot
it show actually displays a plot when we
look at our plot we see that the years
are indeed shown on horizontal axis and
a population on vertical axis there are
four data points and Python draws a line
between them in 1950 the world
population was run 2.5 billion in 2010
it was 7 billion so the world population
is almost tripled in 60 years that's
pretty scary
what is population keeps on growing like
that will the world become overpopulated
you'll find out in the exercises let me
first introduce you to another type of
plot the scatter plot to create it we
can start from the code from before this
time though you can change the plot
function to scatter resulting scatter
plot simply plots all the individual
data points Python doesn't connect the
dots with a line for many applications
the scatter plot is often a better
choice than the line plot so remember
the scatter function well you could also
say that this is a more almost way of
plotting your data because you can
clearly see that the plot is based on
just four data points
now that is got the basics of metal clip
covers it's your turn to build some
awesome plots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
