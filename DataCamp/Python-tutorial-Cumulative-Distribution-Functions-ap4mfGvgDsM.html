bee swarm plots however there is a limit
to their efficacy for example imagine we
wanted to plot the county level voting
data for all states east of the
Mississippi River and all states west we
make the same swarm plot as before but
using a data frame that contains all
states with each being classified as
being east or west of the Mississippi
the bee swarm plot has a real problem
the edges have overlapping data points
which was necessary in order to fit all
of the points onto the plot we are now
up to skating data so using a bee swarm
plot is not the best option here as an
alternative we can compute an empirical
cumulative distribution function or EC
DF again this is best explained by
example here is a picture of an EC DF of
the percentage of swing state votes that
went to Obama an x value of an EC DF is
the quantity you are measuring in this
case the percent of vote that went to
Obama the Y value is the fraction of
data points that have a value smaller
than the corresponding x value for
example 20% of counties and swing States
had 36 percent or less of its people
vote for Obama
similarly 75 percent of counties and
swing states had 50% or less of its
people vote for Obama let's look at how
to make one of these from our data the
x-axis is the sorted data we need to
generate it using the numpy function
sort so we need to import numpy which we
do using the alias NP as is commonly
done then we can use mps or to generate
our x data the y-axis is evenly spaced
data points with a maximum of one which
we can generate using the NPA range
function and then dividing by the total
number of data points once we specify
the x and y values we plot the points
now by default
PLT plot plots lines connecting data
points to plot our EC DF we just want
points to achieve this we
the string period and the string none to
the keyword arguments marker and line
style respectively as you remember from
my forceful reminder in an earlier video
we label the axes finally we use the PLT
margins function to make sure none of
the data points run over the side of the
plot area choosing a value of point zero
two gives us a 2% buffer all around the
plot the result is the beautiful EC DF I
just showed you you can also easily plot
multiple EC DFS on the same plot for
example here are the EC DFS for the
three swing states we see that Ohio and
Pennsylvania are similar with
Pennsylvania having slightly more
democratic counties
Florida on the other hand had a greater
fraction of heavily Republican counties
in my workflow I almost always plot the
EC DF first it shows all the data and
gives a complete picture of how the data
are distributed but don't take my word
for how great a CD f's are you can see
for yourself in the exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
