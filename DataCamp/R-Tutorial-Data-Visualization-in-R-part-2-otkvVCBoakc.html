to start by looking at one variable at a
time to see whether it conforms to our
expectations for numerical data a common
expectation is the values should conform
approximately to the Gaussian or normal
distribution described by the bell curve
shown here under this assumption the
observed data values are clustered
around the mean value here the value 0
indicated with the solid red line
becoming less likely as we move further
away from the central value the standard
measure of scatter or spread in Gaussian
data is the standard deviation and this
plot shows how the likelihood of
observing data values decreases as we
move out from the mean first one
standard deviation away the green dashed
lines then to the yellow lines and
finally three the blue lines these
expectations are not always met but they
have led to the development of several
useful graphical tools for
characterizing numerical data here the
upper-left plot shows 200 simulated
Gaussian data values and the other three
plots show their characterizations using
three of these tools the upper right
plot shows the histogram probably the
best known of these tools it is
constructed by first dividing the range
of the data values into subsets or bins
and then counting the number of values
that appear in each bin the basic
histogram is a bar plot where each bar
represents a bin and the height
represents the number of observations in
that bin the lower left shows a density
plot which we can think of as a
normalized and smooth histogram if our
data values approximately satisfied the
Gaussian data assumption this plot
should look like the bell curve shown
earlier because this example is based on
simulated Gaussian data this density
plot should have the shape and it does
at least roughly the fact that it is
only approximately bell-shaped as a
consequence of the finite size of our
data
imple and it emphasizes that while
density plots are good enough to be very
useful they are not perfect the lower
right shows a normal QQ plot not as well
known as these other tools but extremely
useful it is constructed by first
sorting the data values from smallest to
largest and then plotting them against
an x-axis derived from the Gaussian
distribution for Gaussian data these
sorted points should be very close to
the solid reference line shown in this
plot this plot was generated with the QQ
plot function from the car package which
provides 95% confidence intervals the
dashed red lines around the reference
line to help us see how well our data
conforms to the Gaussian assumption
since all of these data points fall
within these limits the Gaussian data
assumption appears excellent here as it
should here are the results when we
apply these tools to a real data set the
upper left plot shows the duration
values from the Geiser data frame in the
mass package describing the durations of
299 eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser
in Yellowstone National Park
as before the other three plots show the
histogram in the upper right the density
plot in the lower left and the normal QQ
plot in the lower right here the density
plot is probably the most useful
highlighting the fact that these data
values exhibit a bimodal distribution
with not one but two most likely values
now it's your turn the following
exercises give you a chance to try these
tools for yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
