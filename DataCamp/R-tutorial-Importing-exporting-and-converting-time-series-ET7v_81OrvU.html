xes objects from scratch these were
rather contrived simply to illustrate
the mechanics of XTS construction know
what xes objects looked like internally
but most real life cases you'll be
working with data that already exists
usually from some other process maybe
it's a time series from a colleague in a
different data class in other cases you
may find yourself importing data from an
external source which may meet all of
your criteria for X yes but it comes
from a file instead of another our
object in this chapter we'll look at
converting types using x CS reading data
into R as an X es object as well as
exporting XTS objects from our for other
uses first let's take a look at the most
useful and simple way to convert most
objects you'll encounter in our into X
yes this will work in 90% of cases as
XTS was designed from the beginning to
make working with ours myriad time
series and time classes as easy and
flexible as possible till straight how
easy this is we use the famous sunspots
data that ships with our sunspots is a
TS object which is fairly challenging to
work with as it is regular ie fixed
intervals but it is less intuitive it in
structure to convert we only need to use
as X Y s and you see the series now is
well-structured and looks like you might
expect a time series to look to import
data from the outside we can follow a
similar pattern here we can read data
into our using built-in functions such
as read that table and coerce into x ts
at that point as we mentioned earlier
since X D s is a proper subclass of zoo
you could also leverage the powerful
tools Zoo provides to make life even
easier read dot zoo is a great tool to
read in data as the time series and once
again as dot X D S will dutifully
convert it to its final XD S Class if so
desired finally you might be finished
with all your data manipulation and
transformation in XTS and you might need
to send it along to a process outside of
our once again zoo provides a great
function called right dot zoo which will
do a lot of the heavy lifting of
extracting and formatting your x for you
if you are merely saving data for use in
our later I recommend you save it using
the base save RDS function this is
optimised for objects like XD s it makes
it fast and efficient to read and write
data to disk
now that you've seen a bit of moving
data into and out of XS let's give it a
try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
