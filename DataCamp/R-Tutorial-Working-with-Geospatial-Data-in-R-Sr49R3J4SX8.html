and our perhaps your first question is
what makes data spatial it's quite
simple whenever our data is associated
with locations we think about it as
spatial when those locations are on the
earth will often be a little more
specific and called the data geospatial
a location is most unambiguously
described by a set of coordinates and a
description of what coordinate system is
being used you are already familiar with
one coordinate reference system
geographical coordinates the usual
latitude longitude pairs we use to
specify where something as on the globe
in this chapter you'll be working with
house sales from 2015 where I live a
town called Corvallis when a house sells
the most obvious data is the price in
the address of the house but there may
also be data on how big the house was
how many bedrooms it has how many
bathrooms how much land and what
condition it is in all this data is
associated with a house at a specific
location so we can consider this spatial
data although the address specifies the
location it isn't a set of coordinates
to work with these house sales we need
to convert the address to a set of
coordinates latitude specifies the
position north to south and longitude
the position east to west often the
north-south and east-west abbreviations
are dropped and instead we use positive
numbers for one direction north for
latitude and east for longitude and
negative numbers for the other direction
south for latitude and west for
longitude in math we are so used to
specifying location and X&amp;amp;Y that you'll
also often see longitude list at first
since it specifies the horizontal or x
coordinate let's take a look at these
house sales as you'll see them in a data
frame in our each row is a sale there
are latitude and longitude columns that
describe the location of the sale and
then all the other columns describe
other attributes of that sale the sale
price number of bedrooms etc when the
data is associated with point locations
that is a single set of spatial
coordinates we describe it as point data
you'll see some other types of spatial
data in the last section of this chapter
when spatial data is stored in a data
frame you already have tools to display
for example using ggplot2 we can plot
all the house sale locations by mapping
the exposition to longitude and the y
position to latitude this doesn't look
like much of a map because it's missing
spatial cues like terrain and roads that
help orient us when we're looking at
spatial data in this chapter we'll use
the Gigi map package to add these
spatial cues to our plots the Gigi map
package downloads maps from Web Services
and adds them as a layer and ggplot2
plots here's an example of getting a map
of New York City we know the location
and latitude and longitude we use the
get map function to download the map
passing in the location in a zoom
parameter then we pass the result to the
Gigi map function which displays the map
over the next few exercises you'll see
how we can combine the Gigi map function
with our original ggplot2 map to add
some context to our map of house sales
but first you'll play with Gigi map to
learn where Corvallis --is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
