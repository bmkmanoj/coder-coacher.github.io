individual data frames let's investigate
sharing information between data frames
using their indexes this is essential
for combining data frames later as
indexes are the means by which data
frame rows are labeled let's make a
brief note on terminology the plural of
index in English can be indexes or
indices both are acceptable usage let's
adopt the convention of using indices as
the plural of index when referring to
individual labels within an index data
structure by contrast we can use indexes
as the plural of index with reference to
many index data structures associated
with several Panda series or data frames
this is not a standard convention but it
helps us resolve ambiguity in thinking
about say sets of indices within many
indexes to start let's load two data
frames of temperature data recorded from
Pittsburgh in 2013 for both calls to
read CSV we use the index call argument
to specify which column becomes the data
frame index month in both cases remember
the index is a privileged column in
pandas providing convenient access to
series or data frame rows we can examine
our data frames W mean and W max more
closely the mean temperature F and Max
temperature F columns are respectively
the average and maximum daily
temperatures in Fahrenheit observed
during three-month intervals or quarters
for both data frames the column month is
the data frame index the month listed in
each index row is the first month of
each quarter by virtue of how the CSV
files are sorted the index of W mean is
in alphabetical order while the index of
W max is in chronological order the
former gives a distorted sense of
time-dependent trends the data frame
indexes are accessed directly with the
dot index attribute both W mean and W
Max have indexes of type object because
the index labels are strings the type
function shows us the data type of the
indexes
we can define a list called ordered to
impose a deliberate ordering on the
index labels of W mean the data frame
reindex method creates a new data frame
W mean two with the same data as W mean
but with a new row ordering according to
the input list ordered we can see that W
mean 2 has the desired chronological
ordering the original alphabetically
ordered data frame can be recovered with
the data frame sort index method pandas
index labels a typically sortable data
such as numbers strings or date times
the input argument to the re-index
method can also be another data frame
index for instance here we use the index
from w max to reindex w mean in
chronological order when a suitably
indexed data frame is available the
reindex method spares us having to
create a list manually or having to sort
the index the specific index labels
provided to the re index method are
important for instance if we invoke re
index again using an input list
containing a label that is not in the
original data frame index December in
this case an entirely new row is
inserted and filled with the null value
na n or not a number we can also use
reindex to see where data frame rows
overlaps for instance here we re index w
max with the index of W mean 3 showing
that W max does not have a row labeled
December either using the method dropped
n a removes entire rows in which null
values occur this is a common first step
when merging data frames finally we
should realize that order counts that is
w max re index of w-mint
index is not the same as W mean tree
index of W max index the latter fixes
the row order as desired in W mean the
former replicates the misleading
alphabetical row order in W max this is
likely not desire
try reindex and dataframes now in some
of the exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
