financial market data is the
amalgamation of fear greed noise and
generally a whole salad of millions of
people across the world taking bets
practically simultaneously on the price
of financial instruments given this fact
it is plain to see why so many financial
advisors say past performance is not
indicative of future results while
there's a temptation to try and create
trading strategies that wonderful
performance on past data also known as
in sample data there have been numerous
studies showing that when too much
effort is placed into this activity that
the system fails going forward an unseen
data or what is more formally referred
to as out-of-sample data this is more
commonly known as overfitting which is
the act of trying to tailor a back test
to look as good as possible smoothest
line highest profit whatever the
criteria may be rather than seeing the
Baptist as an evaluation of a trading
system in order to avoid such phenomena
trading systems should strive to have as
few parameters essentially the knobs you
can turn to change settings as possible
why because the number of system
configurations increases exponentially
with parameters that is consider a grid
search that has five separate settings
for each parameter a one parameter
system would need only five runs a two
parameter system would Eid would need 25
a three parameter system would already
need 125 and beyond that the numbers
start to get very high very fast
furthermore a trading strategy should
not perform much differently when the
parameters are slightly altered for
instance a trend following system should
have similar results for similar
settings of its trend filter for
instance a trend following system that
buys a stock when its 50-day moving
average crosses above its 200-day moving
average should behave similarly if those
numbers are 45 and 210 respectively
lastly one can conduct statistical
hypothesis tests to determine whether or
not the following properties are true
first of all is there a relationship
between an indicator and future returns
secondly is there statistical evidence
for the signal process to generate
outperformance again
some benchmark while Quan strats
built-in mechanics to protect against
overfitting are beyond the scope of this
class
these are nevertheless important things
to keep in mind let's move on to some
exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
