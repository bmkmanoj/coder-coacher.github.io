created and worked with factors of
different types you have even computed
that length and seen how to operate with
them on a basic level a last important
elements to make your experience with
factors complete is factor sub setting
as the name reveals it basically comes
down to selecting parts of your vector
to end up with a new vector which is a
subset of your original vector remember
the remain vector that we built in one
of the previous videos here it is again
as a named vector suppose you now want
to select the first element from this
vector corresponding to the number of
spaces that are left you can use square
brackets for this we right remain open
brackets 1 closed brackets the number 1
inside the square brackets indicates
that you want to get the first element
from the remain vector result is again a
vector because a single number is
actually a vector of length 1 this new
vector contains the number 11 the name
of the only element spades is
conveniently gets if you instead wanted
to select the third elements
corresponding to the remaining diamonds
you could go to remain followed by 3 in
square brackets this was subsetting
using an index but if you're dealing
with names vectors you can also use the
names to perform the selection instead
of using the index 1 to select the first
elements you can use the name space you
type remain followed by spades as a
go-to string inside square brackets
result is exactly the same as using the
numeric index 1 can you tell how you can
refer to the third element and a vector
with the name you've probably figured
out that you simply have to type
diamonds inside square brackets this
time suppose now you want to select the
elements in a vector that gives the
remaining spades and clubs in a
one-liner and start them in a new
variable remain black instead of using a
single number inside the square brackets
you can use a vector to specify which
indices you want to select because
spades are at index 1 and clubs at the
next for you
use a vector containing 1 &amp;amp; 4 inside
square brackets
how the resulting vector is ordered
depends on the order of the indices
inside the selection vector if you
change
c14 to c4 1 you will get a vector where
the clubs come first
of course subsetting multiple elements
can also be done by using names at least
if you're dealing with a named vector to
get the same result as the command above
we right remain open brackets then a
vector containing the character strings
clubs and spades closed brackets there's
yet another way to subset vectors that's
specifically useful if you want to
select all the elements from a vector
except one suppose you want to create a
vector that contains all the information
that's in the remain vector except for
the space count you can write remain
open brackets minus 1 closed brackets
this command removes the first index
from to remain vector of course you can
also remove multiple elements like this
for example the minus operator does not
work with names though this command for
example draws an error
these subsetting techniques will enable
you to select only the elements of
interest from your vector and continue
your analysis with these before I
unleash you to the last set of exercise
of this chapter I want to talk about one
last way to perform vector subsetting
using a logical vector to do this you
typically use a logical vector that has
the same length as a vector you try to
subset the elements for which the
corresponding value in a selecting
vector is true will be kept in a subset
the vector elements that correspond to
false will not be kept let's try to
select the 2nd and 4th element from the
remain vector using a logical vector to
this sense we construct a vector
containing false true false and true and
put it inside the square brackets of
course you could also have created a new
vector first and then use it to perform
the selection like this now you might
expect that ARCT rows an error if you
try to use a logical vector
that is shorter than the vector on which
you want to perform the subsetting
drying this out shows a different
reality suppose you use a vector
containing only two logicals instead of
four no error whatsoever that's because
our perform something called recycling
are smart enough to see that the vector
of logicals you passed it is shorter
than remain vector so it repeats the
contents of the vector until it has the
same length as remain this means that
behind the scenes this line of code is
executed giving result that we've
observed before even if you use a vector
of length three to do the selection the
factor is recycled to end up with a
vector of length four thus appending the
first element again
so this statements gets converted to
this statement behind the scenes that's
why their outputs are the same up to you
now to solve the challenges and use your
newfound knowledge to beat a casino in
the next chapter I'll be talking about
matrices see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
