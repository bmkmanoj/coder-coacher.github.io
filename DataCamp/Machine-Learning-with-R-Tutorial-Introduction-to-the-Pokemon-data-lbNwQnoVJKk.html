learned about the k-means algorithm to
synthetic data in this final set of
exercises you apply your learning to
real-world data set this data set is
about 800 Pokemon from the Pokemon games
sorry this isn't from Pokemon go this
may not be a data set where you have
already built intuition this is normal
in data science you may want to gain
some intuition about the data by
researching Pokemon in the Pokemon games
or Israel have you do by poking around
in the data the data was originally
collected by Alberto Broadus and it's
hosted on kaggle at the address on the
screen the data contains six features
for each pokemon hitpoints attack
defense special attack special defense
and speed this is unlabeled data because
there's not a single outcome that we
want to predict just some measurements
of each pokemons abilities for the data
curious more information on pokemon and
these features can be found at the
second address on the screen along with
exploring the data this is another way
to build intuition about the data in the
next set of exercises you'll have
multiple steps to complete their typical
and handling real-world data the first
is determining which variables to use
for clustering it is important to
consider which features should be used
in the clustering exercise sometimes
trying multiple subsets of features is
an important step to find patterns in
the data the next and something will
delay to later chapter is scaling the
data if the features being used in
modeling are different units or scale
scaling the data to common measurement
is often completed in order to improve
the insights gained from unsupervised
learning in this example you'll be
finding homogeneous subgroups of Pokemon
the number of clusters is not known
beforehand she'll have to make a
determination in real-world data a nice
clean elbow on the scree plot rarely
exists so as an analyst you'll have to
use some judgment in this step finally a
common output of any analysis exercise
is a visual representation of the
outcomes this can also be helpful to
gain some additional intuition from the
data and the resulting models this may
seem like a lot but will guide you
through step by step providing hits and
templates all
along the way let's practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
