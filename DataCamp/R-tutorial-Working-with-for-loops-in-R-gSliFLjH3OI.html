is a good time to review them and then
in the following exercises we'll teach
you a few new things about four loops
you might not have seen before
four loops are used for iteration let's
take a look at an example from the
intermediate our course Prime's list is
a list of the first six Prime's our for
loop says for each value of i from 1 to
the length of Prime's list print the IFL
amount of primes lists when we run that
in our I starts at the value 1 and the
first element of Prime's list is printed
I increases to the next value 2 and the
second element of primes list is printed
and so on until the final iteration
where is 6 the length of Prime's list
and the sixth element is printed let's
examine that loop a little closer there
are three parts common to all four loops
first the sequence the sequence
describes two things
the name will give to the object that
indexes the iteration in our case I and
the values that this index should
iterate over in our case the integers
from 1 to the length of Prime's list the
second part of the for loop is the body
this comes between our curly braces and
describes the operations to iterate very
back to our index I in this case print
the if-- element of primes list finally
the third common part of a for loop is
the definition of where to store the
result our loop here doesn't actually
have this part it prints to the screen
rather than saving the output let's take
a look at another example that you will
build upon and the following exercises
here is a data frame DF with four
columns our goal is to loop over the
columns each time calculating the median
what should the sequence be well we want
to do something for each column starting
at the first and ending at the last
let's say I from 1 to n Col DF the
number of columns and DF how about the
body it's very similar to our previous
loop print the median of the eyes column
of DF you might not have seen a column
pulled from a data frame using double
square brackets before a data frame is
built on top of the list
each element as a column since double
brackets subsetting pulls out elements
inside a list here it pulls out columns
from our data frame once again we
haven't gotten the output since we are
just printing these column medians onto
the screen it would be much more useful
if at the end of the loop we had an
output vector containing these medians
over the next few exercises you'll learn
two things first a safer way to generate
the sequence and second how instead of
printing the results we could save them
into an output object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
