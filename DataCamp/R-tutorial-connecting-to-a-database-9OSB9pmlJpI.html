our the previous course dealt with
accessing data stored in flat files or
Excel files in a professional setting
though you'll also encounter data start
in relational databases in this video
I'll briefly talk about what a
relational database is and then I'll
explain how you can connect to it in the
next video I'll explain how you can
import data from it so what's a
relational database there's no better
way to show this and with an example
take this database called company
contains three tables employees products
and sales like a flat file information
is displayed in table formats the
employees table has five records and
tree fields namely ID name and start it
adds the ID here serves as a unique key
for each row or record next the products
table contains the details on four
products we're dealing with data from a
telecom company that's selling both with
and without a contract also here each
product has an identifier finally
there's a sales table at least what
products were sold by who when and for
what price notice here that the ID is an
employee ID and Product ID correspond to
the IDS that you can find in the
employees and products tables
respectively the third sale for example
was done by the employee with ID six so
Julie she sought a product with iodine
nine so the business unlimited contract
these relations make this database very
powerful you only star all information
once in nicely separated tables but you
can connected dots between different
records to model what's happening how
the data in a relational database is
stored as shuffled around when you make
adaptations depends on the so called
database management system our DBMS open
source implementations such as MySQL
PostgreSQL and SQLite are very popular
there are also proprietary
implementations such as Oracle database
and Microsoft SQL Server practically all
these implementations use SQL or sequel
as the language for querying and
maintaining the database SQL stands for
structured query language depending on
the type of database you want to connect
to you'll have to use different packages
in our supposed it company database I
introduced before is a
my SQL database this means you'll need
to our MySQL package for PostgreSQL
you'll need our PostgreSQL for article
you'll use our Oracle and so on how you
interact with the database so which are
functions you use to access and
manipulate a database is a pacified and
another our package called DB I in more
technical terms
DB I is an interface and our MySQL is
the implementation let's install the our
MySQL package which automatically
installs the DB I package as well
loading only the DB I package will be
enough to get us started the first step
is creating a connection to remote MySQL
database you do this with DB connect as
follows the first argument specifies the
driver that you will use to connect to
the MySQL database it sure looks a bit
strange but the MySQL function from the
our my sequel package simply constructs
the driver the TB Connect kayuu's next
you have to specify the database name or
databases hosted to rich port you want
to connect and finally the credentials
to authenticate yourself this is an
actual database that we're hosting so
you can try this commands yourself
results of the DB connect call um is a
DB I connection object you'll need to
pass this object to whatever function
you're using to interact with the Beit
database before we do that let's get
familiar with this connection object in
the exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
