of our data but there's no substitute
for just looking at it the head function
shows us the first six rows by default
if you add one additional argument n you
can control how many rows to display for
example head lunch with N equals 15
we'll display the first 15 rows of the
data we can also view the bottom of
lunch with the tail function which
displays the last six rows by default
but again that behavior can be altered
in the same way with the end argument
viewing the top and bottom of your data
only gets you so far sometimes the
easiest way to identify issues with the
data are to plot them here we use hist
to plot a histogram of the percent free
and reduced lunch column which quickly
gives us a sense of the distribution of
this variable it looks like the value of
this variable falls between 50 and 60
for 20 out of the 46 years contained in
the lunch data set finally we can
produce a scatterplot with the plot
function to look at the relationship
between two variables in this case we
clearly see that the percent of lunches
that are either free or reduced-price
has been steadily rising over the years
going from roughly 15 to 70 percent
between 1969 and 2014 to review head and
tail can be used to view the top and
bottom of your data respectively of
course you can also just print your data
to the console which may be okay when
working with small data sets like lunch
but it's definitely not recommended when
working with much larger data sets
lastly hist will show you a histogram of
a single variable and plot can be used
to produce a scatterplot showing the
relationship between two variables it's
time to practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
