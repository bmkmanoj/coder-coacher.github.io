built-in open function to open text
files what if you now want to import a
flat file and assign it to a variable if
all the data are numerical you can use
the package numpy to import the data as
an umpire array now why would we want to
do this first off numpy arrays are the
Python standard for storing numerical
data they are efficient fast and clean
secondly numpy arrays are often
essential for other packages such as
scikit-learn a popular machine learning
package for python it numpy itself has a
number of built-in functions that make
it far easier and more efficient for us
to import data as arrays enter the numpy
functions load text and Jen from text to
use either of these we first need to
import numpy we then call load text and
pass at the file name as the first
argument along with the delimiter as the
second argument note that the default
delimiter is any white space so we'll
usually need to specify it explicitly
there are a number of additional
arguments you may wish to specify if for
example your data consists of numerics
and your header has strings in it such
as in the endless digits data you will
want to skip the first row by calling
load text with the arguments skip rows
equal to 1 if you want only the first
and third columns of the data you'll
want to set use calls equal to the list
containing intz 0 and 2 you can also
import different data types into numpy
arrays for example setting the argument
D type equal to string will ensure that
all entries are imported as strings load
text is great for basic cases but tends
to break down when we have mixed data
types for example columns consisting of
floats and columns consisting of strings
such as we saw in the Titanic data set
now it's your turn
to have fun with low text you'll also
gain hands-on experience with other
functions that can handle mixed data
types in the next video we'll see that
although numpy arrays can
handle data of mixed types the natural
place for such data really is the data
