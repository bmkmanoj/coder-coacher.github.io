final piece of the Python lists puzzle
is manipulation so ways to change
element in your lists or to add elements
to or remove elements from your list
changing list elements is pretty
straightforward you use the same square
brackets that we've used before to
subset lists and then assign new
elements to it using the equal sign so
bow is it after another look at fam you
realize that your dad's height is not up
to date anymore as he is shrinking with
age instead of 1.89 meters it should be
1.86 to change this list element which
is at index 7 you can use this line of
code you now check out fan you'll see
that the value is updated you can even
change the entire list slice at once to
change the elements list and 1.73 you
access the first two elements with zero
column two and then assign a new list to
it do you still remember how the plus
operator was different for strings and
integers well it's again different for
lists if you use the plus sign with two
lists pythons simply pasted together
their contents in a single list suppose
you want to add your own name and height
to the fam height list this will do the
trick of course you can also store this
new list as a new variable fam x for
example finally the leading elements
from a list is also pretty
straightforward you'll have to use del
here take this line for example that
deletes the element within X 2 so Emma
from the list if you now check out fam
again you'll see that the Emma string is
gone because you've removed an index all
elements that came after Emma scooted
over by one index if you again run the
same line or again removing the element
at index 2 which is Emma's height one
point 68 meters now understanding how
Python lists actually work behind the
scenes becomes pretty important now what
actually happens when you create a new
list X like this well in a simplified
sense you're storing a list in your
computer memory and store the address of
that list so where the list is in your
computer memory in X this means that X
does not actually contain all the list
elements in trotter contains a reference
to the lists for basic operations the
difference is
not important but it becomes more so
when you start copying lists let me
clarify this with an example let's start
a list X as a new variable Y by simply
using t equal sign let's now change the
elements with the next one in the list Y
as follows the funky thing is that if
you now check out X again also here the
second element has changed that's
because when you copied X to Y with the
equal sign you copied a reference to the
list not the actual values themselves
when you're updating an element in the
list it's one on the same list in
computer memory are changing both x and
y point to this list so the update is
visible from both variables if you want
to create a list Y that points to a new
list in the memory with the same values
you'll need to use something else an
equal sign I can use the list function
like this are you slicing to select all
list elements explicitly if you now make
a change to the list Y points to X is
not affected if this was a bit too much
to take in don't worry the exercises
will help you understand list
manipulation and the subtle inner
workings of Lists I'm sure you'll do
great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
