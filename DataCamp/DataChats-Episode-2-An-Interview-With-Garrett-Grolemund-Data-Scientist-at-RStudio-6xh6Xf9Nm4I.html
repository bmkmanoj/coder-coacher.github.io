data camp
I'm here with Garrett grummond from our
studio all right I'm Garrett
I've made some courses with data camp on
deep liar or markdown Gigi vis and now
the our Studio IDE Garrett's one of our
most seasoned instructors so
particularly excited to be with here
with him today so we actually just got
done recording the videos for Garrett's
second deep liar course of course on on
joining data in our with deep R which
I'm very excited about and and I thought
I'd just snag him for a few minutes to
ask him some questions about things that
are going on in his life
what he sees happening in the art
community things that he's particularly
excited about etc so alright let's get
started so my first question is how did
you discover our well I discovered are
in college I some people don't know why
I originally say psychology instead of
statistics and I was always interesting
how people learn that sort of thing and
I got calls I got some really bad advice
which was study what you love but then I
realized I wanted a job one day and I
didn't like my chances of psychology so
I looked at what courses I had taken and
to do anything in psychology academic
you need no statistics because of the
research and I figured out I could get
in masters degree in statistics if i
play my cards right so I did and in my
interest statistics course they want us
to use like some hokey software that I
think it's called data desk or something
but it you had to pay for it it wasn't
that good but the TA said you know
there's this this free language it does
the same stuff out there it's called our
and this was like 2001 2002 so you can
imagine what I always like back then but
I said hey free sounds good I'm gonna
start using it does that thing is he
never told us how to read ate it into
our so I spent a lot of my homework just
typing in data census it's such a
frustrating experience it's surprising I
still use our today but that's how I got
started
very good see if then using are for how
many years now you do the math well
about 15 I mean if you round it about 15
okay very cool so you you recently wrote
a book which you co-authored with Hadley
Wickham you
guys have done a ton work together done
a ton of great work and and the the
title of the book is our for data
science so I'm curious why it's art for
data science and not our for statistics
are for data analysis are for analytics
why that well when I really when I
originally pitched the idea to O'Reilly
it was much further back in the past the
night once we admit because it took a
long time write the book and it actually
was art for data analysis in the
beginning but somewhere along the way
the meaning of data analysis changed in
the meaning of data science changed and
in an early draft of one of the books I
actually mentioned that you know all all
rightie has double-digit number of books
I have the word data science in the
title none of them really define it
exactly but Hadley and I have some
strong opinions of what data science is
and it's a real thing and this book
explains that it explains what we think
is the day science workflow and it
really addresses that you know both
Hadley and I came from Rice where you
know he's a professor in Department
statistics that's where I did my PhD
work and we sort of merge at a time is
very interesting cuz data science was
just sort of starting and before that in
statistics departments you might have
people were actually very interested in
using statistics and making it easier to
do but that wasn't really what academic
statistics was about that's very much
the theory based so by by going after
data Sciences is kind of like putting a
flag in the ground and say no this is
what's important or at least this is
what we're focusing on and that's what
the book does it really lays out a way
to do the sort of practical side of
statistics that leads to the discovery
leads to results and you know it might
be a little more directly connected to
real life improvements in the world than
the theoretical size statistics which is
also still very important okay Carl
yeah sure so so I'll put you on the spot
then what what is data science ah well
I've come to accept that my personal
definition data science is not the one
that is going to be embraced by the
world at large but for me data science
and science are synonymous
I hope to write about this one day I
haven't yet but I I think when most
people think of science they think of
experimental science
and the way I understand it science is a
little bigger than just running
experiments and I think data science is
a complimentary side of science and if
you want to think about this way one
thing scientists are up against when
they try to explore the world is
variation variations everywhere
an experimental science has a very good
method for controlling variation you
control everything except the one
variable you want studied and you let it
vary but there are some things you can't
run an experiment on you know the
classic example would be like the
economy whose go control the entire
economy for an experiment the Federal
Reserve you know so for these things you
can't control the variation but you can
still make scientific progress yeah you
just have to analyze the variation or
work in the context of variation it
requires much more data much more
interpretation and much more dealing
with uncertainty and that is what I call
data science but obviously you know if
you look around data science its kind of
use like um the term computer science or
library science
I forget who's the computer scientists
you said anything with word sciences how
it's not a science well hopefully that
doesn't apply here now that's
interesting so in a sense much of data
science is experimental right like when
you're building models on a data set
you're coming up with hypotheses about
things that you think may be true and
then you're building models to try to
understand whether those things are
actually true and so you're conducting
miniature experiments they might not be
on a lab bench but they're in front of
your computer using our and the data
that you have to work with well I mean
when you say it that way it sounds a
little like trial and error I guess I
mean the more the clinical laboratory
setting where you're yeah shared you
yourself are intervening to prevent
things from very yeah okay fair enough
cool so our is booming the community is
growing every year
that's leading to a lot of changes in
the community in the the people and the
company that we're are is being used and
also the software itself so I'm curious
to hear from you what trends you think
are most interesting
exciting that are happening and they are
and or data science communities are
right now
sure well one thing is ours become much
more mature as a programming language a
lot of the best practices of software
development that other languages from
the very beginning were very concerned
with I think as more software developers
uses other languages are filtering down
into our so now you have things like
unit testing and code coverage hmm
reproducibility and and just familiarity
with good coding practices is something
that you find our developers are now
familiar with so that's that's good that
means that leads to better products for
us our users and then you know our is
developing the ability to communicating
in new spaces like you can use our now
with big data which i think is exciting
we'll see whether or not people actually
use big data too often but the thing
that I'm most excited about are is I
think it's reached this sort of like
epoch where what we see happening in our
is very different and much more powerful
than what happened before not because
you couldn't do any of this before but I
see it almost as an evolutionary process
and I'll give you an analogy in the
human species you know we start off as
hunter-gatherers I guess and and over
time we evolved these traces eventually
let us settle down and live in cities
and start farming and create agriculture
and once that happened all sorts of
changes happened really fast
and I think a similar process has
happened in our and I know we've talked
about this I'm gonna talk about that
appeal but our is an unusually flexible
language and to some people that's a
little discerning but the flexibility
lets you create the same set of tools in
different ways and that allows a trial
and error process to happen I've been
able to watch this with had these works
so you know Hadley started off making
the reshape package and you know some
things in there that we're important to
do and he felt like reshape allowed him
do them but there's a better way to him
so then he made the plier package which
focused on those things did a little
better and then after a while he
realized you know there's even a better
way to do this he's I mean he collects
feedback from people and stuff as though
they made the deep-fryer package
and this idea of manipulating tables of
data it's been constant all the way
through it and any of those are valid
approaches all those packages are still
there so you can still use all of them
but there's almost been this
evolutionary process where people just
buy what they use and what they're
excited about have identified the best
formats for doing these tools and I
think that there's been a lot of time in
the life of our for tools to develop to
be used be rejected to be refined and
now we're starting to see tools that
embody a set of principles in my mind
these are explicitly the principles of
the tidy verse but we've we've
discovered these principles that work
really well for data scientists mmm and
now we could start with those principles
when you make our tools and we can make
tools that work with other tools that
are relying on these same principles so
I think that's the epoch we've gone to
this place where we know how to do
really well what we need to do and it
all comes about because we had the
flexibility experiment mm-hmm and those
experiments have finally led to
something I could be really proud of I
think most our users can be proud of
yeah that's interesting so you probably
have a several forces there I work there
in addition to having people like Hadley
we're writing interesting software and
working on problems that mattered a lot
of people you also have a larger
community of people who have eyeballs on
this stuff and are giving feedback but
at the same time you have tools like git
and github for version control and for
sharing the code that make it easier for
the community to actually contribute to
these things maybe to tighten the
feedback loop a little bit and these are
things that we didn't have in the art
community 10 years ago or at least we're
not widely used in the art community ten
years ago yeah that's a very good point
yeah so one thing I definitely want to
talk to you about is uh so for anybody
who doesn't know Garrett's job at our
studio is to teach so he spends a lot of
his time teaching other people how to
use our fort for doing data science so
I'm curious I understand what what
trends you think are most exciting what
are you most excited about teaching
right now or what do you have the most
fun teaching
well they're my colleagues at our share
developing so many products that need to
be taught so there's a lot to be excited
about but what's closest to my heart is
actually some work that I'm doing to
help people teach better in the space
that we work in software on our package
by itself is just you know code in a
computer somewhere there's a side of it
that exists in your brain or the users
brain and that's that's a set of
expertise that you need to use that tool
well and that's that's where my role is
fits in you know I teach people I help
them develop the expertise and there's
lots of demand for that and we have lots
of people are very talented using
software and you know doing the
technical side of things who haven't
really had traditionally had training in
teaching or how to teach and there is
you know some scientific principles
behind it all that are fairly easy to
share but just don't really exist in a
format that people can acquire so I'm
trying to make it more easy for people
who want to teach well want to teach how
to program and are well to ramp up their
skills and then we can all benefit by
having not just the community of our
users give them feedback on the product
book many of our teachers that that make
the first community even bigger and
broader yeah yeah absolutely
cool and it's actually worth mentioning
so Garrett and I recently attended a
software carpentry instructor training
together which is pretty neat definitely
came away it was some some interesting
interesting ideas has that influenced
the way that you're thinking about this
at all oh yes well when we attended that
training there were so many moments that
were like the angelic choir like started
singing Hallelujah in background there
was this Sam say yes finally someone
gets it because uh you know when I did
study psychology it there are lots of
principles that obviously apply to
teaching you know your cognitive load
theory and multimedia learning theory
these sorts of things that you know I've
been a teacher I've been in academic
environments and public education so and
people have lots of theories about how
to teach or how you should teach better
and they they sort of miss these these
are these obvious points or what I
always thought was obvious but software
carpentry gets it and I was very
encouraged to see what they're doing
there it's very encouraged to see that
they're trying to package that into a
two-day course that people
and take their little limited and their
resources that we do like where you have
them volunteers so hopefully we could
figure out how we can sort of you know
just help them get that out there and
continue improving that material mm-hmm
yeah and for anybody who hasn't heard of
software carpentry and its sister
organization data carpentry they're
they're nonprofit organizations focused
on helping people to write better
software and do better research so
they're definitely worth checking out
so I guess something I wanted to end
with is is this so so R has a reputation
for being a notoriously quirky
programming language you might not know
this if R is your first programming
language but if you're coming from other
languages and you've had some exposure
to other languages in the past you may
notice some things that are does a
little bit differently and and you might
even argue that in some communities that
are gets a bad rap for this right but if
you understand the historical context
behind are you understand why it was
developed and the environment in which
it was developed these things sort of
makes sense and you actually can start
to appreciate what makes our special and
unique and why it's able to do some
things better than other languages so
I'm curious to hear your perspective on
that because we've talked about this
before and I know you have a strong
perspective so bullies I think what you
said in the beginning there is actually
pretty insightful you if R is your first
language it might not seem weird when
you come to it in fact it normally
doesn't the people who seem most
troubled by are in my experience are
people who already write in other
languages normally because their
software developers and they come to our
and it's unfamiliar it doesn't work the
way that other languages do where is it
if you are maybe a data scientist for
example I and you start using art it
feels unusually comfortable so why this
difference between things well I think
it's all about the flexibility of our
eye
this is one of those instances where I
have so many spots it's hard to tell
where to start but let's start with the
beginnings of our you know our has an
origin story that I think explains the
language very well you know it began at
Bell Labs that's the same place C began
UNIX began and you had these these
people in 1970s who were basically
inventing personal computing and they
also were statisticians John Tukey was
there william cleveland data
visualization guy and they want to start
using these new computers to analyze
data I mean why not it made perfect
sense but is is actually hard to do they
had these Fortran algorithms that were
perfect implementations of code that
accomplished things but they all had
different interfaces and if you were
statistician you wanted to use these
algorithms every time you switch
algorithms you sort had to relearn
everything and write code to push your
data into the algorithm and the collect
results back out and it just at the very
least it prevented any sort of
interactive process from occurring you
just couldn't do it fast enough to be
interactive so Rick Becker John Chambers
they wrote ass which is the forerunner
of our and the whole idea behind ass and
later are was that the algorithms can be
written and can be perfect and they can
be in Fortran or C or C++ or not but R
would be this thin layer of language
that acts as a bridge between you as the
person who needed to use the algorithms
get results in the algorithms themselves
which would create a sort of division of
labor that I don't think people really
appreciated yet and that's the division
of labor between people who actually
develop the routines the algorithms the
software developers and the people who
use them who these days are you know one
example of a group or data scientists or
statisticians and back then their
decisions there's a lot of overlap
between the two but but our exists of
facilitate someone who doesn't know how
to write the algorithms themselves or
someone who has better things to do with
their time than rewrite algorithms that
already exist out there to use those
algorithms if you think about Fortran or
C or Python or all these things they're
primarily made for software development
and computers are fairly new on the
scene but they've been around now for a
time going on 4050 years in most
languages these days computer languages
can be written with the end result in
mind people understand now what the best
practices of software development are
and there's been a lot of trial and
experimentation there but whenever a new
language is made it's normally because
someone's decide look this is what we
need we need to adhere to these
principles it will make our job as
software developers as easy as possible
with this offer be easy to maintain and
went on so you have languages like
Python where they actively encourage you
there's only one way to do things
that's the right way and that's because
software developments fairly well
understood well you know data science
yeah I just told you I'd start writing a
book but and that wasn't even a term if
I tell you finish the book that's a term
it's so recent that we don't have that
benefit and I think things like the tie
Devers for example are becoming DSL just
maybe quickly before moving on what does
the tie diverse tires
well the tiny versus a set of our
packages that work really well together
and and they kind of accomplish sort of
basic fundamental things you do with
data and so you could use these packages
to do these things and they don't really
do things that you couldn't do anyways
with other parts of our but they've just
been reading written recently and they
have their own philosophy that they
implement and you could use them as the
DSL a domain-specific language for
manipulating data those came about
recently and the reason they're able
come about is because you have this
language are that can connect you to
very powerful backends ran in C++ or
what not but you have flexibility as the
designer to really tweak the interface
to however you want it to be and if
you're familiar with statisticians or
data scientists you have the opportunity
here design a user experience that lets
them stay completely in the zone as they
analyze data they don't have to
translate their thoughts into computer
code to use the computer they just write
the simple are function that this might
even be named the same thing they're
thinking in their head and I think that
these things are really going to take
off I think that deep liar and the rest
of the tiny purse will be well used well
into the future and the reason we're
able to make them so fast after data
science came on the scene is because of
the flexibility that was there in our so
you know are ours quirky because it's
flexible I mean it's like Lisp its it
it does something a little different
than other things but they're real
advantages to that that we're taking
advantage of now cool very interesting
so is there anything else that you
wanted to talk about or do we cover it
all
I could keep talking it's pretty obvious
I keep talking but you know I'm really
excited for this point in history in our
you know I talked a little about the
diversity in software development and
data scientists I think that as well
understood as the software development
process is the data science process it
exists it's real we're starting to
understand what it is itself we're
starting be able to articulate it not
just articulate but improve it so I
think in the next few years we'll see
some real advances in data science and
we'll also understand better the
connections between software development
and data science because there's clearly
connections to be made they're very good
this is this is fantastic
thanks a lot welcome
