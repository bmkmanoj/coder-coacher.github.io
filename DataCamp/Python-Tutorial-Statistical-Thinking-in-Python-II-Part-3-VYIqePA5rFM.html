assumed a linear model for how the data
are generated and then estimated the
parameters that are defined by that
model but how do we assess how
reasonable it is that our observed data
are actually described by the model this
is the realm of hypothesis testing let's
start by thinking about a simpler
scenario
consider the following Ohio and
Pennsylvania are similar states they are
neighbors and they both have liberal
urban counties and lots of rural
conservative counties i hypothesize that
county level voting in these two states
have identical probability distributions
we have voting data to help test this
hypothesis stated more concretely
we are going to assess how reasonable
the observed data are assuming the
hypothesis is true the hypothesis we are
testing is typically called the null
hypothesis we might start by just
plotting the TUI CDF's of the county
level votes ooh it's pretty tough to
make a judgement here Pennsylvania seems
to be slightly more toward Obama in the
middle part of the ECD FS but not much
we can't really draw a conclusion here
we could just compare some summary
statistics again this is a tough call
the means and the medians of the two
states are really close and the standard
deviations are almost identical
so eyeballing the data is not enough to
resolve this issue we can simulate what
the data would look like if the county
level voting trends in the two states
were identically distributed we can do
this by putting the Democratic share of
the vote for all of Pennsylvania's 67
counties and Ohio's 88 counties together
we then ignore what state they belong to
next
we randomly scramble the ordering of the
counties we then reel able the first 67
to be Pennsylvania and the remaining
ones to be Ohio so we just redid the
election as if there were no difference
between Pennsylvania and Ohio
this technique of scrambling the order
of an array is called permutation it is
at the heart of simulating a null
hypothesis where we assume two
quantities are identically distributed
let's look at how we can implement this
in Python first we need to make a single
array with all of the counties in it we
do this using the NP concatenate
function notice that this function takes
a tuple of the arrays that you wish to
contact concatenate as an argument next
we use the function and P dot random dot
permutation to conveniently scramble the
entries of the array we then assign the
first 67 to be labeled Pennsylvania and
the last 88 to be labeled Ohio these
samples are called permutation samples
now let's practice doing some
permutation permutation sampling on real
data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
