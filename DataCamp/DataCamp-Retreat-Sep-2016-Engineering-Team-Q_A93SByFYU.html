Lina I'm Philip hi I'm Peter I'm the CTO
data camp I co-founded the company with
Jonathan and Martine 3 years ago Layla
camp allows everyone from different
demographics different backgrounds to
have high quality portable bio science
education we have over half a million
students now taking data science courses
on lady camp and in the last year our
team has grown from 4 to 24 people we're
going to teach engineering team my job
is to make the process of creating
courses easier for everyone basically I
make internal tools like the teach app
and a teach editor and they will help
course creators I work for the sales and
marketing engineering team we take care
of internal tools like messenger
community and the API we created a new
application the messenger and this is
going to communicate with Redis profiles
that are being populated by the main app
API maybe you have completed one course
but not completed another one
but you said that you were interested in
a special one so we're going to let you
know okay here's this course that you
would like I work on learning
engineering team and I'm actually
responsible with my team for everything
related to learning so we do everything
we can to give people the best learning
experience in the application so that's
about the interface you get when you're
learning but also everything that
happens behind the back end so that your
session runs fine data camp uses a micro
services architecture all components are
inside of a docker container that are
handled by kaptara orchestration
platform called Cuban ladies the reason
we aren't using micro services is the
largest to upgrade our components from
OpenOffice to newer ones we have angular
react node and so on in the learning
engineering team we use a bunch of
different programming languages because
our team is actually inherently
multidisciplinary
we start with it's JavaScript
application on the front ends but in the
back ends we also have a notes framework
that then spins up docker containers
that feature our Python but also SQL
Hadoop spark all these things so yeah we
have to know about a bunch of different
programming tools you're working hard
but it doesn't feel like that so you do
a lot of work but it feels like you're
sitting down with a bunch of talented
people and doing some great stuff
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
