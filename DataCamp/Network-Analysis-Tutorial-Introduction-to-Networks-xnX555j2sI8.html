scientist working at the intersection of
biological network science and
infectious disease and I'm thrilled to
share with you my knowledge on how to do
Network analytics I hope we'll have a
fun time together let me first ask you a
question what are some examples of
networks well one example might be a
social network in a social network we're
modeling the relationships between
people here's another one transportation
networks in the transportation network
we're modeling the connectivity between
locations as determined by roads or
fight/flight paths connecting them at
its core networks are a useful tool for
modeling relationships between entities
by modeling your data as a network you
can end up gaining insight into what
entities or nodes are important such as
broadcasters or influencers in a social
network additionally you can start to
think about optimizing transportation
between cities finally you can leverage
the network structure to find
communities in the network let's go a
bit more technical networks are
described by two sets of items nodes and
edges together these form a network
otherwise known in mathematical terms as
a graph nodes and edges can have
metadata associated for them for example
let's say there are two friends hugo and
myself who met on the 21st of May 2016
in this case the nodes may be hugo and
myself with metadata stored in a key
value pair as ID and age the friendship
is represented as a line between the two
nodes and may have metadata such as date
which represents the date on which we
first met in the Python world there's a
library called Network X that allows us
to manipulate analyze and model graph
data let's see how we can use the
network X API to analyze graph data in
memory
Network X is typically imported as n X
using n X graph we can initialize an
empty graph to which we can add nodes
and edges I can add for example the
integers 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 as nodes using the add
nodes from method passing in the list 1
2 3 as an argument the graph object G
has a dot nodes method that allows us to
see what nodes are present in the graph
and returns a list of nodes if we add an
edge between the nodes 1 &amp;amp; 2 we can then
use the G edges method to return a list
of tuples which represent the edges in
which each tuple shows the nodes that
are present on that edge metadata can be
stored on the graph as well for example
I can add to the node 1 a label key with
the value blue just as I would assign a
value to the key of a dictionary I can
then retrieve the node list with the
metadata attached using G nodes passing
in the data equals true argument what
this returns is a list of two tuples in
which the first element of each tuple is
the node and the second element is a
dictionary in which the key value pairs
correspond to my metadata network X also
provides basic drawing functionality
using the NX draw function an X draw
takes in a graph G as an argument in the
ipython shell you will also have to call
the PLC show function in order to
display the graph to screen with this
graph the NX draw function will draw to
screen what we call a node link diagram
rendering of the graph the first set of
exercises we'll be doing here is
essentially exploratory data analysis on
graphs alright let's go on and take a
look at those exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
