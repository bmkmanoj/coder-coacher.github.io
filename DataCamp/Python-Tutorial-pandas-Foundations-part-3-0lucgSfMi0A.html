numbers and strings let's move on to
date times pandas stores date and time
information in date time objects
the pandas read CSV function can read
strings into date/time objects the past
States equals true option helps
transform dates and times in ISO 8601
format from specified columns into
date/time objects the ISO 8601 format
reads like this read CSV can also
flexibly read from many date and time
formats as an example consider some
sales data from a company that sells
hardware software and service products
this CSV file can tell sales records
from February 2015 here in the first
five rows we can see that the date
columns contain date time information in
ISO 8601 format since we know that the
CSV file contains at least one column of
date times we can tell read CSV to parse
all compatible columns as date/time
objects with the parse dates equals true
option further we're going to use the
date column as the index later we'll see
that date/time indexes are very useful
for data exploration here are the first
five rows of the sales data frame we can
see the date column in the index let's
look at the output of sales dot info we
can see from sales info that we have a
date time index that runs from the
morning of February 2nd to the morning
of February 26th remember the dot log
accessor can be used to select data by
row and by column with date times in the
index we can use very sophisticated
selections for example we can select the
company that made a purchase on February
19th at 11:00 a.m. by selecting the full
date/time string and the company column
name
when using date/time on the index pandas
provides convenient ways to select
multiple rows
let's try selecting February 5th here we
have two rows for the two sales events
that occurred on February 5th notice
that we did not specify a column name so
all of the columns were returned this is
called partial string selection and
panders supports this in a number of
different ways these are a few
alternative formats to select February
2015
pandas also allows partial selections
for entire months or entire years here's
the whole month of February 15 lastly we
can slice between partial date/time
strings by providing a start and a stop
string separated by a colon for example
we can select all of the rows within a
four day window
the pandas - date/time function can
convert strings in ISO 8601 format into
pandas date/time objects for example
here's a few entries from the evening of
February 11th we sometimes need to re
index a series or a data frame
re-indexing involves providing a new
index and matching data as required here
the reindex method returns a new data
frame with the four rows corresponding
to the x in the evening - 11 - matching
entries from sales are found at 20
hundred and twenty-three hundred from
the evening of February the remaining
times in evening - eleven namely 2100
and 2200 are filled with na n by default
when using reindex with missing entries
we can override the default behavior
fulfilling with na n using the argued
method equals FL which means four would
fill the empty entries are filled using
the nearest preceding non null entry in
each column we can also specify method
equals B fill for backward fill the
opposite of forward film which is better
depends on the context of your data
processing tasks so pandas gives us some
flexibility
now it's your turn to practice working
with daytime's and panda series and data
frames</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
