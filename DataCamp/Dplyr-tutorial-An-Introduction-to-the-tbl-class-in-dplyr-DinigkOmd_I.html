spending too much time at the airport at
least that's what Nobel prize-winning
economist once said I'd hate to miss a
plane but I also ate spent too much time
at the airport the H planes data set can
help you avoid both the data sent
records every flight that departed from
Houston Texas in 2011 and that's no mean
feat in 2011 Houston was a major hub for
at least three carriers Continental
Airlines Express jet and Southwest
Airlines and many other Airlines flew
there too hidden in the edge place data
are clues about which airlines are the
most reliable for example you'll see
which had the longest delays and which
had the most cancellations the data is
saved as each flights the date of claim
that are loaded along with the H by its
package you can look at the data
directly by taping H flights at the
command line but that might be a
bittersweet experience our we'll try to
show you the entire data set which is a
quarter million rows small eventually
our will be above but not before filling
your console and it's displayed offer
with data ours version of the data
deluge the plant can help you look at
the data set it provides a new structure
for our the table TBL the table is just
a special type of data frame but our
knows how to display it properly to turn
each place into a table you can run
table DF on now our only displays the
amount of data that will fit in your
console window not only does our cut out
superfluous rows it cuts out superfluous
columns so you don't get that
disorienting wraparound effect the table
display also tells you the dimensions of
the full data set as well as the names
and data types of each column has not
shown the best thing about this display
is that it adapts to your window size if
you change the size of your console
window and rerun each flights are will
display a different portion of the data
whichever portion it fits your new
window size if your data set is small
enough
R will display the whole thing even fill
slightly more than one window if you'd
like to see a more complete display of
the table data you can use the function
glimpse glimpse shows you the data types
and then
initial values of each column in the
data set if you don't like the table
format you can always change your
structure back with something like as
dr. here right I'll use the table format
throughout this course and I suggest
that you do two tables to do more than
make your day easy to look at you also
make your data easier to work with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
