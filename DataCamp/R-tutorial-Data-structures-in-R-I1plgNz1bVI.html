already been exposed to different data
types in our let's review some basics
we'll need for this course there are two
types of vectors in our atomic vectors
and lists atomic vectors are the most
basic type of object in our and they
come in six flavors the most common
which we assume you are already familiar
with a logical integer double and
character there are a couple of less
common ones that you don't need to know
about complex and raw lists of vectors
too but they are recursive that is a
list can contain another list the
contents of an atomic vector is always
of one time whereas lists can contain
heterogeneous or multiple types every
vector in R has two key properties it's
type which we can query with the type of
function and its length which we can
query with the length function in our
additional metadata can be added to a
vector through attributes this allows
the definition of what we call augmented
vectors will complicated data structures
another important object in R is null
which is often used to indicate the
absence of a vector and correspondingly
the now object has zero lengths in
contrast to the absence of an entire
vector the absence of values inside a
vector is indicated with n/a ours
missing value on its own na is a length
one logical vector but there are in fact
many types of NA one for each atomic
vector usually you'll find na is an
element inside a vector indicating the
particular value was unobserved or
unobtainable for a particular
observation the is dot n a function
returns a logical vector with true at
each element that is missing and false
otherwise the most important property of
missing values is that they are
contagious basic math with a missing
value such as addition or multiplication
always results in a missing value
similarly any logical comparison with a
missing value returns a missing value
even in a equals equals n a is a missing
value equal to a missing value returns n
a
lists are useful because they can
contain heterogeneous objects this means
they're ideal for returning complicated
objects like the regression models
returned from the Allium function lists
are created with the list function and
can be substituted using the single
brackets double brackets or dollar sign
the single bracket extracts a sub list
the double bracket and dollar sign
extract elements from inside the list
that is they remove a level of hierarchy
from the list let's take a look at an
example here we create a list a with
four elements a a linked three kit
integer vector B a length one character
vector C a length one double and D a
list itself with two elements each
containing a length one double a visual
representation of this list is shown
here extracting the fourth element with
single brackets returns a list with a
single element that is a list with two
elements that is a list containing the d
element if instead we had used double
square brackets we remove one level of
the hierarchy and simply get a list with
two elements that is the d element
itself if we want to access elements
inside of the d element we can continue
subsetting recursively that is a double
square brackets for single square
brackets 1 is the first sub list of the
fourth element in a if we wanted the
value rather than a list we'd do our
second sub setting with double square
brackets you'll get a chance to practice
this type of sub setting in the
exercises that follow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
