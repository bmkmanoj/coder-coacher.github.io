toolbox you know how to take a data set
and explore it you know how to think
probabilistically and infer values and
confidence intervals about parameters
you know how to formulate a hypothesis
and use your data and Python to test it
let's put those tools to use in this
chapter you will immerse yourself and
what is in my opinion one of the most
fascinating data sets out there you may
know that many of the important
observations that led Charles Darwin to
develop the theory of evolution were
made in the Galapagos Archipelago
particularly in the study of small birds
called finches that inhabit them the
islands are ideal for studying evolution
because they are isolated so they do not
have complicated effects from
interactions with other species
including humans furthermore some of
them are small so entire populations can
be monitored on a given Island every
year since 1973 Peter and Rosemary grant
of Princeton University have been
spending several months of the year on
the tiny volcanic cinder cone island of
Daphne major in the Galapagos this
island has two dominant ground Finch
species Geo spiezio speeds of fortis and
geo speeds scandens the grants have
monitored them every year tagging them
making physiological measurements taking
samples for genetic sequencing and more
in 2014 they published a book entitled
40 years of evolution Darwin's finches
on Daphne major Island they generously
placed all of their data on the Dryad
data repository making it free for
anyone to use the data set is impressive
and a great set for using data science
and statistical inference to learn about
evolution you will work with the grants
measurements of beak length and beak
depth you will consider different
aspects of the beak geometry including
how it varies over time from species to
species and from parents to offspring I
will come back with short discussions as
you are working through the data sets
but you are mostly on your own you can
do it
okay for your first analysis you will
investigate how the beat depth of geo
speeds scandens has changed over time
you will start with some exploratory
analysis of the measurements of these
species from 1975 to 2012 you will then
perform a parameter estimation with
confidence intervals of the mean beak
depth for those respective years finally
you will do a hypothesis test
investigating if the mean beak depth has
changed from 1975 to 2012 have at it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
