your data set for analysis it's
important because data almost never
comes in a way that does not need to be
cleaned this chapter is going to cover
how to diagnose your data for problems
that require cleaning
here are some common data problems that
you will learn how to clean column names
can have inconsistent capitalizations
and/or bad characters missing data needs
to be identified and addressed outliers
can pose a potential problem and need to
be investigated duplicate rows can bias
analysis and need to be found and
dropped untidy datasets can contain
multiple problems and prevent us from
quickly transforming our data set from
one suitable for reporting to a data set
that is suitable for analysis
other common data problems are
processing columns before a column can
be used for data analysis and column
types can signal the presence of
unexpected data values we'll go into
more detail on what these mean
throughout the course this is a data set
that we've abducted from the European
Environment Agency it gives the percent
of females age 15 or over who can read
and write the average number of children
that a woman will give birth to and
population for a given country in a
continent we have row indexes and column
names an index in pandas is the basic
object storing the row labels you can
reference indexes for rows and columns
by their labels or by integer look at
the first few rows can identify some of
the common data problems already we have
some column name inconsistencies country
and continent are capitalized female
literacy has a space in it missing data
which is data not present for whatever
reason these are represented as the nan
values and the country names are in
French to load the data we begin by
importing pandas library with the
standard alias PD the read CSV function
takes a file name and loads it into a
data frame called
d/f we can visually inspect the first
and last five rows of our data frame
using head and tail methods respectively
here we see the column name
inconsistencies missing data and columns
that need to be further processed if you
have a lot of columns calling the
columns attribute of our data frame will
return an index of column names you see
that the country column actually has a
space at the end of it this was
practically invisible when we looked at
the head and tail of our data we can
call the shape attribute to look at the
number of rows and columns of our data
this is useful if you cannot visually
see all your data with head and tail our
data has 164 rows a quick Google search
shows that there are 196 countries in
the world so not every country in the
world is listed in this data set we can
use the info method to get additional
information about our data frame this is
a panda's data frame object with a
hundred sixty-four rows and five columns
the population column only has a 122 non
missing values so we can subtract 122
from 164 and know there are 442 missing
data points the fertility column should
also contain numeric values but it's
stored as an object instead an object
type is a generic type in pandas that is
stored as a string numeric data types
will be represented as an int if there
are no decimals and a float if there are
decimals we will want a closer look at
these missing data points and wrong data
types but for now it's your turn to
loaded data set and visually inspect it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
