scientist at data camp data camp is an
online data science school it will take
fun video lessons like the one you're
watching now and solve interactive
coding challenges where you receive
instant and detailed feedback all of
this happens in a comfort of your
browser so you can immediately start
learning the skill of the future in this
introduction to our course you will
learn about the basics of R as well as
the most common data structures it uses
to store data by the end of this course
you will know how to create these data
structures manipulate them and perform
calculations on them to get surprising
insights but first things first the
basics of our it's also called the
language for statistical computing and
it's one of the most popular languages
to do data science used by tons of
companies and universities around the
globe in all sorts of fields optimizing
a financial portfolio or rapping
marketing data or even analyzing
outcomes of clinical trials you name it
our can handle it but why did our become
so popular well first of all it's really
use next our specialization capabilities
are top-notch making it easy to build
beautiful plots it's also easy to create
so-called packages which are extensions
to our ARS very active community has
created thousands of these packages for
many different fields last but not least
our is an actual programming language
with a command-line interface for
executing codes this is a big plus
compared to other point-and-click
programs out there it might take some
energy to fully get the hang of it but
fear not data camp is here to help you
master our in no time let's get started
an important component of our is the
console it's a place where you can
execute our commands and data games
interactive interface the console can be
found here let's try to calculate the
sum of 1 &amp;amp; 2 we simply type 1 + 2 at the
prompt in the console and hit enter our
interprets what you typed and prints out
results RS more than a scientific
calculator do you can also create so
called variables a variable allows you
to store data and are for later use you
can use the less than sign followed by -
create a variable suppose the height of
a rectangle is 2 let's assign this value
2 to a variable height in the console we
type height less than sign - 2 this
time-our does not print anything because
it assumes that you will be using this
variable in the future if you simply
type an execute height in a console our
returns - we can do a similar thing for
the width of our imaginary rectangle we
assign the value 4 to a variable width
typing with gives us 4 great as you're
assigning variables in your console
you're actually accumulating the our
workspace it's the place where our
variables live you can list all
variables with the LS function simply
type LS followed by empty parentheses
and it enter this shows you a list of
all the variables you have created up to
now there are two objects in your
workspace at the moment height and width
if we try to access a variable that is
not in the workspace depth for example R
will throw an error suppose you now want
to find out the area of our imaginary
rectangle which is height x with height
equals 2 and width equals 4 so the
result is 8 it's also a sinus result to
a new variable area inspecting the
workspace again with LS shows that the
workspace contains three objects now
area height and width now this is all
great but what if you want to
recalculate the area if your imaginary
rectangle when the height is 3 and width
is 6
you'd have to reassign the variables
width and height in a console and then
recalculate the area that's quite some
coding you'd have to redo isn't it this
is the place where our scripts come in
an our script is simply a text file with
successive lines of our code let's
create such script rectangle door that
contains the code that we've written up
to now next you can run the script and a
data camp interface you can do this with
the submit answer button our go is
through your code line by line executing
every command one by one and the console
just as if you are typing each command
yourself the cool thing is that if you
want to change your code you can simply
adapt your script and run it again let's
change the height to tree and width to 6
and rerun the script
the variables are given different values
this time and the output changes
accordingly now it's time for some
interactive exercises use the console
for experimentation and the our script
editor for coding the actual answer when
you hit submit answer your script will
be executed and check for correctness
datagrams tailored feedback will guide
you to our mastery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
