let you all out there know that today
we've been filming unsupervised learning
inviting course we've been Wilson it is
now what time is it in Berlin at 9:30
a.m. in Berlin where we're been lives
it's 9:30 a.m. it's here 2:00 2:30 so
maybe it's 8:30 there maybe thank you
anyway we've been filming for very many
hours it's 2:30 a.m. where we are in
Cambridge the beautiful beautiful town
of Cambridge Massachusetts you sounded
tired you go I'm I'm tired I'm getting
sick but that never stopped me before I
don't what now but we thought we'd take
this opportunity after such a fun day of
recording to have a chat about about the
process and about what Ben's interested
in so maybe you can start by telling us
a bit about yourself sure yeah so my
name is Ben welcome I know
data scientist and mathematician I'm in
charge of the machine learning at a
small company in Berlin called lateral
we do machine learning with texts and
user behavior data to make
recommendations fantastic so would you
call yourself a data scientist sure sure
and what does that mean to you I
promised Ben I wouldn't ask him that
question but what is data science give
us an idea of of what what data science
is in your wind yeah the data transfer
means about extracting insights from
data the distinction I draw is data
science is often about extracting
insights from data for people where it's
machine learning is often you to like
discovering patterns in the data and
using that to make automated decisions
but there's massive overlap between the
two I feel there's some computing
between the two terms
but that's how I define the two things
data science and machine learning
universe and of course data science
encompasses a lot of things besides
machine learning right actually yeah so
not only the you know reporting or
I'm getting insight from your data to
say but all the you know getting the
data into the correct form data
manipulation all of these early steps as
well round where we spend a lot of our
time most of our time hard work great
what about the role of statistics the
role of statistics what super important
I mean I guess we all need a basic
understanding of what we're doing in
order to make informed decisions and get
things right statistics is part of that
hmm absolutely maybe you can tell me a
bit about your relationship with Python
right I guess when I started getting
involved in machine learning item was
the go-to language we found it really
useful for all sorts of things from
doing research in ipython and Jupiter
notebooks to implementation of backend
machine learning systems to serving
those machine learning systems fire an
API to the general public license been
a-been pythons been great fantastic and
so the course we've been filming today
is unsupervised learning in Python and
when you when I started chatting about
potential avenues for working together
on a course there are a variety of
options and I'd like to know why you
jumped it unsupervised learning in a lot
of ways I love it yeah it's my bread and
butter it's what I've always done I'm
fascinated by the problem of trying to
find patterns in data when you haven't
got a specific task in mind like it's a
fundamentally difficult problem but it's
also there are so many exciting
applications and there's a ton of data
that you can use for unsupervised
learning whereas data for supervised
learning good data sets can be harder to
combine in a real world application
setting you know unsupervised learning
is great I mean it's fascinating when
you you're able to extract from data
patterns which you weren't even aware
existed and sometimes even explain your
own behavior for instance in any comment
system yeah absolutely so discover the
cost of it you
you're contained in and find the product
segments and contained all the price
you're interested in and absolutely sir
yeah and we get that every now and then
when you know I think I'm a lot of the
recommendation systems online are
relatively coarse grained and kind of
you know they go towards the central
tendency and as opposed to representing
the spread but every now and then you do
get these recommendations we're like
whoa you know I think Spotify sitting
and yeah ready sometime yep they won't
recommend oh yeah absolutely so
something I've really enjoyed about
working on this course with you is all
the fascinating examples of unsupervised
learning with different real world data
sets that that you've come up with and
brought to the table so maybe you could
tell us a bit about about that what what
you're interested most in kind of a
plethora of data sets that we that we
see hmm right
well look it's a great question I mean I
guess I've always think that like my
favorite unsupervised learning algorithm
would have to be non-negative matrix
factorization when I saw that for the
first time and I saw the examples of its
application I knew our cooks and I've
spent an enormous amount of time
understanding how to use technique is
better and how to find patterns in data
you know like the way can decompose
images into like commonly recurrent
components so I find fascinating or that
example where it decomposes images of
faces into sort of a police identity kit
of eyebrows and noses and ears and so on
it's absolutely and what about topics in
corporate X sure I mean it's a that's a
massive interest to me personally and
also to my company lateral hmm where you
know we work with with text all the time
so that's great thanks for the viewers
out there the non-negative matrix
factorization chapter is chapter four of
Ben's unsupervised learning but again
showing it you know it's really go
through the gauntlet to to taste all the
all the delicious for it there's some
goodies along the way it has there a lot
of good it yeah absolutely
did like please I was going to say the
stock market classrooms a good one
or the clustering of countries according
to their behavior at the Eurovision
contest it's incredible this year that's
a nice place the hierarchical clustering
yeah for those of you who know that
that's very cool
so maybe you can tell us about we
discuss applies in Python briefly but as
a python is - maybe you can tell us
about what type of packages you're most
interested in what you use on a daily
basis yeah sure so the good question yes
I mean when I'm sort of in a hacker mode
in the inner Jupiter notebook its pandas
numpy scikit-learn all the way I'm not
particularly sophisticated in plotting
that's definitely an area in which I
could improve I feel like there's great
packages out there for that of course
there are some great data cap courses
great aging well which I should probably
turn up for absolutely I think I gave
you a subscription actually you need in
fact yeah I should I will yes improve my
knowledge of playing fantastic and it's
a whole bunch of Python packages we use
for ingesting and wrangling data so like
this scrapey tomography um beautiful
soup for pulling apart xml and HTML yeah
I mean there's a whole ecosystem of
stuff out there yeah pythons great like
they're almost anything you turn your
hand to someone's had a crack at it
before and there's a library out theater
yeah that gives you at least a starting
point if not like a fully fledged
implementation absolutely so an old
friend of mine um - actually I mentioned
your numbers runs just and boys who
created our statistical thinking invited
courses but someone asked him once what
do you like about biking and his
response was well it's a Swiss Army
knife that's what I like about it it
won't always be the very best tool you
can use for a specific problem but troll
problem at me and I can probably draw
with blackton yep yep I think the thing
that makes part in particular in the
data science of machine learning
ecosystem is the community
I mean they're all is there are a whole
bunch of languages you can do all the
stuff that Python can do and but they're
not as useful for machining or data
science because because we all use
Python you know there are people out
there writing open source software that
can do anything you can think of and a
huge amount of it's important it's the
go-to option absolutely this has been a
great conversation I've got one one
final question for you before you go to
bed yeah exactly
yeah before I wake up so a lot of our
audiences are budding data scientists
who really are very interested in
improving their skills they're hacking
fields their data science skills I was
just wondering for beginners if you've
had any any advice ah yeah sure okay
first thing I'd say is a data camera is
really good for this you want to mix
learning with doing like data science
it's not a spectator sport you've got to
get in there you get your hand see take
the datasets from the videos take the
datasets from the exercises play around
them with them in yourself and try and
construct some datasets of your own and
the second thing I'd suggest it don't
hesitate to go and get a job as soon as
you can data scientists are in huge
demand there's so many great problems
that you can help solve with real world
data and there's no better way to be
encouraged to feel useful than to get
out there and try and solve these
problems that's that'd be my suggestion
just feels like great advice get busy
yeah and I like it so it's going to
still down to two words for two words
get busy get busy here
sounds up there real pleasure bed thank
you go yeah Cheers
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
