important it is to know what type of
variable you're dealing with and
emphasizing how important it is to look
at your distributions in your variables
it's also really important to keep in
mind what scale of measurement you're
dealing with so for all those histograms
I presented the histograms first in
degrees Fahrenheit then in degrees
Celsius those are just two different
scales of measurement to measure
temperature right so I think we're all
used to dealing with scales of
measurement but in statistics what's
nice is there's a standard scale and
it's called the Z scale so any score
from any scale can be converted into a Z
scale with z-scores and this allows for
a really efficient communication across
statisticians scientists can share data
different researchers can share data if
everything's converted to a Z scale it's
very easy to interpret and if it's very
simple calculation how do we convert or
what I'll call a raw score to a z-score
it's just this formula right here we
just take the raw score that's X
subtract the mean M and divide by the
standard deviation so we'll just take
the raw score subtract the mean divided
by the standard deviation that gives us
a z-score and if we do that for every
score in a distribution then we can put
our distribution on this common metric
the Z scale so what's also nice about a
Z scale or z-scores is the mean z score
and any one sample is are always going
to be 0 all right so I take the raw
score subtract the mean if my raw score
is the mean so say body temperature the
average body temperature in Fahrenheit
is 98.6
so 98.6 minus the mean assuming a normal
distribution ninety eight point six
minus ninety eight point six V zero
divided by whatever the
standard deviation is would give me zero
so the mean and any z-score distribution
is going to be zero what's nice about
that is if you have a negative z-score
then I know you have your scores below
average and if you have a positive
z-score then I know you're above average
so again let's look at this body
temperature distribution here it is
again in in degrees Fahrenheit it's this
nice normal distribution here it is
again in Celsius yen nice normal
distribution here it is in terms of
z-scores again we did this in R and R so
there did the brakes a little bit
differently for this graph but it's
still a nice normal distribution and
most importantly the average is zero so
the average body temperature in terms of
z-scores is zero these are the same
exact numbers from histogram to
histogram histogram it's just in degrees
Fahrenheit degrees Celsius or in
z-scores it's the same exact numbers we
just converted them direct conversion so
just to be clear let's assume we have a
normal distribution of healthy
individuals where the mean body
temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit
and the standard deviation is about a
half a degree so 0.5 suppose I pick one
individual from that distribution at
random and that individuals body
temperature is 99 point six degrees now
I want to convert that raw score that X
99.6 to a z-score well all I have to do
is apply this Z formula I take the raw
score ninety nine point six subtract out
the mean ninety eight point six divided
by the standard deviation which was 0.5
so that's just 1 over 0.5 or two so this
individuals z-score is positive two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
