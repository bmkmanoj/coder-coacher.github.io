about data visualization is to
appreciate that graphics are built upon
an underlying grammar to begin let's
consider one of the most well known
sentences in English the quick brown fox
jumps over the lazy dog every word in
the sentence has a clear grammatical
definition and we when we write text we
take great care to choose the
grammatical elements so that we
communicate a very specific message if
we change any of the grammatical
elements of the sentence we change the
meaning sometimes subtly sometimes
dramatically the same concepts hold true
for data visualization graphics are
built on an underlying grammar this
grammar of graphics is a planning
framework developed by Leland Wilkinson
and published in his 1999 book the
grammar graphics there are two key
things to note about the grammar of
graphics first graphics are made up of
distinct layers of grammatical elements
and second meaningful plots are built
around appropriate aesthetic mappings to
continue our analogy to written grammar
the layers are like the adjectives and
nouns and the aesthetic mappings are
like the grammatical rules for how to
assemble that vocabulary
let's explore grammatical elements first
there are seven grammatical elements in
total and three of them are essential
data statics and geometries the data is
obviously the data which we want to plot
the aesthetics refers to the scales onto
which one to map our data and the genome
layer refers to the actual shape the
data will take in the plot the remaining
elements are optional and control
details of our plots they are the facets
statistics coordinates and theme layer
we will explore the optional layers in
the next course this diagram gives an
example of some of the terms will
encounter in each layer whenever we make
a plot we are choosing from these items
and even more which are not shown the
grammar of graphics established the
building blocks for solid creative and
meaningful data visualizations this
means we are not limited to specific
standard forms of expression because now
we have a framework that allows us to
communicate in a way that best suits our
goal by the end of this course you will
be able to generate meaningful
exploratory plots using the first three
layers
in the next courses we'll go into detail
into the remaining four optional layers
let's head over to the exercises and
explore one of the datasets that you'll
be using throughout the two courses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
