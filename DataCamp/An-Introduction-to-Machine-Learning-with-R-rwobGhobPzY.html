the introduction to machine learning
course my name is ian i'm a content
creator at data camp and in this course
me and my colleague Vincent will explain
some general concepts about eLearning
after this course you'll be able to tell
what machine learning is and what it
isn't you'll be able to solve some basic
machine learning problems and be able to
think critically about your data and
your results but first things first
what on earth is machine learn at a very
basic level machine learning explores
the construction and usage of algorithms
that can learn from data but when does a
machine actually learn we can say that
the machine has the ability to learn if
it is able to improve its performance
when it receives more information that
this experience typically comes in the
form of observations on how particular
instances of a problem was solved before
maybe an example will clarify a possible
task for a computer try beauty label
squares with a color based on the square
size and the squares edge initially the
computer has no idea how to do this
however suppose that the number of
squares were labeled earlier by humans
for example a small dotted square was
labeled green a big striped square or
said to be yellow a medium-sized square
with a normal edge was labelled green as
well and lastly a small striped one was
tabled yellow a machine learning
algorithm can use these observations or
instances to do an informed guess about
how to label an unseen Square an example
could be a medium striped square the
computer can be right or wrong in doing
so
at this specific example was a
classification problem
there are many times of machine learning
problems some are related and others are
pretty exotic a concept that keeps
popping up is a presence of input
knowledge or simply data in our example
it was a set of human labelled squares
in other examples it can be something
totally different
typically this data is a data set
containing a number of salvation that
each have a well-defined number of
variables often called features each
Guerre and its corresponding color is an
observation the features in this case
are the size and the edge the color is
the label of the square as you're well
aware in are a data set is typically
represented by a data frame have a look
at this code that builds the squared
data frame for our example
in a data frame the observations
correspond to the rows and the columns
correspond to the variables to find out
dimensions of your data set you can use
the dim function the structure function
on the other hand gives a more
structured overview of our data also
showing how many observations and
variables the data set comprises another
function you can use to observe your
data is a summary function a DES
function will also give you information
on the distribution of each feature okay
let's dig into a more theoretical
formulation of our example the problem
here is labeling a square that is
actually applying some function on the
inputs to generate an output the size
and H variables of the square go in and
the label variable color comes out a
machine learning algorithm tries to find
a way of labeling the square so you're
actually trying to estimate the function
here this function could be estimated
based on the previous observations of
how the problem was solved ideally the
function you're building is it generally
applicable and can handle all kinds of
reasonable inputs if we put in the
unseen example the medium striped square
with an unknown label the function will
guess a color for us
it's a very important to see when you're
actually dealing with the machine
learning problem when you're simply
calculating for example the most
occurring color of squares in your data
set or calculating the average size of
your squares you're not doing machine
learning the entire point about machine
learning is trying to build a model that
can help make predictions about your
data or future instances of similar
problems
don't let these general formulations of
machine learning confuse you
some very common problems can actually
be thought of as machine learning do you
know about linear regression you can use
it to make predictions on your data
suppose you've got some data about a
group of people their height and their
weight you can use regression to make a
function which can predict the height of
a new person given their weight you do
this by using the given data about the
known height and weight of the first
group of people there are so many other
examples to machine learning such as
shopping basket analysis movie
recommendation systems decision making
for self-driving cars and whatnot but
let's take this step by step in the
upcoming exercises you're constantly
date the main ideas Val machine learning
and take your first gentle steps in this
exciting field</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
