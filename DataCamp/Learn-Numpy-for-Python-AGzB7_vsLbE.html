is pretty powerful a list can hold any
type and can hold different types at the
same time you can also change add and
remove elements this is wonderful but
one feature is missing a feature that is
super important for aspiring data
scientists as yourself when analyzing
data you'll often want to carry out
operations over entire collections of
values and you want to do this fast with
lists this is a problem let's retake the
heights of your family and yourself
suppose you've also asked where
everybody's weight it's not very polite
but everything for science right you end
up with two lists height and weight the
first person is 1.73 meters tall and
weighs 65 point four kilograms if you
now want to calculate the body mass
index for each family member
you'd hope that this call can work
making the calculations element wise
unfortunately Python throws an error
because it has no idea how to do
calculations on lists it could solve
this by going through each list element
one after the other and calculating the
BMI for each person separately but this
is terribly inefficient and tiresome to
write a way more elegant solution is to
use numpy or numeric Python it's a
Python package that among others
provides an alternative to the regular
Python lists the number array so numpy
array is pretty similar to the list but
as one additional feature you can
perform calculations or entire arrays
it's really easy and super fast as well
the numpy package is already installed
on data game servers but if you want to
now get it working on your own system go
to the command line and execute BIP tree
install numpy next to actually use numpy
in your Python session you can import
the numpy package like this let's start
with creating an umpire array you do
this with numbers array function the
input is a little regular Python list
I'm using array twice here to create num
by versions of the height and weight
lists from before NP ID and NP weight
let's try to calculate everybody's BMI
with a single call again this time it
worked fine the calculations were
performed element wise the first
person's BMI will scale
by dividing the first element MP wait by
the square of the first Elton and
b.height the second person's BMI was
calculated with the second item weight
elements and so on let's do a quick
comparison here first we try to do
calculations with regular lists like
this but this gave us an error because
Python doesn't know how to do
calculations with lists like we want
them to next these regular lists were
converted to numpy arrays the same
operations now work without any problem
none by knows how to work with the race
as if you are single values which is
pretty awesome if you ask me you should
still pay attention though first of all
numpy can do all this so easily because
it assumes that your numpy array can
only contain values of a single type
it's either an array of floats either an
array of boolean and so on if you do try
to create an array with different types
like this for example resulting numpy
array will contain a single type string
in this case the boolean and the float
were both converted to strings second
you should know that an umpire array is
simply a new kind of python type like
the float string and list types from
before this means that it comes with its
own methods which can behave differently
than you'd expect
take this Python list and this numpy
array for example if you do python list
plus python list the list elements are
pasted together generating a list with
six elements if you do this with an
umpire arrays on the other hand Python
will do an element wise some of the
arrays just make sure to pay attention
and you're juggling around with
different Python types because the
outcomes can differ a lot
apart from these subtleties you can work
with numpy array is pretty much the same
as you can with regular Python lists
when you want to get elements from your
array for example you can use square
brackets suppose you want to get to BMI
for the second person so at index one
this will do the trick
specifically for numpy there's also
another way to do lists subsetting using
an array of boolean's say you want to
get all BMI values in the BMI array
there are over 23 a first step is using
the greater than sign like this result
is an array containing boolean true if
the corresponding BMI is above 23 and
false if it's below next you can use
this boolean array
side square brackets to do subsetting
only the elements in BMI Dodaro buff to
any tree so for which the corresponding
boolean value is true is selected
there's only one BMI that's about 23 so
we end up with an umpire a with a single
value that specific BMI using the result
of a comparison to make a selection of
your data is a very common way to get
surprising insights learn all about it
and the other numpy basics in the
exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
