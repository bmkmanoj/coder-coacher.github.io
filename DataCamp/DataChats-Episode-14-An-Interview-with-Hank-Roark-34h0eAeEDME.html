scientist of data camp I'm very happy to
be here today with Hank Rowe work we
just finished recording Hanks new course
on unsupervised learning and our so
welcome
great good to be here Nick great so as
per usual I've got some some questions
that I would like to ask Hank today the
first of which is familiar to everyone
who watches data chats I always like to
start off with a question around what
label you associate with data science is
a very broadly defined field I'm curious
if you identify as a data scientist or
something maybe more specific like a
statistician or data analyst a hacker so
which of those and why yeah so I think
like I primarily associate with the data
scientist label right now and I to your
point like I think it's a very broad
field that is can be very encompassing
right to everybody that makes decisions
based on data so the reason that I feel
like I correspond to that is because I'm
talking to the ground too okay so the
reason I feel like I correspond to this
it's yeah I have a background in physics
so that was like my my education and
like doing this work of doing modeling
and doing machine learning and doing
data science feels a lot like doing
physics where you've got just a pile of
data and you're trying to make
hypotheses and models based on that data
and that feels a lot like science to me
so I associate with the data science
label okay interesting so you really
emphasize the science and the data
science absolutely absolutely so yeah
great so actually I'm curious I actually
didn't even realize you come from a
physics background but in contrast to
many of the people that we work with who
are like university professors you've
had a long career in what many people
might call industry
it just means outside of like
universities and yes so maybe you could
just kind of like walk us down the path
of how you got from a
agree in physics to the various places
that you've done it's a great question
so yeah so I was working on a PhD in
physics and made it a year end and
decided that I like not being broke more
than I liked physics so I went into
industry and actually spent 15 years
doing software so doing software
development eventually like architecting
large software systems and leading teams
and after about 15 years I was like I'm
ready for a change so what what
languages were you were you writing
software C C++ Java Pro low level stuff
yeah lots of stuff yeah yeah lots of
eventually lots of web applications it
was like doing some real-time systems
along the way yeah yeah cool
so yeah so after 15 years I decided it
was kind of time for a change and had a
really great opportunity I was working
at john deere at the time and they
needed someone to lead up their efforts
about how to apply you know apply all
this data that was coming off of their
machine so like make more value for
their customers and i said hey we need a
guy for it and i said i'm your man and
that's how i got started really
interesting so what was the transition
like writing software to now using
software to interact with and analyze
data it was it was a learning experience
yeah so yeah you know dealing with
larger and larger volumes of data just
required learning a lot more skills and
a lot more techniques that were around
plus for me like you know a lot of my
stuff had been in these like low-level
languages or building web applications
so I had to like learn all of like the
stats and machine learning and all of
the the programming languages that were
kind of popular right are in Python and
all those types of things so at a great
environment a good place to experiment
and but I was able to bring like the
background I had about you know
answering hard problems to the data
problem right so that it translated
pretty easily it's really interesting so
I imagine that many data camp users
certainly not all but many data camp
users are making a similar transition so
I think we even had a blog post recently
about how to make the transition from
like web development to data science so
what skills do you think are
transferable from from like the software
development world to the data science
world like what advantages do you have
did you have coming from that background
yeah so great question so I you know
some of the advantages I think software
people bring to the data science world
is one the ability to organize their
thoughts in a way that's easy for a
computer understand you're still have to
like take steps that are you know the
same sorts of steps you'd have to take
in software and organize those in an
efficient manner so that's like the very
basic just thinking about things in this
very efficient manner the second one and
I find like particularly software people
are going to this is that they
understand algorithms and complexity so
they know about things like how the the
runtime complexity of an algorithm or
the memory complexity of an algorithm
and by having just that basic knowledge
as a software developer you can bring
that into the data world where you're
dealing with with large datasets that
have to make things work efficiently
interesting okay yeah I think that first
points can't be like emphasized enough
either because like that's a huge
stumbling block for new data scientists
like they have these ideas in their
heads or maybe like formulas on a page
now how do they translate that to code
in their editor that's not a trivial
task especially for people with no
previous exposure to programming oh
absolutely and then I think it even gets
worse when they have to go take that
when they're doing the exploratory work
and maybe the initial model building and
then turning that into a production
running application right so having more
and more software skills tends to help
you make that transition from producing
you know one-off data science products
to you know data products that become
part of like commercial running
applications yeah so that's another
really interesting point can you just
like speak to that a little bit more
like what what you mean by putting
something in production yeah so you
you know off sometimes in data science
your goal is a one-off analysis somebody
gives you a pile data and says tell me
what insights you can gain from this but
more and more of these days it's about
embedding those insights into an
automated system all based in software
and presenting those results to an end
user or maybe just a computer by
presenting them in a way that they can
then go take action to make decisions on
them so that's what I mean by about
going to a production environment
interesting so yeah taking your models
and moving them out putting them in a
place so that the models can make
predictions in real time and either that
and then the appropriate action can be
taken based on what the models say so
that may be like a data product that
your company is building for use by
consumers or maybe it's building
dashboards that like people within the
company can use to make decisions yeah
those are two great examples right
external data products but you know also
those types of data products are used in
credit card fraud transactions now right
or you know so there's lots of internal
use cases and external use cases and end
so I make a purchase on my credit card I
just got back from a trip to Las Vegas
so make a purchase on my credit card
maybe a little bit more than then
Capital One is used to see and I get an
email about it certainly there's not a
person on the other side of that email
saying oh it looks like NICs spent a
little bit more this past week exactly
there's no person on the other side of
that that was all a model that was
making that and sending that to you yeah
okay
very cool so maybe continuing along that
that journey so you you were at John
Deere you've been a couple of other
places since then and maybe you can talk
about what you were doing and what some
of the more interesting problems are
that you've worked on yeah so so yeah I
had a great opportunity presented to me
to go join h2o AI which is a start-up
the specializes in machine learning for
large data so I went and joined them for
a period of time and and really my role
was to work with the customers of h2o
and figure out how to how we could take
large-scale machine learning and help
them solve like their problems so some
of the most interesting ones there like
I mentioned was for all
in protecting you from credit card
transaction fraud and i i i personally
really appreciated that the one of the
first times i was travelling with h2o
and like my credit card got stolen and
some algorithm that one of our customers
are using actually caught it so that's
you know it's good to see those types of
things cool you know also worked with
folks in the healthcare industry you
know trying to work on things like
preventing SEPTA's in in hospitals and
using machine learning algorithms for
that it's a severe infection severe
infection yeah yeah yes so those are
those are some of the really great ones
it's where you're really you know
impacting you know and benefiting
society as a whole so yeah yeah okay so
after h2o i I decided I really wanted to
go back to someplace that when you uh
when you makes something that you make
that you can kick it and know it's there
yeah my wife and I have always loved the
Pacific Northwest so I got an
opportunity to join Boeing and we moved
to Seattle and a Boeing I primarily work
on use cases that are in the our
internal so supply chain operations and
manufacturing and these these are
typical use cases you would find in any
major manufacturing operation so about
how do you optimize your supply chain
and use modeling for that or how do you
how do you keep machines running and you
know so that your you know your
manufacturing process runs very smoothly
and efficiently so all those are really
really interesting use cases and really
fun
so it seems like in at least the last
couple of roles probably one really
important element of your job is
communication because like so at h2o you
are I think officially a customer facing
customer facing data scientist a show
yeah so what is the role of
communication and like being a good data
scientist yeah so that's a that's a
great question you think for a minute
the you know the important part of that
communication at least in my experience
has been kind of multiple faults and
often the the people that are asking for
help you know they're they're not
trained in this domain so I don't know
how to ask questions that you know that
are in the language of the data sites
domain and that's okay it's that's our
job to say I think what you're asking
for
is this isn't with this if we do this
and got perfect at it if we had an
algorithm that made perfect predictions
would this create value and then on the
other end of that is you know the world
is still coming to trust these
algorithms right so you have to be able
to find a way to communicate the results
communicate the output and you know kind
of gain confidence and then I'd say the
other one is you know and this is just
due to the time it's time that you know
and the maturity of data Sciences is
being cautiously optimistic not every
question can be answered through machine
learning so you know making sure that
you're you're keeping the people that
you're communicating with like a prize
but let them know what what can
realistically be achieved and what can't
the data science and machine learning so
that's just this magic wand you throw at
everything and set expectations eggs
absolutely absolutely yeah I want to go
back to something that you said a minute
ago that I thought it's really important
so often I think when we think about
communicate the role of communication
and being a data scientist it's about
how do you communicate your results but
you made the point that it's actually
you're in a sense a translator in both
directions so before you even get to the
analysis you're dealing with the issue
of how do you take a set of questions
that might be coming from somebody or a
group of people who don't understand
data science and then translate that
into the language of data science then
you do your analysis you come up with
some result results and then you did you
do a reverse translation back to the
original stakeholders and you say like
here's how you can interpret the results
of my analysis and like plain language
absolutely right
so that first step of understanding what
problem they're trying to solve and the
impact into the into the into whatever
they view as their benefit so in
industry you know we're always looking
for financial benefits usually is
important right so often like I use a
template that says something like I want
to predict X from Y and if I get perfect
at it the impact will be Z right and
like that then gives you the impact that
you can then come back and relate I said
you know we said if we got perfect we
get Z I'm gonna get you something less
than Z but that's an improvement over
what you have today and putting it both
ways in that language of the in consumer
I found to be very valuable okay cool
all right so you've spent most of your
career outside of university looking
like reflecting back on your education
what are some of the things that you
didn't learn in school that you've been
forced to learn on the job that you
think have been critical to your success
yes so um given how long ago I was in
school it feels like just about
everything but uh you know that
background that I had and like you know
mathematics and and and thinking about
things in a scientific method you know
translated into it so basically I had to
learn everything else yeah I had some
basic stats because you know physicists
rely a lot on SATs but I had a big gap
between then and when I kind of started
this career in data science five or six
years ago so yeah I had to I had to
learn you know the programming languages
that are common in the space all the
libraries are common the space I had to
go back and learn statistical learning
techniques I had to learn machine
learning techniques and then eventually
you know learning the the Big Data
technologies right so Hadoop and spark
and all of those the and then you know
but it's a really great community right
it's a like it's a really great and open
community which makes like learning
these things fairly easy sometimes you
just I will say this like the number one
thing you can do for learning is just
trying and failing a lot so I did a lot
of trying and failing a lot but you you
can't get you have to remain positive
like you're just it's a learning stuff
right so but yeah I feel like I probably
just relied on the base knowledge that I
had learned from school yeah so the the
notion of like lifelong learning is
really in the spotlight recently
especially with like increased
automation coming from advances in
artificial intelligence and robotics
it's
like some people fear for future we're
like there won't be enough work for
humans I'm an optimist so it may be a
the other end of the spectrum but yeah
so do you think so it used to be that
like you would go to school for the
first like 18 or 20 22 years of your
life give or take and then you get out
and you get a job you'd start a career
often with one company and you'd stay
with them for 30 years and you could
retire and you play golf or something
how is that changing and like do you
think that you could have learned all of
these things that are so essential to
the work that you do now in some like
compressed amount of time in the
beginning of your life or is like is the
is the only way forward to like
constantly be sharpening the saw
learning new things I so so I think in
this day and age it's gonna be
constantly sharpening saw and learning
new things do I've got a 10 year old
daughter and I do not expect that the
job that she goes into whatever that is
whenever she gets there will exist today
like that job title probably doesn't
exist today so yeah I think that that's
going to be something that everybody's
gonna have to do and hopefully it's
something that our our our society rises
up to the challenge and enables for
people to do so yeah I think it's gonna
be this kind of lifelong learning I I I
don't know how many more years I've got
doing this I mean this job data
scientists could be automated away in
the next 20 years right and I may end up
finding something else to do so yeah
yeah well that's a rabbit hole we won't
so well actually well maybe just a
little bit so so even like even if it
were to automate certain parts of the
role like let's say like just like doing
an exhaustive search across like many
many many different models right yeah
and automating the task of like figuring
out which has the best predictive
accuracy for example for example there's
still the challenge the very human
challenge of like how do you communicate
those
results to people in ways that not only
that they'll understand but that like it
it kind of like taps into their core
like motivations and interests well I
mean so so that's what's happening right
this is not this is not abstract this is
real right so you know in the course
that you know folks will take for me
they're gonna learn about a couple
different methods it used to be that if
you wanted to use those methods you had
to write the algorithms yourself and now
someone's packaged those algorithms up
as a technology wrapped them and made
them easily available for use right so
you should have to be a machine learning
expert to use them now it can be a data
scientist so you know that continue that
happens in every field right complicated
things become technology and that's why
we have engineering instead of science
which is good all right otherwise we
wouldn't have this built world around us
and then yeah so there's there's still
these problems like doing problem
formulation right that's a complicated
problem nobody yet has made an algorithm
that determines what the loss function
should be or how you should you know how
much you should how much do you lose by
misclassifying something or the loss
function meaning what your optimized
yeah what you're optimizing for like
nobody yet has automated that step right
so yeah there'll be bits and pieces
they'll get automated maybe easier but
that's just that's just the nature of
like moving technology forward yeah yeah
that's really interesting ok cool so I
guess the the part we'll leave off with
is so a lot of a lot of people who've
been watching this are new to the data
science world they're aspiring data
scientists themselves what advice do you
have for them and getting started so I
have two pieces of advice that I would I
would say which is get connected to
community either you know virtually or
physically but like find a community you
feel comfortable with that's right for
your where you're at in your you know at
the beginning of your journey and get
engaged in that community because
they'll be very helpful it's and they
say this is a very open group they're
not closed they're very help helpful and
you can find those all over the place I
mean you can find them you know an
online groups and on kaggle or you can
find them in your local meetups whatever
the second thing is is that
you know aspiring data scientists have
two choices about what they're going to
do this coming Saturday right one of
them is watch whatever sports or on TV
or whatever movie they're interested in
or they can crank open the laptop find
an interesting data set and just try
yeah you know that that second one right
isn't nearly as sexy nearly as much fun
and they're their boss or employer won't
notice that they did it right they'll be
just a little bit better the next time
but over time that builds on itself and
that that kind of purposeful practice is
is the best thing that I think aspiring
data scientists can do yeah so instead
of spending eight hours watching Netflix
spend eight hours building a Netflix
style recommendation engine this
Saturday absolutely absolutely all right
yep thanks great thanks Rick it's great
thanks
