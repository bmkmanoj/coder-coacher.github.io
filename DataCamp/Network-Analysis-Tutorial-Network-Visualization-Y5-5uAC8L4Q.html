involving more than a hundred thousand
nodes they purport to show a visual
representation of the network but in
reality just show a hairball in this
section we're going to look at alternate
ways of visualizing network data that
are much more rational I'm going to
introduce you to three different types
of network visualizations the first is
visualizing a network using a matrix
plot the second is what we call an arc
plot and the third is called circo's
plot let's start first with a matrix
plot in a matrix plot nodes are the rows
and columns of a matrix and cells are
filled in according to whether an edge
exists between the pairs of nodes on
these slides here the left matrix is the
matrix plot of the graph on the right in
an undirected graph the matrix is
symmetrical around the diagonal which
i've highlighted in gray i've also
highlighted one edge in the toei graph
edge a B which is equivalent to the edge
ba likewise for edge AC it is equivalent
to the edge CA because there's no
directionality associated with that edge
if the graph were a directed graph then
the matrix representation is not
necessarily going to be symmetrical in
this example we have a bi-directional
edge between a and C but only an edge
from A to B and not B to a thus we will
have a be filled in but not B a if the
nodes are ordered along the rows and
columns such that the neighbors are
listed close to one another then a
matrix plot can be used to visualize
clusters or communities of nodes let's
now move on to arc plots an arc plot is
a transformation of the node link
diagram layout in which nodes are
ordered along one axis of the plot and
edges are drawn using circular arcs from
one node to another if the nodes are
ordered according to some sorta Bowl for
example age in a social network of users
or otherwise group together by
geographic location in a map for a
transportation network then it will be
possible to visualize the relationship
between connectivity and the sorted or
grouped property art plots are a good
starting point for visualizing a network
as it forms the basis of the later plots
that we'll take a look at let's now move
on to circo's plots a circles plot is a
transformation of the arc plot such that
the two ends of the arc plot are joined
together into a circle circles plots
were originally designed for use in
genomics and you can think of them as an
aesthetic and compact alternative to arc
plots you will be using a plotting
utility that I developed called NX is
here's how to use it suppose we had a
graph G in which we added nodes and
edges to visualize it using NX is we
first need to import NX visits and V and
import matplotlib to make sure that we
can show the plot later next we
instantiate a new env dark plot object
and pass in a graph G we can also order
the nodes by the values keyed on some
key finally we can call the draw
function and as always we call PLT I'll
show the example code here shows you how
to create an arc plot using NX fizz and
you'll get a chance to play around with
the other plots in the exercises alright
let's get hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
