variables into four distinct kinds and
I'm going to follow suit with that
tradition and the four kinds are nominal
ordinal interval and ratio you might
think where did these four kinds come
from they come from classic cognitive
psychologists SS Stevens and this is a
classic paper published in science in
1946 where he outlined these four types
of variables or four types of
measurements so let's start with the
simplest type of variable a nominal
variable a nominal variable and it
literally means to name types of
instances of variables is to just assign
individual cases to categories so your
country of origin is a nominal variable
it's just assigning individuals to
categories so country of origin is a
nominal variable it just allows me to
distinguish some students from others so
there are some students from Brazil some
students from Argentina some from
Australia India the US and so on the
next type of variable is an ordinal
variable ordinal variables are used to
rank order cases in a data structure so
again I might rank the the countries
according to population so some
countries like China India have much
larger populations than smaller
countries say like France or a really
small country like Luxembourg have
smaller populations and if I just wanted
to rank order them in terms of who has
the highest population that they get a
number one who has the second highest
population they get a number two then
ranking would be an ordinal variable
interval variables are also used to rank
order cases so we can we can order cases
from top to bottom but in this case the
distance are interval between each value
is equal that's why it's called an
interval variable so again sticking with
this theme of countries of origin each
country if we look at the globe has a
longitude and a latitude and I can
compare the longitude and latitude of
each country and the distance from say
zero longitude to a hundred longitude is
the same as the distance from one
hundred longitude to two hundred
longitude they're equal intervals
they're equal spaces so longitude and
latitude those are equal interval
variables and in case you're not
familiar with longitude latitude here's
an image of the globe so longitude just
refers to the east west where are you on
on the globe and latitude just refers to
north south where are you on the globe
and again the point of this interval
variable is the distance between say
zero degrees latitude which is the
equator which is right here
the distance between zero degrees
latitude and say 30 degrees latitude is
the same as the distance between 30
degrees latitude and 60 degrees latitude
so this distance is equal to this
distance that's the point of an interval
variable is the intervals between each
unit are equal so we call them equal
interval variables okay the final type
of variable is a ratio variable this is
the same as interval but they also have
a
zero point so what I mean by a true zero
point so let's take population when I
talked about ranking the different
countries all I was doing is ranking
them I wasn't talking about the actual
populations if I wanted to look at the
actual population population is a ratio
variable and it's a ratio variable
because it has a zero point so if the
population of a country is zero that's
meaningful that's that means that it's
humans are extinct and that cut in that
country right so it's a true what what
we call a true zero another example is
age if your age is zero you literally
have no age another good example is
temperature so temperature on the Kelvin
scale we're not used to temperature on
the Kelvin scale unless you've taken a
lot of chemistry courses you might be
used to that but temperature on the
Kelvin scale is a ratio variable because
zero Kelvin is absolute zero means no
temperature it's absolute zero so
temperature on the Kelvin scale is a
good example of ratio variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
