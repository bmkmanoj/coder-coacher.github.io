histogram can be a useful plot to
generate when exploring a data set now
let's go over how we can create one
using Python we are interested in the
fraction of the vote that went to Barack
Obama in each County we can plot this as
a histogram using matplotlib pi plot
modules hist function we pass it the dem
share column of the data frame we could
also have passed it a numpy array with
the same data and it works just fine in
fact for this course and its sequel you
can use data frames and numpy arrays
interchangeably note that P Ltd hist
returns three arrays that I am NOT
interested in I only want the plot I
therefore assign a dummy variable called
underscore to them which is common
practice in Python after creating the
histogram we label the axes always label
your axes for histograms or any other
kind of plot otherwise no one can know
what it is that you are plotting you
probably didn't notice but this plot
looks slightly different than the first
plot I showed you can see it if you look
at them side-by-side they are different
because they have different binning in
the plot at the left we have ten bins
that were generated automatically by the
default settings of PLT dot hist and I
set up the bins on the right by myself i
specified where the edges of the bars of
the histogram are the bin edges and use
the bins keyword argument to pass that
to PLT dot hist you can also specify the
number of bins say 20 using the bins
keyword argument and matplotlib will
automatically generate 20 evenly spaced
bins now the plots we've made so far are
stylized with mat plot libs default
settings I prefer to use the default
settings of Seabourn an excellent
matplotlib based statistical data
visualization package written primarily
by michael Waskom we import it as SNS as
is traditionally done upon import we can
get the style to be Seabourn's default
using the SNS set function this results
in nicely formatted plots
beyond this stylistic functionality
Seabourn offers useful plotting
functions that we will explore in the
next video but before we do that let's
practice making some histograms with
some exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
