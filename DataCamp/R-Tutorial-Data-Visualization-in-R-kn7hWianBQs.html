instructor for this course I've been
using our or its commercial near
equivalent s+ for a long time to analyze
data in many different fields when we're
faced with a new data set especially a
large one one of the first questions we
need to ask is what's in it because our
ability to see patterns is very highly
developed an effective way to approach
this question is through graphical data
displays or data visualizations it is
important to distinguish between
exploratory visualizations designed to
help us see what's in a data set and
explanatory visualizations designed to
help others see what we have found as we
will see our provides many useful tools
for creating data visualizations of both
types the key to a useful exploratory
visualization is keeping all of the
potentially relevant details the
objective is to help you see what is in
the data and the key practical question
is how much detail can you see and
interpret the plot array on this slide
provides a representative example it
summarizes the relationships between the
four variables in the chicke weight data
frame in ARS built-in data sets package
from these plots we can see for example
that weight varies systematically with
time and that the chicks were assigned
to four different diets explanatory data
visualizations show others what you have
found in the data this means you must
make editorial decisions what features
do you want to highlight for emphasis
what features are distracting or
confusing and should be eliminated here
is an explanatory plot constructed from
the cars 93 data frame in the mass
package emphasizing the highway mileage
always exceeds city mileage using
techniques like reference lines and some
flower plots that you will learn about
in this
to visualize data our supports for
graphic systems base graphics is the
easiest to learn and is the focus of
this course grid graphics provides a
powerful set of modules from building
other tools lattice graphics is a
general-purpose graphic system based on
grid graphics and ggplot2 implements the
grammar of graphics in our and is also
based on grid graphics this first
example uses the base graphics plot
function to generate a simple scatter
plot of calories versus sugars from the
US serial data frame in the mass package
the second example uses grid graphics to
create essentially the same plot grid
graphics offers much greater power and
flexibility than base graphics but this
comes at the price of a steeper learning
curve and greater effort required to
create simple plots like this one this
is the reason that the grid graphic
system is mainly used by our package
developers to create special
visualizations or other graphic systems
like the lattice and ggplot2 packages
this third example illustrates the use
of the lattice package which makes it
easy to construct conditional scatter
plots like the one shown here these
plots allow us to see how the
relationship between the variables mpg
city and horsepower from the cars 93
data frame change for different values
of the cylinders variable finally this
fourth example gives a simple
illustration of how the ggplot2 package
can be used to build up more complex
data displays by adding new details to a
simple plot or modifying those details
now it's your turn
the next few exercises will give you a
chance to use the plot function for
yourself and begin learning what you can
do with base graphics in our</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
