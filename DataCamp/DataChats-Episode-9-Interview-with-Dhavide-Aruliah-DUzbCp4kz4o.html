scientist the data camp hi I'm in wi I'm
a computational scientist at continuum
analytics and and david and i will
debate with he's just finished our
recording the third in our series of
pandas courses this is on our combining
data frames in amanda's so maybe you can
tell us a bit about about the the course
or the process of you about designing
the courses in yeah in dec camp okay so
so we've been working collaborating
continuing and data camp in putting
together a few courses so we have you
know we first of all we plan out sort of
what it is that we want to do we sketch
out sort of the structure of what the
high level picture of the courses and we
try and do a sort of a reverse course
design backwards course design process
where we try and build the exercises and
then sort of work backwards to make sure
that everything we do in the lessons
supports those things adequately and
it's an iterative process there's a lot
of going back and forth and spend a lot
of time emailing and talking with Hugo
here in order to and my and my team of
course the the people that continuum the
other trainers that work with me I've
done a fantastic job of actually putting
together some really interesting
material i think that isn't it's very
subtle and difficult to get i think a
lot of time in pandas absolutely now and
something that i think you've done
wonderfully of these courses is to bring
the theoretical material but continually
apply it with a bunch of different
examples in case study oh yeah getting
the data sets and figuring out how to do
that is a really big out of it yeah
absolutely so maybe you can tell us a
bit about your team and what you do it
continuum so so i'm involved largely in
training a continuum so we have we
deliver training to various clients in
various sectors and we are pushing i
guess you know sort of the general open
data science ecosystem so largely python
mean because that's sort of where we
kind of grew up but also also are in
this sort of day whole anaconda
ecosystem
that that we we want to advocate for
open data science so people can actually
sort of experiment things things try
things out not get sort of locked into a
particular way of doing things find
different tools and and move very
quickly on the sort of the bleeding edge
so we're we're involved in any oh so
there's people that continues actually
do do development work and actually
we're building some very sophisticated
tools and libraries we do consulting and
training and various other kinds of
activity as well so you mentioned
anaconda which i think you know I've
been teaching data science in a variety
of X respects for some time I always
used to teach it in art because the
installs were so difficult for beginners
in white and land but the Anaconda
distribution was a game-changer for that
completely fundamental yeah yeah and I
mean it's but you know it's the the
leading sort of platform for open data
science right it's the it's powered by
Python but it's actually now it's moving
towards being more ignore slanguage
exhaustion renzo we're trying to we're
pushing our as a first class citizen as
well and trying to support people
working in our as well and I think
there's a lot of great possibilities to
for full package management's but oh but
also for just in general sort of gluing
together different kinds of tools this
is one of the things that sort of Python
had it has a bit of a head start and in
some sense that's that's fantastic
because that leads to my next question
which is well it's kind of twofold first
what you love about life and why do you
use it and secondly why why should our
students think about using biotech maybe
they're using our ah yeah that's an
interesting question and let's see if I
can think of as a short answer for this
so I like Python because of its elegance
in its simplicity it's really a very
yelling when I started using it i used
matlab for many years and i've also you
know programmed in lower level c in
fortran typed languages for a long time
as well but I phone when I sort of
really started to learn to use it and
get used to it it's sort of how it has a
real elegance to it as an interpreter
in simple language use for sort of
interactive development and where it
fits in i think a little differently is
it inherits a certain amount of its so
its its inherent so set amount of
structure from there's sort of the UNIX
operating system philosophy so it's
really designed to sort of with a pipe
and felt a kind of model where you can
kind of join together very a lot of
simple programs and get them to work
together so I think that's actually and
that's kind of an that was one of the
things that Python was designed for in
the late 1980s which accidentally almost
it wasn't intended that scientific
consumers would would really get excited
by this but they did it was more for the
development community was it was it was
more traditional sort of developing unix
utilities of the command because it's a
guido van rossum i think was if I
understand this correctly he was sort of
trying to find ways so that instead of
having to program these utilities and
see that you could actually use the pipe
pipe things together together he wanted
people to be able to do this in Python
and have quicker development cycles but
it turned out that people were able to
then but the nice thing about this model
is it allows you to glue together
different programs easily and make data
analysis pipelines easily right Oh
Travis Oliphant from then who designed
numpy when he was desired first
designing was working on that all
working on an earlier tools was looking
largely at sort of i think mr i type of
pipelines right and gluing together the
programs in Fortran and C and trying to
get these things to play together nicely
you know so I think this is in
particular this is one of the things i
would say and i don't i don't know are
very well yeah i don't want I definitely
don't want to be rubbishing rubbishing
anyone elses I don't like to do that
anyway and in programming languages but
but I think that you know our was
designed with statistics in mind and and
just like MATLAB with matrix linear
algebra in mine and those tools are
really good for those things but when
you start to try and build out from that
it's there's a little bit of it's a
little bit difficult you'll find do that
because there's a different underlying
design philosophies involved in the
language
I don't and I don't know how easy it is
to sort of glue some of those things and
yeah we're serving Python because it was
designed with the explicit goal of
gluing things together easily you know
it actually you know so then you know
other other scientific libraries came as
an afterthought and so the numpy and
scifi and the rest pandas and the rest
of that scientific stack it wasn't the
first thing was that was there but it
actually you know so it built it it sort
of has borrowed from other sort of
mathematical libraries in a design but
you know so does those things quite well
but you also have the ability to glue
things together and pipe things from
different data streams relatively
cleanly and I funk and I think that's
something that I don't know how easy
that is to do in our or in other
packages I haven't texted environmental
with it but I suspect that would be one
of the when you actually saw getting
into very complicated data processing
pipelines Python has a certain leverage
of playing around with operating systems
in a way that I think that our may not
absolutely and I think also on top of
that pie thing can be relatively easily
plugged into some sort of full stack
development infrastructure so you can
you know build up your your web apps and
web infrastructure and have that with a
database and that's true yeah yeah and
and people do that yeah definitely
exactly so that's actually one of the
exciting sort of flexible too flexible
things about yeah so the courses we've
we've created together we've created a
number of data visualization courses and
a number of pants at state of
manipulation courses at income these are
two of the most fundamental aspects of
data science you also have machine
learning and statistics and all of these
types of things we have a lot of
students out there who data science
things like this big kind of unbearable
base to deal with initially I was
wondering if you had any words of advice
to the budding data scientist huh well
yeah it's a really good question i think
the what i would say is figure out what
kinds of problems you really want to
solve I think the you know when you have
a big problem
always very daunting and challenging to
sort of get into it and I think one of
the things I learned way back when I was
a graduate student is the important
thing to do is ask the simple you know
most idiotic questions first because if
I can't answer the idiotic questions I'm
not going to be able to answer any of
the other deeper ones so ask the simple
questions first make sure I know what
the answers are for those and and then
just keep digging slowly and when you
break it into smaller pieces that that
amorphous you know blob of massive
challenges out there it gets more
manageable so you know start small I
suppose is the way that I would you know
if you're feeling overwhelmed start
small and slowly as you start taking
smaller bites eventually you'll start
taking bigger bites yes yeah all right
well that's it for me to be it's been a
pleasure it's been wonderful here so
thank you very much I hope you all enjoy
the courses as do I all right thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
