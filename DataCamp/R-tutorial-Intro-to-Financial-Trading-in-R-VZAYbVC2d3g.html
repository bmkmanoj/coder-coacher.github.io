establish the reasons people trade and
what a trade is first and foremost a
trade is simply the act of buying or
selling an asset whether that's a
financial security such as stock that is
ownership of a company's equity a bond
that is ownership of a company's or
government's debt or a tangible physical
product such as commodities like gold
oil metals and corn and this is done
through converting cash such as dollars
into ownership of this product and
either converting the product such as
shares in the company's stock back into
cash hopefully for a profit or actually
taking delivery of a physical good such
as an oil company taking the shipment of
crude oil free Fineman while making a
profit from acting on trading
opportunities is one reason for trading
there are others certain companies whose
business revolves around commodities and
through the financial markets to protect
themselves from the business impact of
price movements of an underlying
commodity for example Hershey's might
want to establish a good price for
chocolate airlines want to minimize the
impact the price movement of oil has on
their business and so on for instance if
the price of oil arises too much an
airline doesn't protect itself against
that it would either have to raise
ticket prices while its competitors
don't or make a lot less profit large
financial institutions may want to
increase or decrease their exposure to
various sources of returns and the
riskiness that comes with them at the
heart of the matter
is that financial instruments bear risk
and a payoff allegedly for bearing that
risk the aim of a systematic trading
strategy is to make an educated guess as
to when the ratio of reward to risk is
favorable enough to bear the risk and in
turn gain compensation while not bearing
that risk when the compensation is
insufficient in terms of the mechanics
of trading there are essentially two
types of trades divergence also called
momentum or trend trading is the belief
that a quantity will continue to
increase or decrease if it has already
been increasing or decreasing
respectively a class of hedge funds
known as commodity trading advisors or
CTAs have made a lot of money on proper
trend-following trading techniques these
classes of strategies are characterized
by suffering small losses in trennis
markets while making a great deal of
money when a trend establishes the
opposite style of trading is convergence
meaner version oscillation or contrarian
style trading this type of trading
philosophy is one that attempts to
predict when a certain quantity will
reverse direction for instance the famed
Warren Buffett its value investing
philosophy is one that buys companies
after the price has suffered a
considerable amount of depreciation in
the hopes that this price depreciation
has mostly run its course and will
reverse the near future contrarian
trading styles are classified by many
small gains while suffering the
occasional larger loss when entering the
depreciating position too early let's
move on to some exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
