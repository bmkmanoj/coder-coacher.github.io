data visualization here we're going to
build on the skills you learned in the
first course
to develop a wide variety of not only
appealing for meaningful plots will
examine the last four layers statistics
coordinates facets and themes in detail
we'll also give you some tips for
database best practices so you can make
proper use of your new skill set at the
end we'll wrap up with the case study
using the California health information
survey which will guide us through a
complete process from exploratory to
flexible explanatory visualizations Ora
has risen dramatically in popularity
over the past years not only because it
offers excellent visualizations but also
because they can combine this with a
strong statistical foundation in this
chapter we'll explore how this happens
in Japan to statistics layer there are
two broad categories of functions in
this family
those are calls from within a genome and
those which are called independently as
you may have guessed all the statistical
functions begin with stats underscore
actually we've already encountered stats
functions when we use giome histogram
recall that under the hood this function
called stat bin to summarize a total
count in each group you may also
remember that when we discussed G on bar
I mentioned that it's default status set
to bin so we could have produced the
same result if we use G own bar or we
could have just called stat indirectly
and produced the same plot you also saw
this in the exercises where stat bin
also took grouping by fill into account
that bin simply counts the number of
observations in a given group so you can
see why it's a default stat for the
histogram bar and frequency Polly
genomes that we saw earlier now you can
appreciate what that warning message is
telling us that bin bin with defaulted
to range over 30 it's referring to a
stats layer and its associated argument
that was called in the background what
are some other statistics that are
typically called in this way stat smooth
is a commonly u statistic that we can
access with giome smooth recall one of
our previous scatter plots compared
sepal width to length in three irish
species on top of genome point we can
call angioma smooth which in turn calls
stat smooth
the standard error which is shown as a
great rhythm behind our smooth is by
default the 95% confidence interval we
can remove this by setting the SCE
argument false we know we are calling
stat smooth because another warning
message
geom smooth method equals auto and size
of largest group is less than 1000 so
using louis louis is a non parametric
smoothing algorithm that basically works
by passing a siding window along the x
axis
within each window a weighted mean is
calculated for the model the span
argument controls alpha which is the
degree of smoothing you can think of
this as the size of the window smaller
spans are more noisy as we can see here
from within ggplot2 we can use the
method argument to call parametric
models such as LM g LM r LM g am for
groups larger than 1000 the method
defaults to G am here's an example of
the basic ordinary least-squares
regression using LM notice that in both
the lowest and the ln examples the model
is calculated on the different groups
defined by color will see how to
override this in the exercises we can
again remove the 95% CI by setting the
SE to false notice that the linear model
is not predictive although it can mean
by default it is bound to the limit of
the data on the x-axis if we are using a
parametric method we can ask for
predictions by using the full range
argument just as we'd expect the error
increases the further away from our data
set we attempt to use our estimate there
are a variety of other status functions
which we will encounter throughout the
rest of the data visualization courses
some of which are particularly useful
for dealing with large data sets such as
been docked in hex bin 2d and contour
will encounter those in the next course
when we considered the graphics of large
data sets in general you won't have to
call these functions directly but it is
worth knowing about the relationship
between G ohms and their respective
statistics you'll understand warning and
error messages better and the help pages
for the stats function are often more
formative if you need to adjust any
parameters
okay let's see how stop functions work
in practice in the exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
