credit risk modeling course my name is
Laura I'm a data scientist at data Kamp
and I will help you master some basics
of the credit risk modeling field the
area of credit risk modeling is all
about the event of loan default now what
is lonelyville when a bank runs alone to
a borrower which could be an individual
or a company the bank will usually
transferred the entire amount of the
loan to the borrower the borrower will
then reimburse this amount in smaller
chunks including some interest payments
over time usually these payments happen
monthly quarterly or yearly of course
there is a certain risk that a borrower
will not be able to fully reimbursed
this loan this results in a loss for the
bank the expected loss a bank will incur
is composed of three elements the first
element is a probability of default
which is the probability that the
borrower will fail to make a full
repayment of the loan the second element
is the exposure at default or EAD which
is the expected value of the loan at the
time of default you can also look at
this as the amount of the loan that
still needs to be repaid at a time of
default the third element is loss given
default which is the amount of the loss
if there is a default expressed as a
percentage of the EAD multiplying these
three elements leads to the formula of
expected loss in this course we'll focus
on the probability of default banks keep
information on the default behavior of
fast customers which can be used to
predict default for new customers
broadly this information can be
classified in two types the first type
of information is application
information examples of application
information are income marital status
etc the second type of information
behavior information drags the past
behavior of customers for example the
current account balance and payment irir
history let's have a look at the first
10 lines of our data set this data set
contains information on path
Sloane's each line represents one
customer and his or her information
along with the loan status indicator
which equals one if the customer
defaulted and zero if the customer did
not default loan status will be D will
be used as a response variable and takes
planetary variables are the amount of
the loan the interest rate great
employment length home ownership status
the annual income and the age the grid
is a bureau score of the customer where
a indicates the highest class of
creditworthiness and G the lowest this
bureau score reflects the credit history
of the individual and is the only
behavioral variable in the data set for
an overview of the data structure for
categorical variables you can use the
cross table function in the G models
package applying this function to the
whole ownership variable you get a table
with each of the categories in this
variable with the number of cases and
proportions using loan status as a
second argument you can look at a
relationship between its vector variable
and the response by setting prop R
equals to true and the other proportions
listed here equal to false you get to
row eyes proportions now what does this
result tell you it seems that the
default rates in the hoenn ownership
group other is quite a bit higher and a
default rate in for example the home
ownership group mortgage with seventeen
point five versus nine point eight
percent of defaults in these groups
respectively now let's explore other
aspects of the data using our</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
