tools you can quickly generate and
investigate a histogram you can
immediately get a feel for your data by
plotting all of them with bee swarm
plots or ec DFS in almost every dataset
we encounter in this course and in its
sequel and also in real life we start
with graphical EDA remember what Tookie
said exploratory data analysis can never
be the whole story but nothing else can
serve as the foundation stone in the
next chapter you will build upon
graphical EDA
with quantitative EDA which allows you
to compute useful summary statistics
with your foundation stone in place you
will spend the last half of this course
learning to think probabilistically you
will learn about probability
distributions for both discrete and
continuous variables which provide the
mathematical foundation for you to draw
meaningful conclusions about your data
we will not get mired in mathematical
details but rather will unleash the
power of the numpy random module to use
hacker statistics in order to simulate
the probabilistic stories and
distributions that we encounter you will
find that by writing a few lines of
Python code you can perform even
putatively complicated statistical
analyses as you work through this course
and its sequel you will grow ever closer
to being able to tell what two key calls
the whole story now let's get to work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
