exploring pitch data in R my name is
Brian Mills and I'll be your instructor
in this course you'll use a Cranky's
2015 season as your case study while
gronke has been an excellent MLB pitcher
for a number of years he had an
especially dominant month of July
in 2015 the data in this course will
allow you to examine this more closely
and compare his july to other months
throughout the course you'll use a
single dataset describing every pitch
thrown by Greinke to explore changes
that may have taken place with respect
to his pitch velocity pitch usage pitch
location embedded ball outcomes across
different months you'll begin in this
chapter by exploring pitch velocity by
the end of the chapter you'll have done
enough exploratory analysis to answer
the question of whether grand Keys
fastball velocity was higher in July
relative to the other months he pitched
in 2015
throughout the exercises in this chapter
you'll gradually develop graphical
skills to make colorful histograms to
meaningfully compare velocity
distributions finally note that you'll
return to some of that analysis in the
final chapter of the course where you'll
evaluate whether changes in fastball
velocity had any impact on hitting
outcomes the data used for this course
are usually referred to as pitch FX or
statcast data these data use high tech
cameras in a Doppler radar system to
collect information on how fast pitches
are thrown the type of pitch thrown the
location of each pitch the movement and
spin rate of each pitch the velocity of
batted balls and the direction and
distance the ball is hit there's also
information on better handedness and the
ultimate outcome of each pitch that's
thrown for example if the batter swung
and missed this is included in the data
and the variable pitch result with the
entry swinging strike alternatively if
the batter didn't swing the data
included information on whether the
pitch was called a ball or a strike by
the umpire finally there's information
on the outcome of the at-bat such as
whether the batter hit a homerun popped
out walked struck out or any number of
other general baseball outcomes
as you proceed through the course you'll
examine all of these variables but first
you'll want to clean the data so that
certain analyses can be performed
correctly in our the initial data set
you'll use is named cranky the dates in
the data set requires some editing and
for you to tell are that it should read
the game date column as a date notice
that when you check the class of the
game date variable it's listed as a
character string it works better if this
is entered as a date to allow for
plotting time series data later in the
chapter to reformat the variable as a
date you'll use the as dot date function
this function allows you to specify how
your dates are formatted in your data
the dates in the gran key data set
should be formatted as month/day/year
separated by forward slashes you'll also
make use of the separate function in the
tidy our package to manipulate the game
date variable this allows you to specify
a new variable called month so that you
can break up your data into each month
later in the chapter as you proceed
through the next few exercises
remember that tidying up your data is
always an important first step before
diving into your analyses this step
ensures that more complex analysis down
the road will go more smoothly go ahead
and get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
