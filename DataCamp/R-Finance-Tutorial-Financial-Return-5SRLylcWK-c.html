oriented course there are some financial
terms and mathematics that you will have
to be comfortable with to do the
exercises one of these is the concept of
returns it will be easiest to
demonstrate this through an example
suppose you have $50 worth of apple
stock if that stock earns you a 10%
return in January how much money do you
have at the end of the month the math
word is isn't complicated 10% of 50 is
five dollars so by adding this to your
existing $50 you now have $55 great now
let's think about this a different way
at the end of the month you have a
hundred percent of your original cash
the $50 and now we have an extra 10
percent in total you now have a hundred
and ten percent of your original value
dividing this by a hundred to term
percentages into decimals gives us the
following equation the one point 10 you
see there is important you will use this
value as a return multiplier multiplying
your original $50 by this multiplier
gives us the correct answer of fifty
five dollars time to generalize this the
general formula in terms of variables
for the return multiplier is the
following one plus the interest rate
divided by a hundred to change it to a
decimal using this we can then say that
a total amount at the next period is the
original amount times a multiplier this
example can easily extend for multiple
periods for example if you also earned
an extra five percent in February how
much money would you have at the end of
February simple take the amount at the
end of January $55 and multiply this by
the return multiplier corresponding to
5% 1.05 but wait if you write this math
another way you can see that this is
nothing more than the original $50 times
the multiplier for january times the
multiplier for February to move two
months forward we multiply original $50
by the return multipliers for those two
months now it's your turn the next two
exercises will test your knowledge of
financial returns in combination with
variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
