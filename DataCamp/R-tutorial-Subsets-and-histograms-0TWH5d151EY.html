appropriately it's time to start
exploring your data you'll begin by
exploring the start speed variable this
variable indicates the velocity of each
pitch thrown as it leaves the pitchers
hand it's important to note that the
velocity measurements are in miles per
hour and the variable is entered as a
numeric scale variable and are you'll
begin by using a histogram to visually
explore the velocity of Gran Keys
pitches in later exercises you'll
describe the data numerically the
histogram is a basic visualization tool
for exploring the characteristics of
your data using all of the start speed
data it's easy to plot a histogram and R
with the code here and get a very basic
looking plot you'll improve on the look
of this plot and the exercises you can
also indicate where the overall average
start speed is on your histogram using
the a beeline function in this case you
want to tell our to draw a vertical line
using the V is equal to perimeter we
want to make V equal to the mean start
speed in the Gran key data set let's
also color the line red so it's easy to
see on our histogram something else to
notice about this figure is that it can
be useful in identifying multimodal
distributions this could indicate some
separation and velocity related to the
type of pitch thrown this is easy to see
here where it looks like cranky has a
higher velocity distribution for fast
balls and a separate lower velocity
distribution for all speed pitches you
can identify pitch type in the data with
the pitch type variable and make a
separate histogram of each pitch type
here let's just create a histogram for
sliders represented by the SL code in
the pitch type variable first we'll use
the if/else function to make a new
variable called slider the if/else
function simply tells our that if the
pitch type variable is equal to SL then
we want our new variable to be equal to
one otherwise we make the variable equal
to zero notice that the ones in the new
variable line up perfectly with the SL
code in the pitch type variable you
could also make a variable called not
slider in this case you would tell our
that we want this variable equal to one
if pitch type does not equal slider and
zero otherwise you can see the desired
result here any pitch type that is not a
slider is equal to one in the knot
slider variable and any pitch type that
is a slider is equal to zero now that
we've made a new variable to indicate a
pitch was a slider we can use this to
easily subset our data the subset
function is an easy way to do this
naming the new data set crank ESL we
tell our to keep any data where the
slider variable is equal to 1 notice
here that our new data includes only
sliders further note that within the
subset function you are ready to note
what data is being subsets and therefore
when you give are the condition for the
sub setting you do not have to use the
data name and the dollar sign to choose
your vector granted the original if else
was not necessary as we could have also
subset by the pitch type variable in the
first place and ended up with the same
result this makes subsets pretty
convenient we when we want to work with
portions of our data finally when making
a histogram of just sliders we can see
that the distribution of a single pitch
type is much closer to a normal
distribution than what we saw with all
pitch types throughout the next few
exercises you'll be performing similar
operations to examine grain Keys
fastball velocity and compare July to
other months of the year now start
exploring your data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
