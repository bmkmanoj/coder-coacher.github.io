containing a bivariate outlier 4-h and
annual income from the dataset what we
did not discuss before is that there are
missing inputs or n A's which stand for
not available for two variables
employment length and interest rate in
this video we will demonstrate some
methods for handling missing data on the
employment linked variable you'll
practice this newly gained knowledge
yourself on the variable interest rate
first you want to know how many inputs
are missing as this will affect what you
will do with them a simple way of
finding out is with the function summary
if you do this for employment length you
will see that there are eight hundred
and nine days there are generally three
ways to treat missing inputs delete them
replace them or keep them we will
illustrate these methods unemployment
lengths when deleting you can either
delete observations we're missing inputs
are detected or delete an entire
variable typically you would only want
to delete observations if there is just
a small number of missing inputs I would
only consider deleting an entire
variable when many cases are missing
using this construction with which and
is an a the rows with missing inputs are
deleted in the new data set Loan data no
n/a to delete the entire variable
employment link you simply set the
employment link variable in the loan
data equal to null here we save the
result to a copy of the data set called
low end data delete employee making a
copy of your original data before
deleting things can be a good way to
avoid losing information but may be
costly if working with very large data
sets second when replacing a variable
common practice is to replace missing
values with a median of the values that
are actually observed this is called
median imputation last you can keep the
missing values since in some cases the
fact that a value is missing is
important information unfortunately
keeping the NA s as such it's not always
possible
as some methods will automatically
delete rows with an ace because they
cannot deal with them so how can we keep
an ace a popular solution is scores
classification using this method you
basically put a continuous variable into
so-called bins let's start off making a
new variable amp cat which will be the
variable replacing amp length the
employment length in our data set
ranges from 0 to 62 years we will put
employment lengths into bins of roughly
15 years with groups 0 to 15 15 to 30 30
to 45 45 Plus and a missing group
representing dnase let's see how this
changes our data now let's look at the
plot of this new factor variable it
appears that the bin 0 to 15 contains a
very high proportion of the cases so it
might seem more reasonable to look at
bins of different ranges but with
similar frequencies as shown here you
can get these results by trial and error
for different bin ranges or by using
quantile functions to know exactly where
the breaks should be to get more
balanced bins before trying this all of
us in our yourself let me finish the
video with a couple of remarks first all
the methods for missing data can also be
applied to outliers if you think an
outlier is wrong you can treat it as an
A and use any of the methods we have
discussed in this chapter second you may
have noticed I only talked about
missingness for continuous variables in
this chapter
what about factor variables here's the
basic approach for categorical variables
deletion works in the exact same way as
for continuous variables deleting either
observations or entire variables when
you wish to replace a missing factor
variable this is done by assigning it to
the model class which is a class with
the highest frequency keeping an ace for
a categorical variable is done by
including a missing category now let's
try some of these methods your
self</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
