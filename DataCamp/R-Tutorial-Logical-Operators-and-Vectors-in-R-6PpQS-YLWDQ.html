in are awesome but what if you want to
change our combined results of these
comparisons or does this using the and
the or and the not operator let's have a
closer look at each one of them and
start with the end operator
the end operator works just as you would
expect it typically takes two logical
values and returns true only if both
these logical values are true themselves
this means that true and true evaluates
the true but that false and true true
and false and false and false all
evaluate to false instead of using
logical values we can of course use the
results of comparisons suppose you have
a variable X equal to 12 the check if
this variable is greater than 5 but less
than 15 we can use X greater than 5 and
X less than 15 as you already learned
the first part will evaluate the true
the second part will also evaluate the
true so the result of this expression is
true this makes sense because 12 lies
between 5 and 15 however if X were equal
to 17 the expression X greater than 5
and X less than 15 would simplify to
true and false which results in this
expression being false
the our operator works similarly but a
difference is that only at least one of
the logical values it uses should be
equal to true for the entire operation
to evaluate it true this means that true
or true equals true but that also true
or false and false or true evaluate to
true when both logicals are false in our
operation so in the case of false our
false result is false remember that the
our operation is not an exclusive or
operation so true or true equals true as
well
just as for ant operators we can use
comparisons together with the R operator
suppose you have variable y equal to 5
this time to see if this variable is
less than 5 or greater than 15 we can
use this expression R will first carry
out the comparisons resulting in true or
false which in turn results in true now
let's FY equal 14 the expression y less
than 5 or y greater than 15 now
evaluates to false or false neither one
of the comparisons are true so the
result is false
there's one less operator I want to talk
about here the not operator the not
operator represented by an exclamation
mark simply negates the logical value
it's used on so exclamation mark true
evaluates to false while exclamation
mark false evaluates to true
just as the Arendt and operators you can
use the not operator in combination with
logical operators this is not always
necessary however because this line of
code is exactly the same as this one
however there are cases in our where the
not operator is really handy for example
the built in our function is numeric
checks F and our object is a numeric as
an illustration take is numeric five
which evaluates to true as five is a
numeric you negate this result using the
not operator we get false if however we
type is numeric hello we get false
negating this result gives us true
now how the logical operators work with
vectors and matrices well just as
relational operators they perform the
operations element-wise the end
operation on these two vectors results
in a vector with the elements true false
and false the first elements in both
vectors are true so the first element of
the resulting vector contains true
similarly for the second elements are
true and false result in false and the
third elements where false and false
give false similar thing happens with
the our operator true or true gives true
true or false also gives true and false
or false gives false the not operator
also works on every element of the
vector Druce are converted two falses
and falses are converted to truth
now there's one last thing I want to
warn you about it's about the difference
between a single and a double and
percent or vertical bar in R you can use
both the single signed version or the
double signed version but result of the
logical operation you're carrying out
can be different
the biggest difference occurs when you
use the two types of operations on
vectors as we've seen before this
expression evaluates to a vector
containing true false and false however
if we use a double ampersand we simply
get true that's because a double
ampersand operation only examines the
first element of each vector in this
case the first elements are true and
true so the expression returns true you
can see similar things happening with
the R operator
single sign version returns an entire
vector while the double signed version
returns only the result of the R
operator on the first element of each
vector
another difference between a single and
a double ampersand or vertical bar that
is less obvious has something to do with
control structures but that's more
advanced material for now just remember
that you have to pay attention when
doing logical operations on vectors you
will very likely want to use the single
sign versions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
