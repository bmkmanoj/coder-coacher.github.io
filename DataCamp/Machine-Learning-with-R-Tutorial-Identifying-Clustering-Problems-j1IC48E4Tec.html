scientist and user of the our language
and I'll be your instructor for this
course on unsupervised learning in our
in this first chapter I will define
unsupervised learning provide an
overview of the three major types of
machine learning and you'll learn how to
execute one particular type of
unsupervised learning using our there
are three major types of machine
learning the first type is unsupervised
learning
the goal of and supervised learning is
to find structure and unlabeled data
unlabeled data is data without a target
without label responses contrast this
with supervised learning supervised
learning is used when you want to make
predictions and labeled data on data
with a target types of predictions
include regression or predicting how
much of something there is or could be
and classification which is predicting
what type or class something is or could
be the final type is reinforcement
learning where computer learns from
feedback by operating in a real or
synthetic environment here's a quick
example of the difference between
labeled and unlabeled data the table on
the left is an example with three
observations about shapes each shape
with three features represented by the
three columns this table the one on the
left is an example of unlabeled data if
an additional vector of labels is added
like the column of labels on the right
hand side labeling each observations
belonging to one of two groups then we
would have labeled data within
unsupervised learning there are two
major goals the first goal is to find
homogeneous subgroups within a
population as an example let us pretend
we have a population of six people each
member of this population might have
some attributes or features some
examples of features for a person might
be annual income educational attainment
and gender with those three features one
might find there are two homogeneous
subgroups or groups for the members are
similar by some measure similarity once
the members of each group are found we
might label one group subgroup a and the
other subgroup B the process of finding
homogeneous subgroups is referred to as
clustering there are many possible
applications of clustering one use case
is segmenting a market of consumer
or potential consumers this is commonly
done by finding groups or clusters of
consumers based on demographic features
and purchasing history another example
of clustering would be to find groups of
movies based on features of each movie
and the reviews of the movies one might
do this to find movies most like another
movie the second goal of unsupervised
learning is to find patterns in the
features of the data one way to do this
is through dimensionality reduction
dimensionality reduction is a method to
decrease the number of features to
describe an observation while
maintaining the maximum information
content under the constraints of lower
dimensionality dimensionality reduction
is often used to achieve two goals in
addition to finding patterns in the
features of the data dimensionality
reduction allows one to visually
represent high dimensional data while
maintaining much of the data variability
this is done because visually
representing an understanding data with
more than three or four features can be
difficult for both the producer and
consumer of the visualization the third
major reason for dimensionality
reduction is as a pre-processing step
for supervised learning more on this
usage will be covered later finally a
few words about the challenges and
benefits typical and performing
unsupervised learning and then
supervised learning there's often no
single goal of the analysis this can be
presented as someone asking you the
analyst to find some patterns in the
data with that challenge unsupervised
learning often demands and brings out
the deep creativity of the analyst
finally there's much more unlabeled data
than labeled data this means there are
more opportunities to apply unsupervised
learning in your work now it's your turn
to practice what you've learned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
