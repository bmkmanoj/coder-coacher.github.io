histogram the histogram is a type of
visualization that's very useful to
explore your data it can help you to get
an idea about the distribution of your
variables to see how it works
imagine 12 values between 0 &amp;amp; 6 I've put
them along a number line here
to build a histogram for these values
you can divide the line into equal
chunks called bins suppose you go for 3
bins that each have a width of 2 next
you count how many data points sit
inside each bin there's four data points
in the first bin six in the second bin
and two in the third pin finally you
draw a bar for each bin the height of
the bar corresponds to the number of
data points that fall in this bin result
is a histogram which gives us a nice
overview on how the twelve values are
distributed most values are in the
middle but there are more values below
to the nature are above four of course
also matplotlib
is able to build histograms as before
you should start by importing the pipe
lock package that's inside math booklet
next you can use the hist function let's
open up its documentation there's a
bunch of arguments you can specify but
the first two here are the most
important ones X should be a list of
values you want to build a histogram for
you can use the second arguments bins to
tell Python and how many bins the data
should be divided based on this number
hist will automatically find appropriate
boundaries for all bins and calculate
how many failures are in each one if you
don't specify the bins argument for be
10 by default so to generate the
histogram that you've seen before let's
start by building a list with the 12
values next you simply call hist and
pass this list as an input so it's
matched to the arguments X I also
specify the bins arguments to be treated
so that the values are divided in three
bins if you finally call the show
function a nice histogram results
histograms are really useful to give a
bigger picture as an example have a look
at this so-called population pyramids
the age distribution is shown for both
males and females in the European Union
notice that the histogram
flipped 90 degrees the bins are
horizontal now the bins are largest for
the ages 40 to 44 where there are 20
million meals and 20 million females
they are the so-called baby boomers
these are figures of the year 2010 what
do you think will have changed in 2050
let's have a look the distribution is
flatter and the baby boom generation has
gotten older with the blink of an eye
you can easily see how demographics will
be changing over time and that's the
true power of histograms at work here
now head over to the exercises to
experiment with histograms yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
