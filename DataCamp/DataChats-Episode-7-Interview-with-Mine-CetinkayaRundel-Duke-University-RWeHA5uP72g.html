data camp and I'm very very very pleased
to be here today with Meena Chetan kaya
rondell and I think that's the first
time I've ever publicly tried to
pronounce her last name but I think I
nailed it okay great so we just finished
recording for Mina's new course which
we're calling an introduction to data
it'll be the first in a long series of
intro stats courses on data camp which
we're really excited about so welcome
thank you all right so be here cool
so I've got a few questions lined up and
the first of which is a question that I
asked often which is people in the data
science community associate with many
different labels statistician data
scientist data analyst hacker etc which
of these labels do you associate with
the most my um hard question I don't
usually associate it with a lot of
labels I'm a whatever it works in but I
must a decision by training I think a
lot of what I've been doing lately
within the education community is veers
a bit more towards data science perhaps
than statistics just because I haven't
lately been working on a lot of
statistics methodology um but that being
said I think that overall at the core of
all of this is data and I think that's
what excites me the most so i'm a person
that does hopefully exciting stuff with
data and sometimes that veers more into
the statistical methodologies territory
sometimes that stays more in though i
have some data and how do i do something
meaningful with it um but as a label
that's a little harder to answer I'd say
I'm like a chameleon I change from one
to another from day to day yeah okay
cool yeah and so just to get it on the
record I was showing mean of the
questions beforehand and when she saw
the question about a label I think your
gut reaction was crazy cat lady yes that
would be a label I associate with that
probably is not going
anytime soon okay cool unfortunately
that was outside of the scope of
possibilities for that question hey no
it's there all right so you're a
statistician why did you choose
statistics and how how did you get from
a a child who probably did not
understand the notion of statistics to
becoming a not only statistician but a
well known statistician and a stats
educator so I have not the first stats
course I took was in college not in high
school I finished high school in Turkey
I took a lot of math courses I love my
math classes I was okay or good in math
and I was thinking that I would study
something math related in college but
what I ended up studying was actuarial
science and in fact I actually worked as
an actuarial consultant for two years
after undergrad can you explain what
that is for people sure so when we talk
about you aerial science we're thinking
kind of risk management insurance that
type of field and I was working as a
retirement actuarial consultant so our
clients were firms who provided
retirement plans to their employees so
you need to project how much they might
owe into the future so that you can then
project that back and say well if you
set aside this much money today you
might be able to pay your employees how
long will this perspective live or how
likely are how likely are they to incur
some sort of injury or disability
exactly so there's a lot of mortality
tables involved which is exciting to
some and not to others and there's also
the time value of money involved so you
kind of put the the probability
conversation along with a little bit of
econ conversation there um and I was
working as an actuarial consultant for a
while and then one night working very
late I was working in New York so late
nights were think I looked at my boss
and I thought that's the highest I can
get to in my life I can do fantastically
and I'm still gonna end up here eating
takeout at 11:00 p.m.
working for a client so I thought maybe
I'll do something else with my life and
I I used to do a lot of tutoring when I
was in under
and I enjoyed the teaching aspect of
things so I thought I'll try going to
graduate school try to get a PhD if I
can get into a good program and then I
might perhaps decide to stay in academia
and I could with a PhD you can pretty
much teach at any level you can continue
teaching college or it could go and
teach high school if you wanted to so I
thought that would open the most doors
for me and that's how I decided to do
graduate school and looking back at what
I had studied before I figured probably
math or stats was my best bet I was I
did apply to both math and stat programs
but in my heart I was hoping to get into
a statistics program just because I like
the applied nature of statistics a bit
more than math theory in terms of
something that I like spending my time
on sure so I can definitely relate to
the desire to like have a real-world
application for for statistics what did
you think you want to do apply stats to
when you started yet and into stats grad
programs I thought that I was going to
be working with genetics data a lot and
the reason for this is so my
undergraduate was a business school I
didn't have to take a whole lot of other
courses so the one Natural Science
course I did take was a genetics course
and I love the like the statistical
applications within genetics so I was
thinking that that's the research area
that I'm going to want to go in that did
not end up being what happened at all
but I think that's a good story I think
if anybody's watching who's kind of like
unclear of what they want to do
especially if you're applying to
graduate schools they want you to write
a personal statement and they want it to
sound you know like that is indeed what
you're passionate about and indeed it
was but I think it's okay that if it
changes as you learn more things so I
went into graduate school thinking I
would do research working with genetics
data I dabbled in that a little bit took
a couple courses and then decided I
wanted to do things a little more
differently sure you reserve the right
to change your mind I think so good
cool so are is a big part of what you do
yeah and and and and and I can certainly
relate to that so
I why our how are you first introduced
our and what is it about our that
excited you enough to to keep keep Euler
anymore I was first introduced to are in
graduate school which is I don't know
maybe embarrassing like I just hope that
people in quantitative fields in college
are being introduced to computing
earlier than I was I'm the same exact so
I was introduced when I was in graduate
school I didn't have to do much
competing for my undergrad I did need to
do quite a bit of like coding as part of
my job that I had but it was in
different languages not our and the
graduate school I went to at UCLA the
ph.d program uses our heavily and so
that's where I was first introduced to
it um it was a steep learning curve
initially I must admit but certain
things I loved about it so for example
as part of my my job as an actuarial
scientist we used to work with data a
lot and there was a whole lot of data
manipulation that we would do in Excel
and we would try to take notes for the
next person to you know see oh I changed
this cell because the client called me
and said this was the actual number and
then you write it down somewhere and you
hope that this makes it into the
official records it really does and you
know causes some headaches creeper
disability was yes yeah so I really like
this whole like scripting aspect of
things so that to me worked well with my
OCD nature learning the syntax was a
huge kind of learning curve but that's
when I got started with it from the
first year of grad school I used it as
part of my research and I use it as part
of my teaching starting in grad school
and have been doing it ever since
okay very good so maybe that's a good
segue into my next question which is how
did you learn our like how did you teach
yourself the language and you've been
very involved in stats education and our
education recently and what what tools
do you see around you now and this is
not supposed to be like a loaded or
self-serving question but like what what
what tools have you been involved in
building yourself that you wish you had
when you were trying to learn these
things yeah so
in terms of learning our when I was
learning art I think it was just the are
like the shell so you just open it
there's the cursor and there's nothing
that you can look at the the plot window
will appear should you plot something
but it's not there otherwise similar
with the help window so it was like this
empty slate that you have to get started
with and to me that was a bit
intimidating to be honest so I'll say
that once I started using our studio and
things are kind of old later or it's
clear from the starting point where a
plot might go if you make one
I thought those visual cues were very
helpful so I do wish that when I was
first starting off that kind of a tool
was interface a less intimidating
interface a less intimidating interface
and also something that helps you
scripts what you're doing like take a
record of what you're doing
I do remember very well when I was first
using our maybe I'd be at my machine on
campus and then I'd be like okay now I'm
gonna close this down and where does all
the war go you know if I had typed in a
bunch of stuff in the console it just
been vanishing into the ether isn't what
it felt like to me so I I loved doing my
you know work in something like an hour
markdown document and that's one of the
things that I worked on bringing into
the introductory stats curriculum for
example it seems like another layer
you're adding on to teaching art because
then now we're also teaching a markdown
syntax as well but it's so lightweight
that I think students can handle that
and just starting with this like empty
shell of a report perhaps that you need
to fill as opposed to just the console
where you're going to type some code
into and you're definitely going to make
typos and definitely going to see errors
and you know everything is going to kind
of disappear in your console and will be
hard to pick your work back up I think
that was that made life harder for me
and was intimidating and that's one of
the things I worked on in terms of
integrating this reporting and using our
markdown and the rep reducible framework
into the introductory teaching of our
that I think has been successful and
have been adopted by many which is
fantastic
cool so I'd like to elaborate on that a
little bit more so you brought up an
interesting point which is that
reproducibility is actually not not only
important for presenting your results to
other people and giving them an
opportunity to reproduce what you've
done but but it's actually important for
yourself as well because how often do
you do in an analysis put it aside for a
month or two and then come back to it
and you're trying to remember what you
did yeah why yeah if you know you're
working on an analysis you set it aside
two months later is when your manuscript
is reviewed or you had sent your results
to somebody and they finally got around
to looking it over and they come back to
you you know like all right where did I
leave things off exactly so if you don't
have these helpful notes for yourself
it's impossible to come back to it you
might have helpful no scruples around
all over the place but that's not really
an organized way of doing things so I
think that this like where producible
reporting really helps now that's
helpful for suggesting a data analyst
who knows the language now kind of think
back to when you're this is the first
day you're learning the our language you
have a lab class on campus you'll learn
some stuff just two hours later chances
are you have no idea what you've learned
so I think that that's why this idea of
being able to come back to your work
easily translates into learning are as
well because you know for me I think
about if I look at code that I wrote a
day ago I'll probably be able to figure
it out a lot easier than code I wrote
two months ago but a student who's
learning are starting to learn art today
and writes their first few lines of our
code tomorrow if they don't have good
notes on it it might be very difficult
for them to come back to so specifically
what recommendation would you have for
somebody who is just starting to learn
the our language for getting started
with reproducibility either in the case
of like note-taking or if they're trying
to communicate the results to some
outside party
I would definitely recommend that they
do their work kind of within an within
an arm markdown document if the scope of
the project allows a single document and
if they're first getting started chances
are it might so I would say stick with
that start with that template and you
know fill your work and step by step as
your projects grow and a single document
is probably not enough at that point
then you start thinking about folder
structures and your organization and
whatnot but I would say build up to that
step by step starting small knitting all
the time your work and trying to make
sure that any error that occurs you try
to address it on the spot as opposed to
letting errors build up sure makes sense
okay cool so I guess I'd like to ask a
bigger picture question now so you are
at the center of the AR and data science
communities you interact with a lot of
the most interesting people in in these
communities on a fairly regular basis
what trends excites you the most right
now and again this could be within the
art community or the broader data
science community um I think one of the
exciting trends is that people who are
developing software to me seems like are
more and more thinking about how others
will learn and consume this software I
think that writing code that's easy to
read that's well organized it's
something that is actually something
that's getting credit for in the art
community like the tidy verse like I
think it makes life easier both for the
advanced users and the users who are
starting off and I think that's very
exciting it's not so much about it's not
let me put it this way it's not all
about computational efficiency it's not
all about getting to the point with the
shortest syntax it's more about let me
write my code clearly so others can read
it and understand it as well maybe read
it in a way that it almost reads like
the language that people speak on a
daily basis and I think that's exciting
because I think that lowers that barrier
to entry at the beginning which will
allow more people to more easily get
started with our
I think that's one of the exciting
things um aside from that it seems like
a lot of the developers in the art
community are also thinking about how to
teach or there's you know all these
different initiatives and packages and
whatnot for teaching are there's what
you guys are doing at data camp there's
the teaching aspect of what a lot of the
like our packages come with nice
vignettes that you know get people
started with worked out examples and
whatnot and I think these are all very
very useful and I just love the fact
that people are choosing to spend time
on these aspects and it's not considered
like a secondary concern because I
really do think that they're helping
others get started with learning are a
lot easier yeah and so we were actually
just talking about this yesterday how
you're seeing a greater adoption of like
tried-and-true software development
tools in in the art community so the the
quintessential example of this is like
the use of version control sure get and
github for tracking changes to projects
over time and facilitating collaboration
on software projects there are other
examples continuous integration being
one of them just like good coding
practices so this is a really exciting
trend and one of the so one of the
potential implications over time is that
you have instead of having a group of
developers who know the language through
and through our true programmers and
know how to build software and then you
have like a group a large group of
consumers over here it seems that we're
starting to bridge the gap a little bit
yeah could you just say talk a little
bit about that and I think we're a
bridging the gap because some of these
tools actually allow people who may not
be full-on developers to contribute in
small ways in one way or another sure
and I think that's really helpful you
know if a if an hour package that I
perhaps would not have developed may not
have the skills to develop is lacking a
certain fee
and I might be able to suggest that or
even you know suggested as just a
comment or suggested as in try to
develop it myself and do a pull request
for example and that does get merged
into it or at least perhaps the
developer sees the idea and says oh that
actually sounds like a good idea let me
try to see if I can do that I think
that's really helpful for drawing more
of the people from the user and perhaps
not all the way to the developer head
but towards the middle and similarly the
developers interacting with the users I
think allow them to develop the syntax
in a way that's easy to consume so and I
think that's useful because if there is
a big communication gap between the two
developers might spend a whole lot of
time developing stuff that's not
necessarily being used correctly and
then I think the conversations between
the two groups end up being not that
fruitful sure today so on the developer
side you have things like vignettes that
help newcomers understand how the basic
functionality the package works or maybe
you have them embracing like clean api's
that are creating efficient ways for
people to extend their package or you
have like github which enables an easy
way for them to accept contributions
from outside people and then on the
consumers side that the people who are
using primarily users of the language
again you you have a place where they
can kind of meet the developers on on
github and you have adoption of these
ideas and techniques like version
control and good coding practices so
yeah they're sort of both moving towards
the middle it's moving towards the
middle and I think the other thing is
that the open source nature of the our
language allows this to happen quickly
right if there's a feature you can put
that out there for a few people to try
out test your code get feedback on that
before you perhaps make a big push or a
whole change to your package and that's
that's really nice not that allows for
this faster pace of development where
you're developing and getting feedback
at the same time that's useful for I
feel like any party in this
an equation yeah absolutely great so
that's all the questions I had really
appreciate the time thank you very much
it's been great all right thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
