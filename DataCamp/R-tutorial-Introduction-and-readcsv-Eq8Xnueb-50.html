data in our course imagine this
situation a colleague of yours is still
doing his or her analyses in Excel and
finally decided to transition to our he
or she needs an easy way to convert the
Excel spreadsheets into our data frames
but he or she can't seem to find the
tools to do so well getting to know
these tools is exactly what we'll do
here in this two-part course we will
focus on five types of data data from
flat files data from Excel data from
databases data from the web and finally
data from other statistical software
like SS SPSS and Stata you'll learn to
convert each data format one after the
other into an R data frame ready to do
some fancy analyses let's start off with
flat files flat files are typically
simple text files that display data
tables have a look at this example
states dot CSV a flat file where CSV
stands for comma separated values the
data lists basics information on some US
states the first line here gives the
names of the different columns or fields
after that each line is a records and
fields are separated by a comma health
extension CSV for example there's a
state Hawaii with the capital Honolulu
and a total population of 1.42 million
what would this data look like in R well
actually the structure nicely
corresponds to date frame that ideally
looks like this two rows in a date frame
correspond to the records and the
columns of the data frame correspond to
the fields the field names are used to
name the columns of the data frame but
how to go from this CSV to this data
frame we're in luck because the standard
distribution of r provides functionality
to import these flat files into R as a
data frame these functions belong to the
utils package that is loaded by default
when you start R more specifically will
need to read dot CSV function as follows
the first argument of retail CSV is the
path to the file you want to import in R
if the file is in your current working
directory simply passing the file name
as a character string works if your file
is located somewhere else things get
tricky
depending on the platform you're working
on Linux Microsoft Mac whatever file
paths are specified differently to build
a path to a file in a
platform-independent way you can use the
file dot path function suppose our
state's our CSV file is located in the
datasets folder of the home directory
you can use file dot path like this
because I'm working on a Mac this is
resulting path I can now use this path
inside retail CSV to point to the
correct file like this
the second arguments strings as factors
is pretty important say we have columns
that are strings we can choose to import
these columns as actual strings or as
factors which are uses to store
categorical variables by default the
strings as factors argument is true so
it would convert strings into factors in
our case however the state and capital
names shouldn't be categorical variables
so we set strings as factors to false if
we run this call now we can see that we
get a data frame with five observations
and four variables this corresponds
nicely to the CSV file we started with
if you print out the structure of this
data frame with STR we see that indeed
the two first columns are strings and
not factors exactly like we wanted it
all right that's enough to get you
started for now time to give importing
data a first try in the exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
