things in our data structures such as
vectors matrices and lists have no more
secrets for you however R is a
statistical programming language and in
statistics will often be working with
data sets such data sets are typically
comprised of observations or instances
all these observations have some
variables associated with them you can
have for example a data set of five
people each person is an instance and
the properties about these people such
as for example their name their age and
whether they have children are the
variables
how could you store such information are
in a matrix maybe not really because the
name would be a character and the H
would be a numeric but these don't fit
in the matrix in the list maybe this
could work because you can put
practically anything in a list you could
create a list of lists where each sub
list is a person with a name and age and
so on however the structure of such a
list is not really useful to work with
what if you want to know all the ages
for example you'd have to write a lot of
our code just to get what you want but
what data structure could we use them
meet the data frame it's the fundamental
data structure to start typical data
sets it's pretty similar to a matrix
because it also has rows and columns
also for data frames the rows correspond
to the observations the persons in our
example while the columns correspond to
the variables are the properties of each
of these persons the big difference with
matrices is that a data frame can
contain elements of different types one
column can contain characters another
one numerix yet another one logicals
that's exactly what we need to start our
person's information in the data set
right we could have a column for the
name which is character one for the H
which is numeric and one logical column
to denote whether the person has
children
there still is a restriction on the
datatype stone elements in the same
column should be of the same type but
that's not really a problem because in
one column the age column for example
you'll always want a numeric because an
H is always a number regardless of the
observation so for the practical part
now creating a data frame in most cases
you don't create a data frame yourself
instead you typically import data from
another source this could be a CSV file
a relational database but could also
come from other software packages like
Excel or SPSS of course our provides a
way to manually create data frames as
well it could use the data frame
function for this to create our people
data frame it has five observations and
three variables we'll have to pass the
data frame function three vectors that
are all of length five the vectors you
pass correspond to the columns let's
create these three vectors first name
age and child now calling the data frame
function is simple the printout of the
data frame already shows very clearly
that we're dealing with a data set
notice how the data frame function
invert the names of the columns from the
variable names you passed it to specify
the names explicitly you can use the
same techniques as for factors and lists
you can use the names function or use
equal signs inside the data frame
function to name the data frame columns
right away like in matrices it's also
possible to name the rows of the data
frame but that's generally not a good
idea so I won't go into detail on that
here before you head over to some
exercises let me shortly discuss the
structure of data frames or more if you
look at the structure there are two
things you can see here first the
printout looks suspiciously similar to
that of a lists that's because under the
hood the data frame actually is a list
in this case it's a list with three
elements corresponding to each of the
columns in the data frame each list
elements is a vector of length five
bonding to the number of observations a
requirement that is not present for
lists is that the length of the vectors
you put in the list has to be equal if
you try to create a data frame with
three vectors that are not all of the
same length
you'll get an error second the name
column which you expect to be a
character vector is actually a factor
that's because our by default stores the
strings as factors to suppress this
behavior you can set the strings as
factors argument of the data frame
function to false now the name column
actually contains characters with this
new knowledge you're ready for some
first exercises and it's extremely
useful and powerful data structure
whenever you're experimenting with data
frames remember that they're actually in
lists this gives the data frame the
ability to store vectors of different
types on top of that are also has some
additional functionality built in to
easily extend and subset data frames
I'll talk more about that in the next
