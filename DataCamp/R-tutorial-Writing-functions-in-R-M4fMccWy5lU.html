foundations you'll need throughout the
course functions data structures in four
loops in each case we'll start from what
you already know and emphasize a few new
points that will be essential for the
following chapters let's jump in and
review functions in our you're already
familiar with this basic recipe for
creating a function there are three key
parts use function to create a new
function the arguments that function are
specified inside the parentheses after
the arguments you specify the body this
code typically surrounded by curly
braces is run every time you call the
function
finally we give the function a name my
phone using the regular assignment
operator unlike other languages in our
there's no special syntax for naming a
function and you use regular assignment
in the same way that you would give a
victor a name for example here we define
a simple function called add that takes
two arguments X and Y and adds them
together notice that we've given Y a
default value of 1 if ad is called
without a Y argument Y will be given the
value 1 the body of this function is X
plus y our functions return the last
statement that they execute so the add
function will turn the sum of x and y
we'll come back to this idea in a couple
of slides if we run this code in our our
session we get a new object called add
to call ad we use it like any other
built-in function put the function name
followed by the parentheses that contain
the arguments of the function in our
there's no difference between functions
that you create in the functions that
our developers have created for you
remember R has two ways of specifying
arguments you can either specify by name
or by position let's get a little bit
more technical every function is three
components the formal arguments the body
and the environment we've already seen
the formals in the body but what about
the environment the environment is
usually invisible but it's really
important because it determines where
the function
looks for variables we'll talk about
that more when we discuss scope in a
later video the environment of a
function is where it was defined in the
case of our add function that's the
global environment what gets returned
from a function the last evaluated
expression take this slightly more
complicated function what does it return
if X is negative in the expression
evaluated as negative X if X is positive
the last expression evaluated is X this
function computes the absolute value
sometimes you'll see people use the
return function as soon as return is
called it stops the execution and
returns a specified value I recommend
using this when you want to stop
evaluation early for a special case not
routinely one final important point is
that functions in our work just like any
other object that means for example you
can assign the function mean to a new
variable mean to mean to now points the
same function as mean and works just
like the original in fact you can even
create a function without assigning it
to a name this is exactly the same as
creating a vector of random numbers and
not saving the output functions that
don't have a name are called anonymous
functions and they'll become
particularly useful when we talk about
functional programming in chapter 3 you
can still call an anonymous function but
you need to do it all on one line here
we define the anonymous function then
call it with the value 2 that wraps up
our review of functions and our remember
every function has three parts formal
arguments a body in an environment the
return value of a function is either the
last expression or the first call to
return and finally in our functions our
regular objects you can work with them
in the same way that you work with
vectors or data frames</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
