tidy up your pitch data and explores a
Cranky's pitch velocity in a number of
ways first you took a look at the
distribution of velocities for all of
Gran keys pitches noting that there are
clear multimodal distributions these
were likely result of various pitch
types thrown at different velocities you
then focus specifically on fastball
velocity and saw that in July cranky had
a tendency to throw harder than the
other months of the year combined this
was clearly represented by the rightward
shift in the fastball velocity
distribution you see here finally you
evaluated velocity and its game-by-game
variability across the season while
there was a pretty clear uptick in
velocity in July there is also one just
before June began overall the results
are somewhat inconclusive on whether
grantees success was specifically
related to increased velocity will
return to examining outcomes from these
differences in Chapter four but in the
following chapter you'll begin exploring
grantees different pitch types and how
he uses them in different situations
once you're ready to go go ahead and get
started on the next chapter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
