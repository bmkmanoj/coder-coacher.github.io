working and I'm Charlotte Wickham not
only do we share the same parents but we
share a love of our I'm a long time our
user and I teach Statistics data science
and of course our I'm chief scientist at
our studio and I'm passionate about
developing our packages that make data
analysis easier faster and more fun in
this course you'll learn the best
practices for writing your own functions
why are functions so important in the
words of John Chambers everything that
exists an R is an object but everything
that happens in our is the result of a
function call so to understand our you
must understand functions as your
mastery of functions grows your code
will more clearly describe what is
happening and will allow you to
generalize to new situations without
having to copy and paste this will
reduce the amount of new code you need
to write in order to solve a new problem
allowing you to do data science with
more ease we'll start with some recap of
the basics the key components of a
function and some revision of the basic
data types in our next you'll learn why
you should write your own functions a
good rule of thumb is to win to write a
function and a solid technique for how
to write functions then we'll switch
focus to for loops and why on your
journey to become a great our programmer
you should learn to move beyond them and
rely on functions that write the for
loops for you these techniques are known
as functional programming or FP you'll
then learn some intermediate FP
techniques including with dealing with
more types of input and output in
handling errors we'll finish off for the
discussion of how to write robust code
that either works reliably or fails with
a clear error message before taking this
course you should have a basic
understanding of our programming which
you can get through taking data camps
introduction to R and intermediate our
courses we'll see you in the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
