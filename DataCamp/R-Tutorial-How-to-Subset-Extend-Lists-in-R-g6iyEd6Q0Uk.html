creating a vector is it
unfortunately subsetting lists and
subsetting vectors are not that similar
let's retake the music artist example
remember the list song that contained
both information on a song as well as on
a similar song you might have noticed
that the printout of the song list is
not what it should be I actually
included the output of calling SDR song
here instead which is more compact and
readable I'll also do this in the list
printouts that follow anyways
you see that the list contains four
elements a character to numerix and
another list suppose now you want to
extract the song title or sometimes from
this list when you were working with
vectors and matrices this was that
simple you simply put the index of the
song title which is one and square
brackets and you got the elements well
let's try it out that's what we want
this is not a character string it's a
list containing only one element that
corresponds to the title information
this is a very important detail or
trying to subset lists if you use single
brackets on lists you subset the list
but also a list gets returned if you
want to select the actual title from
song so the character string are
sometimes you'll need double square
brackets instead of single ones that
looks more like it's the difference
between single brackets and double
brackets is not bigger in your keyboard
but it sure is important from an art
perspective just remember this sub
setting lists using single brackets
results in lists while you can only
access a single elements using double
brackets this difference doesn't limit
you from supercharging your sub setting
operations of course suppose for example
you want to select both the title and
track from song you can use a vector
with the indices one and three inside
single brackets to subset the list we
end up with a list of length two this
time only containing the title and a
track could this also work with double
brackets let's try it out it generates
an index out of bounds error
that's pretty stranger
well not really it's because the double
brackets are only to select single
elements from a list in fact this
command is actually equivalent to this
one this command means fake the first
element from the song list and from that
list fake the third element but the
first element from song is simply a
character vector of length one so
there's no way of selecting the third
element from it nonetheless you can use
this approach to select for example the
title of a similar song whose
information is stored in a fourth
element of song in this case you first
want to take the fourth element and then
the first element this is indeed that
the idle we were looking for this could
also be coded as follows
so what about subsetting my name and
biologicals I hear you asking
well subsetting my name is super
straightforward to select the second
element from song for example you can
just as well use the string duration
inside double brackets this sub setting
my names of course also works with
single brackets both to build a one
element list as well as to select
multiple elements subsetting biologicals
is only possible for the single bracket
version to select a second a third
element from the song this works but
this doesn't that's because the second
line is interpreted as follows and this
makes no sense whatsoever
another way that is totally new here is
the use of the dollar sign to select an
element from a list it works just the
same as the double brackets but only
works on named lists if you want to
select the duration string from song for
example you can use song dollar sign
duration this seamlessly brings me to
adding elements to your list before you
want to release your new song online
suppose you first want to have some of
your friends to check it out you decide
to add a vector of friends names to the
song list to remember which ones you've
sent it to let's first create a new
vector friends to add this information
to the list song under the name sense
you have different options why not start
with a dollar notation first you simply
type some dollar sign cents and then
assign friends to it if you now have a
look at song again you'll see that there
is a fifth list element in song now the
same result could have been reached
using the double square brackets it's
even possible to add elements to
embedded lists to add a reason why you
decided to remove the similar song from
your album you could write something
like this that's all you need to know
about lists for now there are two main
takeaways here first you use double
square brackets to select the list
elements while single square brackets
results in the sub list containing the
specified elements second you can use a
double square brackets and it's dollar
sign equivalent both
two subsets as well as to add elements
to your list up to the exercises now
