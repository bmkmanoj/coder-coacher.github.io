mathematical model is a model built from
mathematical stuff a statistical model
is a mathematical model that's closely
tied to data in practice statistical
models are built from a special kind of
mathematical stuff the stuff that makes
up computer languages in this video
we'll examine some of the kinds of
objects in R that you will encounter in
your work with models three of the most
important are objects for modeling our
functions formulas and data frames
some people describe a data frame as a
kind of spreadsheet or matrix with rows
and columns I prefer to think of data
frames more simply as a collection of
variables each of the variables is a
column and in modeling it's a good
practice to give a name to each of the
variables in the data frame that makes
it easier to describe the models in
terms of the names of the variables the
rows of a data frame are called cases
each case is one object in the real
world the case might be a person or it
might be a person at a particular time
or anything else but always the cases
the object from which values for the
individual variables are measured we're
going to use functions for several
purposes both to build models and to
evaluate those models for instance to
calculate the output of models for new
inputs the functions that build models
will generally take as their inputs both
a data frame and a formula that
describes the relationship among the
variables involved in the model formulas
are a way to describe how you want to
relate variables to one another in a
formula variable names are used but no
calculation is done with the values in
those form in those variables instead
the formula sets up the structure of the
relationship that the modeler wants to
express or explore all formulas involve
the little squiggle symbol called tilde
there will always be something to the
right of the tilde
typically one or more variables
separated by punctuation that looks like
arithmetic but isn't to start that
punctuation will be the plus sign but
later you will see other forms of
punctuation as an example of how
functions formulas and data frames are
used together let's use data set called
CPS 85 and calculate the mean wage of
workers in several different sectors of
the economy the mean function is one of
the first functions newcomers to our
encounter but it isn't set up to use
formulas the mosaic package upgrades
mean and other functions so that they
work with formulas while continuing to
work in the original way the formula
waged till the sector means to break
down the wage by sector using that
formula in the mean function gives the
average wage in each sector statistical
models are often built to predict or
account for a single variable which we
will call the response variable the
basic idea is to construct a function
that produces values for the response
variable as the functions output the
functions inputs are called the
explanatory variables in formulas for
models the response variable is always
to the left of the tilde the explanatory
variables are to the right of the tilde
you can think of formulas as a sentence
that relates the response and the
explanatory variables there are several
English equivalents to tilde for example
wage till the sector can be read as any
of these wage as a function of sector
wage accounted for by sector wage
modeled by sector wage explained by
sector wage given sector wage broken
down by sector sorry to be late
and and you are dr. know of the null
hypothesis meaning the null hypothesis
is that nothing is happening that
variation is
thing but randomness okay but this is a
course on statistical modeling our
object is to account for an explained
variation sure there's some randomness
but it's what's left over after our
accounting for the rest but every
statistics course needs me I think
you're looking for the t-test course
this is statistical modeling by let's
get back to building models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
