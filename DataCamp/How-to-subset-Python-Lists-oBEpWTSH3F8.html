Python list you might wonder how it can
access information in this list Python
uses the index to do this have a look at
the family list again here the first
element in the list as in X 0 the second
element has the next one and so on
suppose that you want to select the
height of Emma so the float 1.68 it's
the 4th element so at us in extreme to
select it you use 3 inside square
brackets similarly to select the string
dad from the list which is the 7th
element you'll need to put the index 6
inside square brackets you can also
count backwards using negative indexes
this is useful if you want to get some
elements at the end of your list to get
your dad's height for example you'll
need index minus 1 these are the
negative indexes for all list elements
this means that this line this line
return the exact same results apart from
indexing there's also something called
slicing which allows you to select
multiple elements from a list thus
creating a new list you can do this by
specifying a range using a colon let's
first have another look at the list and
then try this piece of code can you
guess what it will return a list with
the float 1.68
the string mom and the float 1.71
corresponding to the 4th 5th and 6th
element in the list Navy let's see what
the output is apparently only the
elements with index 3 &amp;amp; 4 get returns
the element with index 5 is not included
in general this is the syntax the index
you specified before the column so where
the slice starts is included while the
index you specify after the column where
the slice ends it's not with this in
minds can you tell what this call will
return you probably guessed correctly
that this call gives you a list with 3
elements or responding to the elements
with index 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the fam lists you
can also choose to just leave out the
index before or after the colon if you
leave out index where the slice should
begin you're telling Python to start the
slice from index 0 like this example if
you leave out index where the slice
ends you include all elements up to and
include
the last element in the list like here
now it's time to head over to the
exercises or you will continue to work
on the list you've created yourself
before you'll be using different sub
setting methods to get exactly the piece
of information you need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
