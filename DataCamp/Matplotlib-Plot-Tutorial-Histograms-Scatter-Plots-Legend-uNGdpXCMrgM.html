scientist at data camp and this
intermediate Python course will further
enhance your Python skills specifically
for data science you will learn how to
visualize data and to store data and new
data structures along the way you will
master control structures which you will
need to customize the flow of your
scripts and algorithms well finish this
chapter with a case study where they'll
blend together everything you've learned
to solve a cool problem this first
chapter is about data visualization
which is a very important part of data
analysis first of all you will use it
continuously to explore your data sets
the better you understand your data the
better you'll be able to extract
insights and once you found those
insights again you'll need visualization
to be able to share your precious
insights with other people as an example
have a look at this beautiful plot it's
made by the Swedish professor hands
rustling it's talks about global
developments have been viewed millions
of times what makes them so intriguing
is that by making beautiful plots he
allows the data to tell their own story
here we see a bubble chart or each
bubble represents a country the bigger
the bubble the bigger the country's
population so the two biggest bubbles
here are China and India there are two
axis horizontal axis shows the GDP per
capita in u.s. dollars the vertical axis
shows life expectancy we clearly see
that people live longer in countries
with a higher GDP per capita still
there's huge difference in life
expectancy between countries on the same
income level now why did I tell you all
of this well because by the end of this
chapter you'll be able to build this
beautiful plot yourself
there are many visualization packages in
Python but the model of them all is a
matte pot lip you will need a sub
package pie plot by convention the sub
package is imported SP LT like this for
our first example let's try to gain some
insights in the evolution of the road
population I have a list with years here
year and list with corresponding
populations Express 10 billions pop in
the year 1970 for example 3.7 billion
people lived on planet Earth
the plot is data as a line chart recall
PLT dot plot and user two lists as
argument
the first argument corresponds to
horizontal axis and the second one to
the vertical axis you might think that a
plot will pop up right now but button is
pretty lazy it will wait for the show
function to actually display the plot
this is because you might want to add
some extra ingredients to your plot
before actually displaying it such as
titles and label customizations I'll
talk about that some more later on
just remember this the plot function
despite the water plot and how to plot
it show actually displays a plot when we
look at our plot we see that the years
are indeed shown on horizontal axis and
a population on the vertical axis there
are four data points and Python draws a
line between them in 1950 the world
population was run 2.5 billion in 2010
it was 7 billion so the world population
has almost tripled in 60 years that's
pretty scary
what is population keeps on growing like
that will the world become overpopulated
you'll find out in the exercises let me
first introduce you to another type of
plot the scatter plot to create it we
can start from the code from before this
time though you can change the plot
function to scatter resulting scatter
plot simply plots all the individual
data points Python doesn't connect the
dots with a line for many applications
the scatter plot is often a better
choice than the line plot so remember
the scatter function well you could also
say that this is a more almost way of
plotting your data because you can
clearly see that the plot is based on
just four data points the histogram is a
type of visualization that's very useful
to explore your data it can help you to
get an idea about the distribution of
your variables to see how it works
imagine 12 values between 0 and 6 I've
put them along a number line here to
build a histogram for these values we
can divide the line into equal chunks
called bins suppose you go for three
bins that each have a width of two next
you count how many data points sit
inside each bin there's four data points
in the first bin 6 in the second bin and
doing the third bin finally you draw a
bar for each bin the height of the bar
corresponds to the number of data points
that fall in this bin
is a histogram which gives us a nice
overview on how the 12 values are
distributed most values are in the
middle but there are more values below
to the nature are above four of course
also matplotlib is able to build
histograms as before you should start by
importing the pipe lock package that's
inside math clip next you can use the
hist faction lets open up its
documentation there's a bunch of
arguments you can specify but the first
two here are the most important ones X
should be a list of values you want to
build a histogram for you can use the
second arguments bins to tell Python and
how many bins the data should be divided
based on this number hist will
automatically find appropriate
boundaries for all bins and calculate
how many values are in each one if you
don't specify the bins argument for b10
by default so to generate the histogram
that you've seen before let's start by
building a list with the 12 values next
you simply call hist and pass this list
as an input so it's matched to the
arguments X I also specify the bins
arguments to be treat so that the values
are divided in three bins if you finally
call the show function a nice histogram
results histograms are really useful to
give a bigger picture as an example have
a look at this so-called population
pyramids the age distribution is shown
for both males and females in the
European Union notice that the
histograms are flipped 90 degrees the
bins are horizontal now the pins are
largest for the ages 40 to 44 or there
are 20 million meals and 20 million
females they are the so-called baby
boomers these are figures of the year
2010 what do you think will have changed
in 2050 let's have a look the
distribution is flatter and the baby
boom generation has gotten older with
the blink of an eye you can easily see
how demographics will be changing over
time and that's the true power of
histograms at work here creating a plot
is one thing making the correct plot
that makes the message very clear that's
the real challenge for each
visualization you have many options
first of all there are the different
blood types and for each plot you can do
an infinite number of customizing
you can change colors shapes labels axes
and so on the choice depends on one the
data and to the star you want to tell
with this data since there are so many
possible customizations the best way to
learn this is by example let's start
with the code in this script to build a
simple line plots it's similar to the
line plot we've created in the first
video but this time the year and pop
lists contain more data including
projections until the year 2100
forecasted by the United Nations if we
run the script we already got a pretty
nice plot it shows its population
explosion that's going on will have
slowed down by the end of the century
but some things can be improved first it
should be clear which data we are
displaying especially to people who are
seeing the graph for the first time and
second the plot really needs to draw the
attention to the population explosion
the first thing you always need to do is
to label your axis let's do this by
adding the X label and Y label functions
as inputs we passed rings that should be
placed alongside t axis make sure to
call these functions before calling the
show function otherwise your
customizations will not be displayed if
we run the script again this time the
x's are annotated great we're also going
to add a title to our plot with the
title function we pass the actual title
role population projections as an
arguments and there's a title so using X
label Y label and title we can give the
reader more information about the data
on the plot now they can at least though
what the plot is about to put the
population growth in perspective I want
to have the y axis start from 0 you can
do this with the white text function the
first input is a list in this example
with the number 0 up to 10 with
intervals of 2 if we run this the plot
will change the curve shifts up now it's
clear that in 1950 there were already
about 2.5 billion people on this planet
next to make it clear we're talking
about billions we can add a second
argument to the white text function
which is a list with the display names
of the ticks this list should have the
same length as a first list the take
zero gets the name 0 2 take 2 gets name
to be to take 4 gets a name for B and so
on by the way B stands for billions here
if you run this version of the script
the labels will change accordingly
awesome finally let's add some more
historical data to accentuates
population explosion in the last 60
years on Wikipedia
I found two world population data for
the years 1800s 1850 and 1900 I can
write them in list form and append them
to the pub and year lists with the plus
sign if I now run the script once more
three data points are added to the graph
giving a more complete picture now
that's how we turn an average line plot
into a visual that has a clear story to
tell over to you now
