pandas let's discuss exploratory data
analysis or EDA will apply EDA visually
first will consider Fisher's iris flower
data there are a hundred and fifty
observations with four measurements from
each there are also three distinct
flower species we start with importing
pandas and matplotlib PI plot we load
the data frame and examine it with head
first let's draw some data with the data
frame plot method we can specify
particular column names for the x and y
axes the result is not all that useful
because by default plot creates a line
plot for this unordered for dimensional
data set a line plot doesn't make a lot
of sense we'll try again this time
specifying kind equals scatter
let's also label the axes with units of
measurement the scatter plot is better
we'll see later how to distinguish the
different species individual variable
distributions are likely more
informative than plotting two variables
against each other for instance
specifying kind equals box for say the
sepal length makes a box plot the
resulting box plot shows the range the
minimum and maximum values with the
whiskers the interquartile range with
the Box edges and the median inside will
define these terms clearly later another
common plotting tool for EDA is a
histogram here we use kind equals hist
recall that histograms show frequencies
of measurements counted within certain
bins or intervals the result
approximates a probability distribution
function or PDF of the sepal lengths of
all the iris flowers it could be
bell-shaped but it's hard to tell with
bins this wide we can redraw the
histogram to get a better sense of the
data other hist arguments can be passed
using the data frame plot interface
for instance bins is the number of
intervals to use in building the
histogram range gives the extremes of
the bins normed tells whether to rescale
counts to add to one cumulative tells
whether to draw the histogram or its
cumulative distribution function more on
this shortly in fact any map plot live
options can be specified using keyword
arguments with plot using more keyword
options improves the histogram here we
specify 30 bins and arrange from 4 to 8
and a normed histogram the customized
histogram shows at least 3 distinct
piece in the distribution of sepal
lengths this suggests groups or
subpopulations in the data another
useful plot is the cumulative
distribution function or CDF computed by
adding up the areas of the rectangles
under a normalized histogram CDF's are
used to compute the probability of
observing a value in a given range for
instance a simple width between 2 and 4
centimeters this is easy to plot with
the data frame plot method intuitively
the CDF evaluated at say sepal than 5
centimeters
returns the probability of observing a
flower with simple length up to 5
centimeters a CDF is often a somewhat
smooth curve increasing from 0 to 1 one
warning at present there are three
different data frame plotting a idioms
in pandas for instance we can use iris
dot plot kind equals hist or iris dot
plot hist with the same syntax for
arguments there is also iris dot hist
the syntax has defaults that slightly
different in the latter call these
variants work for hist scatter box and
related plot functions check the
documentation for details that's enough
on visual EDA for now it's your turn to
try some exercises on your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
