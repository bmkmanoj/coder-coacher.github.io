about relational operators which tell us
how our object relates and logical
operators which allow us to combine
logical values now are also provides a
way to use results of these operators to
change the behavior of your own our
scripts sure enough I'm talking about
the if and else statements here have a
look at the recipe for the if statement
the if statement takes a condition if
the condition evaluates to true the our
code associated with the if statement is
executed the condition to check appears
inside parentheses while the our code
that has to be executed if the condition
is true follows in curly brackets let's
have a look at an example suppose we
have a variable X equal to minus 3 if
this X is smaller than 0 we want our to
print out X is a negative number how can
we do this using if statements we first
assign a variable X and then write the
if test if we run this bit of code we
indeed see that the string X is a
negative number
gets printed out however if we change X
to 5 and rerun the code the condition
will be false the code is not executed
and a print out will not occur this
brings us to the else statements this
conditional statement does not need an
explicit condition instead it has to be
used together with an if statement the
code associated with an else statement
gets executed whenever the condition of
the if test is not satisfied we can
extend our recipe by including an else
statement as follows returning to our
example suppose you want to print out X
is positive or 0 whenever the condition
is not met we can simply add the else
statement if you run the code with X
equal to minus 3 we still get the print
out X is a negative number because the
if condition is true however if we now
change X to 5 the text X is either a
positive number or 0 is printed out the
X smaller than 0 condition was not
satisfied so our turn to the expression
in the else statements
there are also cases in which you want
to customize your programs even further
maybe you want yet another printout if x
equals exactly zero how to do this well
our also provides the elsif statement
let's first extend the recipe the elsif
statement comes in between the if and
else statements to see how our deals
with these different conditions and
corresponding code blocks
let's first extend our example say we
want our to print out x is 0 if x equals
0 and to print out X as a positive
number
otherwise we add the elsif together with
a new print statement and adapt a
message we print on the else statements
how does our process this control
structure let's first go through what
happens when x equals minus 3 in this
case the condition for the if statement
evaluates to true so X is a negative
number gets printed out and our ignores
the rest of the statements if x equals 0
R will first check the if condition sees
that it is false
I will then head over to the else if
condition this condition x equals equals
0 evaluates to true so x is 0 gets
rented out to the console and R ignores
the else statement entirely finally what
happens when x equals 5 well the if
condition evaluates to false so does the
elsif condition so our execute the else
statements printing X as a positive
number remember that as soon as R
stumbles upon a condition that evaluates
to true our execute the corresponding
coat and then ignores the rest of the
control structure this becomes important
if the conditions your lists are not
mutually exclusive have a look at this
example that sees if a number is
divisible by 2 or by 3 when x equals 6
the first condition evaluates to true so
our prints out divisible by 2
now our exits the control structure and
will not look at the rest of the
statements so although the second
condition for the elsif part which
evaluated true nothing gets printed out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
