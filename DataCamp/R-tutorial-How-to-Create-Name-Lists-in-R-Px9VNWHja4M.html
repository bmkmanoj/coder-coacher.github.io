minute
I can feel it the most important data
structures that we've covered up to now
are vectors and matrices remember that a
vector is a one-dimensional array that
can only hold elements of the same type
similarly matrices can also only hold
elements of the same type but this time
they're in a two dimensional array
vectors and matrices are great but there
are cases in which you want to store
different data types in the same data
structure this is where lists come in a
list can contain all kinds of our
objects such as factors and matrices but
also other R objects such as dates data
frames factors and many more all of this
can be stored in a single list without
our having to perform coercion to
enforce the same type that's pretty cool
right
because lists can contain practically
anything you can think of in art terms
you do lose some functionality that's
vectors and matrices offered most
importantly performing calculus with
lists is far less straightforward
because there's no predefined structure
that lists have to follow enough for the
theory let's build some lists suppose it
as a music artist on the rise to fame
and fortune you regularly record some
new songs and keep some details for each
of these songs your latest creation is
called our sometimes it's one hundred
and ninety seconds long and should be
the fifth number on your records trying
to start this information in a vector
using the C function inevitably leads to
coercion however you can also start this
information in a list using the list
function this time all the elements have
kept their original type the printout is
also pretty different from what you're
used to we can see that the first
element in the list is the string our
sometimes for example which actually is
a character vector to continue working
with this list
we'll start the list in a new variable
song we can assert that this song
variable is a list using the S dot list
function
now starting the song information like
this without any names is not really
clear so let's assign some labels with
the names function to assign the names
you still use a character vector even
though we're working with lists now
printing song again shows that the
indices and double square brackets have
changed to the names of the list
elements this looks much nicer as was
the case with vectors you can also
directly specify the names in a list at
the time of creation to create the exact
same variable song you can use this
command you've already figured out that
the standard way of printing the
contents of a list is pretty bulky I
suggest you use the SDR function for
this this function compactly displays
the structure of the song list as I told
you before lists can contain practically
anything they can even contain other
lists suppose you want to add a list
containing the title and a duration of a
very similar but less catchy song that
you've also recorded in the last week's
let's first create a list containing
this information similar song we can now
create a song list again as follows the
structure of this list reveals that it
is perfectly possible to star lists
inside lists if you want to go totally
crazy you can even store a list inside a
list and then start that list in another
list but let's not make ourselves dizzy
here it's time to work our way around
some of the interactive exercises before
I introduce you to some techniques to
subset and extend lists have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
