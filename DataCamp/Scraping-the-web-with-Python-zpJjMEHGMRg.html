the web and you've done so using two
different packages URL Lib and requests
you also saw that requests provided a
higher-level interface in that you
needed to write fewer lines of code to
retrieve the relevant HTML as a string
you've got the HTML of your page of
interest but generally hTML is a humble
jumble mix of both unstructured and
structured data a few words on these
terms structured data is data that has a
predefined data model or that is
organized in a defined manner
unstructured data is data that does not
possess either of these properties hTML
is interesting because although much of
it is unstructured text it does contain
tags that determine where for example
headings can be found and hyperlinks in
general to turn HTML that you'll scrape
from the world wide web into useful data
you'll need to parse it and extract
structured data from it in this video
and the next few interactive exercises
we'll provide a brief introduction to
how you can perform such tasks using the
Python package a beautiful soup let's
now check out the packages website the
first words at the top are you didn't
write that awful page you're just trying
to get some data out of it beautiful
soup is here to help since 2004 it's
been saving programmers hours or days of
work on quick turnaround screen scraping
projects firstly a word on the name of
the package beautiful soup in web
development the term tag soup refers to
structurally or syntactically incorrect
HTML code written for a web page what
beautiful soup does best is to make tags
so beautiful again and to extract
information from it with ease in fact
the main object created and queried when
using this package is called beautiful
soup and it has a very important
Associated method called prettify let's
now see beautiful soup in beautiful
action once again
you use requests to scrape the HTML from
the web then you create a beautiful soup
object from the resulting HTML and
prettify it printing the Preda fide soup
and the original HTML you can see for
example that the predefined soup is
indented in the way you would expect
properly written HTML to be you'll
explore a few of the methods that you
can apply to your superfight HTML in the
following exercises such as title and
get text which extract the title and
text respectively
you'll also work with the soupy method
find all in order to extract the urls
of all the hyperlinks in the HTML these
are merely a few of the many methods
existing in beautiful soup to extract
data from HTML if after completing these
exercises you find yourself thirsting
for more beautiful soup there are plenty
of great resources on their website ok
now it's your turn to jump into the deep
end of the proverbial soup bowl happy
