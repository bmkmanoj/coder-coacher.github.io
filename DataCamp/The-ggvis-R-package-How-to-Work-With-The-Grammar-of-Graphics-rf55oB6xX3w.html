grammar of graphics which is a system
that makes it easy to build many
different types of clocks to understand
how the grammar of graphics works
consider would it take to build a plot
from scratch if you wanted to visualize
the data set
you'd have to start with the data set to
visualize next we need to set of
coordinate axes which defines the data
space to plot the data in if you want to
put your data into the space defined by
the chord axes we need to transform each
observation in your data set to a visual
mark that you can draw in the graph I
want to make a scatterplot with this
data so I'm going to use marks that look
like points the points you seen a
scatter plot now to convey information
with your visual marks you need to map
the visual properties of the marks to
variables in the data set for example I
can map the color fill of each of these
marks to the HP variable and the data
set when I do this you could look at the
point and judging on the color see what
value of HP variable that observation
had in the original data set so it's for
example everywhere where you see an
orange point you're looking at an
observation that had a value of two in
the HP variable in the data set I can
map another visual property the marks
and other variable to express more
information for example on that the
shape of these points to the cylinder
variable to express the values of the
cylinder variable in my plot now this
doesn't look much like a plot at all yet
that's because I haven't created two
essential mappings for my plot to visual
properties that each mark requires is
its X location in the graph in the Y
location in the graph and each of those
should be mapped to a variable in the
data set so I'm going to map the X
location of each of these marks to the
displacement variable the data set where
the mark ends up in the coordinate
system on the x axis will depend on this
displacement variable next I'll map the
Y location of each of the marks to the
MGP variable once I've done that I have
my finished scatter plot so now this
looks like a real scatter plot to make
it I only need
a dataset a coordinate system a set of
marks to represent the data within the
visual world and then a set of
properties that I could map two
variables back in the real data set now
I could change any of these elements
here I could use a different data set
and still create a scatter plot now if
you've used a different set of marks and
have a different looking plot and I can
even change my coordinate system use
something like polar coordinates and
there's no reason I need to use fill or
shape I could have used different set of
properties but any graph I make would
use all four of these things because I'd
have to have the X and y properties at
the very least and it'd have to have
some visual representation of the points
the data points that is you might need a
coordinate system to put them in I need
a data set to provide some information
worth displaying I can make it another
plot very easily by switching one of
these things and the thing that is which
most often between plots would be the
mark that you use to draw the plot so
you're placing a scatter plot before
that's what you get when you use points
as your mark but if you change the mark
to align so you display each of the data
points based on a position on the line
and what you'd end up with is a line
plot or a line graph for example this
graph here shows the same data we saw
before except now excluded line plot not
a scatter plot and that did that just by
changing the mark I used to represent
the data if I change the mark to
something like a bar or a rectangle then
I get typical bar plot again that's
showing the same information as before
I've just changed the mark I'm using to
display that information I could also go
back in and change one of the property
mappings for example I could set the
fill here to the displacement body of
each of these bars and I get something
like a colored bar chart this system of
using data marks coordinates axes and
properties is the grammar of graphics
the grammar basically asserts this
analogy just as you can express a full
thought in English with the sentence
that has a noun a verb and maybe a
direct object an indirect object you can
express entire graph with the data set
coordinate system marks and properties
and just lets in English you can extend
the grammar of your sense include
which is adverbs and so on we can extend
this grammar as well but for now we'll
stick with these four things because
they're the four essential components of
every graph that you make and this is
where the power of the grammar graphics
really comes into play but mastering
these four elements you can now make
hundreds of thousands of plots
we're just changing the values of each
of these components you get a new plot
but change from the data set in and so
on you can create a vast array of plots
almost every plot that you can visualize
in your own head
the exercises will give you some
practice working with these four
essential elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
