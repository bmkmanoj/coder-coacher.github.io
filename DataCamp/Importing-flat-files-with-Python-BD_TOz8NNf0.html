files we're going to look at flat files
such as Titanic dot CSV in which each
row is a unique passenger on board and
each column is a feature or attributes
such as gender cabin and survived or not
it's essential for any budding data
scientist to know precisely what the
term flat file means flat files are
basic text files containing records that
is table data without structured
relationships this is in contrast to a
relational database for example in which
columns of distinct tables can be
related we'll get to these later to be
even more precise flat files consists of
records whereby a record we mean a row
of fields or attributes each of which
contains at most one item of information
in the flat file Titanic CSV each row or
record is a unique passenger on board
and each column is a feature or
attribute such as name gender and cabin
it is also essential to note that a flat
file can have a header such as in
Titanic CSV which is a row that occurs
as the first row and describes the
contents of the data columns or States
what the corresponding attributes or
features in each column are it will be
important to know whether or not your
file has a header as it may alter your
data import the reason that flat files
are so important in data science is that
we data scientists really honestly like
to think in records or rows of
attributes now you may have noticed that
the file extension was dot CSV you may
be wondering what is this
well CSV is an acronym for comma
separated value and it means exactly
what it says the values in each row are
separated by commas
another common extension for a flat file
is dot txt which means a txt file values
in flat files can be separated by
characters or sequences of characters
other than commas such as a tab and the
character or characters in question is
called a delimiter see here an example
of a tab delimited file
the data consists of the famous feminist
digit recognition images where each row
contains the pixel values of a given
image note that all fields in the MS
data are numeric while the Titanic CSV
also contains strings how do we import
such files if they consist entirely of
numbers and we want to store them as an
umpire rain we could use the package
number if instead we want to store the
data in a data frame we would use pandas
most of the time you will use one of
these options in the rest of this
chapter you'll learn how to import flat
files that contain only numerical data
such as the M&amp;amp;S data import flat files
that contain both numerical data and
strings such as titanic dot csv but
first let's get you to do a couple of
quick multiple-choice questions to test
your knowledge of flat files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
