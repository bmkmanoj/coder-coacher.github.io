to functions functions aren't entirely
new for you actually you've already used
them type for example is a function that
returns the type of a value but what is
a function simply put a function is a
piece of reusable code aimed at solving
a particular task you can call functions
instead of having to write code yourself
maybe an example can clarify things here
suppose you have the list containing
only the eyes of your family fam say now
if you want to get a maximum value of
this list instead of writing your own
piece of Python code that goes through
the list and finds the highest value you
can also use pythons max function this
is one of pythons built-in functions
just like type we simply pass fam to max
inside parentheses the output makes
sense 1.89 the highest number in the
list
max were kind of like a black box here
you pass through the list then the
implementation of Max that you don't
know did its magic and produced an
output how max actually did this it's
not important to you it just does what
it's supposed to and you didn't have to
write your own code which made your life
easier of course it's also possible to
also sign this result of a function call
to a new variable like in here now
dullest is just like any other variable
you can use it to continue your fancy
calculations another one of these
built-in functions is round it takes two
inputs first a number you want to round
and second the precision with which to
round so how many digits behind the
decimal point you want to keep say you
want to round 1.68 to one decimal place
the first input is 1.68
the second input is one you separate the
inputs with a comma but there's more
it's perfectly possible to call the
round function with only one input like
this this time - figured out that you
didn't specify the second input and
automatically chooses to round a number
to the closest integer to understand by
both approaches work let's open up the
documentation we can do this with yet
another function help as follows it
beers that round takes two inputs and
Python these inputs also called
arguments have names number and M digits
when you call a function round with
these two inputs Python matches the
inputs to the arguments number is set to
1.68
and M digits is set to 1 next the round
function does its calculations with
number and n digits as if they are
variables in a Python script we don't
know exactly what code Python executes
what is important though is that the
function produces an output namely the
number 1.68
rounded to one decimal place if you call
the function round with only one input
python again tries to match the inputs
to the arguments there's no input to
match the n digits argument though
luckily the internal machinery of the
round function knows how to handle this
when M digits is not specified the
function simply rounds to the closest
integer and returns that integer that's
why we got the number two how was I so
sure that calling the function with a
single input would work well in the
documentation there are square brackets
around the comma and the n digits here
this tells us that you can call around
in this form as well as in this one in
other words and digits is an optional
argument actually Python offers yet
another way to show that a function as
optional arguments but that's something
for the exercises by now you have an
idea about how to use maximum around but
how could you know that a function such
as round exists in Python in the first
place well this is something you will
learn with time whenever you are doing a
rather standard task in Python you can
be pretty sure that there is already a
function that can do this for you in
that case you should definitely use it
just do a quick internet search and
you'll find a function you need with a
nice usage example there is of course
data camp or it will also learn about
powerful functions and how to use them
get straight to it in the interactive
exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
