variables to perform calculus
remember how you some apples and oranges
from a previous video you also know that
actually these variables my apples and
my oranges are simply vectors this means
that you can perform calculus with
vectors in R it already did it
however there are still some things I
want to discuss about calculus with
factors that contain more than one
element the most important thing to
remember about operations with vectors
in R is that they will be applied
elements by elements
this means that standard mathematics is
extended to vectors in an element-wise
fashion to illustrate what this means
let's have a look at an example imagine
you have a vector containing your
gambling earnings for the past three
days not bad for a few days in a desert
is it now imagine a well-dressed
gentleman approaches you and offers to
triple your earnings for the past three
days if you beat him in one round of
poker if you want to calculate the
expected earnings for each of the past
three days you can easily do this in R
as you can see our multiplies each
element in the earnings factor with
three resulting in $150 of promised
earnings in the first day 300 in the
second day and 1930 sounds like a sweet
deal if you ask me performing these kind
of calculus works just the same with
other mathematical operators likewise
division subtraction summation and many
more are all carried out element wise
just as if you are carrying out the
operation between two scalars three
times from these lines of codes you
don't see anything different from what
we've done before because of course you
were working with vectors all along the
mathematics naturally extends to factors
that contain more than one element let's
go back to your Vegas adventures to
enjoy your earnings you also decided to
go shopping and spend some money every
day on the Las Vegas Strip you recorded
a vector of expenses because you are
very conscious programmer in training
to compute whether your luck in the
casino was sufficient to pay for your
expenses
how would you go about this once again
this is fairly easy in our you can
simply subtract expenses from earnings
to find your daily balance this time the
mathematics were also calculated element
wise the first element of expenses are
subtracted from the first element of
earnings the second element of expenses
were subtracted from the second element
of earnings and so on it seems that for
days 1 &amp;amp; 2 here on the positive side
I'll on day three you spend more than
you earned
also here the operations between two
vectors that contain more than one
element each naturally extent in an
element-wise fashion have a look at
these three examples pay attention here
multiplication and division are are
different from the traditional matrix
and vector calculus where the
multiplications of two vectors can
result in a single scalar or a matrix a
last question you might ask yourself is
how your bank account progressed overall
after these three math days and city of
sins you can save the previous
calculation in a new vector called Bank
and use the sum function on it to
calculate the sum of all its elements
Wow that was pretty close you still
managed to make a $30 profit in Vegas
that's quite an accomplishment instead
of subtracting expenses from earnings to
compare them which gives you positive
and negative numbers you could also use
relational operators to know when your
earnings were higher than your expenses
you can use the greater than operator
for this this operator compares the
numbers and the vectors element-wise
result is a vector of trues and falses
on these 1 &amp;amp; 2 your earnings exceeded
your expenses so the corresponding
elements are true on the last day you
spend more than you earn sewed results
is false there are much more relational
operators but that's something for the
intermediate our course for now you know
enough about factor calculus to do some
Vegas accounting hopefully they can help
you to earn some cold hard cash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
