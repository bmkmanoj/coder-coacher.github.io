this course will teach you a very
important skill for our how to join
multiple tables of data into a single
table you will find that your work flows
faster and more effortlessly and our
when you put your data into a single
tidy table when your data is in a single
table you can easily extract all the
values of a column to compute a
statistical summary like the mean or the
Max or you can also rely on the table
structure to preserve observations when
you manipulate the columns on the table
for example to compute a new variable in
short almost everything that you do with
tabular data becomes easier to do when
your data resides in a single table
however most real world data comes split
across multiple tables to help you deal
with this I'll teach you the most useful
ways to combine data with R in Chapter
one you will learn how to use mutating
joins which are functions that match
observations from one data set to
observations in another data set even if
those observations appear in a different
order in Chapter two you'll learn how to
use filtering joins and set operations
to surgically extract rose from
combinations of data sets in Chapter
three you will learn the best practices
for composing data frames in R including
the functions bind Rove's
bind calls and data underscore frame in
Chapter four you will become an expert
at diagnosing what can go wrong with
joins and quickly fixing errors or
avoiding them altogether and in Chapter
five you will hone your skills with a
case study there are two things that you
should know before you begin this course
first this is the second data camp
course to focus on deep liar the other
course data manipulation with deep liar
teaches how to arrange filter select
mutate and summarize data you do not
need to take that course before you take
this one however I will use some of
those functions in the exercises here
second there is more than one way to
join data sets with our base our comes
with a general purpose function for
joining data named merge we will ignore
merge and focus on the deep hire
functions that do the same things but I
want you to know that there are real
benefits for doing this first deep hires
joint functions will always preserve the
row order of your data which
unfortunately is not true from
second deep liars joined syntax is also
more intuitive and easier to learn than
merges but perhaps best of all you can
use deep liars join functions to
manipulate data that is stored in a
database or a spark instance the deep
liar package is built to be a front-end
language with multiple backends that
connect to different types of data at
the moment deep liar backends exist in
many common databases as well as to
Apache spark this means that you can
open are use deep layer to connect to a
database or spark instance and then
begin manipulating the data in the
database or spark with deep layer code
this is a great way to work with big
data from our we're not going to cover
database connections in this course but
you should know that what you learn here
can be applied to databases and spark as
well now that all of that is out of the
way let me introduce myself my name is
Garrett I work for our studio and I'm a
co-author of the book our for data
science I'm also a colleague of Hadley
Wickham the author of deep hire and I
work with him to develop educational
material for our packages thank you for
taking my course and I look forward to
seeing you in the videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
