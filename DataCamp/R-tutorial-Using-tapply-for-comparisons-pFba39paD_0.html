data into different groups allowed you
to compare distributions of velocity for
July relative to other months in 2015
but it's often useful to also get
numeric summaries of each group for
comparison to use in more complex
visualization in our one way to do this
is to use the T apply function this
function applies another function such
as mean separately across groups such as
month or pitch type T apply simply
requires that you first tell are the
variable you want to summarize the
grouping variable and the function to
apply across each group for example if
you want to get the average pitch
velocity by month you would indicate
that the variable of interest is start
speed the month variable is the group
and you want to calculate the mean you
can format the t apply output as a data
frame by wrapping it within the data
frame function this allows you to name
the new summary vectors as variables
just like in any data set this can
simplify later code and allow you to
treat your data just like you would any
other data frame in the upcoming
exercises you'll also use T apply in
combination with the plot function to
create a time series figure that shows
the fastball bullet velocity across each
game in the season let's start by
plotting a y variable start speed by an
X variable the month you can see the
points plotted here however time series
plots are usually created as line plots
this is coded simply with the plot
function using the type equals L option
while line plots are useful for
recognizing trends in the mean it's
sometimes helpful to visualize the
variability for each game as well
therefore you'll also add individual
points representing the velocity of each
pitch to evaluate the variability in
velocity for each game since there are
about 100 pitches for each game and
velocity is measured at 1/10 of a mile
per hour many points will be overlapping
in the plot this can make it difficult
to see all of the pitches as you can see
here we can fix this with the use of the
jitter function wrapped within the
points function to add them to your plot
the jitter function is useful when you
have many individual points overlapping
one another jitter slightly spreads
these out either across the y axis the x
axis or both so that you can have a
better idea of the number of pitches in
each game when you start your exercises
you'll slowly build up a plot similar to
this one but you'll also pair jitter
with transparent colors in the plot
using a combination of these two
visualization strategies can help
communicate your data more efficiently
go ahead and get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
