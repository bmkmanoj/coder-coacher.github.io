zoo my name is Jeff Ryan and I'll be
your tour guide throughout the course
bit of background on myself I'm the
creator or co-author of a variety of
widely used packages for our including
XTS quant mod and zoo I also co-founded
the popular our finance conference held
each spring in Chicago the conference
covering all things related to using our
and finance in this course will cover
one of the core object types in our the
time series specifically it will explore
the popular XTS and zoo packages by the
end of the course you'll have an
in-depth understanding of these packages
and how to leverage them in your daily
work to get there we'll work through
five important chapters in Chapter one
will cover the absolute basics of
getting started how to create import and
export time series in Chapter two we'll
explore basic manipulation including the
powerful time-based features that make
working with xes so productive including
XDS is special syntax for time-based
subsetting in Chapter three we
introduced the details of merging time
series as well as methods to handle the
inevitable missingness you'll encounter
in your data in Chapter four we get to
apply functions in time as well as learn
special functions in our that let you
aggregate time series data
finally in Chapter five we poke around
some of the more advanced features of
XTS including periodicity time zones and
little known techniques to extract
complex time periods so now that we know
where we're headed it's time to get
going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
