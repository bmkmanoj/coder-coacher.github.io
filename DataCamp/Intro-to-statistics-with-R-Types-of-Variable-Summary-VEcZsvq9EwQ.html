that we're going to use in this course
in experimental research I talked about
independent variables so for example in
the polio vaccine trials the independent
variable was the treatment whether the
child received the vaccine or the
placebo
that's a nominal variable they either
got vaccine or placebo like the memory
training experiment they are either got
training or they didn't get training
that's just a nominal variable subjects
are randomly assigned to one of those
two conditions the quasi independent
variables are also an example so the
sports related concussion there was
concussion
no concussion those are just nominal
groups another good or popular quasi
independent variable is genders female
male will typically use inter interval
and ratio variables as our dependent
variables or as our measured variables
in correlational research so for example
the rate of polio in a community like
how many kids out of a thousand acquired
polio after the the vaccine that was our
dependent variable or we could look at
score on an intelligence test or score
on a personality survey those are in the
interval ratio type and finally it's
important to keep track of whether your
variables are discrete or continuous so
what I mean by discrete variables our
examples are like the nominal variables
there's discrete categories separate
categories whereas continuous variables
are like the interval and the ratio type
where there's just a continuum so that
we have this scale on and say like an
intelligence test and it's just a
continuum ordinal variables are a little
tricky they're technically categories
right if they're if I only have say
first second and third gold silver
bronze
those are like categories but they're
ordered and in some cases we might want
to take averages of ordinal variables
and then they look more like interval or
ratio so we'll talk more about that
later as we get into some actual
analyses so to sum up this segment the
main point is that there are different
types of variables that we're going to
use throughout the course and that
statisticians use to do their research
and it's really important at the outset
that you always know what type of
variable you're dealing with because you
can only apply certain statistical
procedures to variables of certain types
so just remember that there are four
different types nominal ordinal interval
and ratio and know that as you go from
nominal to ratio you're allowed to ask
more and more interesting questions of
your data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
