with chill I will guide you through your
first steps in the world
of machine learning in the previous
video you learned about three machine
learning techniques classification
regression and clustering so you might
have felt there are quite some
similarities between classification and
regression for both you try to find a
function or a model which can later be
used to predict labels or values for
unseen observations it is important that
during the training of the function
labeled observations are available to
the algorithm we call these techniques
supervised learning labeling can be a
tedious work and it is often done by
humans there are other techniques which
don't require labeled observations these
techniques are called unsupervised
learning
you've already acquainted yourself with
one of these techniques in a previous
video namely clustering clustering will
find groups of observations that are
similar and thus does not require
specific labeled observations in the
next chapter we'll talk about assessing
the performance of your trained model in
supervised learning we can use the real
labels of observations and compare them
with the labels we predicted it's quite
straight straightforward that you want
your models predictions to be as similar
as possible to the real tables with
unsupervised learning however measuring
the performance gets more difficult we
don't have any real labels to compare
anything to you'll learn some neat
techniques to assess the quality of a
clustering in the next chapter
as you get more experienced as data
scientist you might notice that things
aren't always black and white the
machine learning some techniques overlap
between supervised and unsupervised
learning with semi-supervised learning
for example you can have a lot of
observations which are not labeled and a
few which are you can then first perform
clustering to group all observations
which are similar afterwards you can use
information about the clusters and about
a few label observations to assign a
class to unlabeled observations this
will give you more labeled observations
to perform supervised learning on enough
talking let's do some exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
