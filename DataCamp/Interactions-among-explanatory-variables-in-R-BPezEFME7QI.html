mind that there is not necessarily a
single effect size for each explanatory
variable often the effect size of one
variable depends on the value of the
other explanatory variables this plot
shows the probability of being married
for the people in the CPS 85 data set as
a function of age education and sector
the effect size of sex that is the
difference between marriage rates for
men and women is big in the clerical
sector but small in the service sector
young men in the professional sector are
more likely to be married than young men
in other sectors it's as if the various
explanatory variables work together to
determine the effect size of sex there's
a name for this data stations call it an
interaction effect might seem obvious
that the effect size of one explanatory
variable might depend on the levels of
other explanatory variables but it's
easy to get confused many people end up
thinking that the interaction is how one
explanatory variable shapes or causes
another explanatory variable in some
book model architectures such as LM you
will only see in an interaction effect
if you ask specifically for it and some
other architectures such as our part the
interaction is just an ordinary part of
the story
historically the LM architecture has
dominated scientific research and so the
decision of whether to include an
interaction effect is relevant let's
take a moment to examine how interaction
effects are included in LM models as an
example consider a simple story World
Records in the 100-meter freestyle swim
race the graph shows these records over
the course of the 20th century two
features are evident from the data
points first swimmers have gotten faster
over the years
second men's records are faster than
women's and even without formally
training a model you may be able to see
that the effect size of sex the
difference between men and women has
gotten smaller over the
years that change in effect size is an
interaction effect let's look at two
different models of the swim record data
one having an LM architecture and the
other and our part architecture the R
part model clearly shows an interaction
effect the difference between the sexes
changes over the years but the stepwise
nature of the model is jarring the model
output changes only over decades not
years the linear model is more
satisfactory showing a gradual
improvement in record times but there's
no interaction effects the two model
lines are parallel the model says
records are getting better the same rate
for men and women
the reason the linear model doesn't show
the interaction is because it never does
unless you ask for it specifically you
ask for an interaction effect to be
included by using a model formula with a
star to connect the variables you want
to involve in the interaction so here
the model formula says sex star year
rather than sex plus year you can see in
the inter see the interaction in the
graph in two ways the effect size of sex
decreases with year and equivalently the
slope giving the effect size with year
is different for the two sexes there are
good reasons why the LM architecture
includes interactions only if you
specifically ask for them to a large
extent this has to do with the demands
of small data sets that's a subject for
another course but at this point it's
entirely adequate to work with some
rules of thumb our part includes
interactions naturally as part of the
way the model architecture works LM and
some other model construction methods
that we haven't yet discussed will
include interactions only if you ask for
them including interactions sometimes
helps sometimes doesn't help and
sometimes hurts the performance of a
model when in doubt cross-validation
using a test set is a good way to assess
performance so you always have a way
to decide whether interactions are
helping or not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
