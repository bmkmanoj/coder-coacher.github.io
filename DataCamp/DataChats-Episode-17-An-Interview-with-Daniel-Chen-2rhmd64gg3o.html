all right data campers welcome to yet
another episode of data chats we're here
in the beautiful suburb of Cambridge
Massachusetts
had a great day recording a cleaning
data in Python course I'm Hugo von
Anderson a data scientist and course
developer at data camp and our
instructor for this wonderful course is
Daniel Chen so I'm Daniel I am a
graduate student at Virginia Tech I am
in the genetics bioinformatics and
computational biology program there and
I worked at the social and decision
analytics lab up in Northern Virginia to
grad student but you do a lot of other
things as well Daniel so maybe you can
tell us yeah so I guess I'll talk to you
about how I got started so I got my
masters in public health at Columbia in
the Department of Epidemiology and it
was during then when I took a course on
intro to data science taught by Jared
Lander so hopefully some of you guys may
or may not know of them and so pretty
much him and the other instructors for
the course
Rachel shut and Kerr Patel pretty much
got me started got me not so scared
about using our I had already known or
I've already known Python or how to
program in Python just for random
scripting that I've done but this was
the first time I was really introduced
to analytics so that's pretty much how
I've gotten started and since then it
was during that course where I got my
first how do I say this I was I was in
in 10 D of a software carpentry workshop
and it was then when I realized that
what I actually knew from just my basic
playing around in Python I can actually
extend that knowledge to be able to
start teaching other people and so I got
involved with software carpentry and I
think by now coming close to my third
fourth year being involved with them so
with software carpentry I got a lot of
practice keychain - teaching get keep
teaching Python and R and so and over
the course of the years what software
carpenter
and data carpentry they focus a lot on
good data practices or just good
software practices in general and so
I've been trying to do my best and you
know learning all of those techniques
and because I got to teach them all the
time you got a lot better just by
teaching and so now I'm here today
trying to teach the rest of the world
everything that I've learned or that's
taken me about three years to learn so
absolutely and you mentioned that Jared
Lander taught one of the courses you
took in your masters and you also work
work with him on and off right yeah so
with Jared Lander so I guess he intraday
to science course I took at Columbia was
essentially like a semester long like
job interview that I didn't know was
happening and so at the end of the
course Jared sort of like asked me if I
would be okay or if I wanted to help
with his teaching load for like
consulting purposes that other companies
around the country actually we can
actually say around the world now so so
yeah so I've been teaching you know
basic are I've done some teaching on you
know machine learning and are and right
now most of my teaching these days are
around shiny which is you know how you
make an interactive website with your
data but that's more our specific
sometimes done and this is this is all
focused but I'm one of approaching
you're also writing a book for - yeah
right yeah you can tell us a bit about
it so I'm also writing a book called
pandas for everyone and it's supposed to
be just very similar to the course today
that we've been recording except more of
just pandas in general so I'll show you
the book goes over you know how do we
even import data so it's a lot like the
other data camp courses and I guess it
comes from me teaching with software
carpentry and now where I am at school
where I have a bunch of these students
who want to start doing data analysis
and they come to me with like the same
set of questions and I guess just
through teaching experience I've learned
like these are the things that people
are having a lot of troubles with
and because I've been teaching so much
with software carpentry it's I have like
a nice mapped out of order on like what
techniques or what things people should
learn in what order and so right now I'm
just trying to put that down in in paper
form and I guess the goal with that is
to try to come up with like semester
long university course and a book that
kind of very ties in with it because the
university structure is actually really
difficult to hold a proper like just a
course on data science because of you
know you don't meet every day you need a
few hours a day a few times a week so so
I'm sure a lot of people out there want
to know when could I expect to see this
book and who's publishing it versus oh
so the book is published through Pearson
really hope I don't get this wrong this
bad so it's Pearson it's one of the
addison-wesley data series if you guys
look up Jarrod Lander and are for
everyone it's in the same series of that
book and hopefully it'll be out end of
this year slash early next year it
should be coming out pretty soon that's
end of 2017 early twenty seven eighty
what twenty I see yeah so end of point
seventeen early 2018 okay yeah so the
other question that I'm sure is on
everybody's it's it's obviously on my
lips is we've talked about how you do a
whole bunch of training and consulting
and software carpentry stuff in are how
you're doing a pandas Python cleaning
data in place and course here a book on
pandas and Python tell us about aren
pison and and yourself and maybe your
history of both oh so like I said I I
learned are I learned data analysis the
first thing I did how to better train
with the best way actually that's not
even the right way Victoria I've learned
how to do data analysis in our first so
at the time I didn't know anything about
data analysis I was actually doing all
of my stuff in Excel like most people
when they start out and you know using
our was really scary to start I'm not
going to lie about that but I would say
between arm Python it really doesn't
matter
you're going to learn one language just
learn it well because what you learn in
one will translate to the other so a lot
of the you know this tidy data stuff
that actually I mentioned in the video
it comes from Hadley with them which is
very prominent in the art world but all
of that information or that like way of
thinking about data still applies in
Python you still have the same problem
in cleaning data it doesn't matter if I
give you a CSV whether you pick or a
Python it really doesn't matter how
you're going to analyze it you're still
going to go through the general same
general steps so in terms of arm Python
I would say really doesn't matter which
one you pick just pick one and run it
well but for me I started with R and the
way I started learning R was I think I
learned how to load in data as like an
arm matrix and use one of like the
matrix manipulation two like four in a
row of data into like something that
looks like rows and columns and that was
the first thing I did in our was if I
ever got data because I was scraping
something in Python and it just came
back as like a row or like one vector of
values I would save that out to a CSV
loaded into R do my matrix manipulation
so I did a nice rectangular data set and
write that back out and do the rest and
like Excel or something so that's that's
what I did in R and then slowly I
learned other are functions like oh I
you know instead of just transforming
this data into something rectangular I
can do other things like make a
calculation or make a new column based
off of other columns and so I slowly got
more and more into R just because I
didn't want to start reading and writing
out files over and over again
so that's how I slowly built up the
knowledge on how to use R and then you
know you learn more and more and then it
becomes like oh I don't really need
Excel anymore like I can just do
everything I need in R and then from
there because I've been teaching with
software carpentry you learn it's like a
snowball effect like it gets really hard
to start for a lot of people just
because it is scary especially if you
don't have someone showing you how to do
something but then once you get started
you know it's very easy to learn that
one little thing to extend your
knowledge and then you know
you build on that you build on that
until you pretty much know how to like
do whatever you need you can wrangle
data to whatever format you need and
yeah so that's how I pretty much learned
our and then from there it became a
problem of oh I did I learned how to
like scrape data from the web and Python
even though you can do in an R I learned
how to do it using beautifulsoup and so
then the problem was oh I scraped all
this data using beautifulsoup
but I only know how to analyze data in R
and then you learn about this package
called pandas and then the same process
happened I learned how to load something
in panda maybe do this one thing that I
know that has like some correspondence
of how I do it in R and now I write it
out and then load the rest and do all my
analysis and R and then slowly it became
well the same issue instead of just you
know jumping back and forth between
languages I just slowly started learning
how to do more and more data stuff in
Python and then so that's pretty much
how I learned are in Python so you can
do you can come at it the same exact way
just the opposite way really like learn
that one bit in Python work at it until
you know enough you're going to come to
some use case like an R like my use case
I would say shiny is pretty cool as of
yet there isn't something as simple and
almost one-click but it's many clicks
and typing like shiny so maybe they'll
be like the the use case for people
coming from Python they have this data
set they want to manipulate it and they
have this nice data set now they want to
create a website for people to interact
with and so maybe they'll be the way to
you know drag you into the art world and
you know this day and age it doesn't
hurt to know more than one language I
agree completely applies in Easterwood
respond maybe you'd want to use flask or
Django and bouquet for example instead
of going to the our ecosystem I may
disagree with that but this isn't really
about my my opinions you mentioned that
if someone came to you and said should I
learn our or Python your response
generally is pick one language and run
with it and learn it well yeah my
question is are there qualities in this
letter student community this other
particular qualities or things that want
to do that would make
actually you spiked them like if they
said I want to like embed this and a
whole bunch of web apps um do a full
stack development to web scraping would
you then maybe say Python or if they
said I want to focus on statistics and
data base would you then direct but yeah
so and what other qualities would I mean
for me I guess if you're coming from a
computer science background chances are
you already learned Python in just
because you're learning you're going
down like a computer science major
pandas will probably make a lot more
sense just because then you don't have
to worry about learning the syntax of R
because there are some weird quirks in R
then again it at the same time if you're
coming from like a statistic background
more and more statistics program
programs well you know after you take
your intro SAS or jump or whatever those
other stats programs the more and more
professors are teaching are in their
classes so in that respect you might
just know are for general computing
purposes in R in which case you already
know how to fit models because you're
being taught how to do this in a stats
program so it doesn't hurt that just
continuing to continue to go down the R
well in that respect so the our
ecosystem has our studio in particular
has something very clever where they've
abstract it over over the shell the
terminal command line right so you can
get statisticians or biologists or
social scientists jump into a studio and
not having to do any command line right
look if that happened let's say you
could open notebooks without having to
use the command line at or do you think
that would actually open up the Python
ecosystem to a lot more people yeah I
mean I mean like you might whatever
carrier command line is scary and I
guess this ties back into software
carpenter if you ever look at any of
their material definitely doing old data
cameras out there check out software
carpentry and data carpentry yeah so
during the software did a carpentry
workshops the first thing that we teach
in the workshop is bash because we know
that the terminal the blinking cursor if
you've never communicated with a
computer that way is it is really scary
but at the same time it's really
important because you know we're going
into like the big data
world where your datasets are not going
to fit on your laptop the only way
you're going to be able to work on these
datasets are on remote servers so you
have to know bash or some terminal
application just we will communicate
with your data and so and then also like
there's little things like how do you
load in data set like the dot dot system
signify one folder of better
that's a bash thing so that's sort of
why you know the terminal is really
scary and you kind of have to know it
but you don't have to know too much of
it you know most of the termo commands
you need are just how do I get to a
folder and how do I run a program for
sure but I definitely feel like yeah
once python becomes one of those like
double-click you get a nice our studio
environment I mean there are pretty good
Python IDs like rodeo run by Y hat and
spider which is open source ships with
anaconda those are also like you know if
you're home by yourself and you're
really afraid like how do I run this
notebook because mmm it requires some
terminal thing you know look at like
some of the IDE is a ship with like
anaconda or Zulu and I think with
anaconda so I'm also primarily on Linux
so I don't get to see what happens in
Windows and Mac but I think if you
install anaconda like you get a nice
navigator that lets you double click so
you can open a notebook without running
the notebook they in the terminal we can
run all this stuff straight from like
your application toolbar you know so
it's it's nice that you know the barrier
for entry for everything in general is
just going down so yeah to go back to
your point like yeah does something like
Python similar to what our Studios done
exist I would say anaconda pretty much
is lowering that bar already
you just get a different environment
like notebook versus like your panel ID
absolutely so we've navigated quite
quite beautifully around this idea of
data science which is what we're talking
about constantly and I hesitate because
data science doesn't have any I mean
it's a vague it's a vague term it's a
buzzword in
you know in other ways so maybe you
could speak to what what it means to you
personally and professionally and what
your interest is so I guess yeah what is
a data scientist if you ever look at
like job applications they go from
something anything between system
administrators to statisticians to
database managers etc but I guess just
my views personally you pretty much are
the system administrator database
manager or slash analyst and
statistician well or at least you should
be able to speak basic the basic linguo
to be able to communicate between one
group and another is if you're in like a
corporate environment or something you
know databases are their own separate
beasts they have people who write how
databases should look that may or may
not be your job but you should still
know that there is a database that's
where all your data exists how do you
get this data that is your job as a data
scientist you know from a statisticians
point of view you know at the end goal
like whatever company you or somebody or
even if you're just playing with data on
your own you're trying to answer a
question and that requires some kind of
statistical knowledge you're trying to
fit a model just so you can make some
decision or figure out something about
the data you're working with does that
mean that you need to know every single
statistical like test out there no as
long as you can you know get most of the
way done you'll understand your data
like like this course by the time you're
done tidying your data you should have a
good sense of what's in your data you've
seen this for so long you've managed to
understand what each column means you
should be able to formulate like a
pretty simple or not even simple you
should be a form like any question given
the data that your kid that you have so
you know whether you decide to run like
a linear regression for example or a
t-test you should be able to at least
understand the basic statistics but in
no way or shape or form are you required
to understand the entire realm of
statistics that's kind of unheard of
unless you're like a doctoral or a
professor
are in statistics or something yeah but
what's great about as you know our
Python and pretty much the open world of
open source and open science is that a
lot of like this stuff you can find
online like or if you go to if you're
lucky enough to be in like close to some
kind of large city like there meetups
everywhere where you can learn that
brand new statistical technique and you
know you can apply it to your work and
you know again you've started with some
core of knowledge and you expanded it a
little bit more and then you know you
snowball and you learn more and more and
eventually you'll learn a bunch of
statistical techniques which you know
maybe you won't know that absolute Eric
one for that we're data set then ok
you'll ask the statistician whoever
you're working with but you can get
pretty much all most of your work done
at the very least you'll be able to
communicate your problem to someone else
and if anything that is your job as a
data scientist or your job as a
scientist in general or someone working
in general you should be able to
communicate your ideas or your problems
to someone else whether they're in your
field or not you know communicate your
problems communicate your ideas
communicate your findings so that's
that's pretty much what I think of data
scientist is I mean has the word
scientist in there you should probably
behave like a scientist and communicate
results or explain what your problem is
yeah I mean creating science science
doesn't exist in in in a head right it
exists in a method of communication and
communal knowledge and communal wisdom
that's really really interesting we have
a lot of aspiring data scientists we
come to data camp done to learn how to
be data scientist a lot of people
transitioning from from other positions
a lot of working professionals and we
get the question a lot if I want to kind
of get myself on a path to to being a
data scientist what are the best things
I can be doing and maybe you can speak
to that so I definitely if you're
watching this video definitely continue
watching whatever video you have next
queued up I
mentioned the software carpentry data
carpentry stuff those are all Creative
Commons and that's they'll teach you the
core skills that you would know what
other things you would do me personally
i listen to a lot of podcast so there is
shy shy wisdom sure off the top of my
head solution whatever springs to moment
so we have not so standard deviations
yeah so that one's done by oh god I'm in
a road trip to Roger panning and Hillary
Parker so that's more just as that was a
bit right yeah yeah so that's just more
I got a sticker from Hillary to that of
signs I there's no reason why kind of I
guess when things are recorded you get
really nervous about weather station
rule so that's just more about what's
going on in the data science field in
general and it's just like a nice talk
like what we're doing about what what's
going on in data science what's the new
package that has an hour pun yes so
there's that some of the more technical
ones that I listened to theirs partially
derivatives
I should probably a bunch of others
partially derivative is a nice one with
three people they're all usually
drinking beer talking about something
data science related it's kind of nice
the other one that I would like that's
more technical is there's one called
data skeptic and what I like about those
is they have like these they have
general discussions about you know what
the latest thing going on in data
sciences as well but they have like
these mini series which is just like a
small 5 minute burst about what is a
p-value yeah or like what is
unsupervised learning or you know what
is a random for us like like stuff like
that
which you know if you're doing this
before yeah so like you know so me as
like I come from the applied side of
things so for me just listening to like
those mini series or something just to
get a high level overview of what some
algorithm is doing
uh means a lot more to me because I
don't have the proper math background to
read the mathematical proof of going on
so and just understanding what's going
on if you end up looking or coming in to
cross the math or you know just applying
it in your day to day just having an
overview of what's going on it's
probably in my opinion because I come
from the applied side better than just
knowing the nitty-gritty map stuff yeah
absolutely so I guess those are the
three podcasts I can list off the top of
my head that I pretty much listen to
that's great but you also meant
mentioned previously try to make it to
meetups as well with yeah so the meetups
if you can will I mean one will get in
touch with people in your local area to
you'll pretty much learn something
you've never learned before or you'll
see a technique that you've never heard
before that's really relevant to the
problem you're having and so it's and
usually at these things you know there's
there's food or drink involved and
recruiting so recruiters yeah yeah
definitely wanted to get out of drove
home
yeah that's yes you're definitely on a
job hunt you know a lot of these meetups
the first thing they do at the beginning
is who has a job that they're looking
for people and they'll talk about the
job openings they have and then you meet
the recruiters or sometimes like even
the CEO of a company or like or at a
start-up they're there they're looking
for people and you know a lot of these
like I would even say like you don't
have to be like a full-blown data
scientist the one get hired but you
definitely don't need to be a full-blown
data scientist talk to these people I
mean like you have the CEO of a start-up
you know a really you know after you may
be down a couple beers who have enough
liquid courage go up to them and I talk
to them like what what types of problems
they're working on even ask them like
you have your your inspiring data
scientist where do you want to start you
know a lot of these people who go to
meetups are more than happy to share
information it's sort of the nature of
why you're attending this this like
three-hour block of time out
the end of a workday I mean like the
people who go to these things all look
the same mind so if you're really if
you're like an aspiring data scientist
and you want to learn or learn more
there's going to be someone on the other
side who who knows a lot and just wants
to find people who are as motivated to
spend three hours at the end of the day
to like to learn something and work for
them so it works both ways and you know
meetups are a great opportunity to like
learn and get hired absolutely all right
thanks Dan yep been an absolute pleasure
yep see you guys in the course
