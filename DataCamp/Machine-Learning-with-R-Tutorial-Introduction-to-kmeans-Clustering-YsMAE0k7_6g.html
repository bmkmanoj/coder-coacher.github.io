understanding of unsupervised learning
and the different goals of unsupervised
learning
let's stick right in with one popular
approach to unsupervised learning
k-means is a clustering algorithm an
algorithm used to find homogeneous
subgroups within a population k-means is
the first of two clustering algorithms
to be covered in this course the k-means
algorithm works by first assuming the
number of sub groups or clusters in the
data and then assigns each observation
to one of the sub groups in the next
video we'll go deeper into how the
k-means algorithm works to achieve this
goal for example one might hypothesize
that this data shown on the screen
contains two sub groups the k-means
algorithm would assign all points in the
top right hand corner to one sub group
and all observations in the bottom
left-hand corner to the other sub group
k-means and arc comes with the base are
installed invoking k-means and r is
simply a function call to the k-means
function typically with three parameters
the first parameter is the data
represented as X here in k-means like
many machine learning algorithms the
data is structured in a matrix with one
observation per row of the matrix and
one feature in each column of the matrix
the next parameter for k-means is the
number of predetermined groups or
clusters this parameter is called
centers for reasons they'll be covered
in the next video finally the k-means
algorithm has a random component the
implication of this stochastic component
is that a single run of k-means may not
find the optimal solution to k-means to
overcome the random component of the
algorithm k-means can be run multiple
times with the best outcome across all
runs being selected as a single outcome
instart is the parameter that specifies
the number of times k-means will be
repeated there are other parameters to
k-means and i encourage you to check
those out in the our documentation when
you're ready the first exercises use
synthetic data that were generated from
three sub groups but if you plot the
data it might only appear to be two sub
groups later in this chapter you will
see how Kami's can be used to estimate
the number of sub groups when the number
of sub groups is not known a priori
later in the first chapter of the course
you'll get experience applying k-means
with the real world but fun data set
with that information let's get started
on the first exercise using k-means</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
