variables using histograms and plots for
a basic histogram you call function hist
with a variable of interest in this case
interest rate you can use the arguments
main and xlab for nicer labels the
frequencies for the variable of interest
are shown on the y-axis here you can see
that all loans had an interest rate over
5% and very few loans had an interest
rate higher than 20% let's have a look
at the histogram of annual income we
notice that we get a strange results
here with seemingly just one big bar
stirring the histogram in hist
underscore income and using dollar sign
breaks we get information on the
location of the histogram breaks in
order to get a clear idea on the data
structure you can change the number of
breaks using the breaks argument such
that you get a more intuitive plot this
can be done by choosing a number that
seems more appropriate or use a rule of
thumb such as a square root of the
number of survey shion's in the data set
this results in a much longer vector
vector of breaks however the result
still doesn't look very nice here with a
lot of blank space the x axis of the
histogram automatically ranges from the
smallest observed value to the largest
one let us look at a scatter plot to see
what is going on in this plot the annual
income is shown on the y axis and the
observations index number is shown on
the x axis we see that there is one huge
salary of six million dollars
where none of the others is bigger than
around two million dollars we consider
this an outlier in statistics an outlier
is an observation that is abnormally
distant from other values but when is a
distance abnormal in general data
scientists will use their experts rules
of thumb or a combination of both expert
judgment could be used if the data
scientists is considered an expert in
the domain of credit risk modeling he
can then judge that an annual wage above
let's say three million dollars must be
an error and should be deleted from the
data set if a data scientist wants to
rely on a rule of thumb he could delete
all values that are bigger or smaller
than one point five times the
interquartile range which is arranged
between the first and third quartiles of
the variables distribution as outliers
in the negative range did not occur here
we only delete once in the positive
range after deleting outliers you get
the following results these histograms
are more informative than the initial
ones including the outliers especially
the histogram that was constructed using
the rule of thumb note that quite some
observations were deleted using this
rule of thumb even if you don't plan to
actually leave out these outliers in
your analysis it might still be useful
to delete them temporarily when
visualizing the data let's conclude by
looking at a bivariate plot when you
include a second variable in the plot
function the first argument will be
plotted on the x-axis and a second
argument on the y-axis a bivariate plot
for employment length and annual income
is shown here having a look at bivariate
plots can be interesting to track
bivariate outliers which are outliers on
two dimensions of the data for the
combination plotted here we only see an
outlier on the scale of annual income
and not for employment linked now let's
try to make some plots and histograms
ourselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
