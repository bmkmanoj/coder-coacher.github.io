sure contains simple insights that you
just could not access I'm not talking
about the sorts of information that you
can discover with machine learning or
modeling algorithms just simple things
like new variables summary statistics
group differences and so on
most data sets contain more information
than they display and deep hire is a
package that can help you access that
information
deep hire introduces a grammar of data
manipulation by simple functions that
you can use to reveal new variables new
observations and new ways to describe
your data you can also use these
functions as subsetting data into
GroupWise operations and deep liar is
fast very fast the key pieces of deep
hiring and speed plus plus which means
you get the speed of scheme with the
ease of our this course will show you
how to use deep hire like an expert you
learn these deep eyes grammar data
manipulation to solve any game related
tasks you can think of along the way
we'll learn to think about and
manipulate the structure of data you'll
also learn to use deep layers table
structure and the piping operator two
features that can save you tons of time
you'll even learn how to use deep fired
access stays stored in a database which
provides an easy way to work with data
that's too big to fit in are all at once
with deep hire ARS literally faster
bigger and better I'll be a guide to the
deep hire package my name is Garrett
Parliament and I'm a data scientist at
our studio I work closely with Hadley
Wickham the author of deep fire has been
much my time teaching people how to use
have these tools as well as the tools
that my colleagues at our studio create
and that's how need to join us at the
end of the course so if you work your
way through all the exercises you'll
have a chance to hear how these own
thoughts on the deep fire package but
before we can do any of that we need to
set up your our session to use deep wire
if you're ready to begin head over to
the exercises will load the deep fire
package and our dataset</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
