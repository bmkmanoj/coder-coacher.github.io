the Python story we already know about
functions such as mags to get a maximum
of a list length to get the length of a
list or string and so on but what about
other basic things such as getting the
index of a specific element in the list
or reversing a list it can look very
hard for built-in functions that do this
but you won't find them in the past
exercises you've already created a bunch
of variables among other Python types
you've created strings floats and lists
like the ones you see here each one of
these values are data structures are
so-called Python objects this string is
an object this float is an object but
this list is also an object these
objects have a specific type that you
already know string float and list and
of course they represent the values you
gave them such as Liz 1.73
and an entire list but next to that
Python objects also come with a bunch of
so called
methods you can think of methods as
functions that belong to Python objects
a Python object of type string has
methods such as capitalize and replace
but also objects of type float and lists
have specific methods depending on the
type enough for the theory now let's try
to use a methods suppose you want to get
the index of the string mom in the
families Pham is a Python object with a
type list and as a method named index to
call the methods you use the dot
notation like this the only input is a
string mom the elements you want to get
the index for Python returns for which
indeed is the index of string mom I call
the index methods on the family list
here and the output was 4 similarly I
can use the count method on the family
list to count a number of times
1.73 occurs in the list Python gives me
one which makes sense because only lists
is 1.73 meters tall but lists are not
the only Python objects set of methods
associated also floats integers
boolean's and strings are Python objects
to their specific methods associated
with them take the variable sister for
example that represents a string you can
call the method capitalize on sister
without any impass
it returns a string where the first
letter is capitalized now or what if you
want to replace some parts of the string
with other parts not a problem just call
the method replace on sister with to
appropriate inputs in the output Z is
replaced with si
I guess it's clear by now in Python
everything is an object and each object
has specific methods associated
depending on the type of the object list
string float whatever the available
methods are different a string object
like sister has replace methods but a
list like fam doesn't have this as you
can see from this error objects of
different types can have methods with
the same name take the index method it's
available for both strings and lists if
you call it on a string you get the
index of the letters in the string if
you call it on a list you get the index
of the elements in the list
this means that depending on the type of
the objects the methods behave
differently before I unleash you on some
exercises or methods there's one more
thing I want to tell you some methods
can change the objects they're called on
let's retake the fam list and call the
append method on it as the input we pass
a string we want to add to the list
Python doesn't generate an output but if
we check the fam list again we see that
it has been extended with string me
let's do this again this time to add my
length to the list again the familis was
extended this is pretty cool because it
can write a very concise code to update
your data structures on the fly but can
also be pretty dangerous some method
calls don't change the object they're
called on while others do so watch out
let's take a step back here and
summarize this you have Python functions
like type max and round that you can
call like this there's also methods
which are functions that are specific to
Python objects depending on the type of
the Python object you're dealing with
you'll be able to use different methods
and they behave differently you can call
methods on the objects with a dot
notation like this for example there's
much more to tell about Python objects
methods and our Python works internally
but for now let's stick to what I've
talked about here it's time to get some
exercises and at
methods your ever-growing skillsets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
