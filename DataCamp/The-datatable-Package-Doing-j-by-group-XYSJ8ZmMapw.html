calculating aggregates and doing other
things in jail
this section will do that by group and
we simply pass the column names into the
third argument of data table queries
which is by and we use the dot
parenthesis notation once again so in
this example we have the value C
occurring first in column a on Row one
and then again on row four so we add one
plus four and that gives the answer 5
and that's the answer for the first
group so it's very important in data
table that the groups are returned in
the order that they first appear in the
data table now we can also use functions
in bi and here we're using the modulo
operator percent percent so modulo two
is of course returning whether the
numbers are odd or even so in this case
the first row of the data table is an
odd number number one and that's grouped
together with the other odd numbers in
column a which is one three and five so
the sum is produced in the output and
then the second group are the even
numbers on Row two and Row 4 and that
appears in the output as the second
group now there is a shortcut in data
table if you just have one item in J or
one item in bi you don't have to use the
dot parenthesis notation you can drop
that and just use the aggregate directly
and use the column name or even a
function of the column name directly and
by and that's what we do here so we do
that quite a lot if we don't mind too
much about the output column names
we can pass a row subset into AI as well
so here we're passing the row numbers 2
3 &amp;amp; 4 into the I argument and just doing
the aggregation over those three rows
and this time the even numbers come back
first in the answer because an even
number occurs first in the subset of
rows of DT that we're aggregating over
so that's pretty much it
those are the three main arguments of
data table i j + bi and the rest of the
course really just expands on this theme
so now for some excercises to put these
three arguments into practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
