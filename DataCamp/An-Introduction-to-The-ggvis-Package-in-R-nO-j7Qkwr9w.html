learn as a day scientists is how to
visualize data when you graph your data
you suppose it's the most powerful
information processing tool that you own
your own visual system reveal patterns
that wouldn't be clear if you just
looked at tables or odd numbers and you
create a beautiful piece of evidence
that your colleagues and your readers
are likely to pour over with interest
this course will teach you how to
visualize data with the GG this package
and our gg this makes it easy to create
customizable and beautiful pots of your
data like the ones seen here GG this
provides an interface that's flexible so
you can compose new kinds of
visualizations it's simple
so that's accessible to all our users GG
this is a brainchild of Hadley Whitcomb
and Winston Cheng who maintains to the
popular GT taught to package which also
makes grass-like ggplot2 GG this is
based on the grammar of graphics which
makes GG this very easy to learn the
grammar of graphics is a way to think
about a graph any graph as a collection
of parts these parts are like Legos once
you learn to work with them you can use
them to build any type of visualization
that you can dream up but GT this also
extends GG block 2 it uses our to build
HTML graphs which gives you the best of
two worlds you can use the analytic
Hauer of art to prepare your data and
the visual power of JavaScript to
display your results you can even use GG
viz to create interactive data displays
and since GG Fizz graphs are based on
HTML they fit seamlessly into shiny
applications like this one in our
markdown reports like this one this
course will teach you how to use G of is
to make beautiful plots your work
through ten chapters that cover the
breadth and the depth of the G cheapest
graphing language in the course I'll
teach you the grammar of graphics as
well as how to customize your GT this
plots my name is Garrett ol woman and I
will work out our studio with Hadley and
Winston I spend my time teaching people
how to use our packages like GG biz and
I'd be honored to have you take my
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
