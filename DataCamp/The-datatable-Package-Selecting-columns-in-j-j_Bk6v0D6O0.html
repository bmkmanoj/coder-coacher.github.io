how to select rows using row numbers in
the I argument which is the first
argument in data table in this section
we'll cover the second argument which is
J the simplest thing what you can do in
J is to select columns here's the data
table DT where you have three columns a
B and C to select the columns B and C we
just have to wrap them around with dots
followed by a parenthesis in addition to
selecting columns we can also call
functions in J because the columns are
as if they are variables which we just
saw in the previous section using the
same data table from the previous
section we have three columns a B and C
now instead of just selecting on columns
will aggregate on columns a and C we
call the function sum on column a that
adds up the values 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus
4 plus 5 and returns 15 similarly
because the function mean on column C
which averages the values 6 7 8 9 and 10
which gives 14 divided by 5 equals 8 not
that we provided total and mean as a
column names that have been assigned as
the column names in the result now if we
did not provide any column names data
table will automatically generate those
values for us and computing on multiple
columns does not all return the same
length the length of the shorter column
gets recycled to match the length of the
larger column using the same data table
DT with 3 columns a B and C we select
column B and calculate sum on column C
now some 1 column C return a single
value which is 6 plus 7 plus 8 plus 9
plus 10 equals 14 and the length of
column B is Phi and therefore sum of C
value gets recycled to fit the length of
column B in fact you can do pretty much
anything in J it doesn't even have to
return a value for example let's do DT
of plot of a comma C and it just plots
the column a in the x-axis and column C
in the y
axis note that we didn't have to wrap
plot with the dot parentheses syntax
because here we use plot as a side
effect and returns a value now in fact
we can also have multiple expressions
wrapped within curly braces so for
example we print Colin a here on to the
console with returns one two three four
and five followed by the plotting of
histogram on column C here however
histogram returns the values invisibly
and therefore we explicitly set the
value return value now in jail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
