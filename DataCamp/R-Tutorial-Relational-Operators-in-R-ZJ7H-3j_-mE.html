intermediates our course my name is
philipp i'm a content creator at data
camp and i will help you master a bunch
of new concepts in the r programming
language next stop on our trip through
the wonderful world of our relational
operators relational operators are
comparators are operators which help us
see how one our object relates to
another for example you can check
whether two objects are equal you can do
this by using the double equal sign we
can for example see if the logical value
true equals to logical value true let's
try this out in a console we type true
equals equals true and result of this
query is a logical value in this case
true because of course true equals true
on the contrary true equals equals false
will give us false make sense right
apart from logical variables we can also
check the Equality of other types you
can also compare strings and numbers
the opposites of the Equality operator
is the inequality operator written as an
exclamation mark followed by an equal
sign this sentence we treat as hello is
not equal to goodbye because this
statement is correct our will output
true naturally the inequality operator
can also be used for numerics logicals
and of course other are objects as well
see how every time result of the
Equality operator is opposite for the
inequality operator
of course there are also cases where you
need more than simply equality and
inequality operators what about checking
if an object is less than or greater
than another our object this will not
come as a surprise you can use the less
than or greater than sign for this in
the case of numerical values here is a
straightforward example three less than
five will evaluate a true well three
greater than five will evaluate to false
for numerix this makes sense but how
would this work for character strings
and logical values is hello greater than
goodbye let's find out
apparently hello greater than goodbye
evaluates to true but why so is because
are uses the alphabet to sort character
strings since H comes after G in the
alphabet hello is considered greater
than goodbye
how about logical values is true less
than false the following query gives us
the answer it appears not it evaluates
to false that's because under the hood
true corresponds to 1 and false
corresponds to 0 and of course 1 is not
less than 0 hence the false results you
can also check to see if 1 our object is
greater than or equal to or less than or
equal to another our object to do this
you can use the less than sign or the
greater than sign together with the
equal sign so 5 greater than or equal to
3 as well as 3 greater than or equal to
3 will evaluate to true you already knew
that our is pretty good with factors how
about ours comparators can they also
handle vectors suppose you have recorded
the daily number of views your LinkedIn
profile hat the previous week and start
them in a vector LinkedIn if you want to
find out on which days the number of
views exceeded 10 we directly use the
greater than sign for the 1st 3rd 6th
and 7th elements in a vector the number
of views is greater than 10 so for these
elements result will be true you can
also compare vectors to vectors suppose
you also recorded the number of user
Facebook profile at the previous week
and save them in another vector Facebook
when are the number of Facebook views
less than or equal to the number of
LinkedIn views the following expression
shows us how to calculate this does this
make sense in this case the comparison
is done for every elements of the vector
one by one for example in the third day
the number of Facebook views is 5 and
the number of LinkedIn views is 13 the
comparison evaluates to true as 5 is
smaller than or equal to 3
just as for vectors are also knows how
to compare other data structures such as
matrices and lists add over to the
interactive exercises and add relational
operators to your ever-growing our skill
