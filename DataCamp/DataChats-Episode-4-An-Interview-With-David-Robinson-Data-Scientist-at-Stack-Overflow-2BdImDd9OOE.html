camp and I am here with Dave Robinson
today Dave and I just finished recording
his new course it's an exploratory data
analysis case study course which I'm
really excited about so welcome thank
you for having me so I've got a few
questions I wanted to ask Dave I'm very
excited to have him here so Dave first
off I know you did your PhD at Princeton
in computational biology and you now
work for a web company as a data
scientist you have a passion for
statistics you've developed some are
packages so there's a number of labels
someone might apply to you a
statistician a data scientist program or
a developer I'm curious to know which of
those you associate with the most and
why so I identify strongly as a data
scientist I think it's a um I think that
I've really been a data scientist even
while I was doing my PhD it's been
something that my passions have focused
on I think a lot of what happens in act
and academics science is data science is
taking datasets are using programming to
process them and that using statistics
to draw conclusions from them in a
rigorous way so there's there's really
this combination that is not similar to
how a computer programmer
or an engineer would just go about the
jobs nor is similar to a statistician
but this blend that has his own set of
tools and I've been using them during my
PhD and that's one of the reasons that I
felt rather comfortable stepping into a
role in a web company so as I've said
before I think I'm I think data science
exists in both academics and industry in
academics data scientists build things
to answer questions and in industry data
scientists answer questions to build
things yeah that's an interesting way of
looking at it
so so in a sense associating with the
statistician label or the developer
label would be limited in this in a
sense it's actually data science is the
thing that encompasses all of those
things that I listed that that you love
yeah absolutely but it also comes down
to
I'd say statisticians statisticians
would be better at statistics than me
developers better at software
development and it would be wrong to try
and try and put myself in that category
I've seen a nice definition from someone
else that was a data scientist is
someone who was better at software
engineering than any statistician and
better at statistics than any developer
that any status any developer interests
in but there's a popular vendetta fun
diagram that actually shows a third
component to a data scientist such as
domain knowledge who Conway's absolutely
right so that was that's domain
knowledge is something that's absolutely
true that is then you need to do good
data science so when I was in grad
school that involved building some
biology knowledge and since I joined
Stack Overflow that has involved my
knowledge of the business and of the
community on the site and one of the
advantages I had there as I'd spent a
very long time answering questions on
Stack Overflow I've been a lover of the
community for a while so that did give
me that advantage yeah that's
interesting so there's a famous quote
and I'm blanking on who said it the
great thing about being a statistician
is you get to play in everyone's
backyard I think that might have been
kooky yeah yeah so it may be the the the
the the modern the modern alternative is
the great thing about being a data
scientist is you get to play in anyone's
backyard but but it's good to be to do a
good job you have to invest the time in
learning the domain that you're working
in right yeah I I absolutely think so
and I think um I think that's what
separates some of the greatest status
data scientists from from others who
might still be experts but people that
get the most done are usually the ones
that really appreciate and spend time to
understand the area they're applying it
to yeah okay cool so another one of your
passions is writing which is obvious to
anyone that is fortunate enough to
stumble upon your blog variance
explained
how did you how did you get started with
writing when did you realize that is
something you really enjoyed and at what
point did you decide to start your own
blog what was the origin of that yeah
well so I started my blog in the last
year of my PhD so it would have been
fall 2014 and at the at that point to me
it kind of grew out of my interest in
teaching of interest in education I
really enjoyed teaching these are
courses and teaching statistics to
undergraduates and graduate students and
I realized that while a course is the
perfect vehicle for a lot of education a
blog post can as well one of my first
blog posts was about how to interpret a
p-value histogram there was something
that I understood and everyone in my lab
understood but I realized most people
didn't and it would be productive to
have a way that I could spread that that
just spread that knowledge and let
everyone know it I also I also the time
since I was about to enter the job
market I think of writing a blog is a
really great way just to get just to get
it's a great way to this feminine name
and have people be familiar with some of
the work that I can do outside of just
the resume and so those were some of the
reasons I started and I've really um I
and after the first few posts um on data
science education and others on analyses
of various data sets I'd found it found
interesting I really just started
enjoying the process very good very good
so that's really interesting and and as
so a lot of people talk about the
importance of building a portfolio as a
data scientist and and often the way the
way someone will encourage you to do
that is to to maybe start a github
repository start tracking your analyses
and and Martin our markdown documents
and posting those on github fiddling
around with other people's packages but
I haven't really heard people talk about
creating blogs as as a way to
position yourself well for for entering
the job market what would you what would
you what advice would you have for
somebody who who wants to start their
own blog like where do you get started
what are you write about especially if
you're just getting started with data
science I think one of the most so if
you're if you're if so for someone who's
experienced in data science I would say
what do you bid starting a blog I would
say what are you an expert in that you
don't even realize you're an expert in
what knowledge are you walking around
with that that not many people have and
anyone who gets a little experience will
have these areas and that's a great
opportunity for teaching and
communication for people that are
starting I'd say one of the reasons I
built the this course this way in this
exploratory data analysis is you can
learn so much by diving into a data set
and finding things out from it so I
would say to anyone who's starting out
pick a data set that's interesting to
you learn some cool things from it and
then post your analysis that is it is
not just good for your portfolio it's
good for your analysis skill and it's
good for the skill of communicating your
analyses which you have to do whether
they're public or private
yeah and it's a great way to get
feedback on on on your work right oh
absolutely yeah yeah if you're not
putting it out there for the world to
sieve and you might be missing out on
some on some some good some good
insights some good feedback yeah it is
to improve it's sad to me I think how
many statisticians and analysts fill
their hard drive with these really cool
analyses and graphs and everything to
share it I'm also a big fan of Twitter
which is a really easy way to make one
interesting graph and just unshared
without having without writing the
entire post yeah now you're big into the
Twitter game yeah there's a lot of
fantastic data scientists on Twitter and
I think um it's actually Twitter was
even before I started my blog how I was
able to start getting involved in the
data science community say more on that
like so sit for somebody who wants to
start creating a better awareness of
what's happening in the art community of
the data science community how can they
use Twitter as a tool for accomplishing
that
yeah I'd start by following people that
are influential data scientists for me
that's largely the data science in the
RC
that includes Hadley Wickham Hilary
Parker Jeff Leake Roger pang lots less
suppose a lot of people that I that I
follow and and retweeted him and I'm
interested in and by reading through
through them you can really see you can
see a lot of things that people are
working on and see a lot about
communication from these really great
communicators in my case my involvement
with Twitter's really started when I
released the broom package which was
discussed in this course for tying model
outputs so after I released it I tweeted
about it and included Hadley Wickham and
that was how I started I started my
professional relationship with him and
how he and him by between and it kind of
shared that and that really that and
that was a way that after writing
something and releasing something I was
able to get people to notice it and
start giving feedback and start and
start getting mentoring that into the
larger data science community interested
in so it definitely accelerated the
feedback loop for you which is extremely
important when absolutely he's a
software yeah I know other data
scientist that have gotten started in
that in a similar way you know starting
with blogging on Twitter okay great so
at data camp our focus is trying to
prepare people for doing data science in
the wild we want to teach practical
skills and so I guess like from your
perspective now that you are a
practicing data scientist you're out in
the wild what sorts of things have you
been forced to learn on the job or
willingly burned on the job that you
wish you had been exposed to earlier on
maybe when you were studying at
university one of the biggest
differences is is I hadn't I really
hadn't appreciated a lot of business
terminology and how much it ends up
impacting the role of a data scientist I
think Trust is product knowledge driving
up the things that whether things drive
decisions actually appreciating the
impact of particular so the domain
knowledge that we were talking about
absolutely but there's there's there's
kinds of domain knowledge that I think
apply
the entire industry that academia can be
shielded from so one one example would
be working would just be working with
hard deadlines and the idea of of
getting analysis done in one moving on
one month rather than spending a long
period of time making it perfect for a
paper
there were habits that I kind of had to
unlearn between the publication cycle
and the work cycle and blogging was a
good way to get into that a little
earlier to get used to
releasing iterative results another
would just be another would be
understanding impact so it can be easy
in statistics to spend a lot of work
getting a mathematical model exactly
right and I'm not really thinking about
how right does it have to be and not
real I'm not really thinking of for
example when I would say like like the
difference between particular kinds of
models a linear model a generalized
linear model between these these some
simple ones and sophisticated ones
getting a really catted of an
understanding of when you of when you
can use a simple one and it gets you
most of the results it becomes
especially important once models start
being used in production and they are
and more complicated models might be
might be ready to fail it might be hard
to communicate with people that develop
them under these other costs these were
things that I really started to
appreciate once I started in industry I
think it's hard to teach these things in
a in a course environment not in not in
a rather than an experience and one of
things I tried to get across in this in
this in this course is how of even a
very simple using even a very simple
mathematical model can still can you can
still dive in to get exactly the
insights that you're looking for sure
sure okay so maybe a related question is
more broadly like as you look at the
educational system and and the sorts of
things that future data scientists are
learning in a university setting what do
you think we could
be doing a better to prepare would be
data scientists for let's just call the
wild yeah one of the big ones that
immediately pops to mind and it's kind
of emblematic of some of the issues of
data science education is sequel so
sequel is something that almost no PhDs
in any field besides computer science
and the building skills in but it is
absolutely required for a majority of
data scientists people that work at a
web company are going to need to engage
with the database and get not on get
information out of it that's true even
if they're not using Big Data
technologies them just just a
traditional sequel database data centers
will spend time writing it and getting
knowledge out of it and I think it
really is emblematic because it's
something that lies at the border
between computer science and statistics
people people that are computer science
students would probably learn in the
process of database administration and
building websites but it's but it's
something but in the particular
combination where almost all of my time
or really a lot of my time is working
with data that I got from a sequel table
so understanding how to get it out in
the form that it's best for me is an
important part of my job so it's just
it's it's really interesting that people
just that a lot of programs don't look
at it and I was very lucky that in my in
my undergraduate and graduate career I
spent mostly in statistics on biology I
did spend a lot of my extra time
building you learn to build websites and
work with her I'd already be and I'd
already kind of become familiar with the
sequel almost by accident saying that
most of my colleague it's less than I
would have picked up for my colleagues
and I think that's one of one of the
things I would name yeah okay that's
good very interesting so it's clearly a
very exciting time to be in data science
I think it's a very exciting time in the
art community as well a lot of things
are changing very rapidly what trends
are you most excited about personally I
think I can think of two of I'll say you
have two really important ones one is
the
open source our community I think the I
think this has been going on for decades
of with the with the use of with a cram
their central repository of art packages
but I've really noticed in the last few
years a trend towards more people
creating more scientists creating their
own art packages for analyses part of
what what it can do are contributed to
it is github where where people can any1
can put up a package without having to
go through the crown review process even
while it's in development and similarly
the dev tools package which which allows
someone to install a package from go
from github this is this is something
that I'm I really only started making
packages in the last two years and I
think that's true of a lot of people and
I often tell I tell people that are
getting that are involved are users to
start writing their own because it's
just it's such an important way to get
your own tools to spread and and become
useful to a lot of people the other is
the tidy verse so this this kind of set
of philosophically related packages
starting with some of Hadley wickham's
packages such as deep layer ggplot2 and
tidy are that have become really a
really really powerful and I've started
being released in these last couple of
years so these packages kind of all work
together in this way that in this way to
get these analysis that these to do an
analysis with tools that I think we the
way how they refers to it is is they're
not just is there are high-quality tools
but more importantly the glue between
them is there ways to connect from one
to the other are very are designed to
work with each other to be very easy and
that really helps get into a good
analysis flow and the thing that excites
me is we're still very early in that
ecosystems development I think where I
stay what's still just starting to wrap
up we built even this year has seen a
lot of interesting tools for taya for
tidy data one one interesting one is
tidy text data package that Julia silky
and I wrote together for doing a text
mining using tidy tools such as deep I
on juju plateau mmm-hmm okay very
interesting so maybe
I think there are a lot of people out
there who still are not familiar with
the so called tidy verse or and I'm sure
there's there's plenty of people out
there who are skeptical of it you may
know of it but are skeptical of it why
should somebody invest the time to learn
these packages when they already know
how to program in our I think that
investment in in your own programming
skills it just pays off exponentially it
doesn't just pay off in the analyses you
can do today pays off me now and the
next analysis you'll do on the one after
that and a that's especially true when
they're tools that help you learn faster
that help you think about your data
faster because they are their tools that
can get out of your way
I think base saw R is a great language
and there are a lot of fantastic tools
in base R but I've noticed an
acceleration as I move to this set of
tools that has been really exciting and
that acceleration is always worth an
initial investment and one of the
reasons I created this course which is
really centered around for tidy various
packages ggplot2 de ply our tidy our and
my own broom package is to make this
this this learning curve as easy as
possible and in this course it will
definitely be useful to new data
scientists but I also think it'll be
useful to people that have a lot of our
experience want to see how these tools
can be used to work together ok
interesting so from my own personal
experience one of the reasons I I enjoy
using dir and anti-d are together is
they actually help me think about what
I'm trying to do more clearly so they
they not only are useful tools for
carrying an out analysis and analysis I
already have in my mind but they help me
restructure the way that I'm thinking
about a problem and they make me they
force me to break it down into small
simple steps and I think that's very
powerful when you can have when you can
have code when the code actually helps
improve your thinking about an analysis
when it's not just a passive tool that's
there for your for your at your disposal
but it's it's something that actually
enhances your thinking about
I absolutely agree I think the two like
most famous examples of that are ggplot
two's grammar of graphics and deep liars
constrained grammar of verbs so the
grammar of graphics did it wasn't didn't
start with ggplot2 it started with um
Wilkerson's book a layer of the grammar
of graphics and Wickham's 2010 paper and
these and what it really lays out is a
way of thinking about the relationship
between your data and your plot so it
may take a little bit more code to make
ggplot2 than to call a function called
plot and just and just create something
but it is a is but by allowing you to
think about the relationship between
your data and the graph and therefore
between the way you're going to take
your data and turn it into understanding
on the viewers part is really powerful I
think the same thing or a deep liar is
constrained grammar where the ideas is
to have one way to do each type of
operation one way to filter your
observations the filter verb when we're
to add new variables the mutate verb and
one way to connect them together the
pipe so well that can be a bit
restrictive and there are certainly
times where it's worth stepping out of
but by always thinking of things in
terms of these steps you get to fit a
lot in your mind you get to think a lot
about what are the what are the steps
I'm going I'm going to need to run into
and it really helps you it helps take
you away from the syntax and the the
programming questions how to make this
loop or how to make this how to get the
code to do what you want and really more
into the critical thinking of what do I
need my data to do mm-hmm it's good
stuff cool so a lot of the people who
will be watching this are new to data
science they're new to our and new to
the tiburce what advice do you have for
people who are just getting started
besides taking your course well I think
we hit on it earlier and it's advice I
always give to new data scientists which
is create public artifacts that is
something when you do an analysis or
when you do a or when you write some
code for yourself see what you can do to
communicate it to the world
blogging and I'm a big fan of blogging
and writing practice is just is also a
really important skill
so I recommend create some create some
blogs when they start out they might be
a little you you might feel awkward or
uncomfortable working with them but it
will you will approve it of that and the
only way to do that is to start
publishing them I feel the same way
about our packages which which are also
really good to get you thinking about
how to write write code that's not just
used by you but is used by others and
people that say they're not ready to
start writing our packages I found that
people even very even people that are
very early on and there are experience
can learn to create in our package
there's a terrific book by how they were
compiled our packages that's a good
guide to this and Kenna and once they do
that it really helps accelerate their
experience it's so it's good for
practice it's good for writing it's good
for practice of programming and it's a
good way to start getting your name out
there and building a portfolio for
finding a job so they'll be that would
be I think definitely creating public
work and as I mentioned earlier picking
an interesting data set finding some
things out from it and then publishing
the results or what I recommend ok very
good I think that's all the time we got
hey Nick I appreciate it I'm very excite
about the course we did
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
