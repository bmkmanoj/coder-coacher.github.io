scientist a data camp data camp is an
online data science school here you'll
take fun video lessons and solve
interactive coding challenges regular
receive instant and detailed feedback in
its introduction to our four finance
course you will learn the basics of data
analysis in R along with the common
structures that are used to store data
unique to this course
almost all examples will be related to
finance allowing you to have concrete
applications of the theory and ideas
that you learn along the way great now
that the introduction is out of the way
it's time to get started with the basics
as you will soon learn R can be used to
perform mathematical calculations an
important component of R is the console
the our console is where you can execute
our commands in data kemp's interactive
interface the console can be found here
let's try to calculate the sum of 1 &amp;amp; 2
we simply type 1 + 2 at the prompt and
hit enter our interprets what you typed
and print the result pretty cool right
or it's much more than just a fancy
calculator it is a powerful tool for
doing statistical data analysis one
great feature for this is the ability to
create variables often also referred to
as objects think of variables as
containers to store your data for later
use after creating your variable you can
run other lines of code and whenever you
want to get your data back you simply
type the name of the variable you save
it in to create a variable in our use
the less than sign followed by a dash
this operation is known as assignment
what would this example look like in the
our console type my number assign 5 to
it and press Enter when you want to
access the data in my number type in its
name press ENTER again and our returns 5
as another example assume your good
friend Dan owes you hundred dollars to
keep track of this you can create a
variable named them and assign the value
of a hundred to it if your other friend
Rob owes you $50 you can repeat the
process
by creating a variable for Rob and
assigning it 50 suppose you want to
calculate the total amount your two
friends
oh you luckily for you in our you can
perform calculations with variables to
calculate the total just type den plus
Rob you could even assign this value to
a new variable total to use later
consider for a moment what would happen
if you close out of your browser right
now and came back later to the data
campsite the code that created all of
those variables would be gone right well
that's annoying this is where our
scripts come into play an our script is
simply a text file that holds lines of
code and that can be saved and run in
succession whenever you want let's write
the code that has been run so far in an
our script now you can run this code
whenever you want when you work through
data camp exercises you will write your
answers in our scripts and when you are
finished you will press the submit
answer button data Kemp's code wizard
will check your answers for correctness
and you'll receive personalized feedback
on how you did that seems like enough
for now let's get going with your first
interactive exercise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
