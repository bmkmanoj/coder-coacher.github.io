measures of central tendency like the
mean the median or the mode what those
measures do is they try to capture the
center point of a distribution what
measures of variability do is they try
to capture how much spread or how much
of a just how wide is the distribution
so the two main measures that we'll look
at our standard deviation and variance
and variance is simply standard
deviation squared so standard deviation
is just the average deviation from the
mean in a distribution and we'll see
that mathematically in a moment and
again variance is standard deviation
squared so this is an important formula
to know I'm assuming that most of you
already knew the formula for a mean and
if you didn't know it already it's
alright it's easy to remember remember
it's just the sum of the scores divided
by the number of scores so sum of X
divided by n this formula is Justin just
as important to know you should know
this off the top of your head the
formula for standard deviation and for
variance it's very similar it's just now
we're gonna get the sum of deviation
scores squared that's known as the sum
of squared deviation scores or for short
sum of squares and divide that by n and
I'll walk you through the math so you
get familiar with this because this is a
really important concept going forward
in statistics it's knowing how to
calculate standard deviation and
variance and understanding them
conceptually okay so this is new to you
please spend a lot of time reviewing
this segment so that you get this this
the math down and you get the concept
down and just a word about variance
before I dive into the math and an
example is sometimes especially in
psychology and sometimes in sociology or
in political science variance gets a bad
rap so like I study individual
differences in intelligence for example
and a lot of times people think oh well
it's so horrible
this this child is scored so so poorly
on this intelligence test or so on but
it's always important in statistics to
remember that variation is natural and
it's good it's information in statistics
so look at variants with a very positive
view if you can because it's it's as I
said it's natural and the way to think
of it in statistics is variance is
information it's going to allow for us
to investigate covariance and
correlation and so on so and if you
don't if you don't trust me or if I'm
not convincing who enough that variance
is natural and variance is good check
out a guy named Darwin he thought it was
pretty good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
