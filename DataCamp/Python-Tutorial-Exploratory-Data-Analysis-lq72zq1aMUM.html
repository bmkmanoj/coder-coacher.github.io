use exploratory data analysis to help
identify data that need further
investigation the most basic analysis we
can do is count the unique values in our
data we can use the info method to get
the data type of each column here I will
show you the frequency counts for the
non numeric continent country and
fertility columns and the numeric
population column the performer
frequency count we first select the
column we want to perform a frequency
count on if the column name does not
contain any special characters spaces
and is not a name of a Python function
we can select the column directly by its
name using dot notation it works the
same way as subsetting using bracket
notation once we have the column
selected we can use the value counts
method on the selected column I like to
use the drop na equals false parameter
since it will also count the number of
missing values if there are any the
continent column does not have a missing
value so num will be reported value
counts will print out that counts for
each unique value of a column in
descending order note that even though
we counted a column of the object D type
the results of value counts will be of
the type int another way we can select
columns is using the bracket notation
here is the same code and output as
before this time using bracket notation
to select a column now we will count the
number of observations for each country
in our data since there are too many
countries to show at once I'm using the
head method to only return the top five
counts in this example I'm chaining
together methods I'm slicing and getting
the value counts just like before
we expect each country to have only one
observation but Sweden has two this will
require us to investigate this data
point further the fertility column is
the column we expected to be numeric but
stored as a string
this is because we have a string named
missing in the column this is why the
fertility column has the wrong D type it
also alerts us that we need to recode
the missing string if your column has
missing values they will also be counted
provided you pass the drop na equals
false parameter here you see we have 42
missing values in the column
another type of EDA we can do is
calculate summary statistics on numeric
columns this can help spot outliers in
our data there are many working
definitions for outliers one definition
is a value that is considerably higher
or lower than the rest of the data you
can consult the data can statistics
course for more detailed definitions of
outliers outliers are observations of
interest we want to investigate further
for data cleaning we can quickly
calculate summary statistics on our data
by using the describe method only the
columns that have a numerical type will
be returned describe returns a number of
non missing values the mean standard
deviation minimum 25th 50th and 75th
percentiles of our data where the 50th
percentile is the median and finally the
maximum value of our data a quick scan
down the population results show that
the maximum population value is 2.3
billion people our data comes from 2012
no country had this population then now
it's your turn to calculate descriptive
statistics for exploratory data analysis
to see what needs cleaning in your data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
