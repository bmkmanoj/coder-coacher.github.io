academic and professional workers turn
to our is because of its very strong
graphical capabilities walking away from
graphical point-and-click programs such
as Excel and Sigma plot can be quite
scary but you'll soon see that are as
much more to offer the big difference is
that you can create plots with lines of
our codes you can thus perfectly
replicate and modify plots inside our
this IDE nicely fits into the spirit of
repres ability the graphics package that
is loaded by default and our already
provides quite some functionality to
create beautiful publication quality
plots of course throughout time also a
bunch of our packages have been
developed to create visualizations
differently or to build visualizations
and very specific fields of study
examples of very popular packages are
ggplot2 GG vis and lattice but I won't
talk about those here among many others
the graphics package contains two
functions that I'll talk about plot and
hist I'll start with the plot function
first this function is very generic
meaning that it can plot many different
things depending on the type of data
that you give it plots will generate
different plots typically you'll want to
plot one or two columns from a data
frame but you can also plot linear
models kernel density estimates and many
more suppose we have a data frame
countries containing information on all
of the countries in the world there is
of course the name of the country but
also the area the continent it belongs
to and other information such as
population and religion if you have a
look at the structure of this data frame
you can see that there are numerical
variables characters but also
categorical variables such as continents
and religion how it plot handle these
different data types let's find out
let's try to plot a continent column of
countries we do the selection using the
dollar sign cool it looks like our
figured out that the continent is a
factor and that you're probably want a
bar chart containing the number of
countries there are in each continents
also automatically assigned labels to
the different bars now what if you
decide to plot a continuous variable
such as a population
this time the populations of the
countries are shown as an indexed plot
the first country corresponds to the
next one or the population of the
fiftieth observation in the data frame
corresponds to the index 50 of course
it's also possible to plot two
continuous variables such as area versus
population result is a scatter plot
showing a dots for each country there
are some huge countries with many people
living there but also many smaller
countries with also less people it makes
perfect sense that area and population
are somewhat related right to make this
relationship more clear we can apply the
logarithm function on both of the area
and population vectors you can use the
log function twice here looks much
better already
when you try to plot two categorical
variables or handles it differently for
every continent now a stacked bar chart
of the different religions is depicted
on the right you conveniently see the
axis showing the proportions of each
religion in each continents if you
switch the two variables inside the plot
function for every religion a stacked
bar chart of the different continents is
depicted this means that the first
element in the plot function is a
variable on the horizontal axis the x
axis while the second element is the
element on the vertical axis the y axis
all these examples show that the plot
function is very capable at visualizing
different kinds of information and
manages to display this information in a
way that is easy to interpret to better
understand your numerical data it's
often a good idea to have a look at its
distribution you can do this with the
his function which is short for
histogram basically a histogram is a
visual representation of the
distribution of your data sets by
placing all of the values in bins and
plotting how many values there are in
each bin say we want to get a first
impression on a population in all of
Africa's countries with a logical vector
Africa ops we can perform a selection on
the countries data frame to create a sub
data frame that contains
only African countries now we can call
the his function on the population
column of Africa
it appears that around 40 African
countries have less than 10 million
inhabitants that there are only a few
with more than 20 million inhabitants
our has chosen a number of Bin's 6 in
this case itself if you like a more
detailed representation you can increase
the number of pins in a histogram for
example 210 by setting the breaks
argument
it appears that still more than 25
countries have a population under 5
million people apart from the breaks
arguments there are many more options
you can specify in a histone if you are
curious you can already check out the
documentation for these apart from plots
and histograms there are so much more
things you can do in R you can create
bar plots with the bar plot function box
plots with a box plot function and even
create a bunch of plots altogether with
functions such as spares but let's stick
to the plot and his function for now
head over to the exercises and
experience the magic of creating graphs
in R yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
