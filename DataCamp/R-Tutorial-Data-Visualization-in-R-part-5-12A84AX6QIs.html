on developing and refining plots in an
interactive our session using base our
graphics functions these functions are
unusual in our in that they are called
for their side effects they generate
plots but typically don't return a value
some are graphics functions however do
return values that can be used in
subsequent calls to low level graphics
functions to enhance the plot these
functions typically return results
invisibly meaning that the return values
are not displayed but they can be
captured with an assignment statement a
specific example is the bar plot
function whose primary side effect is
the creation of the desired bar plot but
which also returns a numerical vector
and giving the values of the centres of
each bar in this plot here we have
created a horizontal bar plot that shows
the frequencies of each value of the
shelf variable from the US serial data
frame in the mass package the return
value is captured in the vector mids
shown here we can then use this vector
with the text function to place labels
here the numerical shelf values in the
center of each bar one reason we have
focused primarily on plots like bar
plots and scatter plots that involve one
or two variables is that representing
relationships between three or more
variables is harder even so base our
graphics does provide functions that
allow us to generate plots involving
more than two variables one example is
the symbols function used here this
function generates extended scatter
plots where the size and shape of the
points can be determined by other
variables in this example the x and y
positions of the points are determined
by the variable sugars and calories from
the US cereal data frame by specifying
squares equals u.s. cereal dollar shelf
we are representing
each data point by a square whose size
is determined by the shelf variable also
the argument BG is being used here to
specify that the background color of
each symbol is also determined by the
shelf variable the symbols function
offers great flexibility in representing
multiple variables but it is important
in using this flexibility to be certain
that the resulting plots are not too
complicated for us to interpret
especially if we plan to share them with
others finally it is important to note
that plots generated in an interactive
our session are inherently volatile
disappearing when our session ends
unless we do something to save them in
external files one of the simplest ways
of saving graphical results is to write
them to PNG files using the PNG function
as shown in this example these files
have the advantage that they can be
shared as email attachments or embedded
into documents or presentations
developed using many different software
environments now it's your turn the
following exercises ask you to use each
of the functions described here to see
what you can do with them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
