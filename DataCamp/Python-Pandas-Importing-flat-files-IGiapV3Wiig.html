bunch of different types of flat files
into Python as numpy arrays although
arrays are incredibly powerful and serve
a number of essential purposes they
cannot fulfill one of the most basic
needs of a data scientist to have
2-dimensional labelled data structures
with columns of potentially different
types that you can easily perform a
plethora of data science e type things
on manipulate slice reshape group by
join merge perform statistics in a
missing value friendly manner deal with
time series the need for such a data
structure among other issues prompted
where's mckinney to develop the pandas
library for python nothing speaks of the
project of pandas more than the
documentation itself python has long
been great for data munging and
preparation but less so for data
analysis and modeling pandas helps fill
this gap enabling you to carry out your
entire data analysis workflow in python
without having to switch to a more
domain-specific language like r the data
structure most relevant to the data
manipulation and analysis workflow that
pandas offers is the data frame and it
is the pythonic analogue of ours data
frame as Hadley Wickham tweeted a matrix
has rows and columns a data frame has
observations and variables manipulating
data frames in pandas can be useful in
all steps of the data scientific method
from exploratory data analysis to data
wrangling pre-processing
building models and visualization here
we will see as great utility in
importing flat files even merely in the
way that it deals with missing data
comments along with many other issues
that plague working data scientists
today for all of these reasons it is now
standard and best practice in data
science to use pandas to import flat
files of as data frames later in this
course we'll see how many other types of
data whether they're stored in a relay
databases hdf5 MATLAB or Excel files can
easily be imported as data frames to use
pandas you first need to import it then
if we wish to import a CSV in the most
basic case all we need to do is to call
the function read CSV and supply it with
a single argument the name of the file
having assigned the data frame to the
variable data we can check the first
five rows of the data frame including
the header with the command data dot
head we can also easily convert the data
frame to a numpy array by calling the
data frame attribute values now it's
your turn to play around importing flat
files using Python you'll get experience
importing a flat file that is
straightforward and you'll also get
experience importing a flat file that
has a few issues such as one that
contains comments and strings that
should be interpreted as missing values
have fun importing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
