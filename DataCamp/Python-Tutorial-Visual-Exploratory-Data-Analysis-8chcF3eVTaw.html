spot outliers and obvious errors in our
data data visualization is more than
just looking at patterns and reporting
data they can also be an effective way
to spot outliers and plan your data
cleaning pipeline here's the tabular
form of summary statistics for a clean
European Environment Agency data set you
can imagine how overwhelming the results
can be on a data set with many more
columns this is why it's important to
visualize our data because abnormal data
points such as the max population would
immediately stand out we use bar plots
to count discrete data and histograms to
count continuous data these plots will
give us the ability to look at
frequencies of our data which can be
used to look for potential errors here's
an example of a histogram we take the
data frame and column of interest and
call the plot method we pass hist
antenna method to have pandas create a
histogram we have to make sure
matplotlib is loaded before we can show
the plot here is our histogram the
x-axis shows the range of values that
are counted and a y-axis is how many
observations in our data are in a
particular range of values our histogram
shows two observations between 1 and 1.5
billion and one observation above two
billion this dataset counts for 2012 at
the time it was impossible for a country
to have over two billion people we can
slice our data to look for all data
points where the population is greater
than 1 billion people we use bracket
notation to slice our data and inside we
specify the condition we are interested
in countries with populations greater
than 1 billion people our dataset
reports Australia having 2.3 billion
people this is a data error China and
India are also outliers in our data but
those values are correct these countries
are actual outliers not all outliers are
bad data points some can be an error but
others are valid valid
let's see what this dataset looks like
in other visualizations box plots are a
good way to visualize all the basic
summary statistics into a single figure
that we can use to quickly compare
across multiple categories you can see
the data camp statistics courses for
more information we can spot outliers
the min/max of our data the 25th 50th
and 75th percentiles of our data
recreate box plots by calling the box
plot method on the data frame to plot
just the population column we pass it in
to the column parameter we pass the by
parameter the column name we want to
compare box plots across here I want a
separate box plot for each continent in
our data remember to show the plot
here's the box plot of our population
column most of our data is represented
by the box the lines I extend from the
box are called whiskers the ends of the
whiskers show the maximum a minimum of
our data excluding outliers any outliers
our values shown beyond the whiskers you
can see the three massive outliers of
our data one of which we know is bad
data
the other two are actual outliers
scatter plots are used to look at
relationships between two numeric
columns in the exercises you will use
such methods to flag potentially bad
data it will also use scatter plots to
identify candidates for bad data which
you will normally not see when plotting
histograms or block spots such as
countries with low literacy and low
fertility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
