mathematical operations between pandas
series and data frames we load daily
weather measurements for Pittsburgh from
2013 we make date the index and we use
par States equals true to get date/time
objects with date/time indexes we can
use convenient strings to slice say the
first week of July from the
precipitation in column the
precipitation data are in inches let's
convert them to centimeters we use the
asterisk to multiply or series
element-wise by 2.5 for remember we can
broadcast standards scalar mathematical
operations here broadcasting means the
multiplication is applied to all
elements in the data frame let's find
the percentage variation in temperature
in the first week of July that is the
daily minimum and the daily maximum
temperatures expressed as a percentage
of the daily mean friend temperature we
can compute this by dividing both the
min temperature F and the max
temperature F columns by the mean
temperature F column and multiplying
both by 100 to begin slice the min
temperature F and the max temperature F
columns as a data frame week one range
next slice the mean temperature F column
as a series week one mean dividing the
data frame week one range by the series
week one mean doesn't quite work the
column labels don't match so the result
has all Mel values instead we want to
use the data frame divide method with
the option access equals rows the divide
method provides more fine-grained
control than the slash operator for
division itself this broadcasts the
series week one mean across each row to
produce the desired ratios we can see
the temperature range varies by it most
about 10% from the mean in that week
a related computation is to compute a
percentage change along a time series we
do this by subtracting the previous
day's value from the current day's value
and dividing by the previous day's value
the percent change method does precisely
this computation for us here we also
multiply the resulting series by 100 to
yield a percentage value notice the
value in the first row is Man because
there is no previous entry finally let's
examine how arithmetic operations work
between distinct series or data frames
with non-aligned indexes which happens
often in practice we'll use Olympic
medal data from 1896 to 2008 here is the
top 5 bronze medal winning countries the
top 5 silver medal winning countries and
the top 5 gold medal winning countries
for that period all three data frames
have the same indices for the first
three rows United States Soviet Union
and United Kingdom by contrast the next
two rows are either France Germany or
Italy let's compute the total medals
awarded to each country we start by
adding bronze and silver here we add two
series of five rows and get back a
series with six rows the index of the
sum is the union of the row indices from
the original two series arithmetic
operation between pandas series are
carried out four rows with common index
values since Germany does not appear in
silver and Italy does not appear in
bronze those rows have man in the sum on
examination we see the value 2247 for
the United States Row is the sum of 1052
and 1195 from the corresponding rows of
the bronze and silver series
respectively we can get the same sum
bronze plus silver with a method
invocation using bronze add silver the
null values occur in the same places the
default field value is Man when summoned
rows fail to align we can modify this
behavior using the fill value option of
the add method by specifying fill value
equals zero the values of Germany and
Italy are no longer null just as the
divide method is more flexible than the
slash operator for division the add
method is more flexible than the plus
operator for
addition adding all three series
together yield six rows of output but
only three have non null values that is
France Germany and Italy are not indexed
labels in all three series so each of
those rows is man in the sum we can also
change calls to the dot add method with
fill value equals zero to get rid of
those null values in the triple sum now
you can get some experience with
standard arithmetic operations and
methods for series and data frames in
the exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
