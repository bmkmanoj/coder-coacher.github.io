process is exploring your raw data we
can think of data exploration itself as
a three-step process consisting of
understanding the structure of your data
looking at your data and visualizing
your data so to understand the structure
of your data you have several tools at
your disposal and our here we read in a
simple data set called lunch which
contains information on the number of
free reduced-price and full price school
lunches served in the u.s. from 1969
through 2014 first we check the class of
the lunch object to verify that it is in
fact the data frame or a two-dimensional
table consisting of rows and columns of
which each column is a single data type
such as numeric character etc we then
view the dimensions of the data set with
the DIMM function this particular data
set has 46 rows and 7 columns dim always
displays the number of rows first
followed by the number of columns next
we take a look at the column names of
lunch with the names function each of
the seven columns has a name year
average free average reduced and so on
okay so we're starting to get a feel for
things but let's dig a little deeper the
STR function for structure is one of the
most versatile and useful functions in
the our language because it can be
called on any object and will normally
provide a useful and compact summary of
its internal structure when passed a
data frame as in this case STR tells us
how many rows and columns we have
actually the function refers to rows as
observations and columns as variables
which strictly speaking is true in a
tidy data set but not always the case as
you'll see in the next chapter
in addition you see the name of each
column followed by its data type and a
preview of the data contained in it the
lunch data set happens to be entirely
integers in numerix we'll have a closer
look at these data types in chapter 3
the dir package offers a slightly
different flavor of STR called glimpse
which offers the same information but
attempts to preview as much of each
column as will fit neatly on your screen
so here we first load dir with the
library command then call glimpse with a
single argument lunch another extremely
helpful function is summary which when
applied to a data frame provides a
useful summary of each column since the
lunch data are entirely integers in
numerix we see a summary of the
distribution of each column including
the minimum and maximum the mean the
25th 50th and 75th percentiles also
referred to as the first quartile the
median and the third quartile
respectively as you'll soon see when
faced with character or factor variables
summary will produce different summaries
to review you've seen how you can use
the class function to see the class of a
data set the DIMM function to view its
dimensions names to see the column names
STR to view its structure and glimpse to
do the same but in a slightly enhanced
format and summary to see a helpful
summary of each column it's time to
practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
