previous video and the ones you've
created yourself in interactive
exercises look quite nice but there are
certainly more things we can do to make
the plots fancier and more informative
what about setting a title or specifying
the labels of the axes all of this is
possible from inside are throughout our
experiments we will be using the mercury
data frame that lists pressure versus
temperature measurements of mercury
it contains two variables temperature
and pressure let's start with a simple
plot we can clearly see that the
pressure rises dramatically once the
temperature exceeds 200 degrees Celsius
but this plot is still kind of dull
isn't it have a look at this code that
specifies a bunch of arguments inside
the plot function result looks like this
can you tell which arguments led to
which changes in the plot x lab and Y
lap change the horizontal and vertical
axis labels respectively while main
specify the plot title if you set the
type arguments to oh you will have both
points and line through these points on
your plot if you only want a line you
can use type is L which looks like this
finally the call argument specifies the
plot color
most of the arguments that are used here
such as X lab Y lab main and type are
specified in the documentation of the
plot function however the plot function
also allows you to set a bunch of other
graphical parameters an example of such
a graphical parameter is called which
specifies the color but there are also
many others you can specify these
graphical parameters straight inside the
plot function as you did with coal in
this case here the graphical parameter
only has an effect on this specific
graph if you now plot the same graph
without the call arguments the green
color is not there anymore
you can also inspect and control these
same graphical parameters with the bar
function type in question mark bar opens
up its documentation with information on
all the parameters that you can specify
simply calling bar gives you the actual
values of these parameters you can also
use bar with arguments specify session
wide graphical parameters suppose you
set a color to blue using the bar
function and now create a plot of course
it's blue if you next create another
plots the plot is still blue
that's because parameters specified with
bar are maintained for different
plotting operations if you list all
graphical parameters again and select
the call elements you'll see that indeed
it's still set to blue for the rest of
this video let me focus on some of the
most important graphical parameters I'll
do this by adding arguments to the plot
function instead of using the bar
function for this you already know the
first five graphical parameters similar
to the call arguments the call dots main
arguments specifies the color of the
main title there are also other called
dot arguments to set the color of other
elements in your plot next the C X dot
excess arguments specifies with which
ratio the original font size of the XS
tick mark should be multiplied with C X
dot X is equal to 0.6 we have small
labels with C X dot X is equal to 1.5
the labels become huge just as the
culper ammeter
as call dots variants for other elements
in the plots to see x-parameters also
has its CX dot variants the lty
arguments specifies the line type a line
type of one is a full line and the types
2 to 6 are all different types of lines
like you can see here last but not least
we have the PCH arguments which
specifies a plot symbol for the points
here plotting there are more than 35
different symbols for plotting going
from pluses and small octagonal to stars
and hashtags like I said all of these
arguments are just the tip of the
iceberg one of ours main powers is
visualization and this is clear from the
numerous ways in which you can make your
plots ready for report just make sure
you don't overdo things interpretability
should be the main goal at all times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
