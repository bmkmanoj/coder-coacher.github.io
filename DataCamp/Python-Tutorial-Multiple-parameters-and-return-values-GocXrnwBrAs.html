defining your own functions good job at
this point you already know how to
define your own functions and even
return values from them what you'll
learn next is how to pass multiple
arguments to functions as well as return
not just one but multiple values from
them let's tweak the square function
we've been working on a little bit more
suppose that instead of simply squaring
a value we'd like to raise a value to
the power of another value that's also
passed to the function we can do this by
having our function accept two
parameters instead of just one
you should also change your function
name and docstrings
to reflect this new behavior raised to
power is in an appropriate function name
notice that there are now two parameters
in the function header instead of just
one value 1 and value 2 in the lines
after that the behavior of the overall
function was also changed by raising
value 1 ^ value 2 you can call the
function by passing in two arguments
because the function has two parameters
as declared in the function header the
order in which the arguments are passed
correspond to the order of parameters in
the function header this means that when
we call raised to power 2/3 when the
function is executed 2 would be assigned
to value 1 and 3 to value 2 looking at
the function body this means that the
computation value 1 ^ value 2 translates
to 2 to the power of 3 this function
call then returns the value 8 you can
also make your function return multiple
values you can do that by constructing
objects known as tuples in your
functions a tuple is like a list in that
it can contain multiple values there are
some differences however firstly unlike
a list a tuple is immutable that is you
cannot modify the values in a tuple once
it has been constructed secondly while
lists are defined using square brackets
tuples are constructed using a set of
parentheses
here we construct a tuple containing
three elements you can also unpack a
tuple into several variables in one line
doing so means that you assign to the
variables a B and C the tuple values in
the order that they appear in the tuple
additionally you can also access
individual tuple elements like you do
with lists doing this here accesses the
second element of the tuple for example
why is that recall that with lists you
can use zero indexing to access list
elements you can do the same thing with
tuples pretty cool right
let's now modify the behavior of your
function rates instead of returning just
a value of value one raised to the power
of value two let's also return the value
of value two raised to the power of
value one you thus need to make raised
return two values instead of one we can
now use what we know of tuples to do
this we first change the name of our
function and the docstrings
to reflect the new behavior of our
function we then in the function body
construct a tuple consisting of the
values we want the function to return
and also in the function body we return
the tuple calling the function
constructed demonstrates that it does
exactly what we want now it's your turn
to play with writing functions that
accept multiple arguments and return
multiple values enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
