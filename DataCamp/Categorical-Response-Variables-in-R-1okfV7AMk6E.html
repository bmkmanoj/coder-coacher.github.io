effect sizes an effect size is a number
that summarizes how the output of a
model changes when we change the input
when we're looking at the effect of a
quantitative input X on the output Y the
effect size is a rate and has units of Y
divided by X but for an effect size
involving a categorical input on an
output Y the effect size is a difference
and has the same units as Y what happens
when the response variable is
categorical that is when the output is
one of a set of named levels instead of
a number this is more than a technical
question it goes to the heart of what
should be the output of a model function
for a categorical response variable it
turns out that providing a category as
output while natural is very limited
better to give a number or set of
numbers the probabilities according to
the model of the class of interest or of
all the classes as an example consider a
model of the categorical variable
married as a function of explanatory
variables like age education and sex as
always we need to have a model from
which to calculate the effect size we'll
compare the model output for two
different ages as you can see the output
is the same for both ages does this mean
that the effect size of aged unmarried
is zero no effect of age not really
changes in categorical outputs are all
or nothing either a change or no change
at all it's as if we were tracking one
individuals over the years no change
this year no change this year still no
change
finally a change but our models are
really about groups for any individual
marriage is all or nothing but four
groups we can talk about the probability
of an individual being married many
model architectures for categorical
outputs do calculate the probability of
each possible level of the output
