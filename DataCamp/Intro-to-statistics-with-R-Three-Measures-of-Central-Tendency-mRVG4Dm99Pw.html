measure of central tendency that's just
a measure or a summary statistic that
describes the middle point or is
representative of the middle point of a
distribution so it should be
representative of the distribution as a
whole of course we can't describe the
whole distribution with one number right
this is just what statisticians call a
point estimate but it should do a pretty
good job it should be representative the
most common examples of measures of
central tendency and statistics are the
mean the median in the mode so the mean
we saw is just sum up all the scores
divided by the number of scores it's the
mean or the average the median is just
the middle score in a distribution so if
I just lined up all of the rankings all
of the ratings on the wines from the
highest ranking to the lowest ranking
and just plucked out the middle ranking
say the 50th ranking out of the 100 that
would be my median ranking and the mode
is easy that's just the score that
occurs most often in the distribution
and if now that you've seen histograms
you know how to plot histograms it's
real easy to see just look for the peak
of the histogram and that's the mode so
the mean or the average is by far the
most common measure of central tendency
used into statistics it's the one we're
going to rely on the most in this course
in any intro stats course that's the one
that you're going to rely on the most so
for example the red red wine ratings
another classic example is just your
grade point average and those are the
the mean is the best when you have a
normal distribution if you don't have a
normal distribution in particular if you
have a distribution with really extreme
scores so an extreme positive skew or an
extreme negative skew then you might
rather go with the median rather than
the mean and that's because those few
extreme score
can really bias the mean whereas the
median if you just line the scores up
and take the middle one those extreme
scores are not going to bias the median
as much as they're going to bias the
mean so we can look at the white wine
ratings as an example of that but those
weren't that skewed so we'll look at
them so you won't see a big difference
between the mean and median you'll see a
slight difference another example is a
classic example right now in in the US
and and lots of modern countries right
now is household income so household
income particularly in the US right now
particularly in Brazil right now is
really not normally distributed so
there's a real positive skew in in the
income distributions in the US and in
other countries as well and we'll take a
look at that as well so you'll often see
reported it in the news or if you're
reading stuff on the internet you'll
often hear median salary or median
household income reported rather than
mean salary or average salary or average
household income and that's because
those distributions are skewed here's a
more detailed graphic again this one I
just took off the internet
this is a histogram of household income
in the United States it shows this
really extremely positively skewed
distribution okay here you're going to
see a large difference between measures
of central tendency like the mean the
median and the mode okay so if I just
took the average of all of these incomes
we're gonna have to average in these
extremely high incomes way up here which
are this isn't even that high the graph
actually extends way beyond that to
include people like Bill Gates and Mark
Zuckerberg and so on right if I include
their salaries in the mean the mean is
really going to be inflated in contrast
if I just take the median the middle
score that's going to be
right here no matter whether I include
Mark Zuckerberg Bill Gates people like
that in my distribution or not the
median is still gonna fall right here
it's at about forty nine thousand four
hundred forty five dollars and if you
look at this the mode is actually right
about here that's way down between like
it's a fifteen and twenty thousand okay
so when you have this extremely skewed
distribution like this like US household
income right now over the last few years
in particular you're going to get a real
difference between the mean the median
and the mode because it's hard to find a
measure of central tendency that's
representative of the entire group
right that's part of the problem I'm not
going to get into a political discussion
about this it's just a good example to
illustrate a non-normal distribution and
how measures of central tendency can
really differ when you have non-normal
distributions if it was perfectly normal
than the mean and the median and the
mode would be just about the same so
finally the mode is just the peak of a
histogram it's just the score that
occurs most often so the Argentine white
wine distribution and that was a real
easy one to look at the peak remember
because it was it was leptokurtic it had
that really strong peak if you look back
at the graph it was right around 70 to
72 it was also about the average because
it didn't have really extreme rankings
on the negative end or on the positive
end a thing about the mode is it can
also be applied to nominal variables
that's not true of the mean or the
median right but we can apply it to
nominal variables so what I did for fun
is I just took these countries that
we've been playing with the US France
Argentina Australia and I just said well
in the last year what are the most
common or what are the modal baby names
these
really surprised me I don't know if my
source is accurate but in the in the US
the most common female baby name in the
last year is Sophia most common male
named James in France it's Emma and
Nathan in Argentina it's Sophia and Juan
and in Australia it's Charlotte and
Oliver those are the modal baby names
they're the ones that occur most often
it's only the mode that we can apply to
nominal variables we can't apply the
average for example to nominal variables
or the median to nominal variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
