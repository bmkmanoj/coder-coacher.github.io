commands in our let's get a bit more
technical into exactly what types of
data you have been manipulating there
are a number of basic atomic data types
in our here are the most common ones
numeric data are decimal numbers like
42.5 numeric data could be a stock price
cash flow or income a special type of
numeric data is integers integers are
whole numbers that do not have a decimal
place by default whole numbers like 5
are stored as numeric data unless you
specifically tell are that you wanted to
store 5 as an integer to do this at a
capital L after the number you will
almost always use numerix over integers
in R so this default behavior is nothing
to worry about characters also called
strings are the text values such as
hello world or 40 character data could
be a sequence of names or categories for
your data or even credit ratings for
bonds no two quotation marks telling are
that you are giving it character data
even numbers can be stored as character
data if you put it in quotation marks
and finally logicals
are the so-called boolean values of true
and false all requires that true and
false are capitalized so this would
cause an error technically an a to
denote a missing value is also a logical
but we won't go too deep into that here
so far you have stored numeric data in
variables but you could have just as
easily stored logical or character data
in a variable as well here the logical
true is assigned to my underscore answer
and the word carats is assigned to food
given a variable you can use R to
determine what data type it is using
class using class on my underscore
answer returns logical telling you that
the my answer variable contains a
logical data type class is what is known
as a function you will see a number of
useful functions throughout the course
but for now you can think of them as a
black box where you pass in some kind of
input the function calculates some value
and presents it to you as output you can
you
class to see the difference in type
between a numeric and integer version of
five let's find out what you learned
head over to the next exercise to try
out your knowledge of data types</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
