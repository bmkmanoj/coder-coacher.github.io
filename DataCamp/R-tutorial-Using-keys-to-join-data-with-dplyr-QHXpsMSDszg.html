how to join datasets of deep wire at a
very basic level a joint combines two
datasets by adding the columns of one
data set alongside the columns of the
other usually some rows of the second
data set belong with specific rows in
the first data set for example you can
see here that the first row of plays
belongs with the second row of names
because they both provide information
about John you can also see that the
second row of plays belongs with the
third row of names because they both
provide information about Paul the job
of the join is to find rows that match
and to make sure that they are placed
into the same row in the final data
table your job is to give join the
information that it needs to do this
task and you do that by identifying a
pair of keys that connect the tables a
key is a column or combination of
columns that occurs in each of the
tables that you want to join d Peyer
completes the join by matching rows that
have the same values of the key so for
example here name is our key and D
player will be able to use it to match
up the two rows about John and the two
rows about Paul when the key appears in
your first table is called a primary key
because deep i/o treats the first table
as your primary table when the key
appears in the second table is called a
secondary key or a foreign key this
distinction is important because the key
has a special job in the primary table
the primary key should uniquely identify
each row in the first data set if it
doesn't results become hard to
understand
in contrast the foreign key only has to
correspond with the primary key it is a
it is acceptable for a valued be
duplicated or to even not appear at all
in the foreign key you can use this
principle to identify cases where your
key involves multiple variables for
example they might seem like a logical
key for these two data sets but if you
look closely you will notice that name
does not uniquely identified the rows in
the primary data set we have two John's
here our key is the combination of name
and surname d pliers should match
together rows that have the same
combinations of these values in other
data sets you might find that your key
involves 3 4 or even more variables the
next few exercises will give you a
chance to practice
spotting keys before we begin joining
