be talking about the matrix as before
I'll take you through all the basics you
need to know about this new data
structure so what's a matrix well a
matrix is kind of like the big brother
of the vector where a factor is a
sequence of data elements which is one
dimensional a matrix is a similar
collection of data elements but this
time arranged into a fixed number of
rows and columns since you're only
working with rows and columns a matrix
is called two-dimensional as with the
vector the matrix can contain only one
atomic vector type this means that you
can't have logicals and numerix and
matrix for example there's really not
much more theory about matrices than
this it's really a natural extension of
the vector going from one to two
dimensions of course this has its
implications for manipulating and
subsetting matrices but let's start with
simply creating and naming them to build
a matrix you use the matrix function
most importantly it needs a vector
containing the values you want to place
in a matrix and at least one matrix
dimension you can choose to specify the
number of rows or the number of columns
have a look at this example
that creates a 2 by 3 matrix containing
the values 1 to 6 by specifying the
vector and setting the N row argument 2
to our sees that the input vector has
length 6 and that there have to be two
rows it then infers that you'll probably
want treat columns such that the number
of matrix elements matches the number of
input vector elements you get just as
well specify and Gault instead of n row
in this case are in first a number of
rows automatically in both these
examples are takes the vector containing
the values 1 to 6 and fills it up column
by column if you prefer to fill up the
matrix in a row eyes fashion such that
the 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 are in the first row you can
set the by row argument of matrix to
true can you spot the difference
remember how our did recycling when you
were subsetting vectors using logical
vectors the same thing happens when you
passed a matrix function to a vector
that is too short to fill up the entire
matrix suppose your passive vector
containing the values 1 2 3 2 the matrix
function and explicitly say you want a
matrix with two rows and three columns
are fills up the matrix column by column
and simply repeats the vector if you try
to fill up the matrix with a vector
whose multiple does not nicely fit in a
matrix for example when you want to put
the four element vector in a six element
matrix R generates a warning message
actually apart from the matrix function
there's yet another easy way to create
matrices that is more intuitive in some
cases you can based vectors together
using the C binds and our bind functions
have a look at these calls C binds short
for columbines
takes the vectors you pass it and sticks
them together as if they were columns of
a matrix
the R bind function short for row binds
just the same thing but takes the input
as rows and makes a matrix out of them
these functions can come in pretty handy
because they're often more easy to use
than the matrix function the bind
functions I just introduced can also
handle matrices actually so you can
easily use them to paste another row or
another column to an already existing
matrix suppose you have a matrix M
containing the elements 1 2 6 if you
want to add another row to its
containing the value 7 8 &amp;amp; 9
you could simply run this command you
can do a similar thing with C binds
next up is naming the matrix in the case
of vectors you simply use the names
function but in the case of matrices you
could assign names to both columns and
rows that's why our came up with the row
names and call names functions their use
is pretty straightforward we're taking
the matrix M from before you can set a
row names just the same way as we named
factors but this time with a row names
function printing M show that its words
setting the column names with a vector
of length 3 gives us a fully named
matrix just as with vectors there are
also one-liner ways of naming matrices
while you're building them you use the
dim names argument of the matrix
function for this check this out
you need to specify a list which has a
vector of row names as a first element
and a vector of column names as the
second element don't panic if you've
never seen this list function before
you'll learn all about that later on as
I explained in the beginning of this
video
matrices are just an extension of
vectors this means that they can only
contain a single atomic vector type if
you try to start different types in a
matrix conversion automatically takes
place have a look at these two matrices
one containing numerix the other one
containing characters let's now try to
bind these two matrices together in a
column wise fashion using c binds did
you see what happens the numeric matrix
elements were coerced two characters to
end up with a matrix that is only
comprised of characters to have a
multi-dimensional data structure that
can contain different elements you'll
have to use lists or more specifically
data frames up to you now to become a
Jedi in the world of matrices enjoy it
