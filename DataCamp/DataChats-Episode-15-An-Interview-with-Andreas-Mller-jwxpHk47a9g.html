Massachusetts
we've just finished filming introduction
for supervised learning with circuit one
of course I'm Hugo von Anderson data
science the data scientists with data
camp and animal work I'm a machine
learning scientist and Cochrane Jupiter
2 so I could learn maybe you can tell us
what what you do Andy well right now I
work at Columbia teaching data sign and
a pike machine learning and yes I love
my time after working on the cycler and
machine learning projects which is like
an open source project which was a
really big community and I'm one of the
people that manages sort of the project
and can you tell us a bit about the
philosophy behind behind the project
yeah it's a lot about usability and ease
of use the idea is really to democratize
the excess to machine learning tools
absolutely and you mentioned that you're
you're now at columbia teaching data
science maybe you can tell us a bit
about what you think data science is
what it is in whether it's a vague term
or not oh it's definitely in vague term
and meet a lot of different things for a
lot of different people so I'm
definitely more on a machine learning
end but there are people that do like
dica bases and cosmic all the data signs
or visualization and there's a very
broad term and sort of yeah everybody
has their own definition I think
absolutely you program in Python a great
deal can you talk about pricing in
general on the role of python in data
science oh sure I mean the pricing has
grown a lot in reasonable years in
particular I like with the boom of data
science and I think one of the things
that people like about it is that it's
really easy to pick up the syntax is
pretty simple and there's a whole bunch
of tools like my fat lip and the cycad
learn to help you with your data
absolutely listen some people are the
data scientists or developers in Python
data science world who you admire or
you have dealings with better
interesting there's a lot of people in
like the potato stack that I admire a
lot like Jacob and applause just wrote a
great book introduction to to data
science and Nathaniel Smith who works on
vampire core of the high data stack and
he also created with second line them
all together the new color map for Mac
floodlit at viridis or just pretty cool
yeah
there's a lot of amazing people in the
secrecy yeah that's absolutely true a
lot of our students are coming to have
data science and potentially Python for
the first time and we we always get
questions such as arm
what type of things should I should I be
learning first up as a data scientist so
what are the biggest roadblocks do you
have any advice for aspiring data
scientists it depends a lot on what you
want to do I think it's definitely
important to be fluent at least in one
of the data science languages and I
think at that moment it's our or pison
and so you should really learn to be to
be able to manage your data to
pre-process it to visualize it to build
models on your data quickly and to
iterate quickly that like data signs is
a lot about exploring your data and
trying to understand it yeah so the idea
there wouldn't be to you know try to get
a perfect model or you know get things
down to perfection by kind of rapid push
iterate and push right yes definitely
about a lot of like yeah interaction a
lot of there's like well feedback loops
you try and model you see why fails or
and you can analyze the model and maybe
you go back maybe you need to collect
different NATO more detail you need to
propose that'll definitely so in person
now people use the Drupal notebooks all
the time because they're really great
for this interactive iterative analysis
and also for communicating what what
you're doing is well right as opposed to
scripting you mentioned part of the
philosophy behind scikit-learn is
democratizing machine learning in this
case terms of democratizing data science
techniques and
sis's sometimes it seems difficult
because there's a certain amount that an
understanding of understanding that
needs to take place a lot of people
think that needs a lot of linear algebra
calculus statistics to do this type of
stuff I don't necessarily think that's
the case but maybe you could speak speak
to that into yeah it depends definitely
a lot on what you are trying to achieve
if you want to build predictive model
using sort of off the shelf to shelf
tools like scikit-learn I don't think
you necessarily need to have like a very
strong linear algebra background for
example so in the book that I wrote is
basically no mass and no formulas so
it's trying to give like a programmers
perspective of how you can apply machine
learning if you want to create new kind
of models or very sophisticated models
definitely more background in for
example statistics and probability
theory will help yeah so in terms of all
the different things you work on what's
what's the most difficult thing you you
have to do what's the most difficult
thing after you or frustrating or what
what are the pitfalls of living longer
life as a developer and educator and
well the hardest thing is to prioritize
so I guess that's the main thing and in
yoga cause rules there's always more to
do I literally get a hundred
notifications on github every day and so
if I create some talks or educational
material it means I don't review some
pull requests and I rarely have to end
to write code myself and so it's very
hard to prioritize what are the
important things right and on the other
side what what are the most fun things
or what what gets you jumping out of bed
at 6:00 a.m. in the morning besides
getting a train to Boston I mean I
really actually love coding myself and
trying to come up with nice solution
also really creating tools to help
people solve problems if I know oh I can
make this better and if I could learn if
I make it better and I could learn it
will go out to tens of thousands of
people had use it and like their life
will be better for it
that's what I
excited about fantastic alright this has
been great Andy thank you for her shade
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
