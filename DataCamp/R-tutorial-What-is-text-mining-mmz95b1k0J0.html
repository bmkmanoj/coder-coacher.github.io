intro text mining course let's kick
things off by defining text mining and
quickly covering two text mining
approaches academic text mining
definitions are long but I prefer a more
practical approach
so text mining is simply the process of
distilling actionable insights from text
here we have a satellite image of San
Diego overlaid with social media
pictures and traffic information for the
roads it is simply too much information
to help you navigate around town this is
like a bunch of text that you couldn't
possibly read and organize quickly like
a million tweets or the entire works of
Shakespeare you're just drinking from a
firehose so in this example if you need
directions to get around San Diego you
need to reduce the information in the
map text mining works in the same way
you can text mine a bunch of tweets or
all of Shakespeare to reduce the
information just like this map reducing
the information helps you navigate and
draw out the important features this is
a text mining workflow after defining
your problem statement you transition
from an unorganized state to an
organized state finally reaching an
insight in Chapter four you will use
this in a case study comparing Google
and Amazon the text mining workflow can
be broken into six distinct components
each step is important and helps to
ensure you have a smooth transition from
the ore an organized state to an
organized state this helps you stay
organized and increases your chances of
a meaningful output the first step
involves problem definition this lays
the foundation for your text mining
project next is defining the text you
will use as your data as with any
analytical project it is important to
understand the medium and data integrity
because these can affect outcomes next
you organize the text maybe by author or
chronologically step four is feature
extraction this can be calculating
sentiment or an hour case extracting
word tokens in
various matrices step 5 is to perform
some analysis this course will show you
some basic analytical methods that can
be applied to text lastly step 6 is the
one in which you hopefully answer your
problem questions reach an insight or
conclusion or in the case of predictive
modeling produce an output now let's
learn about two approaches to text
mining the first is semantic parsing
based on words syntax in semantic
parsing you care about word type and
order this method creates a lot of
features to study for example a single
word can be tagged as part of a sentence
then a noun and also a proper noun or
named entity so that single word has
three features associated with it this
effect makes semantic parsing feature
rich to do the tagging semantic parsing
follows a tree structure to continually
break up the text in contrast the bag of
words method doesn't care about word
type or order here words are just
attributes of the document in this
example we parse the sentence Steph
Curry missed a tough shot in the
semantic example you see how the words
are broken down from the sentence to the
noun and verb phrases and ultimately in
two unique attributes bag of words
treats each term as a single token in
the sentence no matter the type or order
for this introductory course will focus
on bag of words but we'll cover more
advanced methods in a later course let's
get a quick taste of text mining</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
