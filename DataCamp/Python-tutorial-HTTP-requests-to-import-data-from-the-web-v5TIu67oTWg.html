data in order to import files from the
web we use the URL retrieve function
from URL Lib requests
let's now unpack this a bit and in the
process understand a few things about
how the internet works URL stands for
Uniform or universal resource locator
and all they really are are references
to web resources the vast majority of
urls are web addresses but they can also
refer to a few other things such as file
transfer protocols ftp and database
access will currently focus on those
urls that our web addresses or the
locations of websites such a URL
consists of two parts a protocol
identifier HTTP or HTTPS and a resource
name such as data capcom the combination
of protocol identifier and resource name
uniquely specifies the web address to
explain URLs i've introduced yet another
acronym HTTP which itself stands for
hypertext Transfer Protocol Wikipedia
provides a great description of HTTP the
hypertext Transfer Protocol is an
application protocol for distributed
collaborative hypermedia information
systems HTTP is the foundation of data
communication for the worldwide web note
that HTTP is a more secure form of HTTP
each time you go to a web site you are
actually sending an HTTP request to a
server this request is known as a get
request by far the most common type of
HTTP request we are actually performing
a get request when using the function
URL retrieve the ingenuity of URL
retrieved also lies in the fact that it
not only makes a get request but also
saves the relevant data locally in the
following you'll learn how to make more
get requests to store web data in your
environment in particular you'll figure
out how to get the HTML data from a web
page HTML stands for hypertext markup
language and is the standard markup
language for the web
to extract the HTML from the Wikipedia
homepage for example you import the
necessary functions specify the URL
package the get request using the
function request send the request and
catch the response using the function
URL open this returns an HTTP response
object which has an Associated read
method you then apply this read method
to the response which returns the HTML
as a string which you store in the
variable HTML finally you remember to be
polite and close the response now we're
going to do the same however here we'll
use the requests package which provides
a wonderful API for making requests
according to the requests package
website requests allows you to send
organic grass-fed HTTP requests without
the need for manual labor and the
following organizations claim to use
requests internally Her Majesty's
Government Amazon Google Twilio NPR
Obama for America Twitter Sony and
federal us institutions that prefer to
be unnamed moreover requests is one of
the most downloaded Python packages of
all time pulling in over 7 million
downloads every month all the cool kids
are doing it let's now see requests at
work here you import the package
requests specify the URL package the
request send the request and catch the
response with a single function requests
get and finally you apply the text
method to the response which returns the
HTML as a string ok that's enough out of
me for the time being let's get you
hacking away at pulling down some HTML
from the web using get requests get
