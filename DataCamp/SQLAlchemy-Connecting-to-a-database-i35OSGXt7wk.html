great tools that we can use when working
with databases one of those is CQ
alchemy that we'll be using throughout
this course sequel alchemy will allow us
to generate sequel queries by writing
Python code you should still consider
learning how to write queries in sequel
as well sequel alchemy has two main
components the part we will be focusing
on is often referred to as the core part
of sequel alchemy it's really focused
around the relational model of the
database additionally there is the
object relational model or ORM part of C
clock main that is really focused around
data models and classes that you as a
programmer create there are many
different types of database and each
database type has its own quirks and
unique capabilities you'll commonly find
sequel Lite Postgres SQL MySQL Microsoft
sequel server and oracle when working
with data sequel alchemy provides a way
to operate across all these database
types in a consistent manner to connect
to a database we need a way to talk to
it and an engine provides that common
interface to create an engine we import
the create engine function from sequel
alchemy we then use the create engine
function and supplied a connection
string that provides the details needed
to connect to a database finally once we
have an engine we're ready to make a
connection using the connect method on
the engine it's worth noting that sequel
alchemy won't actually make the
connection until we give it some work to
execute so to review an engine is the
common interface to the database which
requires a connection string to provide
the details used to find and connect to
the database before we go any further
let's talk a bit more about connection
strings in their simplest form they tell
us what kind of database we are talking
to and how we should access it in this
example you can see that we're using the
sequel database driver and the database
file name census underscore NYC sequel
light which is in the current directory
now that we have an engine and a
connection we need to know what tables
are in the database we'll start again by
importing the create engine function and
creating an engine to our database
finally we can use the table names
method of an engine which returns a list
of tables once we know what table we
want to work on we need a way to access
that table with Python to do that we're
going to use a handy process called
reflection which reads the Bata base and
builds a table object that we can use in
our code we've already created our
engine so we
by importing the metadata and table
objects needed for reflection the
metadata object is a catalogue that
stores database information such as
tables so that we don't have to keep
looking them up to reflect the table we
initialize a metadata object next we use
the sequel alchemy table object and
provide the table name we got earlier
from the table names method we also
supply our metadata instance and then
instruct it to auto load the table using
the engine finally we can use the
function wrapper to view the details of
our table that we stored a census this
allows us to see the names of the
columns such as the state and sex
columns along with their types such as
varchar' and integer this process of
reflection may seem like a bit of
overhead but it will make understanding
your databases and extracting
information from them far easier
downstream now it's your turn to
practice writing connection strings and
connecting to databases and reflecting
tables then we'll be back here writing
our first sequel queries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
