data camp and i'm here today with ben
bomber how you doing good so Ben and I
just finished recording videos for his
new course on a correlation and
regression it's going to be part of our
intro stats series on the our curriculum
which I'm really excited about as am I
so it's good to have them here so I have
a few questions lined up and the first
is familiar to our audience it's the
same question I asked everybody so I'd
like to know there are many labels that
people apply to people working in our
field data scientists data analysts
statistician quant hacker etc right
which of those do you and this is not a
loaded question given that you're
working on our stats curriculum which of
those you apply associate with the most
and why okay well of course Nick I
reject all labels but but no I would
identifies the data sciences first and I
think that's because I don't really fit
so between mathematics computer science
of statistics I sort of I fit in those
boxes in some way but not cleanly in any
of them and so you know given my
background and some of the stuff that
I've worked on I think data scientists
best captures like the kind of stuff
that I have done and the kind of stuff
that I'm interested in which you know
kind of spans was disappoints so just to
recap so is that sort of an indirect way
of defining data science to you is it
like you know there are some ways in
which I feel like if we could start from
scratch data science would be a superset
of statistics and computer science maybe
not math but that you know instead of
being this new thing that has to like
fight for space like maybe if we had not
had those things you know in place
before like maybe those would be
considered subfields of data science
okay interesting so yeah there's there's
some some Venn diagram
out there many Venn diagrams that
attempt to explain what data science
needs and it's it's it's obviously a
vague notion and there's no perfect
definition but so it often includes
which you said stats and computer
science but then maybe with the addition
of domain expertise okay how important
do you think that is well for Mia I
think it's really important you know on
my my domain of expertise is baseball
sabermetrics I mean it's not hard to
imagine you know all kinds of like
technical knowledge that people have and
also just knowledge from watching the
game that's built up over decades right
and i think you know it's one of the
things that we try to emphasize in our
classes and we try to impart on our
students but you can have all these
technical tools but if you don't
understand the field of application and
you know how to like use the language of
that domain and how to explain these
what can be very complicated and
technical things to people in those
fields than like i'm not sure what the
value of your work really is right sure
so yeah it's really important okay great
so that's a perfect segue into my next
question conserving um tell the good
people what you do now and you also had
a very non-traditional pass getting
there so maybe if you could just take
people briefly along that that journey
yeah sure how much time do you a lot not
as much a teenager okay yeah so I'm an
assistant professor of difficult data
sciences at Smith right now in the great
state of Massachusetts state of
Massachusetts yep and you know so I
teach some traditional statistics
classes like the intro class and like a
multiple regression class but also some
data science classes like specifically
branded data science classes and you
know I think that's been a great fit for
me my PhD is in math and the graduate
training that I had was in discrete math
my thesis advisor was a theoretical
computer scientist and then at the time
I was working for the New York Mets as
their statistical analyst so you were a
data scientist before this was even a
thing that's right you already doing the
domain expertise with the computer
science and yes that's in the nest and
we didn't call it that right so it
wasn't called data science but yes
absolutely that's the time is just
called overachiever yeah something like
the guy cool suit tell people yes
specifically the first job that you had
out of college is quite unique and
interesting and yeah well there were
others but ok there are others but you
know the one I want to be on that's them
ok let's talk a little bit about that
and what was exciting to you about that
and then how you ended up going from
there to where you are now yeah I mean
so it's not that complicated to imagine
what's exciting about working for a
baseball team right I mean I don't know
I've been a baseball fan my whole life
to play baseball get on the trace levels
not very well but you know enjoy doing
it and yes so to get a chance to work
for you know what happens to be my
favorite team New York nuts you know I'd
say it was a dream come true except it
wasn't a dream because jobs like that
didn't exist when I was growing up so
yeah it was very exciting and you know I
think the best part of that job was
feeling like you're part of something
that a lot of people care about that you
know has very to find successes and
failures we had both of those things
during the time I was there yeah you
know it's very exciting and yeah it's
quite different from the job I have now
not so much in terms of the work that
I'm doing but just you know the
environment and the kind of people that
I'm surrounding it I think one of the
things I like best about my job now is
I'm never bored like every day is
totally different and you know to get
the chance to work with the students
that are you know as talented as I
students are and to get a chance to them
you know see them go on unlike do great
things afterwards is like really
gratifying so one of the things that I
know you're really passionate about and
one of the reasons you're working with
us is you love education were you
involved in any training or education
and your previous job and lose out
motivator for you come into the academic
world yeah yeah so funny he has that but
um yeah you know I was in graduate
school at the time that I was working
for the month for a large portion of
that time and so yeah we had interns
coming in every summer and some of those
interns you know we're working with me
on various projects and you know because
of the nature of my work I was doing a
lot of sequel development and like PHP
development and so so getting like
interns kind of up to speed with writing
basic select queries in SQL was like a
way for them to like make progress in
terms of like being able to do quality
work that would help us yeah and there
are a number of interns that we have
that like took to that right away and
really took off and actually we we
implemented a kind of like interoffice
you know baseball and I think they call
that baseball one-on-one or something
like that but you know to kind of talk
about the rules but not the playing
rules but like the administrative rule
system like really complex you know
covering contracts and things like that
and then also like you know basics of
sequel and like some of the data sources
tough director so we did actually if one
had told us more than just me but like
the part of what we did yeah ok very
good and now that you're a tenure track
faculty member at a liberal arts college
teaching is again a very important part
of what you do yeah maybe just talk
briefly about that and and some of the
things that you've learned since you've
been doing it yeah I mean so teaching is
something that you know I actually come
from like my father's of professing my
grandfather so something that I've
always thought about another something
that I not like I like the dream of my
life to become a professor or anything
I'm just that sort of worked out that
way but again I you know I think just
what's most gratifying for me is like
seeing some of these students at this
stage of their lives and you know our
students are all intelligent like
capable people
and you know it's at this moment that I
like have something that I can teach
them that they can take with them right
and it's like some of my students it's
like if it were two years later like
they'd already be beyond me you know so
i get this day just like i can still
kind of often on something so you've
been doing this long enough now that
you've had you've heard from some
students who have gone on to do other
things and it had taken a class with you
what are some of the things that they
say we're most valuable for them with
some of the most valuable takeaways that
they have from from the courses you
taught well i think you know first and
foremost is like the experience of
working with real data which as you know
does not always come to you in the way
that it does in some of the more
traditional statistics text books yep so
you know the ability to work with real
data the ability to to learn coding you
know like you know whether it's our
Python or whatever it is you know that
ability to write code to work with the
work you just do what you want with the
data that you have to work with I think
it's something that people sort of
consistently say is like a rewarding
thing that they learned in these classes
and then that they actually that was
actually useful to them in their in
their jobs and their senior career so as
the word gotten out that like when
somebody takes your course they're going
to have the program is this a surprise
to those people are or is it now I've
accepted that this is just a part of
doing statistics I think so yeah um and
on and I I basically say that on the
first day across you know it's a little
different you know an intro stats class
where a lot of students are taking it
because it's required for their major
versus like a data science class where
they're all taking it because they want
to be there but yeah basically my my
messages I know if you want to do this
kind of work and you want to do
statistics or data science in this day
and age like you want to do it right
like you have to learn to code and it
doesn't mean that you have to be a
master programmer that you have to learn
a whole bunch of different languages but
like you got a you got to learn how to
how to create something for yourself
and that's ultimately like an empowering
thing and it's something that I try to
heal i try to convince them all so it's
a perfect segue into my next question so
you mentioned creating something for
yourself you've created at least one our
package etl in our package that we were
just talking about which stands for
extract transform load correct yeah
maybe it'd be useful to just give a
brief explanation of why you built that
package feel free to talk about the
technical reasons but I'm actually
curious like what motivated you to
create the package in the first place
and why you think it's important for
other people to do similar things okay
oh well like most people who create our
packages I did it's all about right like
I have a problem and I want to solve it
and I realized that if I can solve this
problem for myself like maybe I can
solve it for a bunch of other people and
in this case the problem is if you have
what I've been calling a medium data
source right so it's not small boy what
does that mean okay so small is like
data that fits in memory no problem okay
an Excel spreadsheet yeah okay you know
big data is like something that involves
clusters and multiple computers and
terabytes and I'll talk about that
either so this is like you know on the
order of like a couple gigabytes like so
a data source with like a couple
gigabytes worth of data sure not an
Excel spreadsheet it's not Facebook
Google scale data something in the
middle opting in the middle i'm there a
lot of data sets like this a lot of the
data sets that i worked with in baseball
we're all this sort of magnitude and
it's something that like you know so
just reading the data into our and a
data frame is like maybe not so peaceful
it's not a great solution but like SQL
is like a reasonable solution to this
problem but then you know to go through
that process of this ETL process that
you talked about extract transform and
load that means downloading the data
from song server on the internet
transforming it into some kind of
tabular format and then loading that
into an SQL server and that's a process
that like a lot of data scientists spend
a lot of time working with right I know
I certainly did and that process can be
fun I always enjoy that kind of work
actually if you know sequel a sequel and
like some scripting languages yeah but
it's it's hard to reproduce and it's you
know it can be frustrating to have to go
back and do it again to be kind of like
constantly updating these things and so
what I was looking for is a solution
that would allow you to do this
programmatically and automatically
preferably in a cross-platform way and
and preferably without knowing much SQL
necessarily sure sorry so the our
package does exactly that it downloads
data from the internet transforms it and
then loads it into SQL and you can use
the deep layer connections to like
seamlessly work with it in our which has
become the thing that I work with all
the time yeah so that's what it does and
in a sense you're practicing what you
preach right this is what you want your
students to do you want them to identify
problems that are worth working on and
then you go out there and create some
solutions yeah some transparent you know
reproducible solutions yeah yeah does
this come up in your classes at all do
you guys talk about not only how to
extract value from this vibrant
community around our but how to
contribute back to that a little bit
yeah I'd actually love for that to be
like a bigger part of what we do is to
build that I I'm a been a big open
source software the kid or whatever
supporter for a long time and I would
love for that to become part of the
culture of just like you're benefiting
from using all this open source software
like you should be contributing as well
so I have a couple students now who are
working on you know special studies
where they're actually building some of
these packages I would love for that to
be a bigger part of what we do yeah and
and it's probably worth pointing out
that it's not always like you have to be
have these look purely altruistic
missions to like give back to the
community community awesome finds a good
reason for contributing to the open
source software is you're using some
software package that in our package and
it lacks a particular feature that you
need and like you're like okay well I
can either go build something from
scratch or submit a pull request on
github to add this one additional
feature to this existing framework
exactly and sometimes it's the path of
least resistance exactly and it still
benefits the community but right no I'm
the truth is that for most of us you're
better off contributing to somebody
else's ficus than you are building your
own anyway because it's so much more
likely to kind of have some like yep
absolutely cool so maybe going back to
the education thing for a minute I think
we're kind of heading on this indirectly
was the sorts of things that we're
talking about but as you look at like
the way that we educate people in
statistics what do you think is missing
from a traditional stats curriculum and
I don't even necessarily mean like in a
university setting but I think we've
developed this notion of what an intro
stats curriculum should look like yeah
over the last hundred years and yet in
your opinion what's missing or what
should we be doing differently well
that's a loaded question and a heavy
question but I'll give you a couple of
fun I mean so as you said you know some
of the stuff we've already sort of
talked about you know for me personally
I believe that computing has to be a
part of any statistics course that you
know if you want people to actually go
out and practice statistics like they
need to have that computing ability you
know I struggle sometimes with some of
the some of the small sample tests that
we that we talk about a lot to become a
guru sample t-tests and things like that
sometimes a nova where you know for me
personally in the work that i do like
those just are not like tools that i use
very often and so it's harder for me to
to spend a lot of time on those things
but you know a lot of the students who
take my classes are biology majors and
you know psychology majors and you know
for them and their research the stuff
can be useful and so this kind of like I
think nationally and the statistics
education community is like some push
and pull between you know these things
that we've been teaching for decades and
people are still using but then also
this desire to kind of like move things
forward a little bit and be viewing more
with larger and more interesting data
session so moving from a situation where
we're having students computer
t-statistic on pencil and paper to
students working with a real-world data
set building a model that incorporates
multiple variables and doing this using
a modern tool like are exactly exactly I
think part of the problem is that you
know the curriculum has been what it is
for a long time and so we have this
tendency to just add you can't keep
adding things right it's like something
has to go and and it's not clear what
those things should be frankly but
anyway that's one of the things for
arrest my way yeah yeah sure cool so
maybe let's let's look a little bit more
broadly at the are and the data science
communities there's a lot going on right
now in both of those what are some of
the most exciting trends that you see
well um you know for me personally like
just the way that our studio has
developed it has basically taken over
like my word processing and my wasn't
element and that's been a big win for me
in having in having that you know tools
I can do all those things I think so
again you know a lot of my background
was in PHP programming for web
development I'm sequel for database
development and so not known for their
user friendliness yeah any their case
but you know the way that deep liar has
been able to kind of blend
what your your workflow and are with
your SQL workflow has better paper
breakthrough and then you know our mark
down I think it's a you know just as
huge leap forward and for the
reproducibility to to reproduce end and
you know what is the point of it's not
just transparency to the outside world
but it's also just replicability like
for ourselves you know so i used to do a
lot of work that would involve you write
a query and then you know you pull the
data back into our and you like make a
plot and then you want to write it up
and you know if that workflow have
existed 10 years ago things would have
been very different yes sir and
basically I do everything now in our
marked oh okay very interesting and
you're teaching these tools to your your
students as well yeah everything I want
every class from day one we use our
market day to usually but yeah what's
the response initially I reckon um so
there's some there's no resistance for
sure I think and people you know at this
point our students are able to pick it
up pretty quickly because it is basic
level like are marked on is not that
complicated of a thing from the user
perspective I think you know people
still get tripped up on the whole like
there's your our studio environment and
then years you're marked out environment
which is fresh when you you know knit
HTML and you know students struggle I
think a lot of people are actually even
unclear on the distinction between our
and our studio that's you and for people
who are learning are in 2016 it's highly
likely that they've never even seen or
seen it exactly like our at the command
prompt for the exact be of the art GUI
good yeah yeah I know I try to be very
explicit than like there's three things
we're talking about as are those our
studio there's our market but but I
think in general you know the thing
about the alternative right so if you're
not using our mark down to do like
statistical projects you know are you
writing a word document and like copy
and pasting figures from our studio like
into like you know like that is not
working
so I you know I haven't met any real
objections at all interesting okay well
that's all I've got okay thanks a lot
for stopping license my pleasure right
yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
