information captured that's not captured
by summary statistics so just for an
example it's run with this body
temperature example assume a few kids in
the class are sick just a couple they
have the flu for example and they have a
really high body temperature we might
not capture that just by getting say the
average body temperature across the
whole group especially if it's a really
large group right there's a couple of
kids who are sick won't really show up
but if we look at the histogram then
what we'll see is we have like here's
one kid out here who has a temperature
of like over 101 so it's not quite
normal it's more like this right if I
had to smooth it out so that's what
what's called a skewed distribution and
this is a positive skew and the way to
remember that is the skew is where
there's few so there are fewer scores at
the positive or high end of this
distribution that's why it's a positive
skew okay so the skew is where there's
few this is a positively skewed
distribution this is the same exact
graphic just presented again in Celsius
instead of in Fahrenheit and again we
don't get a nice normal distribution we
get something that looks more like that
it's not quite as skewed as I drew
before but you get the point
it's a little bit positively skewed now
again not all distributions are normal
we're going to assume normal
distributions for a lot of the
statistical procedures that we do in
this course but we need to examine that
first so a first step in a lot of our
labs and a lot of the homework
assignments will be to plot histograms
and determine if we have normal
distributions but there are lots of
distributions that are not normal so
let's look at a couple that are not
normal so again I'm going to
run with this body temperature example
for a few more slides and say today we
have one group of children the entire
group had the flu say a whole whole
classroom full of children got sick with
the flu and then they were treated they
were given say antibiotics and one thing
that can happen with that antibiotics is
can actually suppress your body
temperature a bit so after getting the
antibiotics that group of children their
body temperatures might be a little bit
below average relative to normal and
then let's compare them to a second
group a second classroom of kids who
also got infected with the flu but maybe
say a week later so their body
temperatures are still high okay
let's look at that in in graphics again
I'm going to do this first in Fahrenheit
then in Celsius so here's a on the left
a normal distribution it's pretty normal
but it's a little bit below average
remember I said it's the average is
ninety 98.6 and in this case were
actually a little bit below 98 it looks
like is the average for that group and
here again we've got a pretty normal not
perfectly normal but pretty normal
distribution and this group is a little
bit above average so we've got you know
the average looks like it's approaching
100 so this is the group of children who
are are still sick they haven't had the
antibiotics yet imagine that I didn't
know that these were two separate
classrooms of children imagine I just
looked at their body temperatures and
plotted the histogram all of them
together so let's put them together so
if we put those two distributions
together the the group of children who
are on the antibiotics and are their
body temperatures a little bit below
average with the group of children who
are still sick and haven't received the
antibiotics their body temperature is
still above normal what you'll see is a
distribution that looks like this it's
it's actually bimodal meaning it has two
modes so if I if you look at it
carefully you can see there's sort of a
normal distribution there and a normal
distribution there it's the two
distributions put together so if you
didn't know that it might be hard to see
but the more practice you get at looking
at histograms the more you'll start to
see these evidence of non-normal
distributions so this is an example of
something that looks not normal instead
I would describe this as bimodal again
I'm just doing the same exact thing
except here I'm plotting everything in
degrees Celsius instead of degrees
Fahrenheit so here this group is a
little if you look at the average
they're a little below average if you
look at the average for this group on
the right they're a little above average
if we put them together again what we
see is something that looks a little
bimodal you get these two peaks there's
peak here and a peak here remember in a
normal distribution there's just one
peak right at the center of the
distribution here we're seeing two peaks
and again it's evidence that we have
these two different samples of children
that were put together so the point of
that exercise in the point of looking at
all those histograms is to just make
this simple point that not all
distributions are normal yes we are
going to assume a lot of normal
distributions as we go forward in this
course it's easy especially for
introductory statistics to assume a
normal distribution but we'll make that
assumption then we'll test it by looking
at histograms by running descriptive
statistics and our will see if we have
normal distributions or not so we'll
assume normal distributions but just
keep in mind not all distributions are
normal so simply viewing a histogram
often reveals whether it's not normal
you might have a positive skew you might
have a negative skew
you might have something that's bimodal
you might have something that looks
completely out of whack not normal at
all sometimes it's hard to determine
just by looking at the histogram and
it's it's a it's a judgment call there
are no hard and fast rules about this
so in that case summary statistics will
help and we'll talk more about that in
the next lecture on summary statistics
so the only way to really get a good
handle on what is a normal distribution
look like and what is a non-normal
distribution that look like it's just to
look at more and more histograms the
more experience you get with this the
more you'll be able to say oh yeah
that's that's normal enough for for our
statistical procedure we'll go ahead or
that's that's too positively skewed
that's too negatively negatively skewed
so the best way to do that is just get
experience so let's look at more
distributions this can get a little
tedious so while we do it we'll imagine
that we're wine-tasting or you're at
home you could start drinking wine right
now if you haven't already I haven't yet
it's still in the morning here in the US
on the East Coast so let's go
wine-tasting so in this example suppose
that we have 100 wine experts and
they're gonna drink and rate the overall
quality of eight different wines they're
going to rate for red wines and for
white wines and in all the examples
higher scores indicate higher quality so
if they give it a score in the 90s that
means they really liked it and let's say
we had four countries submit two wines
each so Argentina Australia France and
the US each one submitted a red and each
one submitted a white we again just did
this for fun
my my assistant on this is is from
France and so we had a lot of fun doing
this example so let's say Argentina
submitted a Malbec they're very known
further there
quality Malbecs and the end of
chardonnay australia let's say they
submitted a Shiraz and a Pinot Grigio
France let's say they submitted a
Bordeaux and Sauvignon Blanc and the us
let's say they submitted a Cabernet and
a Riesling and they say Riesling from
the US but yes upstate New York has
really great Rieslings which was where
I'm from so that wasn't random I I had
to slip that in that was personal so the
US submitted a Cabernet probably from
California a Riesling from upstate New
York let's say okay to preview what we
did again we just made up this example
we had a lot of fun making this example
up and we made it up so that the red
wines the distributions of the ratings
are normal in the red wines but if you
look at the ratings of the white wines
those are all not normal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
