camp and I'll be your instructor for
this course on cleaning data in our
let's kick things off by looking at an
example of dirty data you're looking at
the top and bottom or head and tail of a
data set containing various weather
metrics recorded in the city of Boston
over a 12 month period of time at first
glance these data may not appear very
dirty the information is already
organized into rows and columns which is
not always the case the rows are
numbered and the columns have names in
other words it's already in table format
similar to what you might find in a
spreadsheet document we wouldn't be this
lucky if for example we were scraping a
web page but we have to start somewhere
despite the datasets deceivingly neat
appearance a closer look reveals many
issues that should be dealt with prior
to say attempting to build a statistical
model to predict weather patterns in the
future for starters the first column X
all the way on the Left appears to be
meaningless it's not clear with the
columns X 1 X 2 and so forth represent
and if they represent days of the month
then we've got time represented in both
rows and columns the different types of
measurements contained in the measure
column should probably each have their
own column there are a bunch of na s at
the bottom of the data and the list goes
on so don't worry if these things are
not immediately obvious to you they will
be by the end of this course in fact in
the last chapter of this course you will
clean this exact same data set from
start to finish using all of the amazing
new things that you've learned dirty
data are everywhere in fact most
real-world data sets start off dirty in
one way or another but by the time they
make their way into textbooks and
courses most have already been cleaned
and prepared
analysis this is really convenient when
all you want to talk about is how to
analyze or model the data but it can
leave you at a loss when you're faced
with cleaning your own data with the
rise of so-called
big data data cleaning is more important
than ever before every industry finance
healthcare retail hospitality and even
education is now doggy-paddling in a
large sea of data and as the data get
bigger the number of things that can go
wrong due to each imperfection becomes
harder to find when you can't simply
look at the entire data set in a
spreadsheet on your computer in fact
data cleaning is an essential part of
the data science process in simple terms
you might break this process down into
four steps acquiring or collecting your
data cleaning your data analyzing or
modeling your data and finally reporting
your results to the appropriate audience
if you try to skip the second step
you'll often run into problems getting
the raw data to work with traditional
tools for analysis and say R or Python
this could be true for a variety of
reasons for example many common
algorithms require variables to be
arranged into columns and for missing
values to be either removed or replaced
with non missing values neither of which
was the case with the weather data that
you just saw not only is data cleaning
an essential part of the data science
process it's also often the most
time-consuming part as the New York
Times reported in a 2014 article called
for big data scientists janitor work is
key hurdle to insights quote data
scientists spend from 50% to 80% of
their time mired in this more mundane
labor of collecting and preparing unruly
digital data before it can be explored
for useful nuggets unfortunately
cleaning is not as sexy as training a
neural network to identify images of
cats on the Internet
so it's generally not talked about much
in the media nor is it taught in most
intro data science and statistics
courses but no worries we're here to
help
in this course we'll break data cleaning
down into a three step process exploring
your raw data tidying your data and
preparing your data for analysis each of
the first three chapters of this course
will cover one of these steps in depth
then the fourth chapter will require you
to use everything you've learned to take
the weather data from raw to ready for
analysis
