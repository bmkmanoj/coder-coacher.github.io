already have an idea about some machine
learning problems let's get a bit more
specific and discuss three common types
of machine learning problems
classification regression and clustering
these are all very broad topics so I'll
stick to a brief introduction in this
video to get you familiar with these
techniques the three last chapters of
this course go into more detail first up
is classification a classification
problem involves predicting whether
given observation belongs to a certain
category
remember how I compared machine learning
to the estimation of a function well
based on earlier observations of how the
input maps to the output classification
tries to estimate a classifier that can
generate an output for arbitrary input a
classifier can then label an unseen
example with a class the possible
applications of classification are very
broad for example after a set of
clinical examinations that relate vital
signals to a disease you could predict
whether a new patient with an unseen set
of vital signals suffers that disease
and needs further treatment another
totally different example is classifying
a set of animal images into cats dogs
and horses given that you have trained
your model on a bunch of images for
which you know what animal day depict
can you think of a possible
classification problem yourself what's
important here is that first off the
output is qualitative and second that
the classes to which a new observation
can belong unknown beforehand in the
first example I mentioned the classes
are sick and not sick in the second
example the classes are cat dog and
horse in Chapter three we will do a deep
analysis of classification and you'll
get to work with some fancy classifies
moving on a regression problem is a kind
of machine learning problem that tries
to predict a continuous or credited
value for an input based on previous
information the input variables are
called the predictors and output the
response in soft sense regression is
pretty similar to classification you're
also trying to estimate a function that
map's input to output based on early
observations but this time you're trying
to estimate an actual value not just a
class of an observation do you recall
the example from the last video there we
had a data set on a group of people's
height and weight a valid question could
be a cell relationship between the
height and the weight for example will
it change in height correlate linearly
with a change in weight and if so can
you predict a height of a new person
given their weight these questions can
be answered with linear regression here
you're trying to fit a linear function
between the predictor the weight and the
response the height together beta0 and
beta1 unknown as the model coefficients
or parameters as soon as you know the
coefficients beta0 and beta1 the
function is able to convert any new
input to output this means that solving
your machine learning problem is
actually finding good values for beta0
and beta1 these are estimated based
previous input to output observations I
will not go into detail on how to
compute these coefficients the function
LM does is for you in all now are you
asking what can regression be useful for
apart from some silly weight and height
problems well there are many different
applications of regression going from
modeling credits goals based on past
payments finding the trend in your
YouTube subscriptions over time or even
estimating your chances of landing a job
at your favorite company based on your
college grades
all these problems have two things in
common first of the response or the
thing you're trying to predict is always
quantitative and second you will always
need input knowledge of previous input
to output observations in order to build
your model the fourth chapter of this
course will be devoted to a more
comprehensive overview of regression
so classification check regression check
last but not least there is clustering
in clustering you're trying to group
objects that are similar in clusters
while making sure the clusters
themselves are dissimilar you can think
of it as classification but without
saying to which classes the observations
have to be long or how many classes
there are take the animal photos for
example in the case classification you
had information about actual animals
that were depicted in the case of
clustering you don't know what animals
are depicted you will simply get a set
of pictures the clustering algorithm
then groups similar photos in clusters
you could say that clustering is
different in the sense that you don't
need any knowledge about the labels
moreover there is no right or wrong in
clustering different clustering can
reveal different and useful information
about your objects this makes it quite
different from both classification and
regression by there always is a notion
of prior expectation or knowledge of the
result and intuitively straightforward
clustering method is k-means this method
will cluster your data in K clusters
based on some similarity measure more on
this in the fifth and final chapter of
this course well enough theory for a
while it's time to roll up your sleeves
head over to the exercises and tackle
some classification regression and
clustering problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
