to import flat files using the utils
package the utah's package is loaded by
default when you start our of course
there are also specific art packages to
import your data I'm going to talk about
two such packages Reidar and data table
first let's dive into the read our
package written by Headley Wickham it's
a fast and very easy to use package with
very consistent naming while utils more
verbose and multiple times slower we'll
start with installing and loading to
read our package before you used read
the table to import text files as a data
frame to do this to read our way you
want to use read underscored the lim
have a look at the same statestat csv
file from before the following call will
import it for us i also included the
corresponding retail table call from the
utah's package so you can compare both
calls the first argument is the path to
the file you want to import next to the
lim argument specifies the character
that is used to separate fields within a
record it's the equivalent of the SEP
argument and retail table this already
works fine for radar as you can see from
resulting data frame this output is
exactly the same as this retail table
call first off we didn't have to specify
anything like header is true because my
default read underscored the Lim expects
the first row to contain the column
names it does this through the call
names arguments next strings are not
imported as factors by default so
strings as factories equivalent it's not
necessary to control the types of the
columns radar uses a call types argument
similar to the call classes arguments
from utils let me dive into column names
first and then talk some more about gold
types call names is true by default
suppose you have another version of the
stays file without column names setting
column names to false leads to automatic
generation of column names like in this
example you can also manually set call
names to a character vector the names
you pass will then be used as the names
of the columns and the first line is
read as a record like here
next there's also called types to
control the column classes if you leave
it to the defaults now the column type
will be guessed from the first 30 rows
of the inputs this code shows the
classes of the different columns you can
also specify the column classes manually
just like you did in the exercises
before in this call we enforce the state
and city to be a character and the
population area to be both numeric I
used short string representations here C
stands for character D for double or
numeric I for integer and alpha logical
beyond that you can also use an
underscore to skip a column check this
example where the fourth column is not
important now apart from the short
string representations you can also pass
call types a list of collector functions
these collector functions are more
versatile as you can also use them to
import columns as factors you'll learn
all about these in the exercises if
you're working on huge flat files say 1
million lines you might be interested in
handling the data and chunks of 50,000
lines for example this keeps your work
tractable it can easily follow up on the
progress of your algorithms in radar you
can do this with a combination of the
skip and end max arguments have looked
at the output of this goal we skipped
two rows and then read in three records
there's a problem though as call names
is true by default the first row that's
Reds are used for the column names but
this information has been skipped we'll
have to manually specify some column
names this time by setting call names to
a character vector this time the first
two rows so the column names and first
observation or skipped and the next
three observations are read in to make
things easier for you
the yuto's function also has a retail
CSV function remember well read are also
has a read underscore CSV function
similarly to read total lymph function
in utils as a counterpart and read are
read underscore TSV which stands for tab
separated value both of them are
wrappers around to read underscored LM
function similar to how you tells digits
this table summarizes
make sure not to mix things up
the other package I want to discuss is
data table the key metric for the
authors of data table met Tao and Arun
Srinivasan is speed the package is
mainly about data manipulation and our
but also features a super powerful
function to read your data into our F
reads if you have huge files you want to
import and merge into our you'll want to
go with the data table package let's
start with installing and loading the
package if you want to learn everything
about data table data camp offers a
course that is dedicated to this package
in this course we'll stick to the F read
function it is pretty similar to the
retail table function you've seen before
but it is more convenient to use let me
introduce it for an example suppose we
have the two versions of the state CSV
file one with and one without column
names in first row let's call F read on
both the CSV files without additional
arguments every it automatically deals
with these two different cases in the
first case the column names are
correctly transferred to the data frame
while in the second case every it's made
up some call names itself next to
automatically handling the names F read
can also refer to column types and field
separators without having to specify
these that's the cool thing about F read
it just works on top of that it's
ridiculously fast
of course the F read function is much
more than automatically finding out all
column types and conventions in the
files you want to read you can also
manually specify the separator the color
class is the number of lines to skip and
the number of lines to read and manually
think of F read as an improved version
of the read of table function which is
faster more convenient and adds
functionality all of that being said I
believe it's time for you to get some
practice and to learn how to use the
arguments without mixing them all up
sounds challenging but I'm sure you'll
do great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
