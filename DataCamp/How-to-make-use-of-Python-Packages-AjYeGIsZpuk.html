Python functions and methods are
extremely powerful you can basically use
other people's code to solve your own
problems however adding all functions
and methods that have been written up to
now to the same Python distribution
would be a big mess there will be tons
and tons of code in there that you'll
never use also maintaining all of this
code would be a real pain this is where
packages come into play again think of
packages as a directory of Python
scripts each such script is a so-called
module these modules specify functions
methods and new Python types aimed at
solving particular problems there are
thousands of Python packages available
from the internets among them are
packages for data science there's numpy
to efficiently work with arrays met plot
lip for data visualization and
scikit-learn for machine learning not
all these packages are available in
python by default to use Python packages
you'll first have to install them on
your own system and then put code in
your script to tell python that you want
to use these packages data camp already
has all the necessary packages installed
for you but if you want to install them
on your own system you'll want to use
pip a package maintain a system for
python if you go to this URL you can
download the file get pip top py next
you go to the terminal and execute
Python tree get Bittle py now you can
use pip to actually install a Python
package of your choosing suppose you
want to install the numpy package which
you'll learn about in the next chapter
you type pip 3 install numpy you have to
use the command Python tree and pip 3
here to tell our system that we're
working with python version 3 now that
the package is installed you can
actually start using it and one of your
Python scripts before you can do this
you should import a package or specific
module of this package you can do this
with the import statements to import the
entire numpy package you can do import
numpy like this a commonly used function
in numpy is array it takes a list as
input simply call the array function
like this will generate an error to
refer to the array function from the
numpy package you'll need this this time
it works the
beret is very useful to do data science
but more on that later using this number
dot prefix all the time can become
pretty tiring so you can also import a
package and refer to it with a different
name you can do this by extending your
import statement with s like this now
instead of num by double a you'll have
to use and B dot or a to use numbers
array function there are cases in which
you only need one specific function of a
package - allows you to make this
explicit in your code
suppose that you only want to use the
array function from the numpy package
instead of doing important um pi you can
instead - from numpy import or a like
this this time you can simply call the
array function like this no need to use
numpy dealt here this from import
version to specific parts of a package
can be useful to limit the amount of
coding but you're also losing some of
the context suppose you're working in a
long Python script you bought the array
function from numpy at the very top and
way later you actually use this array
function somebody else is reading your
code might have forgotten that this
array function is a specific number
function it's not clear from the
function call in that respect the more
standard important um PI call is
preferred in this case your function
call is numpy dot array make it very
clear that you're working with numpy at
the end of the day it's a matter of
personal preference up to you to decide
what you think is most convenient up to
the exercises now or you can practice on
different ways of importing packages and
modules yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
