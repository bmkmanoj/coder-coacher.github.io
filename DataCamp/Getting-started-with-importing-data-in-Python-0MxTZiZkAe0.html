data in Python my name is hugo van
Andersson and I'm a data scientist the
data camp in this course you'll learn
how to import data from a large variety
of sources for example flat files such
as TX T's and CS fees files native to
other software such as Excel
spreadsheets Stata SAS and MATLAB files
relational databases such as sequel Lite
and my sequel will cover all of these
topics in this course first off we're
going to learn how to import basic text
files which we can broadly classify into
two types of files those containing
plain text such as the opening of Mark
Twain's novel The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn which you can see here
those containing records that is table
data such as Titanic CSV in which each
row is a unique passenger on board and
each column is a characteristic or
feature such as sex cabin and survived
or not the latter is known as a flat
file and we'll come back to these in a
minute in this section we'll figure out
how to read lines from a plain text file
so let's do it to check out any plain
text file you can use pythons basic open
function to open a connection to the
file to do so you assign the file name
to a variable as a string past the file
name to the function open and also pass
at the argument mode equals R which
makes sure that we can only read it we
wouldn't want to accidentally write to
it would we assign the text from the
file to a variable text by applying the
method read to the connection to the
file after you do this make sure that
you close the connection to the file
using the command file close it's always
best practice to clean while cooking you
can then print the file to the console
and check it out using the command print
text a brief side note if you wanted to
open a file in order to write to it you
would pass it the argument mode equals W
we won't use that in this course as this
is a course on importing data but it is
good to know you can avoid having to
close the connection to the file by
using a with statement this allows you
to create
a context in which you can execute
commands with the file open once out of
this clause or context the file is no
longer open and for this reason with is
called a context manager what you're
doing here is called binding a variable
in the context manager construct while
still within this construct the variable
file will be bound to open file name R
it is best practice to use the with
statement as you never have to concern
yourself with closing the file again in
the following interactive coding
sessions you'll figure out how to print
files to the console you'll also learn
to print specific lines which can be
very useful for large files then we'll
be back to discuss flat files and then
I'll show you how to use the Python
package numpy to make our job of
importing flat files and numerical data
