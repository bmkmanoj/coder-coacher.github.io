scientist the data camp and we're in a
recording studio today with cliff Aang
we've just recorded a video on bond
valuation analysis in R so cliffs
welcome and thank you obviously for for
every single will be a great video so
it's a new of course where to finance
curriculum so maybe we can start off
with for the people that don't know you
maybe you can tell a little bit about
yourself yes I love you my name is cliff
AG I'm vice president at a firm called
compass Lexecon we do economic
consulting I specialize in the areas of
business valuation and securities and we
primarily do work in litigation ok nice
so I'm probably the most important
question to ask for me as I'm in charge
of the finance curriculum and and
promoting finance I guess in a way so
how did you end up in the field of
Finance so way back in college I just
did better in finance classes and I
thought I guess that's the way to go and
just fell in love with it and a lot
meatball almost all my coursework after
that is in finance and it's just I just
have interest in a lot of areas in
finance in particular financial
economics ok ok
nice yeah well so then I guess this is a
early good question as well so so why
did you decide to build a course for
data camp in the first place and why did
you choose this particular topic on bond
valuation and bond analysis now I've
always been interested seeing all these
online courses and I thought data camp
had a very good platform and you know
the structure and everything look look
really really good to me it's very
attractive and I mean this correspond
valuation analysis I think is one of the
most fundamental concepts that every
serious student of finance should know
it's also probably the most one of the
most practical things
yeah yeah that's right now definitely
yeah I think it will be it will be great
definitely so how well I mean you're
obviously in finance so how why did you
decide to use our so how did you how did
you start using our so I started using
our this was in 2012 or thereabout
colleague of mine and I you know we
decided that we wanted to present in the
are in finance conference okay yeah in
you are and I had to force myself to
learn our so that was it so okay so it
was a what other languages like or did
you know any other I guess you didn't
know what other languages before so what
were other languages that you used
before so I used SAS a lot especially a
work from MATLAB BBA you know those
helped a lot especially in learning a
new language like our mmm-hmm yes answer
certainly knowing other languages does
help I guess so I mean you're working
finance you have experience in are you
recently finished a book analyzing
financial data and implement
implementing financial models in our so
why did you decide to write that book
and and what may be our users are
interested in hearing absolutely
whatever that so there are I think maybe
three things so the so I also taught
finance investments and a lot of times I
see students the the harder parts in in
terms its up so first it's a financial
modeling textbook and so when when you
see these financial modeling textbooks
so the problem is that they don't take
the student from the beginning all the
way to the end so that's one so I wanted
to write a book that that essentially
handles the students through the whole
process and secondly when they do even
when they show something like that they
kind of only do the spar at the end and
you're kind of left guessing if you have
a multi-step problem or model that
you're creating the students may get
lost in the middle so in my book it's
every step the intermediate output is
generated and our is a really good tool
for this because you can output
intermediate data and so they can see
okay this is the spot where we're you
know I made a mistake so you don't have
to wait till the end and then try to
figure out for yourself
how to debug all this and then the last
reason is I want to write a book where
all the data is free by publicly
available data some of the books they
require you especially in university or
college you know it would be a database
that you know once the student leaves
they're not going to have access to
write so in my book it's either Yahoo
Finance data data from the Federal
Reserve so all of these you can access
for free at home or wherever and you can
implement every single model from start
to finish that's a very valuable
contribution yes because I know most
most finance data it's not easy to get
there's non-disclosure agreements that
need to be signed so so not everything
and most of it is not publicly available
exactly and for most of the things that
that that people want to do like you
want to study stock prices or create
portfolios with publicly traded stocks
it's fairly easy to get a free data
online and so how do you integrate that
with our right and so yeah that was one
of the things that that I wanted to
share with other people yeah that's
great I'm sure this is very valuable for
many people so yeah that's very
interesting so I think the last question
I would like to ask you I think our
users would be interesting into is what
would you advise people who aspire to be
working in the field of financial
modeling so my advice and is that the
building the financial models is in
really a mechanical exercise a lot of
people treat it that way right so you
know just because you can do it doesn't
doesn't mean you know it's it's it's the
right you know that you know I know the
ten steps and this is what I'm going to
do I would say probably the biggest
advice is learn the concepts learn the
fundamental
learn the intuition behind the models
and that way you know how to apply the
models properly because the last thing
you want to do is just you know
implement random models because some guy
ten years ago figured out this is how
you're supposed to do it but without
really understanding why and is it
really appropriate for the situation
that you're working on okay yeah I
couldn't agree more I think you think
it's ready so advice okay all that thank
you again for being here well thank you
for all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
