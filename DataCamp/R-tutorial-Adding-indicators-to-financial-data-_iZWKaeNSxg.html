plotted financial data our CTR library
written by Joshua lauric contains a
toolbox of classical trading indicators
such as the simple moving average more
colloquially unknown as a moving average
and sometimes referred to as an SMA in
TTR the SMA function stands for simple
moving average as you might have guessed
a simple moving average is a calculation
takes a basic average over some past
period such as 200 days for which there
were prices as time moves forward the
last price falls off of the calculation
and the newest one enters hence the
average moves many commodity trading
advisors have made a great deal trading
using the 200-day moving average some
ETF still used this very filter to
activate defensive positions while the
200-day moving average is not a
particularly magic number it's a line
that displays where the price has been
over the past 10 months is there about
200 business days that is days that
aren't weekends or holidays in 10 months
here's the code on how to compute the
200-day moving average when plotting
financial data a trend line can be added
using the lines command after plotting
as this displays if the current price or
a faster moving average is above this
line then the general thought is that
the price will continue to increase in
the future
similarly when the price is below this
line usually some very bad things happen
the gray area is when the price action
is around the 200-day moving average
which can often cause losses from false
signals for your next exercise you will
be tasked to do the same thing with a
different asset</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
