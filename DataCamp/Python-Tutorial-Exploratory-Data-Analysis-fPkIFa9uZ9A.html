watching the same is true with data if
you can appropriately display your data
you can already start to draw
conclusions from it I'll go even further
exploring your data is a crucial step in
your analysis
when I say exploring your data I mean
organizing and plotting your data and
maybe computing a few numerical
summaries about them this idea is known
as exploratory data analysis or EDA and
was developed by one of the greatest
statisticians of all time John Tukey he
wrote a book entitled exploratory data
analysis in 1977 where he laid out the
principles in that book he said
exploratory data analysis can never be
the whole story but nothing else can
serve as the foundation stone I
wholeheartedly agree with this so we
will begin our study of statistical
thinking with EDA
let's consider an example here I have a
data set I acquired from data gov
containing the election results of 2008
at the county level in each of the three
major swing states of Pennsylvania Ohio
and Florida these are the ones that
largely decide recent elections in the
US this is how they look when I open the
file in my text editor they are a little
prettier if we look at them in a panda's
data frame in this case we are only
looking at the columns of immediate
interest the state county and share of
votes that went to Democrat Barack Obama
now we could stare at these numbers but
I think you'll agree that it is pretty
hopeless to gain any sort of
understanding from doing this
alternatively we could charge in
headlong and start defining and
computing parameters and their
confidence intervals and do hypothesis
tests now you will learn how to do all
of these things in this course and its
sequel but a good field commander does
not just charge into battle without
first getting a feel for the terrain and
sizing up the opposing army so like the
field commander we should explore the
data first in this chapter we will
discuss graphical exploratory data
analysis this involves taking data from
tabular form like we have here in the
data frame
and representing it graphically you are
presenting the same information but it
is in a more human interpretable form
for example we take the Democratic share
of the vote in the counties of all three
swing states and plot them as a
histogram the height of each bar is a
number of counties that had a given
level of support for Barack Obama
for example the tallest bar is the
number of counties that had between 40%
and 50% of its votes cast for Obama
right away because there is more area in
the histogram to the left of 50% we can
see that more counties voted for Obama's
opponent John McCain than voted for
Obama look at that just by making one
plot we could already draw a conclusion
from the data now this would have been
extraordinarily tedious if we did it by
hand counting in the data frame now
let's review some of the basic ideas
behind EDA with a couple of exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
