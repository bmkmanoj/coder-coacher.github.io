take it from the unorganized raw state
and start to clean it up we will focus
on some common pre-processing functions
but before we actually apply them to the
corpus let's learn what each one does
because you don't always apply the same
ones for all your analyses besar has a
function to lower it makes all the
characters in a string lowercase this is
helpful for term aggregation but can be
harmful if you are trying to identify
proper nouns like cities the remove
punctuation function well it removes
punctuation this can be especially
helpful in social media but can be
harmful if you are trying to find
emoticons made of punctuation marks like
a smiley face depending on your analyses
you may want to remove numbers obviously
don't do this if you are trying to text
mine quantities or currency amounts but
remove numbers may be useful sometimes
the strip whitespace function is also
very useful sometimes text has extra
tabbed whitespace or extra lines this
simply removes it a very important
function from TM is remove words you can
probably guess that a lot of words like
the and of are not very interesting so
may need to be removed all of these
transformations are applied to the
corpus using the TM map function this
text mining function is an interface to
transform your corpus through a mapping
to the corpus content you see here the
TM map takes a corpus then one of the
pre-processing functions like remove
numbers or remove punctuation to
transform the corpus if the transforming
function is not from the TM library it
has to be wrapped in the content
transformer function doing this tells TM
app to import the function and use it on
the content of the corpus the stem
document function uses an algorithm to
segment words to their base
in this example you see complicatedly
complicated and complication all gets
stemmed to complic this definitely helps
aggregate terms the problem is that you
are often left with tokens that are not
words so you have to take an additional
step to complete the base tokens the
stem completion function takes as
arguments the stemmed words and a
dictionary of complete words in this
example the dictionary is only
complicated but you can see how all
three words were unified to complicate
you can even use a corpus as your
completion dictionary as shown here
there is another whole group of
pre-processing functions from the q dat
package which can complement these
nicely in the exercises you will have
the opportunity to work with both TM and
Q data pre-processing functions then
apply them to a corpus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
