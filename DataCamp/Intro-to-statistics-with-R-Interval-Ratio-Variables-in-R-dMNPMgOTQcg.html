1946 he came up with these four distinct
categories or types of variables because
there are different types of things we
can do with these kinds of variables I
know this font is a little fuzzy and
hard to see I purposely cut and pasted
this table from Steven's 1946 because I
think it's an important paper everyone
should read it I won't go through the
whole whole slide you can look at this
at your leisure
the point is that a variable of type say
nominal only allows us to do certain
things it only allows me to say our two
entities equal or not equal so are you
are you from the same country or
different countries if I take two
students at random from this course and
I just know this nominal variable
country of origin all I can do is say
are you from the same country or are you
from a different country I can't do it
say anything about greater than or less
than I can just say are you from the
same or different that's all that's all
nominal variables allow us to do as you
go down this this list you'll see as you
go from nominal to ordinal to interval
to ratio you're allowed to ask more and
more questions of your variables so for
ordinal I can ask not only are you the
same or different but I can ask are you
ranked higher or lower so do you come
from the same or different countries and
does your country have a greater than or
less than population than the other
student and so on with interval I can
ask questions about how by how much are
you different right if I just have rank
orderings so if you're just if all I
know is you come from the country that
has the greatest population and then I
know that you come from the country that
has the second greatest population
I can't ask well what's the difference
in population that's what interval and
ratio
variables allow us to ask just another
example perhaps a little more intuitive
think about the the people who are
running a race or swimming against each
other and a swim meet you know you can
get first place second place third place
like in the Olympics you get the gold
medal or the silver medal you get the
bronze medal if all I know is the rank
ordering that's the ordinal variable
just first place second place third
place who got gold who got silver who
got bronze if that's all I know then I
can ask well by how much did the winner
win so was it a really close race
between first place and second or was it
just a blowout so the person who won was
way ahead of the person in second if all
I know are the rankings if all I know
are the ordinal variable then I can't
answer that question about distance but
if I have their time say it's a running
race or a swimming competition if I have
time that's a ratio variable there's a
true zero then I can ask questions about
well by how much did the winner come in
first place over the second-place
finisher and by how much did the
second-place finisher come ahead of the
third-place finisher and so on so as you
go down this list you're able to ask
more detailed questions and so in
statistics and in this course we're
going to strive for variables that give
us that interval or ratio scale we can't
always do that but ideally we'll use
interval or ratio variables because
they're the richest in terms of
information they allow us to ask the
most in-depth questions of our data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
