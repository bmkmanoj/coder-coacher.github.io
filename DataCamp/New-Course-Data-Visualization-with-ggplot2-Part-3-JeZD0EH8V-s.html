series on data visualization with
ggplot2 this course assumes you're
familiar with the functions and concepts
in data visualization that I introduced
in my first two courses those courses
should have given you a pretty good idea
about what good data visualization is
and how to achieve it since this is an
advanced course we're going to dig a bit
deeper into some more advanced ggplot2
functions but before we get to that
we'll cap off the material we began in
the first two courses by rounding out
your knowledge with some niche topics
we'll begin by exploring two kinds of
specialized plots in Chapter one we'll
consider the first type of specialized
plots those suited for data savvy
audience these are statistical plots
that you wouldn't normally see in the
popular press like box plots and density
plots plus we'll consider how to combine
several variables in Chapter two we'll
move on to the second type of
specialized plots those that are suited
for very specific data types we'll begin
by putting some fundamental concepts of
working with large data sets into
perspective and then we'll see some
specific cases like cannery plots
networks and diagnostic plots this topic
will continue into Chapter three when we
consider two main classes of maps coral
plants and cartographic maps finally
we'll see many concepts come together
with the last type of specialized plot
animations which adds video frames as
another mapping aesthetic depending on
your area of expertise you may find that
you seldom have the need to use these
specialized plant types but it's still
useful to know what's possible within
the ggplot2 framework in the fourth
chapter we're going to get under the
hood by digging into the internals of
ggplot2 objects for this we'll begin by
looking at the basics of the grid
package on which ggplot2 is built the
next step is to begin manipulating
graphical objects that we made with
ggplot2 and look at more efficient ways
of doing that with some built-in
functions in ggplot2 such as ggplot
built in the last part we'll make use of
a useful accessory package called grid
extra in the fifth chapter we'll bring
our series on ggplot2 to a close with
two case studies and the first case
study we'll look at a feature that was
introduced in ggplot2 release 2.0 making
extensions well understand how to build
the new
or stats function from scratch this will
allow us to use ggplot2 to create
exactly the statistics and
visualizations we want in a more
straightforward manner in the second
case study we're going to reproduce a
classic plot by Edward Tufte using data
familiar to everyone the weather using
ggplot2 will create a unique plot
drawing on what we've learned over all
three courses and the capital off we're
going to combine our tufting weather
plot with ggplot2 extensions and turn
our unique plot type into a flexible
efficient and reproducible plot type
that we can use with any data set of the
appropriate type all right before we get
into all of that let's get started on
some brief refresher exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
