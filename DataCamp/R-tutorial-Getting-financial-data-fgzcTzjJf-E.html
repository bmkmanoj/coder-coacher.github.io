system is to actually get financial data
when most financial data are pressed and
institutional rate there are some
sources of free data of passport quality
the one we will use for this class is
Yahoo Finance in our the quant mod
library has the get symbols command
which will create an object in your work
environment the name of the financial
asset you obtained in this course we
will be looking at ETFs exchange traded
funds an exchange-traded fund is a
basket of securities that aim to reflect
a certain behavior we will be looking at
two ETS in this course lqd and sp1 lqd
representing the basket of investment
grade corporate debt will be covered in
the course videos spwhy and etf that
tracks the S&amp;amp;P 500 which is a basket of
large companies will be covered in the
exercise the data comes in a format with
the following columns open high low
close volume and adjusted prices the
quantum odd library has the following
commands to access each of these columns
op4 open h high for high ello for low CL
for clothes vo for volume and ad for
adjusted to understand what these terms
mean know that the US markets open at
9:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time and
close at 4:00 p.m. the open is the price
at which Trading begins the closing
price is the last price that was traded
and the high and low are the maximum and
minimum values that though asset reached
over the course of the day respectively
the volume details the number of shares
traded and the adjusted closes the close
adjusted for dividends and splits
dividends are a regular cash payout to
the holder of the asset that is not
reflected in the raw prices and splits
are when the price of an asset gets cut
in half but the number of shares are
increased by two for instance
furthermore one can plot the Stadio with
a following code displayed in the
following exercise you will need to
follow this process with a different
asset</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
