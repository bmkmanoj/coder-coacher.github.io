data was informative we learned that
more counties voted for McCain than for
Obama since our goal is to learn from
data this is great however a major
drawback of using histograms is that the
same dataset can look different
depending on how the bins are chosen and
choice of bins is in many ways arbitrary
this leads to binning bias you might
interpret your plot differently for two
different choices of binning an
additional problem with histograms is
that we are not plotting all of the data
we are sweeping the data into bins and
losing their actual values to remedy
these problems we can make a bee swarm
plot also known as a swarm plot this is
best shown by example here is a bee
swarm pot of the boat totals in the
three swing states each point in the
plot represents the share of the vote
that Obama got in a single County the
position along the y-axis is the
quantitative information the data are
spread along X to make them visible but
the precise location along the x axis is
unimportant notably we no longer have
any binning bias and all data are
displayed this plot may be conveniently
generated using Seabourn a requirement
is that your data are in a
well-organized pandas dataframe or each
column is a feature and each row and
observation in this case an observation
is a county and the features are the
state and the Democratic share of the
vote to make the plot you need to
specify which column gives the values
for the y axis in this case the share of
the vote that went to Democrat Barack
Obama and the values for the x axis in
this case the state and of course you
need to tell it which data frame
contains the data from this plot too we
can clearly see that Obama got less than
50 percent of the vote in the majority
of the counties in each of the three
swing states this time the plot is more
detailed than the histogram but without
too much added visual
city now it's your turn to make some bee
swarm plots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
