at data camp and I'm here today with
Charlotte Wickham we just finished
recording the videos for her new course
on working with geospatial data in our
which I'm really excited about I think
she is as well so welcome thank you so
maybe to kick things off I'd like to
know do you consider yourself a
statistician a data scientist a data
analyst the data mine or whatever you
could rattle off a bunch of different
terms and then and why I think I have to
leave myself a little bit as a
statistician because my PhD was in
statistics and I live in a Statistics
Department at the University of Oregon
except that you know what I what I
really love doing is working with this
data and doing data analysis and
programming and making day or analysis
easier so I think I think that makes me
a little bit of a data scientist as well
mm-hmm okay fair enough
see you you are an AR guru you love
programming and are and that's clear
from working with you what is it about
so how did you first come into contact
with R and what is it about the language
that that excites you so I first came
into contact with are at the University
of Auckland where I was doing my
undergraduate and first math and physics
and then statistics so our hours home is
that the University of Auckland's was in
every single statistics class you takes
so it was my first exposure not only to
R but also to programming so I think
what got me excited at that point was
simply that I hadn't really done any
programming before but this was this way
to like automate things to make things
easier to record like all the steps and
what I'm doing and that was sort of like
a revelation for me then like I no
longer had to point-and-click to record
like how he did something so that's how
I got started in R and then I haven't
really stopped I've said
been using our you know almost every day
since then like many many years ago
mm-hmm very cool so I'm really
interested in this generation of people
who consider our to be their first
programming language so I actually fall
into this camp I did a little bit of
programming in my undergraduate studies
but the classes were exceptionally dry
and boring and we weren't working on
really any interesting problems we were
just talk talking about like big
o-notation and and and programming and
like C++ so I started to learn R and I
was using it for cool and interesting
stuff I was getting exciting outputs
like almost from day one and and that
was enough motivation to propel me
forward and keep learning and then I've
learned R as a programming language and
I don't think I'm alone and I'm curious
what you think about about people like
that and will there be more people like
that in the future that's a good
question I think you know I think that's
the way I learned R so I sort of
identify with it that you know my first
our classes wouldn't you know wouldn't
really touted as programming it was just
like look here's the tool we're gonna
use to get these results and and I knew
so little that it was really like I was
copying the code exactly and like making
these tiny changes to get what I wanted
and I think that's a pretty accessible
way to get started and it's a great way
to see like these you know capabilities
really really quickly of what I can get
you mm-hmm so that you have that
motivation to be like oh well how does
this actually working like how is this a
language how do I learn the structure
and the principles of this language to
start like expressing myself rather than
just like parroting back what somebody
else has told me and I think that will I
think that will continue I think so many
people are seeing are is sort of the the
means to the end like they they need to
get something done and I are as one way
to get it done and I hope that when they
see they can get it done that that sort
of inspire them to learn more yeah and I
think we're in a great place now because
there was the
very few resources that sort of helped
you move from a sort of an AI user to an
art programmer and those resources are
much better and much more available now
so I think sort of see more people
taking that transition as well yeah sure
well at least partly and thanks to you
because the other course that you've
done with us today is the writing
functions in our course and that that is
really the first step to becoming a
programmer it's like when you stop just
being a consumer of other people's
functions that they've compiled into our
packages and you realize that wait a
second people wrote these functions and
I can write my own functions to do
things that they don't do and there's or
things that I want to do for myself
and that's a I think when I started
writing my own functions this one I
really realized the power of programming
because all of a sudden I could
construct my own tools and not rely on
other people's so and and and that
course in particular is very exciting
for me because that's exactly what what
we want to do a data camp we want to
help people make that jump from consumer
of the language to programmer or
developer okay cool
so what what sorts of things are you
most excited about spending your time on
over the next few years good question I
think I mean I think I want to continue
you know continue helping people get
into our and helping people make this
transition to programmers so that means
I want to continue teaching and I think
you know I kind of have two ways of
doing that now one is like helping out
with data camp and getting sort of
reaching this incredibly broad remote
audience but I also really love teaching
in person and having that you know
one-on-one like instant interaction yeah
which I think can be really useful when
you're when you're learning to program
to sort of have someone there to kind of
go through things with you so that's one
sort of thing I'm interested in and
continuing to do and then I definitely
want to get them a little bit more
involved
in the sort of programming in our in
that community
start contributing to two more packages
and and and also sort of start there's
sort of definitely a movement to kind of
open up the community sort of both of
those groups and I'd like to sort of
help and help people that that are
interested in getting involved that
maybe historically haven't been being
involved okay very cool so one great
example of that is like the our ladies
group yeah so I've been in contact with
with them recently and actually recently
opened up a chapter here in Boston oh
and I think that the first meetup might
be next month so I love to attend yeah
you don't have to be a woman to to
attend yeah so so actually jump you just
jumping back to that something you said
a minute ago about making contributions
in the open source community we were
talking about this last night and a
great way to start getting involved in
the open source community is to look at
the github go on github github calm and
find the repositories where the
developers of your favorite packages are
keeping their code and if you're using
their packages frequently you probably
become opinionated about them some
things that they might do differently
and you might even occasionally run
across a bug and with the advent of
version control and code sharing via
places like github you can poke around
and you can find the source code for
whatever it is that's causing the
problem you're having or whatever it is
you think could be done differently or
better and you can actually make changes
so you can create a your own copy of
that of that software make changes to
the code and then propose the changes
back to the the original author in the
form of what's called a pull request and
there's there's no there's no one to
tell you that you can't do this you can
go out to any repository on any public
repository on github tomorrow and make
these suggestions and is up to the
author to decide whether they they
approve of those suggestions and merge
them into the source code that everyone
else will then well then you
so this is a very long-winded way of
asking the question like so what what
role do you see like version control and
these code sharing platforms like github
having in developing future our
developers and maybe what other
suggestions do you have for people who
want to get involved in in software
development or open source or what are
some of the things that you're thinking
about for yourself even sure so I think
I think github
you know this whole idea of version
control and then having it publicly
shared it's sort of amazing like when I
started and our that wasn't happening so
so short open source software you could
dig in and find that source and look at
it there wasn't really a way where you
could sort of ping back to the author
and say hey I've got this idea for a
change is it a good idea you know can I
make it so I think github really
facilitates that that you know ability
for me to grab the code and have a look
at it but also for me to kind of seduce
things back so I think that's been a
great great benefit to the our community
mm-hm there still are a few packages
that aren't on github and it's always
kind of a little bit frustrating when
you come across them because like oh
there's this thing going wrong I really
want to figure it out and try and
suggest a change but I don't know where
the source lives yeah yeah you can
probably still get your hands on the
source but it's it's maybe a little bit
less straightforward or unclear where
it's being kept yeah and I think one
other thing that people are starting to
do is package authors is sort of on that
github readme the kind of keeping track
of you know things that they maybe want
help with or you know how to go about
contributing are they open to
contributions and you think that makes
it a lot easier for people to you know
feel like they can jump in and suggest
something when the authors say hey I
need help
sure um help me out by working on this
yeah it's intimidating to think that
something that that some suggestion that
you put forward is going to be evaluated
by the person whose software you use on
daily basis and that if if that those
changes actually end up getting merged
but now all of a sudden thousands of
people might be using software that
you've played a part in developing so
that that can all be a little bit scary
so I agree actually that's I love I love
the idea of having the the package
developers proactively reaching out to
would be contributors and telling them
how they can contribute in a productive
way and hopefully lowering that that
barrier to entry for people yeah and
it's also nice to see that a lot of
packages are sort of implementing
automated testing so that you know at
least you feel like yes I've made this
this contribution I've made this change
but I know it hasn't broken everything
can you actually just elaborate a little
bit on that for people who might not be
familiar with like Travis CI and that
sort of stuff sure without going into
the Nitty Gritty yeah essentially as
part of the package people will write
sort of a sequence of tests that need to
pass that needs to be successful before
they're going to release the package and
onto cran and let everybody else use it
so when you make a change you can gonna
rerun all those tests and check that
they are all still successful that they
all pass before even that that changes
even sort of considered as a I'm you
know being integrated cool cool so it
allows you to do a self-assessment maybe
before formally proposing changes yeah
to the softly and I think it also if a
package is already implementing that if
you're suggesting something new it sort
of forces you to think about what the
test should be mm-hmm
and that's sort of a nice way to think
about what your code should do and how
it's your function sure yeah that's
really interesting so maybe just to wrap
things up the course that you've been
working on is this is geospatial data
course which is a fun combination of
like manipulating geospatial data like
getting it into our manipulated and and
visualizing it often in the form of maps
you do a lot of work and spatial spatial
statistics why should people be
interested in spatial stats or working
with maps or geospatial day
general why do you think this is an
interesting field and why should people
care about it I think it's a little hard
because I find this sort of inherently
interesting like as soon as something as
location associated with it I want to
stick it on a map I want to be able to
look at a map and maybe that is because
sort of historically maps where our
first visualizations that you know we've
we've been sort of working with maps is
there a human race for you know hundreds
of years yeah sure and I think I think
sort of naturally we're pretty good at
like like oh I want to see on a map show
me a map no we're pretty good at kind of
navigating and exploring them and then I
think you know there are just so many
sort of spatial type you know I think
increasingly you know everything we're
recording so much more location data you
know the people are being tracked with
GPS and their phones like almost 24/7
yeah and that kind of tapping into that
and exploring it is is interesting yeah
yeah sure no I find it very fascinating
and I I agree I love the visual
component and it's it's very it was very
cool to me the first time I built maps
in are because when I first came to our
it was never something that I really
thought about doing in our I thought oh
I can build like a linear regression
yeah no but I as soon as I realized like
there's an API to like Google Maps and
you can like pull in a map with one line
of code and then like plot points on it
with like metadata I was like wow this
is this is extremely powerful and now
there's even tools to make those Maps
interactive mm-hm and put them on
webpages and yeah yeah it just opens up
a lot of a lot of possibilities yeah I
think the first the first GG map map I
made I'd attached a GPS to my cat for a
day so I bought that data back into our
and I could you know put this little
trace on the screen and a plot yeah I'm
still like I have no idea where this is
yeah one line you grab that map from
Gigi Gigi map and it's in the background
I think a second there's my house yeah
and here he is like spend
the entire day at somebody else's house
yeah that's uh that's really interesting
cool a hacker in the truest sense of the
word all right well thanks a lot for
answering the questions this is this is
great yeah it's great to be here all
right cool
