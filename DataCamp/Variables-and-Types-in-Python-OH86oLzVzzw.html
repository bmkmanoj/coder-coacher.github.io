calculator if you want to do more
complex calculations though you'll want
to save values while you're coding along
you can do this by defining a variable
with a specific case sensitive name once
you create or declare such a variable
you can later call up its value by
typing the variable name suppose you
measure your height and weight in metric
units there are 1.79 meters tall and
weigh sixty eight point seven kilograms
can assign these values to two variables
named height and weight with an equal
sign if you now type the name of the
variable height bioethanol looks for
this name retrieves its value and prints
it out let's now calculate the body mass
index or BMI which is calculated as
follows with weight in kilograms and
height in meters can do this with the
actual values but you can just as well
use the variables a height and weight
like in here every time you type the
variables name you're asking Python to
change it with the actual value of the
variable weight corresponds to sixty
eight point seven and height two 1.79
finally this version has Python star
results in a new variable BMI BMI now
contains the same value as a one you
calculated earlier in Python variables
are used all the time they help to make
your code reproducible suppose the go to
create a height weight and BMI variables
are in the script like this if you now
want to recalculate the BMI for another
weight you can simply change the
Declaration of the weight variable and
rerun the script the BMI changes
accordingly because the value of the
variable weight has changed as well so
far we've only worked with numerical
values should set sides and weight in
Python these numbers all have a specific
type you can check out the type of value
with a type function to see the type of
our BMI value simply write type and then
BMI inside parentheses you can see that
it's a float which is pythons way of
representing a real number so a number
which can have both an integer part and
a fractional part - also has a type for
integers ends like this example to do
data science can lead more than insane
floats though by some features tons of
data types the most common ones are
strings and boolean x' a string is
pythons way to represent text you can
use both double and single quotes to
build a string as you can see from these
examples if you print the type of the
last variable here you see that it's STR
short for string the boolean is a type
that can either be true or false can
think of it as yes and no in everyday
language boolean's will be very useful
in the future to perform filtering
operations on your data for example
there's something special about Python
data types have looked this line of code
that sums two integers and then this
line of code that sums two strings for
integers the values were summed over the
strings the strings were pasted together
the plus operator behaved differently
for different data types this is a
general principle how the code behaves
depends on the types you're working with
in the exercises that follow you will
create your first variables and
experiment with some of pythons data
types I'll see you in the next video to
explain all about lists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
