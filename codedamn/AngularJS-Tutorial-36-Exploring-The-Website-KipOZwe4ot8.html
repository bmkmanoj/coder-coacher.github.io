who and welcome to your 36th angularjs
tutorial this tutorial I'm not gonna
cover anything about angular cheers
instead I'm gonna show you my website
this code uncom which is this channel's
official website and I have been working
past four or five months on this website
whenever I get free time because you
know managing this channel and creating
a website from scratch up is gonna
time-consuming I won't say it's
difficult but it's kind of
time-consuming so whenever I get time I
write here on go down for like you can
say these are kind of little
documentation for the languages if you
want to read like some contextual
material and I know that this website is
not fully developed right now but what I
want from you guys is that I really want
that you visit this website and for
those who are learning angular the guys
you're seeing that so you want to learn
angular and I have written everything
myself here
so I have written like I guess seven to
eight pages from now but all of this
stuff each and every line has been
written by me and I have been doing this
from like two to three months for
angular not really due to three months I
guess it's a month or so and for other
things as well and doing like four HTML
from the starting so I really want you
guys to go to these URLs and interact
with the website I want to get the
feedback of the users I have also
installed this comment section right
here you can just start the discussion
or post your suggestions I have even
this page ready if you want to report a
glitch or something I know this website
is highly under development right now
but I just want to develop this website
for you guys and with you guys so that
you know every developer who want to
kick-start his career in programming
language
find it easy to learn that language so
you know you can just go ahead and read
all of these I have written these all
myself so you know I just made sure that
this text isn't boring to read and I
have included my silly jokes as well
sometimes in between so yeah so that's
pretty much it and one last thing I'm
going to show you is that you can use
this editor as well
this code damn editor which you see
right here and you can edit the code
life and you can see the changes here so
you don't need to you know just go ahead
and open your notepad and save that
somewhere on your document and just make
your desktop ugly so that won't be about
that would be avoided and about the form
which I was talking that I would create
a form and would upload all the source
code of the YouTube tutorials there I'll
be doing that field soon so that's all
for this video and I really hope you
guys that you would come to this website
and leave your valuable suggestions so
thank you I'm looking forward for your
wizard and that's it pretty much and
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
