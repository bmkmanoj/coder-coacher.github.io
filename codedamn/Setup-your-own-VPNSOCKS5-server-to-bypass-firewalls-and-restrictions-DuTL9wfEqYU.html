Mei hole and welcome to another
screencast for godamm obviously so in
this tutorial what I'm gonna do is show
you how you can set up your own proxy
server or what you can call it as a wee
peon well I won't call it a whip yen
it's technically a socks5 server which
would allow you to securely browse
internet all the time
now there are a lot of advantages of
using such a server the first one being
is that you can access everything which
was restricted before and I'm telling
you from my experience I am on a network
right now which is so badly restricted
I cannot even access sites like
speedtest.net you won't believe that
so my network denies access to some of
the most basics websites as well plus
the other thing is that if you are
worried that your ISP is stalking you or
eavesdropping upon your connections or
you know anything anybody's inserting
some sort of ads in your web experience
this is the tutorial you are working for
right so by the end of this tutorial
what I'm going to do is tell you and
make sure that you have set it up
correctly a socks5 server you are using
that with your browser and you're
accessing every frickin site you want so
let's just start now before starting
what I want is a server owned by you
somewhere on the globe now the reason
for this is that what we are essentially
doing in this tutorial is that we are
giving all of our information which you
want to access from the Internet to
another server which we own so we trust
that it's safe right and that's over
then on the behalf of us get started
information from the internet and
returns to us now all this thing would
be happening over encrypted channels so
you don't have to worry your data would
be fully encrypted and nobody in the
middle except you and your server knows
what the heck is going on
alright so to get that so er what you
want to do is that go to this link vit
dot l-wire slash in motion 16 now what
this is and what the hell in motion is
actually is that these guys are hosting
or these guys are hosting providers
right and they would give you a server
now when I say they would give you a
server I say that they would give you a
part of the server and you would be able
to access that server as if it was your
server right and once you access that
server what you can do is take your
computer right here which you're using
to connect to that server and you can
later on tell that server to connect to
internet on your behalf sounds are hell
a lot complicated but trust me it's not
even a matter of five minutes to setup
this thing so let's start and once you
visit that link which is bi d dot ly /
in motion - 60 which gives you a
humongous discount of about 60% on their
hosting plans in
see that is three point four nine
dollars per month instead of going to
eight dollars per month which is their
standard price and trust me this is the
cheapest kind of socks5 proxy server or
weepy end you can get for yourself with
the guarantee that this is owned by you
nobody's eavesdropping you don't have to
trust any third party companies or
whatever right for your privacy so once
you get this what I want to do is order
this for two years right and this would
give me for around 85 bucks for two
years and that's I think it's amazingly
cheap to begin with so if I sign up for
this you can see that actually I have
doing god so yeah it's around 84 bucks
so you can just go ahead and purchase
the domain you can make use of that
domain later on in your life but what we
essentially want right now is the
hosting pad and once you're done with
that what I want you is to log into your
EMP so actually once you create once you
continue once you pay these guys these
guys will send you a login you can use
that even address and password to login
into your ANP and let me just login into
there and we'll see you on the other
side all right so I just logged into my
EMP and now I can always it this thing
so yeah one more thing I want to show
you guys is that before we go any
further I wanna show you my IP address
which is this thing 103 point something
something something which I'm gonna hide
for I don't know just privacy reasons
and all right not a problem we can go to
my subscriptions I'm not really it's not
billing yeah hosting one so you can see
that my connection is actually it's
actually pathetic right so
thing this roxrite proxy would also push
this connection a little bit because
every time you're just doing that
sending stuff and receiving stuff from
one tunnel instead of querying your DNS
every time which might be slow for your
ISP let me just get a hold of this thing
all right so we are in now the next
thing I wanna do is actually set up SSH
access do my machine right now and the
reason for that is that our computer
will what it'll do is that it would open
something known as it done all do this
server so what a tunnel does is that it
will protect all of the chunk you're
sending in all of your precious data
from being accessed by the outside world
right so what I want to do is go down a
little bit and you should be able to see
cPanel obviously you first of all need
to get into your cPanel right and let us
just redirect so here are some important
information which you might want to take
a look at right just go to the server
information thing and in the same tab
what I want you to do is go to this SSH
access now click on this manage SSH keys
and what I want you to do is generate a
new key now when you do that what it
does is that it generates a public key
which is stored on your server and a
private key which is which it would give
you to download on your computer now
what does private key can do is that it
can access that's the way the server
knows yes I am talking to a computer
which actually wants me right so that's
the way so you can name this key
whatever you like like SSH
something like this and you can give it
a password as well copy this thing yup
and you can keep the algorithm to by
default you can just generate this thing
right so now you can just go back and
what I want you to do next is authorize
this key
don't miss this out I spent hours
searching what I was doing wrong and at
the end I just found that I just haven't
authorized the ski so what I want you to
do next is generate your newly generated
key download your newly generated key by
this thing just go ahead and download
this key and this should get you started
all right so from here onwards things
split a little bit for a pretty operated
operating ooh operating system specific
users windows guys I am not really sure
how you can do this but if you can get
something like what do you see a kid
bash right you can make use of this SSH
inbuilt command to open that particular
tunnel so I would highly recommend you
to download this thing get bash just
google it download this windows guys and
you should be able to access what we are
doing what we are about to do right now
with a Mac terminal or Linux terminal
right okay so we have our file the
private key file right here with us do
next is take a whole of this thing and
our user name where's our user name
where is our username boy it was
somewhere in cPanel right yeah there we
go and make sure I have password in my
crab boil
right so what I want to do next is hop
over to my tamil looks beautiful just
open downloads folder so what I wanted
to do next is do SSH SSH
add key and SHS which is your name of
your key hit enter okay you would get
this thing so to fix this I didn't need
to do is change the permissions to 400
so that the private key becomes kind of
small private as I say now do this thing
again the passphrase here for SH s would
be same as what you enter so I just
pasted my password here and it said
identity added so the phosphorus is this
thing for this key
and what do you want to do next is
actually move this guy so what we want
to do is copy this thing to SSH and yeah
that's pretty much it so you just copy
this thing once you do that once you're
done with all that stuff what I want you
to do is write SSH not this is important
current user is this your username Co de
df5 add the rate the thing we'll take a
look here this one nine nine right which
is our server name this one 99.9 not go
on /b to to to do now what this means is
that hey guy I just added to my system
that I own the server by this SHS key
and now I want to connect to this
machine which had a user name of this at
this thing and the port number I'm using
to connect to this is dudududu hit enter
and you should be able to get into your
machine now if you're doing it for the
first time you would see a dialog box
where it would ask you for a
confirmation where it would just say do
you want to actually add this too
list of trusted whatever it is you just
have to write yes there and once you
write yes there you should be able to
see something like this right and oh boy
you're almost done so what I want to do
know now is this exit out of it all
right now fasten your seat belts because
we're gonna do something like this
I don't know hop here so that we do not
close our tunnel because we closed
terminal or something like that no help
SSH then the thing is perfectly fine
but what I want to do is enable the gzip
compression with C flag and flag is just
make sure the tunnel is up I don't want
to access the terminal right there and D
flag is the port number
I want to forward all of my requests on
my local computer to this server now
what this means is that I would write
like 9999 here so what this would do is
that when I send any particular request
on my computer to localhost port number
nine nine nine nine it would send that
particular request do this SSH tunnel
which we have open right now and don't
worry if that doesn't make sense
I'll just make in a minute hit enter and
I'll just see this a pending output will
no help not out perfectly fine if you
see this you are almost done now what I
want you to do next is open your network
settings right here and go to Advanced
Cell first of all select whatever
network you're connected to go to
advanced go to whatever network you're
on go to proxies and select this socks
proxy just stick it make sure the socks
proxy server for you is localhost the
pose number is the same port number
which you are using right here all right
99 a and you don't need a password for
this because we already have a SSH
tunnel established hit okay hit apply
and bam you're done now you are
accessing internet on the behalf of this
server you own let me just give you a
quick proof of that
let's just open speedtest and boom there
you go by now we are accessing speedtest
on the behalf of the server we own which
is this in motion hosting you can see
that our IP has changed I'm extremely
happy because I'm able to access a lot
of websites that we are able to access
block website as well and I can go to IP
leak dotnet as well so that and it is
very far that we are actually protected
you can see that I'm somewhere in the
United States no I'm in India rather
right whereas the RTC is still leaking
my private IP address but it doesn't
matter right so yeah yay we are private
now and have fun so when we want connect
to let's say you want to browse securely
on the Mac what you can do is set a
global soft v proxy and it will get you
started on Ubuntu I'm pretty much sure
this should be a way to make this thing
a global software proxy and probably
better than Mac but I haven't actually
tried that out I'm going to yet so you
might want to give it a try
further Firefox out-of-the-box provides
you do setup socks5 proxy because chrome
just works on the system level proxy so
I have to do it right here but Firefox
provides it out of the box inside the
Firefox setting as well so you can try
that out so to summarize what we did is
first of all purchased a server from in
motion hosting right then what we did is
we created an SSH key pair we downloaded
the private key we try to add that key
do our SSH it was ignored we change the
permissions we try to add it again
it was added we copied our SSH key into
our SSH keys directory we SSH into our
server it was working we created a final
tunnel which looks beautiful and we are
working on Internet purely anonymous and
secure so whatever you send right here
would be encrypted
so yeah that's pretty much it for this
tutorial and if you liked it then please
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching and at the last I would
also tank my first patreon subscriber
and that is job below so kudos to you
man I'm gonna make you do this to host
hey I can't host a free are not really
free
but the server of emotion on his patreon
subscription right so yeah I might try
to do a giveaway as well for an ear or
something so yeah that's all for this
one and again if you liked it then
please don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching and all the links
