May hood and welcome to your yet another
tutorial for messenger chat bot
development in which I'm gonna show you
how to send images as replies right so
Facebook provides you an API to do that
and what you have to do here is you have
to add another field inside your JSON
data which would be the attach and
actually this would be inside message
only wouldn't be outside that so message
would contain an attachment right and
this attachment and let's just get rid
of the text for now this attachment
would be something of a type which would
be an image right and next you need to
pass in payload right so the payload
would contain information about the
image right so here you can pass in the
URL of the image or what you can do
instead is that you can leave the
payload as empty but attach an image
from your server itself in our case it
would be my computer only but if your
images or whatever you want to send is
toll on your server instead of URL or
actually you can just pass in the same
URL as well but if you want to upload
the image instead of sending a URL then
what you have to do is leave the payload
blank and inside your call request you
have to upload the image and to do that
just make use of the file create here
like my file is a file create and and
yeah make sure you're running I guess
over PHP version 5 because before that
what you have to do is you have to first
of all get the file path file path and
instead of this gs1 data what do you
have to pass in is an array with a field
file contents right so not this one then
you have to pretty much you know make it
an associative array and pass in the
information about your file right so
let's just leave it to JSON for now and
we'll just take a look at that later how
to do that
with actually on file on the server so
you can just google it if you want to
I'm just gonna skip over this and just
go to URL instead so the payload would
contain a URL typically if you want to
show an image and this URL this could be
anything actually so let's just say if I
copy the URL or the image link address
write this one and I pass in something
like this right I save the file and I
make sure that nothing is broken right
looks like okay so now if I go to my
chat board and I have already made
changes to the web hook because I have
started and grew up again and the
message now and say like hey there
then they were receiving a request on
and rock
well
it works right so there should not be a
problem we have the chat board and the
file is updated as well so hey there and
we are not getting requests right so it
is something to do with Facebook and oh
okay yeah I get it
I have to we subscribe the page right so
you subscribe it because my bad book was
disabled because it was inactive for
over eight hours so yeah that's the
thing as well so now if I pass in hi
this you see that I get an image as a
response right and obviously Facebook
actually parses it into its own URL
before you know it won't directly
display the URL which you are passing so
that is how pretty much you pass in URL
or actually images and what like you can
do as an assignment is that you can just
create an array of images here and
actually the URLs only and what those QR
else could be is like since our borders
about a chalkboard right so you can
create images regarding memes right so
you can just Google some and you can
modify the code here as well to say that
if there's a matching query for like
send me an image or you know a picture
or a meme or you know you can just make
it a random as well sometimes you send
and text choke and sometimes you send in
right so you can just make it a bit
interesting as well so that can be done
and that's pretty straightforward
actually because the main implementation
is just the API call right and we have
done here and as I told you for the
local image sending what you have to do
is just leave this payload blank and
upload a URL an image here using your
either your C or file create or just
directly attaching it in the post fields
with the file contents as the extra
header in JSON data which we need right
and actually just passing in as JSON
data but you might want to pass in this
as an array right so you can just do
that as well if you want to if you want
to try out just do this and if you face
any problem then let me know and I'll
just shoot it to rely on that as well so
that is all for this one and if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching and in the
coming tutorials
we're gonna see how to create actually
smarter BOTS and pretty much we haven't
actually just seen the other data types
which you can send in like you can
create allies little menu for the user
to select from and all that weird stuff
right so there's a lot to learn and a
lot to explore as well so that is all
for this one and if you like that then
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching I'll see you then in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
