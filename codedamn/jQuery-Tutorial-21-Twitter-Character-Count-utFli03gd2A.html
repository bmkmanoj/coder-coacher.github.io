21st jQuery tutorial in which we'll be
building a Twitter like status character
count limiter so in this tutorial we'll
be learning a couple of things a couple
of more things we have not been learning
past tutorials and let's see how it
works so Twitter has a kind of a text
box for the status update our limits its
status update to 150 characters so let's
build a kind of such text box in our own
jQuery and HTML files so for the HTML
part we need a text area with a kind of
ID to grab this character count would be
a nice one so in script Egeus we
obviously want a status
to update the user and in the jQuery
file
must've bug
let's get the text text box as in the
variable text box so let's copy this
here we have I'd also get the status
the span so here we go now let's reload
this and we have a text box down here
status which is not as well because we
don't have anyone dead now let's supply
a variable with maximum length as 150
characters now we would use this
variable for basically validation
purposes so let's see how it works now
we would attach a text box dot key down
function now what would happen is each
time there's a key down on this text box
this event would fire up right here so
let's see
now the first task you need to do with
the get to get the number of characters
in our text box so let's do that now
let's insert the maximum length in span
as well the status box so it doesn't
appear empty to user when the user
visits for first time so let's say
status dot text maximum length plus
characters left
so here we go let's reload this and
we're good to go 150 characters left so
now let's grab the number of characters
in this text box right now so we'll use
this to target this text box dot eval to
get the value and dot length which is a
string property to get the number of
characters the length of characters in
this text box so
now what we want to do is we would like
to update the status box with number of
sta tus number of characters left so
status dot text would be maximum length
which is in case 150 minus T characters
which we have down here in this
and now we'll see how this works let's
rid of this resize a bit let's see
and I'd like to do like
there's Plus let's just bracket this so
that there's no confusion
just a minute okay so there was a call
from a mall anyways so we have this code
down here and let's see now let's reset
this a bit hello world sweet now this is
updating every time but let's say we
reach the zero margin now I want
something to inform the user that you
are exceeding your length so what we can
do is we can apply some CSS to it once
the user which is zero so what we'll do
is we'll do if maximum length is less
than the characters so what should
happen then I would like to apply some
CSS status which is the status box dot
CSS
the color should become red
and or else if it's still lower than
this then I would like to revert the
color of CSS box to black now this event
is necessary to call because once you
exceeds then this would fire and once
user comes back to the limit then we
should have the color reverted back to
black so we have to write this code
now let's reload this and see what
happens say hello world now let's copy
this down as you can see let's see now
once we reaches
the zero now whenever I type the next
character this would become red so
that's how we create a kind of Twitter
account widget like widget in jQuery and
HTML so I hope you like this tutorial
I'll see you there next time don't
