hole and welcome to your 19th annular 2
tutorial in which will be finally
finishing off with our simple car
application which we have been
developing so far so what I'm gonna do
in this tutorial is that I'm gonna add a
bit of code so that we can actually pass
the card from one component to another
and yes we can do that using services
something called a services and angle 2
but we are a little bit far away from
discussing about that and it might take
a bit of time as well so for this
application purpose I'm just gonna push
all of the card stuff into the what do
you say that local storage actually so
yeah so let's get started
now I'm gonna say local storage dot got
items yes and remember that you can only
store strings and local storage so I'm
gonna say in this dot card right there
so here we go we'll just go to resources
click on any item we see that the Cod
items are added as it is so we have
these three items and again if I go to
my card page we do have the local
storage intact so what I can do is
inside my component card I can see that
my public God is actually json dot parse
local storage dot get item and we have
the key name ask are items items and
voila as you can see we got all of these
things right here lined up perfectly now
what you can do is that you can actually
make the templates of both of these web
pages similar for example you can just
copy this header and paste it inside
this card module and you might then get
a similar feel and look for the whole
web application
and this was a quick tutorial on how to
just fix up your card page so that it
displays all of that stuff and as an
assignment what I can give you is that
you can just make use of a cross here
which would what it would do is that it
would actually just remove this movie
from the card and I might even tell you
the algorithm for that you just have to
search for the local storage having this
get item or you can just from the card
itself you can just make use of the
index of property to remove whatever add
index this item is located or again a
better solution is that since they are
in the same you know in the same order
of they're the same order in which they
are located in this card array what you
can do is you can just get on the click
of each of these allies you can get the
location where each of the Allah for
example this one is at 0th position this
word is first this one is second then
accordingly you can just pop it out out
of array or not pop it out but actually
just you know just kind of make it null
because if you just pop it out then if
there's another movie down the list you
you know you just get the idea you can
just kind of do it if you want to so
what you have to do as an assignment I'm
giving you is that just make sure that
you have a cross button here which on
clicking just removes the local storage
this item from local storage and again
if I just go back to this page I must
have the option to add that movie again
and yes I guess I told you about that
assignment actually whoa so we have
actually removed some sort of things
right from the local storage that might
be some sort of glitch in the program
oh okay so the problem is that every
time I am actually clicking on this
visiting this page it is actually
creating the same re again and again the
empty one so again what I can do to fix
is that I can either check whether
there's an aria-label in the local
storage and if it is then use that
particular re instead of just creating a
new one and again I'll leave this to you
guys
so that's all for this tutorial and from
the next tutorial we'll be learning
something new about angular 2 and
something interesting as well and again
we are not completely done with routing
there is a lot to learn in routing and
we have just begun so that's all for
this tutorial and I'll see you then in
the next series of angular 2 I don't
know what will be creating but that will
be awesome so thank you for watching and
