your twelfth jQuery tutorial in which
we'll be discussing about a very
important even toddler in jQuery which
is the on event now this is kind of very
important when you are doing
Chikara ad production sites because many
times you have to receive dynamic data
and create dynamic HTML and attach even
handlers to them so let's see what this
method does and why do we need it so
let's create a button down here in the
body let's say create a div so in the
script we have that's pretty function to
create a div create a death and let's
say what if equals
just a normal string variety
let's give it a class
d diff and dynamic discs
I am
so this is our function
let's do button but after this simple
enough we are just creating a random
string a div and just appending this
trip to the button which is this button
down here cool now let's attach an even
handler to the button which would say
button one click let's assign this
create a div so on clicking this this
function drop down here would fire so
far so good now suppose I want to attach
an even handler whenever the person
clicks any of these dynamic divs
so the method the method you would think
to do this would be the class name or
click
god
they're stiff
so we have called the stiff let's say
load
you just call me okay so we have this
ready now according to you this even
should fire wherever I click this
dynamic tip now let's see what happens
there's the browser let's refresh this
let's create a lot of tips all of these
are deaths but when you click on any one
of them then this even down here is not
fired and the reason is because whenever
the click event is fired it would look
inside the Forrestal
dontrey which has not been modified to
search for this element so what it would
return is that this event would say to
the original browser door to give me a
reference of the element which was typed
in the document instead of just created
automatically by a script so the
original door would say that I don't
have any element any as such element so
this even won't call at all to fix this
thing we have the on event on event
method which works on dynamic content
generation as well so let's take this
fix this
it's great d/deaf basically to call on
the ephod what you have to do is supply
a document or body or any element which
is the parent of the element you want to
click for instance document would be the
parent of all elements you can also
supply HTML or body down here but that
should not be dynamically generated so
remember this when you're using on the
on method then remember that the
selectors should be already present in
the original Dom tree and should be the
parent of the function you want to call
off the event you want to call for
example document would be the parent of
the stiff HTML would be the parent of
the stiff body would be the parent of
the stiff
none of those except these two have
access to them so therefore I would use
document you could also use HTML or body
or whatever you like but I'll just use
document
now the first argument we would supply
the event the second argument would take
the selector and the third argument
would take the function so let's fill
these three places in the first we want
the even to be click the second should
be the DTF the selector should be did if
on which we want to file this event and
the third function should be called as
death as we have already created down
here up here basically so we are ready
with this now let's see an our browser
let's refresh this let's create some
dips so let's click on any of these
strips and as you can see we got an
alert box you just call me and now this
works on every death and because now
this event a chat attach this to the
click event do every dynamic element as
well in the document so basically on
keyword or on method is very useful when
you are doing large products because
many times you would like to receive
dynamic data generation from the user
from the client-side actually attach
various kinds of even Stewart so all
comes very handy so instead of click you
could actually use any event down here
like
or anything you want like mouse-over
and on is a kind of parent to own evils
all events would work and would make
these events work on the dynamic
elements as well so that's all for this
tutorial and I'll see you then in the
next trip thanks for watching and don't
