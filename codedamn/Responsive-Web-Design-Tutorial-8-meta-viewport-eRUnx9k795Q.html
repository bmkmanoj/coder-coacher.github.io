May ho and welcome to your egg
responsive web design tutorials in which
I'm going to only talk about this guy
right here so what this is doing what we
have actually added to make a riptide
work is this viewport and secretly I
have used it all the time without
telling you so that are this thing
device toolbar works with Chrome now see
if I or I actually have mapped it to the
real domain so it wouldn't date the real
time give me a sec okay we are done so
let's just start okay so it's solving
from the local copy now and let's see if
I move disk and look at the iPhone
reload you can see our display is whole
messed up right like never before like
it was never responsive at all let's see
if I add this reload you can see it's
back to responsive so what what the heck
is this essentially doing well this
defines the viewport of your website
that means it tells the device it tells
the website what your device this and
how the website should behave so it
pretty much tells your code that the
width of the device is whatever the
device width is and the initial scale
you should neither zoom in or zoom out
so it is extremely important line you
should add before deploying your code in
the production because if you miss this
line your code would still be responsive
when you scale the website but it would
not be responsive on live websites and
by the way you're seeing this broken
image because it's switched from the
three bar entity to an image because I
tested it on my phone and it just showed
a square the unknown square
um which kind of made me realize that it
might not have been supported on a lot
of the devices as well so yeah that was
a very quick tutorial on viewport and
then you just have to add this to make
it work and what do we have in here yeah
we're missing something right okay right
so yeah that's all for this one and if
you liked it then don't forget subscribe
and thank you for watching and the next
one I'll be finally showing you it live
on my device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
