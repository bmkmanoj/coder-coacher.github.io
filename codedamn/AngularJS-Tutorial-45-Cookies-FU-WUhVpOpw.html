angularjs tutorial my name is May ho and
in this tutorial I'm going to show you
about angular cookies and using this
library you could pretty much work with
cookies on your web application and
they're pretty handy if you are
developing an application which needs to
store some sort of result for the user
or the Preferences in the browser or you
know pretty much you don't want to
implement signup functionality for just
storing up pretty much a simple setting
the user want like I don't know like
their image URL or even their name or
something so you just don't want to just
create another big database and handle
that so you can just make you love
cookies for your application so as long
as the user doesn't clear up their
browser cookies you'll be good to go
so first of all what you have noticed as
we have might noticed is that I have
loaded this file and the library angular
cookies window cheese and the path is
pretty much same just like angularjs but
on different arises in the noodle part
of this part that is this is angular
mintages and this is angular cookies
mintages so pretty much everything else
the same then the next thing is that I'm
running this browser on localhost
instead of my fight protocol because
cookies are not yet supported by
browsers on fire protocol but you could
eventually make it work by launching
Chrome browser with some pre enabled
flags or something like that you can
just google that and you'll get it so
inside your controller dot GS let's say
I do like scope dot my cookie well is
cookies and yes I have added dependency
for this and cookies as a parameter so
I'm going to say cookies dot get and
this is cookie let's just say this is
the name of the cookie so in this case -
cookie Holly and pretty much I'm just
going to display it
my cookie rod right there so if I look
at in the browser
nothing happens very much because we
don't have any cookies set up right now
for our application so let's do some so
I'm gonna say at the end of the
application or let's just make it more
interesting by adding an input field
instead I'm going to say this is input
type text ngmodel
cookie well and right here I'm gonna say
button ng click is set cookie cookie val
and let's just say update cookie value
right there and inside my controller if
i create a function scope dot set key
let me just see what this was yes set
cookie only so this is a function and
what this would do is actually set your
cookie so it's going to say it cookies
dot put now these get and put methods
are important and you could kind of
remember them as well because they are
relatively simple to understand and
remember because gate accepts one
argument that is the cookie name and put
obviously to that is the cookie name and
then the value which you want to store
in the cookie so I'm going to say cookie
and then value as well and pretty much
we are done with this application so if
I reload this and enter like hello there
update cookie value and reload you can
see that pretty much my text appears
here and it stays there and if I write
something else then it actually cannot
you know rewrites it instead of like
appending it or something so what you
can do outside out of these cookies is
that I guess we created a login
application with angular sometime ago
with
I don't remember exactly how I did that
but I guess I made it using resolve
function inside my login route so that I
can check if the user is logged in or
not so what you can make use of these
cookies as is that you can just create
that login application without resolve
but using cookies on the front-end then
with a simple code modification you
could even change the whole
functionality into a secured
functionality by transferring the login
information on the backend and cookie
validation as well so in this way you
could pretty much create a full-featured
angular login application which is
actually working so that's all pretty
much for this tutorial and if you liked
it then don't think to subscribe thank
