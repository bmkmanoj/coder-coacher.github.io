coding this is going to be about a
weight and async now these things await
and async are built on the top of
promises so if you have no idea what
promises are then I guess you might not
be ready for the story oh so if you want
to check that out there's a link in the
description for the promises video and
that should be I guess enough for you
getting started with promises now async
await in JavaScript in es6 rather is
kind of cool because it makes your
asynchronous code look and behave like
synchronous cooling and then finally you
can make use of all the try catch or
blocking system as well just like you
would do in promises but with this catch
and you know the reject methods so let's
just take a quick look at what
difference a sink and a wait brings us
to us let's just say you have a function
which is async function which performs a
bunch of asynchronous operations so
let's just say we get LED image is the
get image we first of all get the image
then let's say we got off processor
image in processed image process is a
processed image and the problem here is
that you cannot pass an image what you
have to do is something like image dot
then and then value and then do
something like process image or maybe
just like that and then and then and
then all that stuff that is kind of ok
but a single weight when you can use
make use of that it simplifies your skin
a lot of life it makes it look a lot
like synchronous and easier to read and
handle so you could literally do
something like this even if image is
synchronous how well you can make
JavaScript wait for this promise this
promise right here which this function
would return for the ass
value so we're going to stay awake and
get a mage so let's just quickly create
this function function get image and we
can just return a new promise right here
which would either resolve or reject and
we can just create a little three half
second and we can just say resolve done
all right so what happens now is that
JavaScript would actually block the code
until it gets a value from this result
well what well if JavaScript does that
nonetheless it will just block the full
script obviously because javascript is
running on a single thread well that
won't happen and the reason that would
happen is that we would write async with
this and whenever you make use of a
weight you have to write a thing with
that function and that being said you
cannot make use of a weight inside
global scope right here you cannot do
something like this just under your
window right that won't work so to make
use of a weight you need an async
function and the reason you need an
async function is because JavaScript
would kind of act like waiting for all
the asynchronous operations done by done
instead of its regular asynchronous
behavior of callbacks or like kind of
like promises then right so now when we
get to this line right here the moment
we get to this line right here our image
already do has a value of this done
right so it would literally JavaScript
would literally wait a second for on
this line and again with a think what
happens is that all this thing all the
values inside it is internally wrap in
the promise so when you call async
function you automatically get access to
this Bend right because this returns a
promise even though you do not have any
kind of like return from
I saw return anything or result or
reject anything right there so what we
can do is we can create another function
which is process image and we can get
this image string which in this case
would be done and we can pretty much
just return another promise we just
append the image strings with again
right so yeah and then finally what we
can do is just like a regular function
we can return the process and this would
appear as the been data right here
because again this returns us a promise
and whatever you return right here is
returned as a result value whatever you
throw in this function is returned as
the catch or as an error value right
here inside the promise so if we take a
look in the browser now and if we reload
this hit the console we would see that
process image is not defined I guess we
have some sort of type order and reload
this again so you can see now we get
done again Holly now the reason for that
is we are just going to long it right
here so we can control look the stuff
here as well and we should be good to go
and we can just constant log done here
so if we hit reload now you can see that
we get done after a second then another
second passes by we get done again and
then finally inside this function right
here we get done again so you can see
how your asynchronous function looks
like both of these are asynchronous or
actually I guess we are missing the
awake keyword here this should be await
right and the reason why it was working
without a wait as well is that process
was eventually a promise and you are
actually returning a promise from async
functionally so it doesn't matter right
because again you're going to wait for
that so that time this returns the
promise but this time it would be just a
value so if we console.log console.log
standings and process this process would
be a value now so if we reload this you
can see we get done done again we're
going to send done again and not a
promise and we finally get done again so
yes that's pretty much it about async
and a weight and it's kind of a lot easy
to use as compared to callbacks and in a
lot of case promises as well obviously
because it makes your code look like
synchronous and it's kind of extremely
easy to manage as well so it makes it
extremely easy if you kind of want to do
asynchronous dot in a specific order
right you do not want to spoil them all
at once
so in that situation it can come handy
and yeah and all sort of stuff you can
make use of async and wait one thing
about this is that you cannot directly
make use of async await for callbacks
and the reason for that is that a wait
expects promise in front of it right so
you can see that we are returning a
promise here we are returning a promise
there and then only we are making use of
this awake so if you want if you have a
function which kind of fits a callback
accepts a callback then you might want
to create another function wrap it
inside a promise and then inside its
callback you can resolve that promise
and then make use of a weight so yes
that's how pretty much you would get
started with it and that's all for this
one and if you liked it then please
