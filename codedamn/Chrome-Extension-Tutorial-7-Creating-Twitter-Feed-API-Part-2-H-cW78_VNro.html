Minho and welcome to your seventh Chrome
extension development tutorial in which
you're going to continue with our
Twitter feed and let's just create this
so right now you can see that we are
just loading background edges out of
nowhere so we can just include jQuery as
well because it would help us in
manipulating the Dom response you're
going to get back the HTML response so
the idea would be essentially that we're
going to hit go to calm we're going to
hit our get request to this get all the
HTML back and right here you can see
that inside HTML we do have this these
tweet information so we can pretty much
just read directly from the HTML instead
of doing any sort of other API callbacks
and parsing JSON objects and all that
stuff plus it gives us the benefit that
the user need not to authenticate into
your app user just needs to be logged in
inside
Twitter only so okay what the background
OGS would look like is that pretty much
first of all we're going to get some
data and we can do that by writing like
get data and again I'm going to make use
of promises in this extension so if you
want to learn a bit about promises what
they are then check out the link in the
description I would place a link for the
video which had did a week or two ago on
promises and it should give you a start
so again we have this get data so this
would return us a promise with all the
information we need and when this
information is with us what I want to do
is first of all to check if notification
is already shown to the user so we can
just say check it exists and info and
we're going to write the definition for
this function as well which would again
return us a promise then what I want to
do is actually create create Chrome
extension from notification right and
then again we would have the simple
we're going to say save the link so that
we do not
show the notification again right so we
were we would choose some sort of unique
identifier here so that we can identify
the notification uniquely all right so
now let's just implement these things so
we're going to start off with function
get data and what this would do is the
turn of a new promise which would be the
result or reject and we're going to get
a get request to Twitter and once we
have a data with us first of all I would
just like to console.log this data to
see what this is so if we reload this
extension go to background page and we
get some sort of problem here
dah dah dah some missing bracket on
there I'm not really sure where showed
that missing bracket after argument list
where the heck on line eleven nine
eleven oh this is a federal function
right we load diagram page you can see
that we get this error
xmlhttprequest cannot load this all
right this is perfectly fine and valid
as well because obviously any JavaScript
should not any JavaScript on internet
should not be able to access any Twitter
account which is logged in or any sort
of other account right so this is a sort
of a protection mechanism provided by
the browser and it is available in all
the browsers but with Chrome extensions
what you can do is you can request the
permission to access Twitter on the
behalf of user right and this would
allow you to access and that ajax
request to Twitter so if we reload this
now go to the background page wait a
little
we should see some sort of response from
data now
and let's just try one more time might
be some sort of interconnectivity and if
I reload the location go to networks we
do have this request ending and not sure
why my internet might not be working
correctly right we can just check yeah
looks like my internet is down right now
so yeah let's stop I'm not sure let's
just wait for it to get up again alright
resetting the router always works fine
so again let's just reload and hit the
background page hit the console and you
can see that we got all this data chunk
back and we want to process it with
jQuery now so we're going to extract
some data from the all the HTML using
jQuery and we're going to show that at
notification to the user and yes that's
very much it for this tutorial we're
going to do that in the next one and if
you liked it then please don't forget

really help
so again yeah see you then in the next
