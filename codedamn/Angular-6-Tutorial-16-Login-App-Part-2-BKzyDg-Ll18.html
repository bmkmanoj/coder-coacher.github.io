middle and welcome to your second hang
Euler six tutorial in which we're gonna
continue with our log in application
which we have been developing so far
from one tutorial yeah so let's get
started alright so when this tutorial
we're gonna cover some back-end part and
create some validation so that we can
send the data across the server so if
take a look at our side what we have
right now is that we can just go to this
login page and we can just go to this
admin page and everything is open right
now so we can do is that we can program
to get this text out of when we click on
the summit button and then send it to
server alright so now to do that we go
to login component and right here we
have this login user event so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna say my target
element is even dot target right and
then currently we can say that inside my
login drug component HTML I can provide
this an ID of user name and ID of
password and since we are passing the
entry form summit even of login user and
we're passing this as even as you object
so we get the event of this file
solution so we have our ID as user name
and this one has ID as password so we
can do constant username is target dot
get element by ID and this would be
username and the password
would be this thing right so now see
just console.log or username and
password here and see in the browser
alright so now if you just go to
inspector go to console we had nothing
for now if I enter like 1 2 3 4 5 and 1
2 3 4 5 hit summit okay we get target
dot get element by ID is not a function
let me just see not get element
okay I'm still gonna get elements
okay I think we cannot screw about that
so let's just go with query selector
right here and we should be fine there
we are
you obviously want the value here there
we go
now if I enter one two three four five
one two three its summit we have not
seen the updated changes here one two
three four five one two three its summit
you can see that we get username and
password logged in perfectly
now what I want is that I want to inject
the service which we have already done
our service right here so inside our pod
service right here what we want is we
want to call this user details function
so I'm gonna say something like get off
this dot but get user details and I'm
gonna pass in the username and password
right here and we're gonna do something
with this so right here what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna import HTTP client
module to perform an AJAX request an
angular common HTTP there we are now I'm
just gonna inject this privately HTTP
HTTP client won't you just like that and
now what I'm gonna say is return this
dot HTTP dot post now this would be our
URL which in our case is API slash what
we have in here is auth dot PHP and the
data we want to send is username and
password and what we're seeing here
or actually this should be just
httpclient
there we are okay so now we are sending
the username and password and want to
subscribe to this now this is the rxjs
implementation we're gonna come to that
later on the series but right now let's
see Nessus assume that subscription what
this subscribe means is that you are
subscribing to the c-synch
pipeline flow so whenever some event
occurs this subscription that it would
be called and in our case is that the
data when the data would be returned so
I'm just kind of console log data right
here and see is Whoopi got send this
over all right and if you take a look
inside over to dot PHP you can see that
we have this code right here which says
that if is said post and empties post is
not empty then I want to get username as
opposed to username I work and password
as post password if username is admin
and password is also admin then I want
to display this JSON record
if elsewise I'm gonna display invalid
credentials and if there's this request
is not post or post request is empty I'm
going to say that only post requests I
access is accepted all right makes sense
now if I go to this alright one two
three one two three right here its
summit we get 504 gateway timeout right
here
okay okay we are getting some error
proxxon too
so over right here so if we just say the
HPS localhost one two three four one two
three four right here
okay so now we can squeeze it
one two three four here it just works if
you add the PHP also works so that
should not be a problem
really
but we get 504 gateway timeout so if we
see what's happening here
you
okay so now if we go to like API
you
we get broken when Trump Rock City okay
so it looks like that we have some
problem with our PHP server so let's
just create that again so I'm gonna say
PHP s localhost or you can just go with
that and one two three four this is now
there we are and now if we reload this
and actually we can just lose it
our angular project it's up and actually
some of this we can see that our network
tab looks like something like okay so
you're getting only post access accepted
but we are indeed sending a post request
here so if it said post added post is
not empty now what we can do here
it is pretty much just or dump post were
you able to see what it contains so if
you submit this again we get nothing out
of it all right to quickly fix this what
we're gonna do is just redefine our post
here so that PHP can accept the JSON
stuff here as well so I'm just going to
get file get contents here and then I'm
gonna read from PHP input stream and
what we're gonna do is pretty much that
is it this should make it work
and this is just the back end path so it
really depends on your implementation
again so now if we take a look here in
the browser hit summit should see that
we get invalid credentials which is true
now if I write something like admin and
admin and hit summit
we get this is the secret no one knows
but the admin alright so now what we can
do is go back to our login component
right here and I'm just gonna say not
subscribe data I'm gonna say if date had
what success then we're gonna redirect
redirect the person to admin else so
just kind of alert invalid or rather we
can just make you look detail about what
we have message there we go alright so
okay what we're gonna do here is finally
we're just gonna return just this thing
so now you can see that we get this
thing okay so now if we take a look we
load one more time here and editor add
an admin its summit you see we get
nothing because we are the admin
obviously so if I write this as admin
one and hit summit you can see we get
invalid credentials as the option so
that is how pretty much would work with
login application in this tutorial now
that in the next video on we're going to
cover about routing and making this form
a little bit beautiful because it looks
ugly
and yeah that's all for this one and
I'll see you then in the next video and
