your 34th HTML and CSS tutorial in which
we'll be looking at a very interesting
concept in CSS which are pseudo CSS
selectors now pseudo CSS selectors are
basically just work like the normal CSS
selectors but with a catch and the catch
is that these selectors are basically
kind of events to your user action that
means that you could make see the
selectors work when the user is hovering
over your element or just clicking over
the element and basically you could also
use that for Dom manipulation selecting
some nth child or selecting every second
child of a parent and everything like
that so let's see what pseudo selectors
are and how to make them work so for
that let's first of all create a div ID
box to work with and in the standard CSS
and let's go ahead with the box one and
I'll just give it a background wait
some width and height has 300 pixels so
that it's visible on the screen and
let's reload this and I've got this box
right here so this is a 300 by 300 box
you see on the screen and now let's say
I want the background of this box to
change to let's say green when I hover
over this with my mouse so how would I
do that so to do that what I will do is
I'll write the exact selected name I
have used or any other selector but I
just have to make sure that this line
right here the selector line is still
pointing to the same element I want to
of it then a colon this garland
basically denotes that now the anything
except space ahead of this colon is a
pseudo selector and after the scholar we
make write the pseudo selector we are
working with for now I would like to
work with the horse through the selector
and the modern browsers as well
basically in the modern browsers we make
use of double colons and these double
colons work with all modern browsers of
google chrome your Firefox Safari Opera
and all that but we'll be using
just a single callin for simplicity and
on the production sites as well a lot
many sites use double colon because it's
still not supported by some versions of
ie so let's reload this now or this is
some properties down here let's say a
background to be Queen so okay so I hope
you have watched my last tutorial about
CSS specifically and in on that I told
you about how CSS properties are made to
work without any collisions between them
so this right here is a heavier property
than this because this has a pseudo
selectors so remember that properties
having pseudo selectors have more
advantage over the properties just with
those normal selectors so now let's save
this Alice reload this and one time who
were over this you see the box color
change to green so that's how basically
hoar pseudo works and not only this we
could use this just as a normal CSS
selector so what do what that mean is
that let's say
I have divided the box - right here box
- and let's style the box who as well
this should be at half sign
let's give it a background of arranged
with a 30 and height of 30 as well so
let's now what I want is whenever I hold
over this then instead of changing off
the background of it it's ball itself I
want the background of this thing this
box do to be changed so as I told you
this is just like a normal CSS selector
which you can make work with anything so
if I do like box whore give it a space
that a plus sign and write box Q so now
what I'm doing is I hope you know that
what this plus is used for in a funeral
know that then go back to my CSS
selectors tutorial and I'll explain you
there so right now I'm doing is whenever
a user hovers over this box ID which is
assigned to death Dave then
the immediate sibling of this box when
who would so remember that this
immediate sibling which is box to when
who would on box one which is just the
Box this DCSS properties would be
applied so let's see what happens now
let's reload this and we've got a little
little orange box right here down here
if you see and when I hover over this
then you see that instead of the color
changing of this red box itself we are
now changing the color of the green
little box right here and this is pretty
much how our CSS selector works and your
CSS selectors are not only limited to
over but there are many many CSS
selectors so let's take a look at a
bunch of those so let's say I write
active here so active would mean that
whenever I'm in the process of clicking
this box then this this these properties
would be applied so active means that
when you're holding your left mouse
click or whatever click you have set
primary s then these properties would be
applied so if you see if you pay
attention then whenever I am holding my
mouse click right here
then I'll leave this change occurs in
this small Dave so once I release it the
change it changes back to orange once I
hold my mouse click it changes back to
green and then orange green orange so
that's how basically it works the active
one okay so
next CSS selector I have is let's take a
look at focus so focus would kind of
work well with the input boxes so let's
create the input box
so
now let's just remove this you don't
need this inside this okay so now we are
giving a background of Queen Guenever
box is focused and box let's remove
these styles and box in this case is the
simple input type text box so let's
reload this and we have got this box so
when I focus on this you see the
background is automatically changed to
green and when I focus out and its
background is automatically changed to
white and you may wonder what is the
difference between focus and click then
now focus even would be fired whenever
your focus is on the input box and focus
can be brought on input box is box in
many ways for example you can press your
tab key on the keyboard to bring the
focus but this even if it was if work
click the
with the help of Turkey were key on the
keyboard you won't be able to fire the
click event but the focused one is fired
immediately whenever your input type
against focus and you could basically
use this with other CSS Silica's
elements as well in the HTML ok so I
guess I explained a bunch of pseudo
selectors to you in this tutorial and
introduced you to those and in the next
tutorial we'll be discussing about some
more pseudo selectors in CSS and maybe
we'll be building some sort of HTML web
page in the featured tutorials so till
then stay tuned with me and don't forget
