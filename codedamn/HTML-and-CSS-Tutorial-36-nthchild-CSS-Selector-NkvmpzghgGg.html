your 36 HTML and CSS tutorial and which
will be discussing about and child CSS
pseudo selector and in the last couple
of tutorials we learned about some of
these through the selectors in CSS like
overactive empty and invalid valid and
so on and in this tutorial I have made a
full separate tutorial for the end child
because it is kind of special so let's
see why I am stressing so much on this
and how you can basically use it in your
code so first of all let me create a
unordered list
let's say this is a list about
programming languages
then we have Chava
why not JavaScript
then we have Python
PHP as well and that should be good
enough so we have a bunch of programming
languages here in the unordered list and
if I view it on the browser then it
looks something like this ok so what
we'd want to do is we want to let's say
you want to style every second item in
the list with some other color so what
we can do is we can go to our style of
CSS file
we'll get Ally put a column to indicate
that it's pseudo selector now and we'll
write and child now this end child what
it will do is it would accept a kind of
parameter which would accept a number
and this number refers to your index
starting from 1 so Li and child 1 means
select every Li whose which is basically
first in the parent so if I reload a
supply cell Styles before a little dot
and now if I reload this then you see
that this becomes red and Li and child
right here one would apply to any Li
which is
a parent of our basically has a parent
so basically Li and child one means that
the parent of this Li these allies the
first enter the first child which is an
ally should have these styles so this
ul is the parent of all these allies and
for us child the end child one means
that first child of the parent which is
an anti right here should have these
Styles applied and so they are so let's
take a look at some more informative
example which will help you to
understand what this actually is doing
and let's say we create some tables to
work with
let's say
what you say
serial number for the first four
and then
we have rth actually
programming languages
and
let's say we do
percentage
expertise level so this is a kind of
your resume type of thing so now let's
give DDS one
C++ any programming language would go
and
and the person maybe
gr
GED to
see
and a percent you see also good and then
we have got
Java
and Anzio let's say 10 because I'm not
that much into Java you see and then we
have got my tongue
I love battle so this should be
hundred-person
and let's do one more because this won't
be complete without all-time favorite
PHP and not to be obviously hundred
verse okay so we have got this table
right here let's reload to see what you
have got so this is a nice little table
we have got right here on the document
and I'll just use some CSS to apply some
models it
table dr
it's going didi
two pixels solid black
okay so we have got a
nah this won't work
okay so we have got this border around
it which doesn't look much nice but it's
good for now let's remove that from didi
all right thing let's just make use of
the HTML attributes but don't use them
on your production site because these
attributes are deprecated okay so we
have got this two pixel border with the
help of border attribute which is
deprecated so don't use it on the
production side instead use some CSS and
I have just used it to speed up what I
was doing so now let's say you want to
organize this table a little bit so what
we can do is first of all we'll select
every TR and
we'll do background of a little crash so
every tiara now is a little crash but I
want that every second TR should be
white so that would give us a nice
little effect so one thing I can do is
either I can go ahead and apply a glass
to each of what each one of them or what
I can do is I can type and child.and
inside this when I type odd and I reload
this background and I reload this now
you see every odd which is one three
five
gets changed to white background and if
I do even here even I reload this then
we get two four six as the white
background and what does that signify is
it is selecting every TR of table parent
which is e one in number that means this
first TR means one second means two
third means three and remember that and
child indexing begins from one so
there's nothing and child zero here okay
so one thing we have God another thing
is n now this n now before odd and even
we were doing like numbers so TR n child
one refers to this one if I change it to
then it refers to the second row and so
on so what if you want to customize or
then even the odd and even key words a
little bit so you would like only one in
three rows to be background or white so
we can do that by making use of this end
an alphabet and this n basically is a
dynamic is a multiple shows multiple so
2n basically refers to two into one and
the next time it would refer to two
into two so first time it would say okay
select TR which is end child to the next
time it would select TR and child for
next time TR and child six and it will
go on unless or basically it would go on
till how many TR elements are there in
the document so when I reload this you
see that I get back on the plate on two
four and six so this is a kind of a more
programmatic alternative of your even
one and what if I do
2n plus 1 now this 2n plus 1
signifies that every second element but
next to every second element so in the
first one it would select this one to n
plus 1 then in the next one
it would select 2n plus 1 so when I
reload this we get this one because when
it sets n to 0 then we get 2 0 plus 1 as
0 for 1 it gets to 0 plus 1 as this row
then this row so we could do like also
like 3 and plus 1
if I reload this then only we get this
row add this row
and any guesses if I do just end right
here what would happen if I reload it
with just n any wild guesses yeah so
when I will reload this then what would
happen is since this end refers to any
digit starting from zero to the number
of D are elements then this would
basically means basically mean just like
the statement so this doesn't make any
sense right here so I can basically
exclude it or include it so when I
reload this you see that every Row is
converted into white background so this
has got a higher specificity than this
one so this these Styles would apply
so that was a quick little tutorial on
ant child in CSS and I hope you learned
something from it and that's all for
this tutorial and don't forget to
