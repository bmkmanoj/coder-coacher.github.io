very first JavaScript tutorial in which
we'll be looking at another method
called match now you're gonna use this
match method a lot to follow this
tutorial very carefully so let's say if
you want to match a string inside
another string so in the last tutorial
with the search method what it does is
it would return you the index position
of your occurrence if that occurs what
if you want their socialist results
themselves to get responded back by this
by a method now for that we have match
and let's see how that works so let's
say we have a variable E and let's say
it's a bunch of random string and some
alphabets with some numbers school now
let's say I want to get this number
right here to be matched so what I'll do
is I'll do
our result one is a dot match and said
this I would directly write the regular
expression instead of just writing it in
another way you will just to save some
space now let's write down this number
as the expression now let's use an under
variables for that you can actually
learn the differences between a dot
match and a dot search now let's alert
both of these why not just document dot
write these so let's say rest one plus a
little bit of space address - now here's
the document and let's read out this now
we have this number right here with a
space and and seven now what does what
does that mean is for the search we got
the index number which is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
and the seventh one but for the match
one we got the string itself now if I do
like something which is not available
the same thing which is not available in
the string and let's reload this now we
get null - 1 as results so why the heck
is much useful actually now to show you
the uses of match I have to use a
certain kind of regular expression which
I'll be teaching you in the next
tutorial don't worry about that and that
is matching the digits in a string now I
would be teaching all this in the next
tutorial but just try knowledge know
that regular expression D this backward
slash and D matches digits in a
strange so for now the string is a 1
which is this one
now let's alert restaurant now notice
that I haven't used any of the digits so
this could technically mean any of the
input which a has so let's reload this
and we get 3 now what does that 3 means
that in its regular expression the first
occurrence of a digit is 3 and widened
in return hole number and then this
number and this number and that we would
look in the next tutorial I using
special characters in regular expression
but just know that we are just matching
this first occurrence of in digit and
this regular expression using the
forward slash and addy so that's all for
this tutorial for the match one and
remember this match function which I
told you in this tutorial because I
won't explain it explaining it again in
the next one so that's all for this and
I'll see you then good bye and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
