welcome to your 41st angularjs tutorial
in which we'll be discussing about
shared and isolated scope in angularjs
directives obviously so in the last
tutorial I quickly give you an example
how the directives in angularjs fallback
to a shared scope gutta they shared the
same scope all of the directives and
here's the example again so if I click
one of them you can see all of the div
having the my first script as a
directive changes to here there now this
is because the scope is shared among all
of these directives now we can prevent
this thing by you know breaking each of
the directive to its own individual
scope and to do that in the return we
have a property known as scope now this
kind of septs three values either it is
true or false
or it is a kind of object so what
happens with false is simply that you
are just not writing anything else so
this line and this line technically
means same now what happens with true is
that with true your directive would
create a separate scope for your you
know your HTML element but it would
prototypically inherit from the
controller as well now what was that so
to demonstrate that in simple words let
me show you an example so right now we
have nothing in our controller let's
just quickly populate this upward scope
and school dot controller property
nothing fancy here this is a controller
specific property okay
so right there we have a controller
specific property which is only specific
to this controller but this directives
as you can see comes under these
controllers the ng-controller app
so what happens with true is that this
directive would prototype Italy inherit
now prototypically what it means is that
if you already have seen my JavaScript
tutorials then you obviously know that
because I have discussed that in greater
details in around tutorial number 11 to
17 or 18 or something like that but for
those who are not familiar with
prototypal inheritance it's simply gonna
like how JavaScript works on the model
of inheritance just like OOP works on
the class inheritance or the object here
in inheritance JavaScript has its own
model of inheritance that is prototype
book the prototype is just simply a
chain inheritance models for example if
I already have a property score blood
controller property in here then this
code will make use of its own property
instead of going to the controller but
for instance let's say I don't have this
property inside here then what would
happen is as a chain this directive
would contact the you know it's superior
some something which is superior to this
in a chain because all of these are
linked in a chain and for now this is
just the simple controller and then this
controller already has this property so
it will stop if the controller would not
have this property either then this
controller would look somewhere above it
for now we have nothing but you know you
can have the dependencies added here but
that's for some another day so let's get
back to the work and for now we have
created the simple control controller
property let's just hook this up in here
so instead of hey there and just kind of
save controller property okay so what
happens now is if I reload this and
click on this okay so we got controller
property instead nevermind let's just
create this other function only let's
just change this to school dot control
solar property let's reload now so when
I click on this you can see that this is
a controller specific property and the
other two did not change so that is
kinda you know the effect of the scope
true and if I click on this as well
this is controller specific property and
this one as well now what happens when I
change this to an object literal so what
happens now is that you can technically
do not you technically do not have
access to the controller robbery okay so
how the heck in this world are we
getting access to this okay so I haven't
saved the file yet alright so you can
see now that the text is going blank
instead of showing this is a controller
specific property now the reason for
this is that this directive has its own
individual scope plus an isolated scope
which would you know just would not be a
part of the prototypal chain which this
controller is a part of now in most of
the scenarios you would like to have an
individual and an isolated scope because
you know if you can access this property
you can actually modify this property as
well from the directive only and you
don't want any you know just a random
directive on your page modifying your
controller properties because that could
be fatal for your program so yeah so
that's all for this tutorial and you
know some interesting stuff goes in here
which we'll be talking real soon and
yeah so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial and if you liked it then don't
