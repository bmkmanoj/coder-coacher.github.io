May ho and welcome to your fourth
react.js tutorial in which I'm gonna
tell you basically what react offers
also known as virtual Dom is so react
actually a lot of libraries other
libraries also up or something like
virtual Dom but I'm just going to
discuss it to a reference to react right
now so what react does is is that behind
the scenes it creates a whole copy of
the exact Dom you have on your screen
right so let's just say if this is your
dorm
that this is your dorm I hope you
understand Dom document object model all
these nodes so what react would do let
me just get my hands dirty with paint so
let's say if we organize the strong dawn
in the form of let's just say some sort
of trees or something so you know this
is the hard to rotate so let's just go
with a line on it so the necessary is
this something like this right so this
is your actual norm right your actual
dog so what react would do is that
behind the scenes it would create an
exact copy of the same dog but instead
this would be reacted on right so this
is react to Dom or what we could say is
virtual long right and whatever
manipulation you do in the data right
react would let's just say you modified
something in this node of the tree of
the Dom tree so you can just place it
again and
you're running out of space anyway let's
just say you change something in this in
this node right so now what happens is
that react chicks that are the two trees
matching well it sees that this node is
not matching right so reacts down which
was the copy of the actual Dom is now
not matching to the Dom which is created
when you modify a component or any part
of your app using react react or updated
virtual Dom we can say right so what
reacts does is we'll just compare these
two nodes or you know it will just
compare all nodes and see that these two
do not match so react would go to the
Dom and would update only this node
which is updated inside virtual Dom
right so react to the just update this
Dom this node on the actual Dom so it
kind of says a lot of you know time
because querying actual Dom is kind of
expensive and actually updating it every
time like if you just replace the whole
down with this it's quite expensive
because you will just the browser would
need to calculate the CSS and you know
on the layouts and margins again it's
kind of kind of expensive tasks to do if
your application is big so react kind of
brings in virtual Dom concept so that it
just updates whatever is actually needed
to be updated on the actual log so
actual Dom is kind of hard and I mean
it's kind of expensive to mess up with
so we create another Dom copy and we
just update it when it's needed so
that's how pretty much reacts virtual
Dom model works and from the next
tutorial onwards we will just gone up
get some code into our script files so
that's all for this one and if you liked
it then don't forget to subscribe and
