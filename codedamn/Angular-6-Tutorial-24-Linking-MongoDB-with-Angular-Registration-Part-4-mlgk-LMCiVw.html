Mei hole and welcome to your 24th
angular 6 tutorial in which we're gonna
take a look at how to link front-end to
Mongo which we have been for which we
have been doing so much of work so far
so let's get started alright so we have
seen that our API works with our HTTP
client that is for for Mac and for
Windows postman you can use
so now let's just implement that inside
our angular application so here's our
app it's working nice so far discretion
and logging seems to work but what I
want to do is right here inside my login
component
if data is success then I just want to
redirect the user to dashboard and set
the logged in to true else just alert
our login component seems fine we can
just check this component this performs
an HTTP request to API slash log in with
a username and password as the JSON data
and it should return a success and a
message so we can pretty much do it
right here a log in thing should
actually warn JSON should return success
or false and message message rate or msg
what's it message is incorrect details
like that look at the schedule of this
as well otherwise we're gonna just send
the response to a choice on/off success
true and what else
yep that's it so there we are and if it
is correct we go to dashboard cool
otherwise we just get an alert this is
fine for just raishin what we have is we
get username password confirm password
we check it ourselves a fair start
length is zero this all the register
your list ring user name and pass will
be you subscribing again we are seeing
success so we are saying this tour HTTP
dot post API register username and
password which we cared here with this
requested body we creating a new user
and we are getting it back what we can
do care is that we can say constant
existing user is user-defined one email
so I can just say if existing user
exists that means you cannot basically
register with that email address so I'm
just gonna say your sponsor JSON sex
this is false message is email already
and use you can just return as well here
otherwise you're going to create a new
user and I'm gonna save that user and
you're gonna say success is true message
welcome something like this right and do
with that being done what we have that
we have we are now creating the users
just a response by not a message as
strengths right here so now we can just
go to district definition here and see
that we are getting data again if this
is success we just navigate to dashboard
fair enough
I will just console.log the username and
password which is entered by the user
all right makes sense and it should work
probably so now if we take a look for
the dashboard thing what you're gonna
see is pretty much nothing so just gonna
get that stuff from admin so we can just
copy this thing inside our dashboard
component and do with the admin file
here as well we can just paste that
thing inside - put on change it to -
dashboard component like that and what
we have is this right so we can just
actually just schedule of this at once
for now because we are not using
sessions so that could not work so now
if we take a look in the
browser what we should see is can't
resolve admin component CSS and that is
because inside our dashboard we are
using dashboard dashboard dashboard and
now if we just inspect the element log
in Mayville one name ladder it one calm
one two three four five Google Network
stab its summit
you get incorrect details okay we are
submitting password and username there
should be emailed so let's just fix that
real quick this should be email it
should be email and this should be email
as well let it reload
Mabel one way ladder it one gone one two
three four five to your summit we get
successful login it's a review we get
success true we get a loading screen
fair enough alright this works now I can
just go to login again and actually do
dis ur and now I can say something like
some email at the rate gmail.com one two
three one two three clear summit
registration we get email already in use
okay this should existing user not find
one okay let's just see what we are
getting here existing user email and
passwords it's safe summit this again we
hit it and inside our
terminal which is pure or lers it what's
up has submitted now we get oh there
should be a wait use it at find one
right now if we summit this one more
time you should see that the sooo
description is successful and we get a
welcome message however if I go to
register if you write user name as a
hole at 1 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 its summit
we get success falls as message email
already in use once I write something
like this
we get success true and message welcome
so basically our front-end back-end
database all is ready what's left now is
a little bit of UI and sessions so we're
gonna do that complete you know complete
that thing in the next video so that's
all for this one and I'll see you then
in the next video and one more thing if
