May ho and welcome to this screencast in
which I'm going to show you real quick
how you can link a domain from a domain
to Google cloud computing and if you are
actually running a Google cloud compute
engine instance then you might want to
link it to a domain instead of using
just the IP address every time to access
it and obviously you have to purchase
the domain first if you are going to
going with dot-com intent or to Archie
or whatever and right now I'm just
making use of this free domain right so
you can do that as well otherwise if you
have purchased it from sites like
Namecheap or maybe GoDaddy or whatever
you can find this DNS section somewhere
and you should be good to go so now what
you have to do is go to your project
inside your Google Cloud and let's just
go with this one only so I'm going to
compute engine and I'm going to my
instances page and just to find out that
I do have some instances running you can
see that I have one instance running
here and then what we have to do let's
go to the sweet PC networks and go to
external IP addresses to verify that you
are running a static IP address and not
on a formal one so that your IP address
does not change automatically otherwise
you will lose access to the domain as
well the domain would not point to the
right IP address the next thing you have
to do is go to network services and thus
cloud DNS right here you should not see
anything but what you have to do is
create a zone and once you do that
actually we can do it right away as well
so I can create a zone and name it like
FB for you which is the domain
registering right now and right here
inside DNS name you need to write your
domain name dot TK which is a free
domain
and I have created this you can see that
we get to records by default so what you
want to do is add a record set and the
first one would be blank and this would
this would consist of your IP address so
you need to go back to your instances
page they can look at what your IP
address is for that particular instance
you want to map the domain too and just
copy and paste that right here inside
your ipv4 column and looks like yeah we
are here so if I can just copy this
thing and paste it right here and do we
can do a similar thing with the tww
right here and there we go how we can
this create both of these records right
so now we have this SP for UDK done and
you want to take a look at the star
setup things you can see that google
tells you do based these four as the DNS
name servers so just go ahead on your
registrar and you should be able to
locate this column somewhere right just
like a set on Namecheap it's somewhere
inside your domain management GoDaddy it
would be somewhere but it is usually
very easy to find and you should be good
to go so if you take a look you can see
that these are all a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4
numbers so you can just copy and paste
this a couple of times just change this
right here right and just change the
name servers so once you do that your
name servers would be updated really
soon it takes a little while maximum 24
hours but the changes start reflecting
at least on the proxy servers within 10
to 15 minutes so you might not be able
to access something like this right now
there you would be able to access it
using a proxy server like something like
kapok see really soon and yeah that's
pretty much it for this one and I guess
it would take a little time you can see
that it's not live right now and after
some time what you should see is that if
you visit your domain again and right
now you can see that it saves me it
before you that decays server DNS could
not be found when you reload this after
some time you can see that the message
changes that it refused to connect now
now it refused to connect because no
server is running on the instance for
which I am using this domain so now what
you have to essentially just do is set
up your server once you get this message
that means your domain is correctly
linked to your instance and if you had
already set it up the server then pretty
much you should see your site by now so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
and if you like this then please don't
