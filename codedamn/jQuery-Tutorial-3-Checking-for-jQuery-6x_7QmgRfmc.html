jquery
tutorial and in this tutorial i'll be
teaching you how to check if jquery is
properly loaded into the browser or not
so in the couple of last couple of
tutorials we learned about something
about jquery that what is jquery and how
do we use it and how to write a hello
world program in jquery like this but
what if you want to check where the
jquery is loaded or not so for instance
you have placed the script and somehow
the server goes down and you have your
check very code down here you want to
see you want to basically execute this
code only when the jquery file is ready
because it takes some time for the
browser to visit this URL and load this
file into memory or on the current
server to work with so to do that what
we do is as I told you in the previous
tutorial jQuery can be accessed by the
keyword check ready so let's try to play
with this keyword first let's
console.log thus keyboard check ready
and here's our window let's refresh this
they inspect element so we have this
function down here function a B this
would be some internal function of check
very which actually initializes the
library so now by passing by actually
adding a exclamatory mark what we are
doing is we are converting this variable
into a boolean value now by that what i
mean is if i refresh this we get false
now why we get false because jQuery it
will set to something and it's library
down here but when we do like jQuery if
you have learned from your JavaScript
classes then when you do like let's say
I create a variable x equals hello
and I say if X this statement means if X
does not exist then do this code so
basically down here we are doing if
console.log
what if jQuery does not exist so this
returns us down here the browser
asphalt's that means it does exist and
by passing a double negative we can
check whether the script executes false
or true and as you can see it executes
stru for example let's take the function
of this we are saying X as hello and if
X that means if X does not exist
then do run this code
let's refresh this we do not get any
alert box because X is set now
let's pass double negative that means
double exclamatory mark and let's
refresh the page
and now we get a JavaScript alert that
means literally we have converted the
value of eggs to a kind of boolean to
know whether X exists or not so by using
this you could actually verify if jQuery
file is loaded in your browser or not
and as I told you
jQuery could be accessed by window as
well because window is a super global
and jQuery is an object of window global
so if I do refresh now it returns us
true because jQuery is running so let's
take the script above this file now you
have guesses what could happen when i
refresh the browser notice that we are
running the script before we are loading
the file
so obviously window torchic but it does
not exist and it should return us a
return as false let's refresh this page
and as expected we get false so at this
point at the time of running of this
script we do not have jQuery ready for
the browser so it returns us false this
value
so that's how you check for the
availability of jQuery in your browser
and basically this is kind of very
useful when you have a lot of
dependencies or in jQuery for your
website and you could not afford to not
load jQuery on the clients browser so
this is how you check whether our jQuery
library is loaded into the into the
client side or not so in the next
tutorial we'll be going on to some more
jQuery code and fun with jQuery and how
you can use jQuery to work with Dom so
I'll see you then
