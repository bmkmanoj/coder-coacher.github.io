and welcome to your seventh typescript
tutorial in which I'm going to show you
what enemies are in typescript so what
enemies actually do is that they just
simply store a bunch of numbers in your
program and you cannot actually modify
those numbers obviously it would throw
an error in the terminal or you know
console whatever you call it but it
would eventually compile into a
JavaScript file so let's just start with
one so I'm just going to say ennum my
constants star see when SC o NS d a and
D s and then I'm just going to say by a
3.14 e as 2.73 log two as what it is 0.3
log 5 as 0.7 all right now what I want
to do is let's just say also that log
finding area of circle I'm just gonna
say console log two times my constants
dot pi times radius and this is not the
area but circumference so so just make
some room for this and for the radius
one this is a number let's just set it
to 10 all right now what I'm trying to
do here is that I'm just getting this
number from here and I'm just using it
this in my program so what if I try to
modify the value by so if I said this
like 2 4 and compile it try to compile
it it shows me invalid left-hand society
of assignment
so obviously you've gotta change the
value of pi' unless you just bend the
space-time fabric well that's something
for another day but the main thing here
to observe is that you cannot actually
change the enumeration constants right
there so these are kind of your number
constants and the bad news is that they
are only restricted to numbers so you
can just have a string in here that's
not valid actually so as you can see it
wouldn't compile very well so that is
why and yeah so that's pretty much it
and if you just take a look on that and
browser if I build this file first
reload it shows me some good result so
that's how you create an enumeration and
typescript and yes so that's all for
this one and thank you for watching and
don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
