your fifth MongoDB tutorial my name is
May ho and in this tutorial I'm gonna
show you various data you can insert in
your MongoDB database and I should have
probably done this tutorial a bit before
I guess it should be on number three but
you know I'm a bit lazy so anyhow here
we are so anyways well what I want to do
is first of all start off Mongo D so
Mongo D and here we go it's now
listening on four two seven zero one
seven right so now inside my second
terminal I'm gonna say Mongo and hit
enter now we are in the Mongo shell show
DBS and here we have all our DB so use
em DB now with Mongo DB what you have is
you have access to a lot a lot and a lot
of data types right very much whatever
you had in JavaScript you have in
MongoDB right so you create my object
you can have an object with the like
boolean right this should be true could
be true or false then you can have a
string of my own string right you can
have a number which is like one two
three four five six seven or like that
then you can have something like my null
as null right then you could also have
an array for example you want to say
that your last test marks and you would
enter like 0 0 0 0 0 kinda so like that
and don't forget to close your object
and hit enter now you see that your
object contains all that information you
can just push it into your m DB so write
a B not
my custom object and make sure you have
the switch to your DB and then say that
insert and write it to my object hit and
true you will get right results 1 and
let me just get rid of this one actually
so yeah right there and probably it
would have been kind of jumping camera
so anyways now what I'm gonna do is say
DB not my custom object but fine and
actually this is a document right so now
you see that it's kind of not pretty so
what I'm gonna do is make use of pretty
keyword right there you see that it
works pretty awesome well now you see
that you've got all of our data but what
the heck is this well in MongoDB what
happens is that your every of your
document and so Jack would assign an
object ID and it consists of you know
some sort of pattern you can just trace
trace it back how this ID is created
it's kind of like some sort of digits
first contribute to your time when the
object is created and all that stuff I
don't actually kind of remember exactly
how this object ID is constructed but
it's actually no use of actually as well
if you want just take out and then you
can just do that because it's not really
knowing in the point what this consists
of it's just kind of unique ID
associated with each of your object and
that is kinda why it is an ID right so
well yes that is pretty much all for
this tutorial and I just wanted to show
you that you can store pretty much like
anything you want to in MongoDB and it
you would be good to go and it be fast
and easy as well and yeah so that is all
for this one and I'll see you then real
quick in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
