Mei hole and welcome to your another
chat wat tutorial remember the tutorial
number exactly but in this tutorial what
we are going to do is I'm going to show
you how you can add that get started
button to your chat board when the user
or you know the person who is using your
chat board uses it for the first time
right I'm just going to show you a
little example here you see you click on
this message Now button you see that
this button is get started now if you go
to messenger comm then it kind of is
just the sidebar of Facebook right in a
beautiful way so there you would see
this get started button to taking up
your full screen so that would kind of
make an impression if you want to do
that you can do that so to do that what
you need to do is you need to actually
send a request to Facebook with your
authentication token and this should be
something like you know you can just go
to google and write get started button
on Facebook Messenger right you see this
first link let's go ahead and copy the
school you see right here but it's just
a call request you can do this with PHP
as well but two-way easier to do that
with just your bash shell or you know
you'll get bash if you are using that
it's just way easier right so what you
need to do is just paste it here
I'm just configuring it so I just have
to hit enter after entering it and get -
and just replace your access token right
and inside your payload this would be
the thing which would allow you allow
your script to recognize that this user
has came for the first time to your
channel because your script does not
know the state of the chat right it's
just like Facebook send some data your
script send some data back add
dead right on the next boot your face
your scrip does not know who the user
was or whom it is talking with right I
mean it does with the user ID but you
know you get the idea you do not know
the state of that fool so in the play
payload what we'll write is anything you
like like force and shake it could be
anything but it's just the same data
Facebook will return to your script when
the user clicks on that get started
button all right so once you are done
with that just copy this code and if you
have git bash installed then you can
just shift the shift and right click
anywhere and then see that the skip pass
here right if you are on Windows 10
actually you should have
- itself I guess I do not have that I do
actually
yeah I need to install it I don't have
that yet I'll just do that later because
it would take some time right so if you
have git bash install you can go ahead
and just get bash it from this things
right and if you're on Windows 10 and a
half - install you can do the same thing
from the command line for Windows
otherwise you can I don't know I haven't
tried it maybe there are some online
called request senders or something so
you can just go ahead and do that it's
just URL request or whatever you want to
call it and you can actually do that
with PHP as well but then you just need
to configure it like this something like
this it's kind of tedious because you
have to do this only once right so just
go ahead copy this thing open your kit -
right just paste it here you'll see that
this is successfully added new thread
CPS right so now let's see what happens
so if I go back to my chat board and
yeah yeah it should be good to go
so you see that we get a get started
button you should be able to see the get
started button now and want to click on
this and head over to end rock you'll
see that you get a post request and
you'll see that in the payload we have
this post handshake right now how did we
take this well it's simple what I can do
is first of all we need to do a couple
of things you're not entirely sure that
in every request Facebook would send us
a message right so yeah but the user ID
would be there so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say that this message
ching-ching are a its first to father
this thing's right messaging and then
this thing so the next thing we have is
that if is set messaging array and then
I'm going to say post back right if it's
set and if messaging area post back is
actually equal to our fourth on shake
that means the user actually you know
click on the get started button right
and what we can do here is we can
actually take this all this off and
create a new function send text message
message here or
yes that would be fine for now so we can
just say message here right and
obviously I would need to do like that
right commas nothing do the work right
so if that's the case what I want to do
is let's just remember Saad send text
message hello there right
and let's just die for the movement so
let's just see if we have all set and
for the variety we can pass it right
here
variety and the actual token as well
right and that should do it
yeah look first okay are we closing this
not really okay so let's
try them see if we get any errors or
actually this world
these two are global so let me not pass
them but anyways right okay now let's
just try to clear the chat and message
it again okay we don't get anything
let's just see what happens
undefined and next on line 26 what does
that mean we have postback set this code
should probably die shouldn't it
Oh for the postback we need pay level
actual yeah let's try it again
right we don't get anything now so send
text message either ID oh you'll meet
this condition for now because we'll be
handling our checking ourselves right
one final time here we have our hello
there right so that's how pretty much
you create a get started button and
obviously if you want to see that again
you'd have to delete your conversation
so say this is and that is how very much
you create that and if you liked this
