tutorial now in this tutorial finally
we'll be looking at a proper approach
what is Dom and the difference between a
bomb and a dorm
sounds like bomb but it's just be om
bomb and I bet it's not a name of a
villain it's some technical part bomb
Dom anyways coming to tutorial now first
of all let me explain what Dom is now
basically when people ask me that is Dom
what appears in the source code of a
browser for example we have this web
page and people ask me if this is the
this is called the dorm no it's not this
is not Dom then people ask me then what
this notepad text is called Dom No
this is also not Dom then people ask me
that whether this content right here is
the Dom and technically it's it's called
the Dom this content right here in the
inspect elements section it is called
the Dom and this answer is correct to
some extent but then you'll ask me that
what's the difference between this code
this code right here
so technically there's no difference
appearing to you right here now but
basically DOM is a API is a browser API
which is accessible to the JavaScript
now basically with the help of
JavaScript we can modify this Don
structure so what you have to remember
is basically that Dom actually deals
with the document the HTML elements
themselves basically and Dom is the kind
of API which can be accessed modified
and basically you could do anything with
drawing with the help of JavaScript now
coming to bomb now what is born bomb
stands for browser object model just
like Dom stands for document object
model and basically bomb is a kind of
superior to Dom DOM is a subset of bomb
but bomb includes features like like you
don't have those in Dom which are like
your history your location changing your
location getting your history your
screen window object and like that so
let's look at an example right now so if
I do
if I do like this then what I'm doing is
I'm modifying Dom
of this file so basically I'm modifying
the Dom with the help of this API which
consists of the document object then we
are accessing body then we are setting
the inner text to hello world so this is
the API the Dom API which are we are
using to modify the content that is
shown to user now about Bom then if we
do something like document dot location
dot H ref then we set it to some other
page like google.com then what we are
doing here is we are walking now with
the browser we are not working with User
Content now we are not telling user
anything or we are not showing user
anything
we are just sending an action to the
browser level at the browser level to
redirect this page to this URL so
similarly we could use objects like
history and your navigator your screen
object your window object these are
objects all our objects are called the
browser objects basically and come under
the be om which is browser object model
so this was a short quick tutorial on
what is bomb and what is DOM and the
difference between do and I hope you
understood clearly that what is DOM and
what is bomb technically we don't use
these terms very often in coding
basically while bu could but
theoretically it's very important for
kind of quizzes and when you have to
answer questions I'm and you have to
explain do a new person new to
JavaScript the word is storm and how it
actually works so as I have already took
your five minutes right now so I'd like
to close this tutorial now and thanks
