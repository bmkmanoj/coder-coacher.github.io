welcome to a thirty first Android
application development tutorial
my name is Miho and in this tutorial I'm
gonna create the layout for the news
item and would bind it with our adapter
as well so that we could actually
actually see that in action right so I'm
gonna go to layout new layout resource
file and let's just say this is item
well we're gonna change that currently
this looks cool alright but let's just
say that do defaults only and I'm gonna
hop over to this one and then copy all
that code and paste it right here and it
produces a similar result so I'm just
gonna change this from large text to
heading text why not and make some space
as well so I'm just gonna say this
Android padding a bit as 5dp right so
what about 10 okay looks nice right so
now almost all errors are gone pretty
much what we have in here okay so one is
gonna bracket right okay so what I want
here is I want to say that this is my
new item news item current item is
newsfeed dot position or not kit
position just like earlier so now we
have access to our current item right so
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get
all these things from the item as well
so I'm gonna say that this is image view
news image is equal to
image view then find or actually current
item but find view by ID oh no no no
this is gone what view actually not item
aa dot ID dot left I go right then
similarly I'm gonna find text view
do we have one yes we have to I guess
yeah description description text view
then I want to have heading heading and
actually let's just place that like that
okay so now we are pretty much done and
what you can do is just say description
dot set text and then I'm gonna say that
this is my current item dot get get get
get news heading and know this should be
having right then heading description
and news image then description is get
news description line user major set
image resource grunt Adam get news
heading but no we have get image ID
right so yeah so let's just take a look
and see what works
and I just forgot about this one so
let's see if it just throws in some
error or not because I just updated
Android studio to two point one point
two so that is why it's showing me this
one probably yeah looks like there's
some sort of error hmm okay so let's go
to okay so I figured out a way that
would be to change this SDK version to
23 and then synchronize it so let's see
if it works it looks like it dead so yep
so we should be cooler yep
and now let's just run our whoa
could not delete folder what the heck
let's just do some cache invalidation
and here we are again so let it index
and okay so looks like we should be good
to go now okay so oh okay so yeah looks
like we are done okay so you can see
right now we get this news feed and I
guess the text aligned and work because
this is API level 16 and it was added I
guess after API level 16 so we'll just
find a pair for that and right now it
looks like it works cool you can see
that pretty much that's all for the view
right now which we have coded so that's
all for this tutorial and in the next
one I'm gonna shift this code to a
static Jace or an object or maybe a
dynamic one as well
so yes so I'll see you them in the next
one so if you liked it then don't forget
