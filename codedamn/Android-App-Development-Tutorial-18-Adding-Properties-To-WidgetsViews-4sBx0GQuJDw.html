Miho and welcome to your 18th Android
application development tutorial in
which I'm gonna extend the last tutorial
a little bit by just showing you how to
play around with this dynamic addition
of buttons and all that good stuff on
your screen so right now we just created
a simple application where just
dynamically kind of adds your button on
the screen when you click on that
particular button that's kind of boring
and actually useless to do so let's just
make this application a little bit fun
and you know nice so let me just get rid
of all that code and I'm gonna say
actually I'm gonna switch this from
relatively out to linear layout and the
reason is that while we're pushing the
buttons on the layout screen linear
layout what kind of makes make that
easier for me to stack the button on you
know in layers but little relative I
need to specify where to place the next
button a spot so that would kind of take
a lot of time and even code would become
a litte little bit buggy and hazy so I'm
gonna change this to linear layout
instead of relative layout change this
tool in your layout as well so here we
go and again I'm gonna say button button
second button equals new button and then
mainactivity done this where main
activity is the name of our activity
right there now you could actually
explicitly specify the parameters as
well which we'd they're like second
button that set parameters in the last
tutorial with that particular thing only
so like if you want to create a lot of
views at one go and all of them should
have kind of common parameters so you
can do that like this so you have to say
like a linear layout dot layout
parameters
parameters right there and you have to
set up variable in obviously so let's
just say my funny rameters and again you
need a new keyword right there not an in
you linear layout layout parameters
layout parameters and then inside here
you would again specify the width and
the height just like we did later on I
mean earlier so this is layout
parameters then this is let's say we
make it match parent right and then I'm
gonna say the same thing layout it works
but but this time let's just make it
wrap content so the width would be match
parent like the elements will be stacked
like this and the height would be only
the height which is required right so
okay so now we just need a semicolon
right there and the next thing we have
the button so we need to set some sort
of things with this button so I'm gonna
say second button dot set text and again
I need to have like I am a button right
and actually what we can do is actually
we can make this button a bit unique by
saying that we have int I equals 0 and
I'm a button with a twist which is I'm a
zero button right then the second one
would be I'm a first button and actually
you just need to make sure that you just
update the button as well so there we go
and just move it right here so now we
are pretty much good to go
and I'm just gonna go with this I and
then I'm gonna say that
I guess we don't have that linear layout
yet in our code so my layout is fine
view by ID are okay so it was smiley and
Ollie got ID my layout and then
explicitly just just linear layout and
fine view by ID here we go
and now finally what I need to do is I'm
gonna say my layout dot add view then
I'm gonna say this is my second button
and for explicit parameters you need to
specify the parameters right here so my
funny parameters would all be the
parameters which would be applied to
this button so that is pretty much it
about it and let's just see how this
looks like on the phone so let me just
adjust my seat right there and here we
go
so let's square a new button and I'm a
one button I'm a two button three button
for button really sweet cool actually
so you have actually developed your
first dynamic program with Android and
what else you can do with this is that
you could actually make use of other
properties and I'm just gonna show you
what properties you have access to if
you take a look like here in the design
let's click on this button so you have
access to all of these properties in the
code as well like your I'm just gonna
say that the one you recognize like
gravity or the ID which we already made
use of the letter spacing then maximum
width then this on click padding text
which you already made use of then text
size theme and all that awesome stuff so
you could just do that from the Java as
well
and for a quick review I can just show
you that how you can set background
color so you need to set a background
color then you need to make use of the
color library right so you need to
import that it would just show me in a
while so RGB let's just say and I'm just
gonna go with three zeros so it saves me
doing poor Android graphics colors so
just do that and you would be good to go
so if I just we start my application and
you see that the buttons are kind of
black now so that kinda sucks
but you can just play around and then
familiarize yourself with all of these
properties as well so I guess that is
pretty much it for this tutorial and if
you like that then don't forget to
subscribe thank you for watching I'll
see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
