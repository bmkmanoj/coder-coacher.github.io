to your 37th Android application
development tutorial in which I'm gonna
discuss about grid layouts in Android
well what we have done so far is that we
just made use of relative or linear
layouts but there's another boy in the
group known as grid layouts and it's
quite handy actually if you make it make
the right use of it and instead what
relative layout does apart from that
what grid layout do is actually it cuts
your screen into a bunch of horizontal
and vertical lines and it kind of
creates a table out of your screen so
you can just place individual view in a
cell block and pretty much just like how
calculators are laid out actually so
let's say you are creating a calculator
or maybe a game like like a chess board
or you know there's a game known as 2:04
read that game is actually pretty cool
you have to just slide the numbers to
the numbers just add up in twos powers
like to will add 2 then 4 with 4 to
create 8 then 16 32 1 all the way so my
highest score for that is I guess around
16,000 the power of 2 which is 16,000 I
guess it's sixteen thousand three
hundred something so let me know what's
your highest score let's try it out it's
pretty fun actually no I'm just kidding
just continue with this one so what I
want to do in this tutorial is that I
just want to show you how how basically
grid layout looks like so let me just
get rid of this text view and move to
design panel right so in design I can
just drag this layout though I'm not a
very big fan of creating things from
here but I just want to show you
something which could be more precisely
shown from this design layout and
where's the button
okay so let me just go with plain text
view so now you can see that pretty much
it organizes your stuff into a grid so
how cool is that you can see that it
shows me a lot of options to drag and
drop my element into any one of my
column or rows and these rows and
columns are actually dynamic they just
adjust to the screen width and the
available space so for example if I just
draw drop it here you can see the
previously the columns were 21 now there
are 18 so you know that is how pretty
much you create credit and there's some
sort of information available here as
well that how the grid layout is
occupied so that is how pretty much a
grid layout looks like and they're gonna
make a lot of fun apps with grid layout
pretty soon in this series of tutorials
only so that is all for this tutorial
and if you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one real
quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
