Mei hole and welcome to your first video
for electron framework and in the story
Aladdin this whole web series we're
going to create some awesome desktop
applications using front-end
technologies like JavaScript HTML and
CSS as basis so electron has been there
for a while I guess it was released
around three four years back
and it has become a lot popular these
days because of its portability on
multiple operating systems and
developing desktop apps with the
front-end technologies like JavaScript
so using electron what you can do is you
can create awesome desktop applications
with UI and all that good stuff about
menus and navigation then you can create
sort of notifications as well using the
native libraries of a particular
operating system and pretty much
anything you want and you can distribute
that again on Windows Mac or Linux
so it's cross-platform app maker right
sort off and again it is backed by
github so github controls the
spreadsheet now and if you have ever
used a text editor it is called Adam so
that editor is actually made all out of
electron as well so yeah electron has a
lot of use if you are familiar with
front-end technologies like JavaScript
then I guess you should be pretty much
well off with electron in no time
so that's all for the storia land in the
next video I'm going to show you how you
can set up your environment for electron
and we'll get started from there so hope
to see you soon there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
