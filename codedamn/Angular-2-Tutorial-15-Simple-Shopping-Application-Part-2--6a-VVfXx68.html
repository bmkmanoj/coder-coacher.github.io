are welcome Chiara 15 angular 2 tutorial
in which you will be just adding some
sort of styles to our application so
that it looks a bit nice on the browsers
so so far if you take a look it kind of
looks crappy and it just looks like a
bunch of h1 and B tags and you'll bags
which you know just every new learner do
with HTML so obviously you don't want to
take your site live with this sort of
structure although how good you're
coding in JavaScript maybe so let's just
add some sort of CSS to it now first of
all first things first let's get rid of
this template and add a template URL of
app and let's create templates folder
indexed on HTML and there's a way to
actually just get rid of all of this and
just write like templates dot HTML so if
I create a folder right here which says
templates and I create another file
which is index dot HTML and actually
this would not work right now and the
reason is that angular by default would
look inside the root directory if you
don't you know it will always look
inside the root directory no matter how
you specify the path and right in the
component like in the template URL or in
the style URL so if you take a look in
the browser you can see that it just
says that localhost templates index dot
HTML is not found so I'm gonna leave it
like app and probably the same directory
templates and like that again what I'm
going to do is let's just create another
folder right here which just says CSS
well we could actually create a simple
folder like assets and then put in
JavaScript and CSS in both of them but
anyways
let's just name a style dot CSS and
inside here I will just write my
wildcards we just apply to almost the
whole page and which don't need to be
edited again and again so I'm gonna link
this style inside my main index so my
main index file is index dot HTML and
right here I'm gonna say link rel
stylesheet' href is up and probably this
is CSS style dot CSS alright and as you
can see the styles are already applied
and from google fonts i'm gonna grab
this open sans for the font just place
the link here now what you can do is go
down to this line right here and inside
body let's just paste this and as you
can see it looks much better than before
again now we need styles for our
component so I'm gonna say style URL and
here would be again an absolute path
instead of relative so this would be app
CSS let's just name this as my sharp
component dot CSS and don't need a
semicolon right there so my shop
component dot CSS here we go and for
this what I can do is actually all right
this is 404 not found this is inside app
then we have CSS style well my shop Co
and Bo any
the shop zom oh there's a typo right
there see om p o ne and T right alright
now what we need to do is that once the
style is loaded let's just customize
this application a little bit from the
styles and as you know that these styles
only applied to components so I don't
need to do like h1 ID and something like
that so that it doesn't look messy at
all so that's the heads up for angular 2
zh component style urls and yeah so
that's pretty much it so let's just say
text-align:center
and why not just edit this as some name
to your shop let's just say your shop is
named as why not crazy coders so this is
the name aura of our shop ad we are
selling movies well so anyways well
that's how it looks right now and we can
just do a bit of styling from here only
so I'm just going to do a bit of styling
from the browser itself and would copy
that again then pixel 20 pics so I guess
we don't need that 20 pixel so let's
just make some space for header and the
border bottom to pixel solid and the
background would be a guess not really
black but you could actually have black
raccoon so color would be white and text
shadow
0:05 pixel white
you know this is just sort of a layout
which would I'm just quoting in five to
ten minutes you can go ahead and take
your time to code your own layout and
pretty much like all right now we have
this one add h1 then B then you will
just sort of unorganized isn't it
so let's just organize this a little bit
as well so this would be probably where
we are in the index so we have crazy
coders as the heading then we could have
you have the following movies available
alright so let's just change this to h3
h3 then we have let's just say div id my
movies list and you would probably need
to have one time or another these user
IDs and classes because he will just
can't rely on elements every time so we
have this movie list then you could
probably just get rid of this you will
at all and you could just go ahead with
a div of glass movie item and live here
as well
and we can just get rid of this recently
added movie and again you could just
actually create another separate file
for this card but for now I'm just going
to keep it inside my index dot HTML only
and inside this card I have this an h3
then a ul and then they was closed all
right now
what we can do is we can just probably
just wrap this whole thing into a
container actually container and a div
here as well and inside here we can say
container is width 960 pixels margin:0
auto and this looks like that right now
so for this we can say like h3 is
padding top 25 barring bottom then or
let's just say this is margin bottom 10
then we have water bottom 1 pixel solid
black only let's just see and then we
have a bit of color customization right
there just like that and again for these
the movie item what I can do is I can
just say this is rid of 33% and this
would be float:left again we would need
to clear out cursor:pointer we would
need to clear out the floats so what I'm
going to do is create a class content
display:block and clear boat so this is
some sort of simple CSS I guess I don't
need to dive much deep for this and what
I'm going to do is again just place my
CSS we have to clear the floats right
here so this
we class clear so let's just check this
out if the floats are cleared yes they
are so yeah all right now the next thing
we should probably do is that get some
batman vs superman image images and why
not just civil war
Captain America as well so what we have
Deadpool right so we have the pool as
well so let's just open the images for
this one as well so for Batman vs
Superman we could probably go ahead with
let's see this would be okay yeah this
one would be good and then we have for
Civil War as well I like this one but
the dimensions are not very much useful
for us and I'm on the side of Tony Stark
if you are wondering so we could just
get okay
all right so let's just go with this one
a leaf so this one's for Civil War and
for Deadpool it is let's just say this
one so this is for Batman versus
Superman I'm just gonna go ahead with
the relative layout or URLs only and not
gonna save them or anything or such like
that so what I can do is right here I
can probably say that this is movie Adam
and then we have our if you don't like
then you can just write data or let's
just keep it in the class itself so
we'll say movie item movie all right now
let's just take a look in the browser
and as you can see we have a bit of
floor room because there are some sort
of spaces so I don't know it would work
or not let's try this out this is a
simple JavaScript tag to remove spaces
and looks like it'd probably work yeah
so it worked so you could actually just
make use of some sort of JavaScript
stuff inside this expression also so now
we have the name of the movie as well
concatenated the class name so what I
can go do is go ahead and inside style
know inside knot style I can say movie
item or just simply Batman vs Superman
as background URL is this one right
there and similarly for the other three
and what is their names Civil War and
Deadpool
so for civil war we have this one on the
background and for Deadpool we have I
guess I placed it in wrong positions so
for Civil War again we have this one as
the background well it looks good but
not really so let's just extend the
height of these containers a little bit
so what I'm gonna say is height is 300
pixels and we're stead pool that were
console all right so they are so you
thought of using some sort of hot link
prediction never mind
so for this one again I would just go
ahead and write background size 100% or
200% way about background size so this
would go for all the movie items and
where's the height 1 400 pixels and
background for Civil War it is no repeat
all this to central central alright cool
now for Deadpool Deadpool images let's
go with this one so let's to see if it
allows us to use Deadpool or not
what this one is good as well so let's
just go with this one because that
loaded first so this is right there and
inside our browser if you take a look it
looks kind of cool
the next thing what you can do is you
can just wrap all of this movie inside
span class movie name this pan is closed
right there and then what you can do is
just position it relative and for dot
movie name you can say that it is
absolutely positioned and it is bottom
zero with 100% height let's just leave
hide background is black and text line
is settled so let's just take a look
hard looks so all right looks like we
have some sort of blah blah okay so this
should be left zero as well here we go
and four back on black I want color as
white this could be a bit transparent
actually this is change this to RGB a
and transparency sweet and padding off
10 pixel zero will do the job and the
last thing we need to do about this one
is that
ha so we can just reduce this - or we
can just apply a margin of 20 pixels
directly and make use of in the style
that CSS border sizing what was that
property name yes mom yes so it was
box-sizing box-sizing border box and
doesn't look like it worked
does it so we have still a bit of
problem right there so let's just make
the margin to 2% that would do the job I
guess probably yeah so let's just get
rid of this we'll take a look at that
later on someday and this would be
margin 2% and width of 29% so here we
are with our Deadpool page ready or the
movies page ready we have just made a
bit of customization to our home page so
it looks a bit nice now you could
actually do this for card as well but
I'm just gonna leave it right now with
this one as only so we'll be continuing
with our web application from here only
from this point and if you just you're
lazy enough to not just code this
yourself then don't worry I'll just
leave a link in the description where
you can find all of these files
absolutely ready for you to start coding
from the next tutorial onwards so guys
that's all for this one and if you liked
