Christine development tutorial my name
is may hole and this would be a quick
tutorial on how to fix a bunch of stuff
which will left and last tutorial and I
don't know why I just left that pretty
much so anyways what we are left with is
that we are actually left with an
non-working sort of form right now which
just sort of accepts a text field but
actually doesn't even stores that or you
know notifies you that there's some sort
of update going on in the database and
it kind of sucks right now actually
because it's not properly connecting to
my MySQL and database so i'm just gonna
restart my server and see if it works
yeah pretty much so save this you can
see that nothing happens so to fix that
what I'm gonna do instead is hop over to
this admin dot PHP template static and
add an action which will left later two
options dot PHP and the reason is that
what Burris
you know commands you to direct all of
the form fields and the forms two
options dot PHP and from options dot PHP
onwards actually what press takes care
of your stuff so if I just go to like WP
and the options dot PHP you can see that
pretty much this is not the file which
we want but actually the option start
PHP which would be sort of in WP admin
so we need to go to WP admin instead WP
admin and then options dot PHP so you
can see that
right here it's sort of like storing
some sort of stuff and if you just a
little bit attention you could see that
it has some redirecting options which
will just allow the user or notify the
user to say that you're actually your
settings are saved or they are not saved
and stuff like you are not allowed to
manage these items or cheating uh I
don't know what this when this would
appear can see from the if statement
that if current user can capability is
the capability which we added right here
in the manage options right there so
might be some sort of stuff so you can
see that pretty much options dot PHP
does its job and would probably this
work pretty fine and the next thing you
can do is actually right here you can
say that free text is actually get
option right here I'm gonna say this is
my black box which is the same name as
the input type name and you could pretty
much depend that and value free text
right there here you go reload write
like a number or something and as you
can see it pretty much stores the number
now because we have pretty much got it
in the input text field and another
thing which you can do is because right
now if you just you know add something
and save it doesn't actually tells the
user whether their action was successful
or not well it kind of looks successful
to us but if you have like some a lot of
fields on the screen then you want to
list down the errors so to do that what
you can do
instead our settings I'll leave it like
that so if you reload this now and I
guess this would be errors then reload
save you can see that we get settings
saved pretty cool now this function
would pretty much just is handled by
options dot PHP and would display the
result sent by option start PHP and
that's how pretty much it works so
that's all for this tutorial and in the
next tutorial I'll just show you how to
implement this text on your live website
right here instead of the static text so
if like this tutorial then don't you
think you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
