first part in that video series of
making money online so in this spot what
I'll be teaching guys is how you can
make a few bucks online easily with your
social accounts so if you are looking to
make a few bucks online fast and easy
way in an easy way without doing much of
the things then this tutorial is for you
so we have something called as URL
shorteners which pays you every time
whenever you click a link so not you
actually the people with whom you share
the link so I have got two websites
right here for you but there are many
more so if you're free to try those but
I guess these two would be good for the
person who doesn't know about a much
about URL shorteners so this one is
shortest and this one is a DF not ly now
I like shortest because its design is
pretty much appealing to anybody who is
looking to start earning online and AD F
dot ly though has a less fancy design
than shortest but is an old player in
the market so on both of the sites you
can use a Facebook to log in immediately
so I'll just show you both the
interfaces so just click on login on a
DF toward Elvira and click on log in
with Facebook and here as well click on
log in with Facebook
okay looks like we have bad internet
connection right now okay so it worked
all right never mind so these are my two
accounts on shortest and on this one ATF
dot ly as well so to do on something
let's say you have God latest
information about Google changing its
logo so let's say I Google about Google
Doodle logo change and I guess the link
was with me a day ago but Google just
removed that link from the homepage now
yep so this is the doodle let's say this
image is here so let's say I want to
tweet this to all of my followers my 1.5
k followers about the information that
Google has changed is logo and I also
want to share this on my Facebook page
so what I'll do is I'll copy any
interesting link and I'll paste this
here so I'll use some more options and
I'll set the custom name as Google new
logos so it looks kind of more appealing
the domain ad F dot ly should be enough
and selecting there's still a Desmond
click on shrink and here you go now
whenever somebody clicks this link you
would be paid so how much well that
depends on the country of the user which
click that and the interaction of that
particular user with the advertisements
shown there so if I was at this page
you'll see I guess I need to put this as
HTTPS because in my country ad F dot ly
is actually
and I don't know why but it is so I
guess the page would open shortly yep
so it redirects automatically me to a
wider Gy which is not bad so you see
that this is the advertisement area and
I have to wait five seconds as a user so
whenever somebody clicks this link he
she would have to wait only five seconds
and an advertisement would be shown here
and if you're lucky enough then the
highest paying rate here is about five
dollars per thousand views which is not
bad the similar thing can be done on
shortest as well I can use the same URL
and I'll shorten it do you see that I
got this URL and similarly just like ATF
dot L where it would just make me wait
around five seconds or would just verify
that I'm a real human then an
advertisement would be shown here and
once this 5 second timer is done the
user can click and go to the link and I
would be paid in return so share your
link as much as you can once you join
these two sites ad F dot ly and shortest
and then you could see the Bucks coming
in daily so that's it for the first part
and in the next part I'll be showing you
more ways to make money online so till
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
