Miho and welcome to your 35th angular 6
tutorial in which we're gonna take a
look at what and how actually we can
basically get the data from the angular
store so let's get started okay so in
this video what we're gonna do is
basically get the data from the radix
store somehow to our components so that
we can see and access them and yeah
basically that's it for this tutorial
Alaska's get started with what we intend
to do so what I'm gonna do first of all
let's just say I want to get some sort
of state in my header component let's
say I want to know if the user is logged
in or not so I'm gonna first of all in
check a service now I can directly query
the state here as well but let's just
keep components clean so I'm gonna make
use of a service here I'm assisting this
user and this would be user service
there we go and then what I can do
something like this dot user dot get all
state maybe first of all and that's
subscribe because this would work on
observables so we're gonna subscribe to
that and I'm just gonna say state I'm
just sort of constant log this state for
now okay so that's for the component
part and what we're gonna do next is go
to the user service and right here write
a method something like get all state I
believe that's what we named it there
inside the component yep and then here
I'm gonna return this dot actually we
need to get the store first so let's
just inject the store here 5-it store
store nope it should be store there we
go and the type it has is just let's
just make it any for now and now what
I'm going to do is this the store select
now what this method does is that you
need to pass in the name of your state
which you want to get back in our case
what this would be and how you determine
this is this a producer one because my I
named it a producer so I'm just gonna
say a producer give me a producer and
yeah basically that's it because we are
in the back in the code we are
subscribing to this thing so what I'm
gonna do is basically that's it so so if
you see that if we reload this
and check that out in the console we get
the login as falls of our state which is
a default state so what I can do here it
said my header component is say that
state that login is true then I want to
set our let us say we can say something
like create message this trade the login
is true hello then state that user
otherwise it should be guessed right how
do this make it this okay so now if you
take a look now we can just start greet
message is not defined okay let's just
try to move this logic let's just say
this dot
don't start Crede message is let's say
we default is to loading actually you
can just default this to loading here
only loading something like this and
then we should be able to see say this
not creat message like that okay so now
you can see that we get guest here and
if I somehow change the default state
here from false to true now let's just
change this to user may whole we can
just update this as well something like
this and if you reload you can see that
I get hello may hook which where we
could just plug in this thing or
basically just plug out this thing as we
want so it will just show guest and
hello me just like that so it becomes
easy now for us to actually manage the
state with the store and reducers and
all that stuff set up for us so yeah
that's all for this one and on the next
one I'm gonna show you how you can
update the state and make sure your
people your components which are
listening to subscribe to that
particular thing are also updated and
informed about that well that's more
like the observables part but yeah we
will just take a look so that's all for
this one and I'll see you then in the
next video and one more thing if you
