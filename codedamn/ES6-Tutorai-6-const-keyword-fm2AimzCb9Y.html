hole and welcome to your fifth akma
script six tutorial in which i'll be
showing you what is constant now a
constant is a variable well that is our
a little but who cares so a constant is
a variable which cannot be modified so
that is why it is a constant variable
well what does that actually mean well
if I just create a constant let's just
say by a 3.14 and if now I can use this
just like any other variable like i can
multiply it or add to it or do anything
whatever I want to do with it but if I
try to change it like I change it to
four and then I run this code in the
browser you can see that it's throws an
error of assignment to constant variable
and this is an error so this is a type
error obvious obvious ly so well the
thing with Constance is that though they
are themselves protected but the
properties associated with constants are
not so if you just create like like my
constants and do like pi is 3.14 is 2.73
and like that then this is not a good
approach the reason is that you can
actually modify this so I can change
this to four I can console.log my
constants so if I reload this as you can
see that pious change to four well
though I can change this the value or
the properties of the constant I cannot
change the constant itself so if I just
right on red here then this wouldn't be
allowed as you can see i am trying to
change an object to a number so that is
not allowed and will a number to a
number is also not allowed just in case
you were wondering so yeah so that's how
basically constants work and
that's it for this tutorial and in the
next tutorial will be looking about
something more interesting in egmore
script 6 so stay tuned with me don't
