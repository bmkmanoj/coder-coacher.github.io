mayo and welcome to your fifth angular
six tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to take a look at how to actually
work with lifecycle hooks and not really
work with but just a brief overview this
would be a quick two second video
tutorial on lifecycle hooks in angular
and we just need to know this because we
will be making use of lifecycle hooks a
lot in later in our applications which
will be creating but on its own there's
really no use of lifecycle hooks knowing
just knowing what they are because you
can't create an application an angular
application which just contains an
energy on init function right it doesn't
make sense so this is just a step for a
bigger staircase but though I don't even
know what that means but anyways so
let's get started okay so what we have
in here is some lifecycle hooks listed
for angular so these are all the
lifecycle hooks which you might use
sometimes in your code now you might use
them and you might use them sometimes
right not every time so starting from
the top what we have on changes now this
on changes is invoked every time there's
a change let's say you have some kind of
input property in your components so if
you change that this own changes will be
fired so you can handle those kind of
changes there on a net would be fired
whenever your component is initialized
right and the thing with all in it is
that it would be called only once per
component so you can be sure that the
code you write in on in it would be
fired once so this is an ideal place for
let's say if you're retrieving some data
with some REST API for a component or a
given component then on in
is the place where you would want to
perform an HTTP request okay so the next
event the next life cycle hook we have
is the do check one and the do chick one
is actually fired by angular when
actually angular thinks that there is a
change right so what we have with
angular is that angular itself has its
some sort of detector which actually
detects the changes behind the scenes
right because that's how the things work
so do check would be fired by angular if
angular suspects something has changed
so you can add your own custom
implementations in this to check then
what we have is the app content in it
after content checked after unit and
after you checked now these four would
make a lot more sense to you if you know
something about the content projection
but I believe I have not covered it yet
but what content projection I can give
you overview of what that is is okay
let's just take it that way for example
let's just say let's just get rid of
this this is a quick intro to content
projection let's just say you create a
select tag right so you have a bunch of
option tags here like option one and
then option two three four and so on and
so forth all right so what angular does
is let's say if you're creating your own
custom component what you can do is you
let us say this is your own custom
component let's say this is my own
component my own component right
so angular allows you to add these
children inside your own component
instead of director so let's say you
want every option to be red colored so
what you can do is just add a class of
red to every option in here
right for example let's say you want
this option to be red as well I will
come to that in a second what I wanted
to say earlier so okay
all right so we have all of these
options as read now you could have
implemented this thing in a single
component file as well so I could save
my own component all option colors and
read and inside the definition of this
file when I render all those options I
would just add loop over every option
and add this class as well now the
problem arises when I want this second
option to be blue right so in that case
I cannot do something like all options
and then grid in that case I would
happen to like option two is blue and
then render it as blue you know you get
the idea I have to write a lot of code
to make it specific to a particular
option added scatter of pain in the butt
to organize all that code so what
actually is coming to the point what
content projection pretty much is is in
one line is that you can write my own
component and then your children child
components here and you can pretty much
work with all of your child components
just right here and in this definition
in definition of this own component you
would write ng content and what this
would do is that it would reflect
whatever child components you are
passing in in this my own component so
in a nutshell more people talking about
was right so we have after content in it
after content checked after viewing it
after you check so these four events are
associated with this content property so
in a nutshell what we have in is that
for content projection what we need we
have is are these four lifecycle hooks
and after content in it would fire if
there is a change okay so what we have
in here is that I have created this
simple program which pretty much just
adds a component
removes it so if I add the test
component you can see that we get ng on
in it called first of all then ng to
check is called then after a Content and
it is called you can see that on and get
called do check is called after content
in it is called content checked is
called viewing it is called how you
check this call and she destroy is not
call because it is not destroyed it but
if I remove this component you can see
that ng destroy is called now if I add
it again add it one more time you can
see all these methods getting call again
and again and if I remove this component
you can see that and she destroy what's
called then ng to check was again called
because it seemed to angular like
something has changed and then ng I have
to contain check this call and after a
few check is also called because views
are changed so angular's after content
shaked and after you check that call
after ng to check so this was basically
the flow of how angular is taking care
of lifecycle hook evens and take away
from this it's pretty much that ng on in
it is the place to call some methods you
want to because this is the point which
would be called once in your core and it
would be by the time this method is call
your component would be ready to be
rendered right so yeah that was all for
this one and I'll see you them in the
