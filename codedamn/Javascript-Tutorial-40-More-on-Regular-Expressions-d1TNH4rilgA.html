40th JavaScript tutorial in which we'll
be discussing more on regular
expressions and if you are here like
blind sitting and have no idea what the
heck is regular expressions and what the
heck is going on so I do recommend you
to go back in to my playlist and watch
the very last tutorial which is the 39th
tutorial where I started with regular
expressions with you guys so now let's
get started with regular expressions so
the last tutorial we learned about what
regular expressions are and how they
work and in this tutorial let's look at
an example so for example let's write a
string my string let's say
it's god damn so that's kind of arrived
arrived
now let's screw it another string let's
say
a programmer
no life that's kinda actually true so
now let's say I want to check whether
his word is available in the sentence
down here so one way it would be to
check index off but just forget that
because in this miniseries we would be
learning about regular expressions and
to give you the most simple example of
regular expressions you don't have to
think about index off because obviously
that could be done with index off but we
are here to learn regular expressions so
to create a regular expressions okay so
first of all I should tell you that just
like we did create objects in two ways
in JavaScript first way is the object
literal by using two curly braces
it creates an object
and the second way is by using the new
keyword to create an object which is a
constructor function similarly in
regular expressions we have the regular
expression literal and the constructor
function let's look at take a look at
two for literal one we have regular
expression literal and for the
constructor one we have this constructor
function so for the literal one what we
have is we have a forwarding slash then
your expression then we have another
forward slash and that's pretty much it
so we have now created a regular
expression in literal format and for the
constructor function format we have an
object our eg exp now this stands for
regular expression and in the arguments
it takes the expression as a string so
we have let's say expression down here
so there's pretty much no difference
between these two but for performance
issues I would go with this and while
creating dynamic regular expressions I
would go with this and I'll explain the
reason in
having tutorials but for now for the
sake of simplicity let's ignore this
second one the constructor function 1
and let's go with the expression literal
let's name it reg X so it's kind of
looks fancy
and now to test a string against a
regular expression what you need is you
need a string method go and search now
string method search kind of works like
this way let's say I have one result as
my strength
dot search now this is a string method
so it would be accepting a string dot
search and if the parentheses down here
it requires a regular expression either
in the quotes format or as fast as a
variable so we already have a regular
expression in the variable reg X so here
we go and now let's see what this result
got so let's do a document dot write
reserved and now let's reload this on
browser
okay so you have got a negative one and
that is because oh sorry I forgot to
replace this expression with my own one
so in this expression down here let's
say I want to search for the s key
whereas I told you earlier
so let's write is as an expression I
remember no codes are on this and two
for weddings last so that JavaScript
knows that it isn't a variable but is an
expression a regular expression now
let's save it and let's reload this now
we get nine as a result and what does
that nine symbolize here is 0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 so this is word begins at 9th
position
so that's they pretty much one method in
regular expressions but if we have a lot
more and we don't often use the search
but it was kind of necessary for you
guys to explain because this is the most
simple or this is the simplest regular
expression method for you guys to
understand and to basically adopt or
take in your mind what regular
expressions are and using regular
expressions you could create your
powerful programs and could save your
code a thousand lines
from validation so that's how regular
expression works and in front of you is
a kind of hello world regular expression
so I'll see you then in the next
