JavaScript tutorial in the last tutorial
we learned about inheritance in
JavaScript and how properties and
methods of one constructor function
could be inherited into another in this
tutorial we'll be learning how to create
private methods and properties in a
JavaScript constructor function okay to
start with let's create a constructor
function with name let's say patrol bomb
let's apply with an argument
actual liters let's create our private
variables
look carefully that's how you create it
to create a private variable you either
write the variable followed by war
keyword or do not write war at all
because both will point to dysfunction
only but if you want to create private
variable do not write this keyword
because this would refer to the object
and then object could actually access
that variable so to create private
variables use the keyword var or nothing
at all
I'm using no keyword here so let's give
a troll price per liter
let's say 50 INR 5060 INR I guess right
now is equal to $1 okay then let's
create a method total price is function
I'll let it return
that troll price per liter star patrol
in liters that is supplied by the user
please notice that I haven't used the
keyword this here because this is a
private variable and we do not require
to use this keyword right here okay so
we have this total price let's create
another method which is gas-filled but
let's create this as a public method and
let's do this dot function let's call
this method
and this job price is equal to total
price
let's do
returned their stock price
and just do like this you're surprised
this
okay we are all set now let's create an
object cards go to new
control pump and let's supply let's say
I want to get five litres of petrol
let's do a console.log of God
Phil
let's check this out in a browser
and you can see the output is output is
your total price is 250 now what's
happening here is we created a new
object with the new Cuba new petrol pump
five this argument is supplied here
price per liter here then this dot fill
method when this is not fill me that is
called this dot fill request the total
price method now this method is
accessible by the this dot fill method
because they belong to the same
constructor function but if we try to do
console the clock car dot total price
then it would result in an error to
refresh this page and as you can see it
says uncut type error undefined is not a
function this means that this this
method and this property is private to
this constructor function but once you
use the keyword this then the property
or the method becomes the global and
could be accessed by the object so this
was a short tutorial on private methods
and properties you could use these
private methods and properties to
protect your code or kind of when you're
working on so was like no yes
then you use these private and public
properties just like you do in CS C++
and Java and PHP like that to protect
unnecessary access allowance to your
objects so this was a short tutorial on
private methods and properties
I hope you learn something from it don't
