ho and welcome to your third electron
framework tutorial in which I'm going to
show you a real quick and real dirty way
of creating a hello world app and I'm
going to keep the last simple and as
restricted as I can so that I can nicely
explain other things when the time is
right so what I'm going to do is show
you how quick and easy it is to actually
create a very simple hello world in
electron right so let's just get rid of
this first and let's just get a very
simple document which just says a hello
world and hello electron pretty much
like that we can just make use of our
old school CSS as well something like
that
or rather I guess it should be cream
right red kind of looks dangerous so
anyways now this is something I want to
show but again we need to make use of
JavaScript to do that so what I'm going
to do is first of all I'm going to
import some packages which would be the
app and the browser window from
electrons right key are right so we have
installed electron and it is available
globally now so we can just make use of
that again we're going to make use of
URL which would be required URL to
actually locate this index dot HTML file
right so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create function good we just
fires whenever our electron up is ready
to show user pages right because the
electron itself has to work a lot in the
background so I'm going to create a
variable win and I'm going to create say
that this is new browser window and I'm
going to say win download URL load you
are our rel is your elder form
and this would accept an object and what
this would do and actually you can just
leave some angolans if you want this
would do is that it would help you to
format actually what we add which while
you're gonna put your or at which file
you want electron to go and read its
content and display to the user but
there there are a lot of options here
but whatever keep just do funnel so that
we can just keep it simple and since we
haven't the same directory I'm just
going to make use of roughly make use of
this otherwise you can just make use of
dir name on Windows and refereed why and
absolute path but I'm just going to skip
that for now and I'm going to say
slashes is equal to true so that our
path is probably you know well it did
are actually constructed by the URL door
format right so yeah that's pretty much
it so I'm going to stay after on ready
and again this app is the same one which
you have we are importing from electron
and again so self-explanatory more or
less that it would fire boot function
whenever the electron is ready to
actually show the user some meat right
so yeah that's all for a very simple
hello world and if you take a look in
the terminal we can launch our app by
single ik phone and dot do you see we
have our very first application of hello
electron from electron created is purely
using HTML CSS and JavaScript so that is
all for this one and if you liked it
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching see you then in the
next one real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
