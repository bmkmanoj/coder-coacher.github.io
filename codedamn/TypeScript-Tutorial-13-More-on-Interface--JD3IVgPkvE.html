Miho and welcome to your 13th died
script tutorial in which I'm gonna show
you what interface how interface can be
used to create function headers and then
you're gonna kind of create a blueprint
out of what you're you know whatever
your object as an object would act and
I'd rather show you how what I'm talking
about so interface lets us create an
interface and let's say you are creating
a game in JavaScript and actually for
the web
so I have this like player as an
interface and then inside this I have
functions like run and this is a void
return then what means that it returns
nothing then I have like lives and this
would be a number type argument so that
we can just add number of lives if you
want to add then what we can do is like
add a score here then this would be a
number type right so now what I'm gonna
do is create a function here which would
be create player and now what I'm gonna
do here is that I'm gonna set what this
function returns is a player right so
now what does that mean is that whatever
I write in here should comply with this
interface right so this prevents us from
adding unnecessary code or basically
this prevents us from having a lot of
errors like an error you made while
writing the property name like if you
have run if you write run instead off
you know you use double n then it will
show you an error so now if we create a
quickly create definition for every
function which we have in our interface
it doesn't return us anything and then
we have lives as a function and as a
number argument and then it doesn't
return us anything either and then score
it
function as well but it returns us like
a score or something should be a cola
actually right so now it matches with
our interface and now we can create
safely create any player like player 1
is equal to create layer like that
actually just do that so now this is how
pretty much you create an interface now
this is the kind of a blueprint so that
you do not you know do any sort of
mistake like instead of lies if you
write like this or you know why the
words are you do f here and then write V
there so this kind of prevents errors
like these silly errors and it kind of
creates your code more compatible and
not compatible actually but it just you
know enhances your code that you do not
create buggy code right so as you can
see it builds successfully and it's not
kind of a lot different from what we
have would we have written in JavaScript
if you did it natively but say like if I
have scores here instead of score then
would immediately show me an error that
scores is not assignable to type player
otherwise in JavaScript it would just
silently do not it actually would
wouldn't do anything you know at all in
JavaScript it wouldn't show you any
error or whatever because javascript
doesn't know so this is a very basic use
of interfaces and you can make use of
interfaces a lot more in classes as well
which we take a look at when we would do
classes and typescript and yeah so that
is all for this tutorial and if you like
that then don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching I'll see you then
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
