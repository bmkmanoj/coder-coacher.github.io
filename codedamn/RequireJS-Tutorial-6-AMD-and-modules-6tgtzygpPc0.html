your tutorial number six in require.js
I'm a ho and in this tutorial I'll be
showing you and we'll be introducing you
to AMD now this is not AMD which is
associated with you know the circuits
and semiconductors this one is the
asynchronous module definition now what
does that mean
now I have made a bit of changes here I
would like to show you those first so I
just moved all of the libraries which I
used to work with in this library folder
and the configuration file is also in
the J's folder and it looks something
like this so it just points to the J's
folder right now and yeah so that's
pretty much it and if I reload this you
can see that it works so even if you get
rid of that line that should work again
as you can see so let's get back to work
and the AMD now AMD is basically as I
told you is synchronous module
definition so this is AMD and this is
just a fancy way of you know just kind
of saying for now you can just
understand it like that that it's your
way to make your own JavaScript files
work with required years so yeah so
that's Kara you know an element regard
of definition for AMD for now and so
let's say you want to cut off you have a
lot of methods on your website and you
want to just push them all of them at
all of those methods into a separate
script file so how would you do that
well you can obviously create a new
JavaScript file here let's just say our
method sturgis and you
just start writing your functions all in
here click function submit form or
function load more posts and all that
stuff but how the heck would require
just know that when it it has to fire
this file or any on this function and
what is the dependency and all of that
stuff so to EMD fire the script kind of
you can see you what you need to do is
you again need to make use of the
defined keyword so would define i'm
writing a script here now this is my
custom script and the jquery file as you
can see i use this but i didn't use this
code again somewhere so this was gone up
you know a hard code type of thing so
this would obviously run on my web page
but what if i want to create a file
something like jquery a library you can
say or angular or x-score or whatever so
to do that first of all just go ahead
and create a defined and inside here
would go the dependencies which would
your which your file would requires for
example if you were writing a jquery
plugin got off so you would just write
it here jquery will actually with jQuery
plugins as well most of them would hook
them to the jQuery global so you
wouldn't need that but anyways I'm just
kind of giving you example so let's just
say our mini plug-in requires a bit of
jQuery so inside here let's say this is
my method store JS file which it
actually is so I'm gonna create a
methods object and inside here let's
just say change its tml
function and let's say this just changes
and don't forget to pass the dollar sign
body dot html' let's just say this is
the argument and this is the argument so
yeah and another one you can just add at
that show a load and function argument
again alert argument
simple as that so I'll just keep it to
two methods right now so what we are
doing here is I'm just creating an
object object I'm just attaching two
functions kind of to this object and
finally what I need to do is I need to
return this methods object and why
needed to return that I'll just show you
that in a minute so for now let's just
go back to our jQuery file here and
since this file method sturdiest does
not do anything on its own so even if I
call it somehow I can't do anything so I
need to call the functions the functions
of these methods so in this jQuery file
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add
another dependency methods but to make
this work again I have to go to my
configuration file and inside here I
need to add methods and this since this
is a custom script custom scripts
methods touch yes and you don't need the
cheers and yeah so that's pretty much it
and inside here I don't need angular for
now so for the jQuery I got dollar and
for this let's just keep it methyl it's
only so what I want to do is now is that
just create a button right here so
button ID click me and click me dot
click what I want to do is I just want
to change this HTML so what I'm gonna
write us methods dot change HTML - I was
clicked
yeah so everything looks good let's try
it out in the browser let's reload this
let's just open the console for in
debugging ok so as you can see the text
change is - I was clicked now what's
happening here is to revise or one more
time I am adding a dependency call
methods and this methods is taking its
path from this conflict of Jesus and
Aris this custom scripts up slash
methods tortillas file and this file
right here
first of all requires jQuery and then
this is the object and then this is the
function to which I'm at a appending
function again which is change tml which
just accepts the arguments applied and
would change the HTML accordingly and
the show alert you can show that one as
well so you see that it will it works so
this one as well this simply shows an
alert and finally I'm returning this
methods and this methods is basically
returned to this require geus and this
is basically you know this right here is
directly hooked up right here so as if
this right here at I'm a safe so instead
of this what you can use this yellow or
you know whatever
so even whatever would work fine
as long as you make use of the same word
here and here
wherever you are calling so you see that
this name doesn't matter but just keep
in mind that whatever you make use of
here you have to make it available it
everywhere in your code so return
methods just simply returns the
reference to this object and all of
these functions are - to it inside here
and the reason why you don't need to am
defy your jQuery script because you
might ask that how this works it doesn't
have any define or whatever call neither
does it looks like it is returning
jQuery - this one right here so that is
because MD is not a simple concept
limited to just require J's
it is used in many other frameworks as
well so jQuery is quite a bit adopted to
AMD and as you can see somewhere here it
looks like they are making use of
something else you know for checking if
the call is by a script which which
wants to try an AMD or you know if you
just download the non compressed version
of this jQuery then you could kind of
read it a bit better so just download
the non-compressed code search for AMD
and somewhere here is the code we just
you know makes jQuery work with these
files so most of the popular libraries
would work without any problem but if
you face any problem like a script is
not working so most probably that would
be because this that script kind of
needs you to M defy it so that's all for
this tutorial
and the next tutorial let's see what I
will cover yeah so I'll see you then
