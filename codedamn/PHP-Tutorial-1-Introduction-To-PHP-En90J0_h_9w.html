your very first tutorial on PHP
development now PHP is a great language
for server-side programming I myself use
PHP to program all of my server side web
sites more Bri website has a suicide now
even before starting I would like to
discuss a little bit about PHP now
whenever you visit a website let's say
code on calm now
what happens is when you wizard the side
your browser requests a page or some
information from the remote server which
is hosting this website so whenever your
browser requests that your server has to
determine what it has to display and how
it is displayed and what additional
information if you want to send to the
browser so all of the stuff which the
server responds to your computer is done
by suicide language including PHP but
not limited to PHP only because there
are many server-side languages like PHP
asp.net and even Java so in this video
series we will be learning about PHP
only so let's get started now to develop
in PHP we need a server on a computer
because obviously purchasing a server is
not feasible for just learning purposes
so what we can do is we can create our
own server on our computer and then we
can use that to basically run PHP
commands on our own computer so to do
that first of all go to google in the
search box type zamp for windows or
whatever your operating system is click
on the wave first link and if you're on
windows download
the recent one PHP five point six point
one two but if you are watching it right
now and the PHP seven is available then
go ahead with this one because I would
prefer you to download the latest one
only now the next thing you have to do
is when you are done downloading this
108 MB or something then you will get a
file something like this
so now double click on this setup you'll
get installation screen now it would
prompt you to it seems you have an
anti-virus running in some cases whoa
really
I don't thought that I had an NT worse
on my computer
see anyways let's continue with the
installation
ok next make sure you have selected all
these next next ok now we could actually
delete that if that's creating some
problem because I know I whoa yep so
let's just delete that
because this folder is from windows 8
which I have upgraded now to Windows 10
so I guess I just copied and pasted it
this year so faster faster
okay
now click on Google Chrome I prefer that
click on next and if we take its time to
install now I'll just pause the video
here and I'll resume that what it's
about to complete ok so we are closed
all right
yep so just click on the finish button
and yay
now finally we have a can of geeky type
panel so go ahead and hit start on a
bash allow the network access for sure
and congratulations you have set up your
server on your computer now we'll be
doing the hello world program for PHP in
the next tutorial because you know I
like to create a separate video for the
first HelloWorld program for any
language so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial I'll just wanna give you
guys a closer look to the panel for
those lazy who are not gonna download it
with the video running right now so
that's it for this tutorial I'll see you
the next time don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
