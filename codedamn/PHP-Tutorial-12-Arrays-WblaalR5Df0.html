calm and in this tutorial we'll be
learning about arrays in PHP now so far
what we have been doing is we have
learned different kind of loops for loop
while loop do-while loop and we looked
at the if-else statements with
statements conditional operators
automatic operators and so on but from
now onwards we would be using that in
PHP to create some real world
applications so let's start with arrays
now
Ares is a bunch of collection of objects
in PHP you have chiefly two ways to
create array which is like let's save my
air is the variable and first way is to
create array array as this should be
like array and inside this you could
pass your objects and these would be all
arrays distinct elements inside an array
or you have another way my added two to
create array as element 1 element 2 and
so on
I like second way myself because it
keeps things clean and easier to read
but you could adopt any of the ways so
what is an are basically so an array is
a group of you can say RS allows you to
store a bunch of elements together in a
single variable so let's say you want to
have an array of your favorite
programming languages so what you can do
is you can create in my area as HTML CSS
JavaScript PHP like that and then you
could echo out an array by using its
index number so what is an index number
it starts with 0 starts with 0 this one
would be 1
two and three so if I want to access
HTML I would need to use the index
numbers zero so inside the square
brackets if I pass zero then this is
actually selecting HTML so if I run that
in the browser you see I got the output
as HTML Alan PHP what you can do is you
could eventually type keep any other
types keep different types of data types
together so let's say if I want to keep
the number 100 here as well so it would
have an index of 4 and if I type 4 here
then you can see we got the hundred as
output in traditional languages like C++
and C you could not do that
you cannot keep different types of data
types together in a single Eric but in
PHP you can so that's one more advantage
of PHP and in array we could it create
over every element so that you could get
output at once so I guess I told you
about I told you guys about for each
loop and width for each what we can do
is instead of writing for I equals to 0
as less than 5 I plus plus and then echo
my array I we could use for each loop as
variable as my array here any temporary
variable let's say element and what I'll
do with echo element let's reload this
so you see we got HTML CSS JavaScript
PHP and 100 now how does that work so in
for each what we used to do what we do
is actually we copy every element in one
iteration not every element the
particular element associated with
particular iteration in the temporary
variable elem so in the first one the
for each loop
copied my air is first element that is
HTML Elam and we occurred that in the
second one it copied the second array
element of the array in LM then we
occurred that so similarly it friend
this all happens behind the scenes by
PHP and I guess I told you guys about
for in loop instead of for each enough
for in loop is actually used in
JavaScript so I guess I confuse I was
confused there a little bit so there's
no for in loop in PHP but for each loop
in PHP so far each loop is used to
iterate over array elements so we could
similarly do this thing with traditional
for loop as well to do that for I equals
to 0 is less than 5 which is the length
of your array I plus less not see out
echo I not i but my array I like that so
you see we got one more iteration of
that particular area now there are many
things you can do with array which we'll
be learning in the next tutorial but for
this tutorial I guess this masters
enough so if this tutorial helped you
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you there next
