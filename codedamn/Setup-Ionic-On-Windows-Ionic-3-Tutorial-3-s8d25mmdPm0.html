Rahul and welcome to your third tutorial
for ionic framework in which we're going
to take a look at how you can set up
ionic on Windows so if you take a look
in the documentation you can see that it
says us to install ionic with the NPM
and if you do not know what NPM is it's
just a package manager which comes
bundled with node so you can go to
node.js org and download the latest
stable release and it would be kind of
just in clicking next next process so
you should be up and running with it in
no time so once you do that what you're
going to do is go to any directory and
open command line window there by
holding shift and right clicking on that
and you should be able to write NPM
right there and get some results like
this so if you get something like this
that means NPM is correctly set up on
your computer so once you do that what
you want to do is install ionic so to do
that again just write NPM install g--
Cordova and ionic so what it does is
that it installs ionic and Cordova
globally on your computer so that you do
not need to install it again and again
for individual projects and by the way
Cordova is just something on which ionic
is built on so it's basically Cordova
which actually packages your application
for the mobile devices and ionic
provides a wrapper for the UI and all
that functionality so it might take a
little bit time depending upon your
connection speed and all that stuff so
just wait for it and yeah so you can see
that it's installed already installed on
my computer so for you it might be a
little bit different the message might
be a little bit different so once you do
that to verify you can say ionic weak
and you should get three point something
depending upon your release your time of
watching this video
once you do that what you can do is
actually start a new ionic project by
staying ionic start and the project name
let's just say first step and then the
boilerplate template you want I'm going
to go with blank so that we do not get
any sort of functionality attached to it
already so you can see that it's
creating our project and it's
downloading some files for us first and
let it run so once it's done you should
see a message something like this and
I'm just not going to link it to the
dashboard right now okay so now if you
can do is go to our app and right here
we can say ionic serve this would start
a local development server on your
computer itself so that you can see life
changes while creating your application
in ionic so it would just start it and
meanwhile you can just go back to the
project and open another command window
and write s-u-v l dot to open your
project inside sublime text and you can
see that our application started and
this is precisely what the application
looks like inside source folder index
dot HTML is what is being served to us
right now and then from here onwards
angular is taking over control so yeah
that's all pretty much how you would set
up ionic on Windows so if you like the
story then please don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
