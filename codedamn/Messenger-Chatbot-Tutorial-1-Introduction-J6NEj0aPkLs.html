Mae whoo and welcome to your very first
tutorial for chat bot development for
Facebook Messenger and in this tutorial
what I'm gonna do essentially and
actually in this web series is that I'm
going to show you how you can create a
very basic chat board using Heroku as
the cloud platform and this chat board
will be for facebook Messenger right and
yeah so essentially what a chat bot is
is that actually it's just a piece of
code which you have written which
respond to people accordingly what the
message like you can have a bot which
kind of adds tasks to the list so you
can create that and then if the user
says like add tasks to water the plants
and then to just add a task or an alarm
or whatever so you can even kind of if
you are technical enough you can kind of
create you can control your computer
with the help of this bot what you can
do is you can personally create your own
chat bot and then whenever you send some
messages or actually you know it would
just work without a chat bot as well so
anyways the basic idea is that you
create a bot which responds
automatically without any human need
right so this is kind of simple if you
see and it can be made hard as well so
it can make use of a I write machine
learning so we won't be going into that
much deep because you know machine
learning is kind it's not hard but it's
kind of it'll take a lot of time so what
we'll be doing essentially is that we'll
be creating a basic chat bot and would
be looking how to publish it how to make
use of Heroku as a platform to do stuff
and other stuff so I'm excited for the
series so let's start it right away so
that's all for this one
and if you liked it then don't subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
then in the second one real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
