sixth node.js tutorial in which we'll be
looking at something called NPM in
nodejs so this NPM is basically node
package manager and this thing is really
really helpful not only node but in your
other programs as well because this is
kind of you know just a package manager
which just makes your life a lot easier
so when you install node you obviously
came with the NPM install by default you
can just verify that by just typing NPM
V or NPM version so it just gives me two
point one for for mine and then you can
do NPM LS so NB m LS gives you all the
local locally installed packages on your
computer
and it saves me empty because obviously
I haven't installed any local package
for now and if I do npm LS g it shows me
all the globally install packages so all
of these packages are installed by node
but all of these are being shown to me
so all of these packages the HTTP one as
well would be here so if you just take a
look
no not really
so that might be so search for HTTP no
doesn't look like just no yeah it is
somewhat here so anyways you get the
idea that you know it just shows you all
of the packages you have installed and
then you can finally make use of
something called NPM install and then
your package
yeah and will be very soon making use of
this command to install something known
as the Express framework so even if you
want to do it right now you can do that
so just go ahead and write NPM install
Express and it would just install that
for you
so for this tutorial just make sure to
install this Express so yeah so that
that's all for this one
and the next tutorial will be working on
some new things in node.js and would be
starting off with Express GS as well so
again I'm just gonna say that again
that Express is just a framework for
node.js which again makes your life a
whole lot easier so that's all for the
story don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
