hole and welcome to your 13th egg my
script tutorial in which i'm going to
show you something called last template
strings in ESX now this is a brand new
feature and this is very cool so what
this does is that it brings a lot of
features with it like you can finally
have multi-line strings without any
hacks and there are things like string
formatting then there are there is
interpolation and all that techie stuff
so let's get started now to write a
string template string you need to
enclose the text in something called as
back ticks so this is right there for my
keyboard this is on the left of the one
the numeric one on under the functional
keys so you have dogs those keys like f1
f2 f3 on the top below that you have
those numbers from running from one to
nine and eventually zero as well and on
the left of the one you have these back
tech keys you can see there they are not
the codes they are back ticks so if you
see that they are kara tilted at an
angle so you need to make use of that
right the template shrinks let's just
say my variable is hello world hey there
from egg mask ripped six and if you try
to console log this hello world and
reload this you see that it works
perfectly fine so that is a good news
and what you can do with this actually
is that you can actually substitute a
string so let us say you have our name
as cold damp
then you can say here hey there and I
can say name how are you doing so what
happens here is that this thing right
here substitutes the value of this tank
so as you might have guessed that you
can pretty much do a lot of things with
this so if you have a numbers let me
just just make you this example so all
right so we get name only
wait I'm at
all right so I guess I'm messing this
thing right here let's reload this and
as you can see the substitution occurs
so what happens is that you can actually
make use of a lot of things like you can
have some numbers here as well if I do
like two plus five equals VAR num 1 is 2
92 is five and you can write noun 1 plus
plumb to hear or as you can see or you
can just do like that as well that would
work as well so this is kinda gives you
a feel of what we had as expressions in
angular so that is kind of a similar
thing it's not the same exactly but that
kind of gives you the feel of that so
you can pretty much do a lot of things
here so if you have a function as well
function something and return this is
the thing now you can actually just call
this something as well inside here and
this will work perfectly fine so it
saves me do plus 5 equals this is the
thing and this kinda you know you can
just customize it according to you you
can just make use of the methods which
are available with strings in here and
you can just pretty much do anything you
like and yeah so I was talking about the
multi-line strings so with JavaScript
what we need to do is we need to have
something like Hello what I actually
preferred if I had to write multiple
lines what I used to do is like my
string I used to split it in an RA then
this is my first line
then this this is my second line and so
on and so forth after that I just used
to join the string so that was my kind
of hack but there are other hacks
available as well but with these
template strings we don't no longer
require these acts you just have to
write my string is really good and can
be really long without having any sort
of breaks so if I just console.log this
thing reload as you can see it works
perfectly fine so that's how pretty much
you do multi-line strings and template
strings in es6 and i'll just limit this
tutorial to hear because we have a lot
of things to do with template strings
and i'll cover some of the other things
in the next one so if you liked it then
