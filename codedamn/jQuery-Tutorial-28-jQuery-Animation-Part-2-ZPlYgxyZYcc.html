tutorial in which will be discussing
about more on animation in jQuery which
we studied in the last tutorial and
let's take a look at some of the more
properties in animation and let's just
remove the text for now because with
just a square it would be easy to do
some animations let's just make it a 200
pixel by 200 pixels square and padding
should be left color should be left and
background should actually be something
like right maybe
all right so we have got here some bunch
of animations let's remove all of these
so first of all our a callback function
on technically the callback one but who
cares so here's the callback function
here and here whenever this is clicked I
want this thing right here to animate
and as you remember we have to pass the
object as the first parameter the
animation speed in the next and actually
you could do like slow or fast or
whatever you like here as this as well
these are already registered in jQuery
library but I'll just go with the
technical one which is supplying a time
limit for the animation and the callback
callback to is the callback function so
I'll just create a callback to function
here it's just an alert or not in a lot
because that's alike all right so right
here we have got animate me dot animate
but first of all I would like to look at
what we have got so far
so let's reload this and we could
actually just close the console here for
a while and we have got this box right
here and let's say you do not know the
dimensions of this box we do know but
let's say we don't so we need to add
some height and width to this box so how
would you do that with CSS this is not
possible because CSS doesn't allow you
to add add height to the original height
you can only modify the height or reduce
the height to a minimum height with a
maximum height of CSS so what we can do
here is with jQuery obviously we have
control over our scripting we can do
height plus equals
pixal now plus equals is nothing but
simply like we used to do with you know
incrementation of variables with Java or
JavaScript or C++ or whatever you have
been doing so far so plus equals hundred
pixels just increments the original
height with hundred pixel given that the
height is also in pixels originally
let's reload this and let's click here
to animate and you see that the height
increases 200 pixel and one more thing I
want to tell you guys about this is the
cueing in jQuery not cueing means that
let's say you support base tier a bunch
of animations right here now
what jQuery would do is it would just
make a queue of all these animations and
would call each of them one by one so
first of all this would be completed
then this one then this one then this
one now you would ask me then why the
heck do we have this callback function
right here it was doing the same purpose
so why does jQuery follow this thing now
callback function is technically this
thing right here the queuing is
available only for the animation
functions so let's see if I have an
alert right here animation completed and
I have an alert right here as well
animation completed so let's give it a
number one and two so now if I reload
this page and click here then you see
even the animation has not started this
JavaScript alert pops up and when I
click OK the animation - only pops up
when the animation gets completed so
that is the use of the callback function
because without a callback you are
normal JavaScript function which were
executing before would be called
asynchronously with the animate function
itself but the animate just queues
itself with other animate functions so
let's say I want animate that animate
this to height hundred bucks pixels then
the width should also be increased 200
pixel then I'll just console.log this
then I want again the opacity to change
to 0.5 then I want it to what say
I want it do left off plus 100 pixels
yes we can do that and I'll just do this
again one more time and then stop all
right so we have got a bunch of
animations here let's take a look at how
they're working let's reload this you
get ready to go on an adventure let's
get started let's click on this button
you see that we have got a bunch of
animations right here
and we could make it more smoother if I
just
position it to top zero our left zero
with CSS so here you go let's click on
this button now
so you see that it follows obeys my
orders first of all it increases his
height with opacity left and top it is
going in a queue like thing and not
everything is happening in the half of
that way with each other and killing
each other process to complete the
animation and if you check out the
console now we must have got one two
three four five six six callbacks called
here you see six time repetition it does
not show six times individually if the
console text is the same one it just
shows a number how many times it's
repeated so the next thing right here we
need to see is something called camel
kissing now let's say if you want to
change the padding left of this thing so
to change that what we need to do is we
have to say padding left now originally
you would say just what the heck won't
padding left work but it wouldn't
basically because in JavaScript we need
camel kissing to work with and remember
that as a fact
camel kissing is something like if you
wrote padding left it would be rendered
as padding left camel kissing in this is
nothing but the capitalized letter is
changed to the small letter and a dash
is added before that so if you do like
padding left
then it would be rendered as this thing
which is invalid in CSS but I was just
telling you guys so okay so yeah one
more thing I need to tell you guys is
about toggle inside the animate itself
so let's say I had a animate here with a
height not right inputs height and total
now this right here doesn't mean that
assign CSS property of height to toggle
jQuery is smart enough to understand
that we are trying to do toggle to the
height and what this means is it would
toggle the height from zero to the
original height again and again so let's
reload this let's close the console
let's click here and you see that the
height is toggled each time I'm clicking
the button so that's how basically
toggle is working and you could actually
make use of width as well here
and you'll get some nice little effects
if you want you could do that all day
so I leave all the rest of the CSS
properties up to you to give it a try
and understand how's animation and
jQuery are going in hand-in-hand and how
jQuery makes it so much easy to animate
stuff and things so that's all for this
tutorial and I'll see you there next
time so don't forget to subscribe and
