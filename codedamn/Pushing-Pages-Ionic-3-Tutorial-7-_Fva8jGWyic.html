Mei hole and welcome to your seventh
ionic tutorial and in this tutorial
we're going to take a look at how we can
start from the scratch and create our
own pages and push and pop them and all
that good stuff inside our ion AKOP
Legation so let's get started now you
can see that right now I have got my
blank project ready and to do that what
you can do is inside your command line
where you are actually looking for
putting your applications just right
ionic start your blank projects name
which is the name of the project and the
template would be blank in our case for
this time and the last time we made use
of tabs here so it gave us a tab
boilerplate but just write blank and hit
enter and you should be presented with a
file structure something like this so if
you take a look inside app and app dot
HTML we can again see that ionic
provides us with the navigation
controller which binds to this root page
and again inside our app dot component
we can see that the root page is
actually referring to this home page so
for the home page if we go to pages home
and home dot HTML this is precisely what
we are seeing right now on the right so
let's just create a page first in ionic
to create a page what we can do is make
use of the command line itself so I'm
going to go into my project and what I'm
going to say is ionic generate now you
can write either generate or just G both
are same then write the page and then
the page name you want to create so I'm
going to say first so that would be our
first page so hit enter and you should
see something like generated a page
named first now you should again see a
folder automatically created right here
which consists of all of your page files
so this is your file which would be
visible to the user once you present it
in your application now by default ionic
right now does not add your page into
your app module so you need to do it
yourself so if you have worked with
angular the angular generate component
thing actually automatically updates
this app module file as well so
might seem a bit weird but yeah that's
it for ionic for now so we might expect
a change from ionic team to
automatically pop this thing up but
right now you have to do this manually
so once you do that your first page is
actually now ready to be served to the
user so inside our home dot HTML file if
we take a look we can actually get rid
of all of this and simply say a button
button ion button and we can populate
this thing with this is something like
click me and by the way whatever you
want to get information about how how
you can customize your buttons or
anything like that you can always refer
to this ionic documentation right here
and under the docs you would see this UI
components which would really much
consist of everything you will need in
your application so we go to buttons and
right here you can see that we have got
our color lights that can be dangerous
or things and also like block buttons if
you want to fold with your buddies and
the full one as well which would just
make it without border but a radius and
full width and all that stuff so we can
just make it a full button and a color
would be light light not login it saves
and we should see something like this so
now if we click this button again
nothing happens and you can again see
that it kind of optimizes your buttons
create your buttons according to the
platform it's working on so on Android
it might look like a native button only
when you tap on it it would give you a
material kind of team just like it is
doing right now on iOS it would try to
create a button which looks like the iOS
native button so it's always recommended
to make use of ionic custom attributes
and tag names whenever possible instead
of going with your own things because
when you do that ionic would try to
create things natively as close as
possible so
that it provides a kind of a native
experience to the user so anyways now we
have got this button set up what I want
to do is actually I want to listen for
anybody clicking this button so we can
say something like open first page and
again inside our what the heck inside
our home the typescript file right here
we can say something like actually we
can first of all create this method only
and we would say open first page now
what I will do is actually navigate our
application to that particular page and
right now you can see that ionic
automatically gives us this nav
controller thing injected into our
application so that we can just make use
of this dognap control now what this
would do is that this is actually
responsible for managing the stack of
your pages right so it's something like
this your application starts with a page
somewhere here so app starts here and
you can push the page you want to
display to the user on the top of this
page right so your app is now here app
is now here now the page would be which
would be at the top of the stack which
would be the one which will be displayed
to the user right so if you pop this
page out you would automatically be
taken to the page underneath that in the
stack so right now we are at the bottom
most page only which is this blank
template right here so we want to push a
page on the top of this page so I'm
going to call push and right here it
would contain the page we want to push
so I'm going to say this would be our
first page so now what about this first
page we can get this first page imported
so we can say import first page from
what we have right here first
first and then first so what's happening
here is that inside this first I'm
importing this foster type script file
you can see that is expose the first
page class so that we can import it
right here and make use of it in the nav
controller so right here if you save
this and let it build and actually we
can just keep it like that only so if I
click on this you can see that we got
our first page with us and by default
ionic also takes care of the back button
so let's take a look what this first
page actually consists so you can see
that it consists of a boring first title
so we can say hello there something like
that and this is a custom page
consisting of awesome content anything
like that and let's say we should be
able to click on this and see our text
right here so that is how very much we
would create a very basic page with
ionic and in the coming tutorials are
going to take a look at how we can
actually create multiple pages and put
them on the top of each other and pop it
out all at once to the root because it
might be a thing you want to implement
if you're creating a login sort of
application and suddenly the users logs
out so you do not want the user to
pretty much just hit the back button and
get to a page which was only there for a
person who's logged in right so that is
kind of useful in such applications so
yes that's all for this one and if you
liked it then please don't forget to

the pace in the patreon link in the
description so if you want to check that
out please do god really helps so that
is all for this one again and I'll see
you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
