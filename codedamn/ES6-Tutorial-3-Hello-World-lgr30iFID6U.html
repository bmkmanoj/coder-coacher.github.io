your third es6 tutorial in which i'm
going to show you how to make use of
your javascript on your web pages
because just outputting your JavaScript
output on a terminal window is kind of
useless so you would like to use it on
your web pages so how to do that well to
do that first of all is to square the
same code again and we'll just compile
it and we'll just make a little changes
here script compiled the script alright
so now as you can see we get this file
right there but what the heck is this so
we have to include two more scripts
right there to make this thing work and
those scripts are these two scripts so
this is the tracer compiler which is
itself written in JavaScript and this is
all es5 and this is a whooping I guess
20,000 lines or something like that no
it is 32 thousand lines so this is no
not even 32 it is thirty-three thousand
lines and this is a huge library and it
is a god of compiler you can say for es6
right now and if i just save it as
compiler jes in the same directory and i
need to include the script SRC compiler
GS and don't worry you could actually
get these links or these files actually
from google itself but I'll leave the
links of these file in description as
well or you can just take a look and if
you're a really fast typer you can just
type this out and the next file we need
is this one so this one I would leave
the link for this file as well so I'm
just gonna save this this one is small
so let's just copy this bootstrap yes
and just include this in your folder as
well bootstrap GS and yeah that's pretty
much it what you need to do now let's go
ahead and put containing folder and as
you can see in the console we get hello
world so this is executed by the script
compiled so that's how you basically
write your hello world program in es6
with tracer so that was just a beginning
to the awesome javascript which is about
to come so that's all for this one and
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
