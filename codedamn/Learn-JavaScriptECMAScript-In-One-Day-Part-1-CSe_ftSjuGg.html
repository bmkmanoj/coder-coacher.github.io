is May ho and welcome to you're learning
javascript javascript unlocked one video
tutorial in which we're gonna go through
over how to get started with javascript
in a single video I have never done this
before this is my first time with
JavaScript with you like this so let's
get into it
because we have a lot to do okay so a
little bit about javascript javascript
is give a programming language it's a
scripting language which people used to
use earlier on the web but now it's
expanding into every thing you can
imagine you have node for the backend
you have electron for desktop and mobile
desktop application we have react and
react native for mobile applications so
javascript is virtually everywhere and i
guess recently a couple of days back
tensorflow has really released its
JavaScript version so yep now you have
tensorflow
on the web as well so that's pretty rad
and that would be cool for us to look
into how JavaScript works okay starting
from the starting so let's get on to
what we call as console so you see that
right now I have opened console you can
open this console in your browser by
right-clicking anywhere on the webpage
going to this inspect and slinging on
this console once you do that this is
the interface where you can run your
JavaScript you can test your JavaScript
at a basic level obviously you would be
writing JavaScript into files but for
the tutorial purpose I'm gonna go with
the console approach so JavaScript gives
this option to write anything anything
from the code to this particular console
so for example if you want to debug
something then you can write that thing
to console to see what's happening so
first thing to write to console what you
need to do is basically write console
then dot now dot is just a way of
accessing a method of this console
object which we take a look at that
later on don't worry about that about
that dot and console dot log and right
here we can inside single quote
good right our value my value anything
like that and hit extra you see that we
get my value don't worry about this
undefined we just take a look at that
later on and to clear this console
anytime you can write it clear just like
that clear and opening curly brace and a
closing curly brace and this would clear
your console with that being done let's
come to variables now variables in
JavaScript is basically similar to what
we have known as variables in other
languages that is they are just basic
containers to store a particular value
so that you can use that value again and
again and modify that and all that stuff
inside the memory itself so to create a
variable in JavaScript what we use is
what we used earlier was var keyword so
our my variable which is the name of
your variable is equal to my value hit
enter now you can write console dot log
my variable and hit enter you can see
that I get my value now the catch here
is that inside console you can avoid
this console dot log statement at all
and you can just basically write my
value here my variable sorry my variable
here and you would get the value right
so console dot log is basically used in
your script files so that you can print
to the console you can in side console
you can just directly write that
variable m and it would print it but I
would just still recommend you to go
with the console dot log so that you
don't get confused okay so with that
being done what we come to is constants
and yeah not constants right away we
took a look at how to create variables
we do our keyword the new spec the new
specification of the language says us to
use let let keyword now there's not much
difference in warren let there's a
slight difference between scoping and
some advanced difference as well but
we're just gonna ignore that for the
beginners purpose and we'll just
concentrate and say that let my are
almost same so I'm just gonna create my
variable
- is this is created using let and I can
destroyed my variable to here and hit
enter and you see that I get this string
back and just clear the console and
there we are okay with that being done
we come to constants in JavaScript now a
constant value as you know as the name
suggests should not be changed right so
what happens now right now if I see if I
say something like let variable is five
and later on Mac OS a variable is 10 it
works I can write variable and I get 10
right now what happens is let's say I
create something like let pi is 3.14 1 I
do not want anyone to change pi by
mistake inside our code because
obviously by is fixed and this universe
at least so pi if I write 3 it changes
it to 3 which is not what I want so what
I can do is instead of making PI as a
let variable I can write something like
Co NS t Const incent of my variable to
make it constant now Const my pie is
3.14 1 and if I try to change my pie now
if I say something like 3 hit enter you
can see that JavaScript throws us an
error and if you just take a look at
that we did it seems like it's a
reasonable one assignment to consume
variable is a type error all right cool
that makes that makes sure that this
variable cannot be changed anywhere in
our code by mistake by anybody okay okay
so before actually going for the let's
discuss about what the standard is is so
standard gist is just an implementation
just a way of letting developers know of
a particular method of writing
JavaScript code you need not to follow
this all the time but mostly if you find
yourself confused on in two different
approaches then this is a place you can
take a look at for it
example right now you if you are Trevor
enough you must have seen that I am
writing console dot log my PI like this
it works and if I write a semicolon here
then also it works so what should you
use should you write the semicolon all
the time or should you leave it well in
JavaScript if you see if you come here
you see that it's the standard G is
recommends that you should not write
semicolon it's not really necessary but
there is a condition your lines never
start with a curly bracket a parenthesis
a square bracket or a backtick right so
this is the only gotcha with omitting
semicolons so if you were doing if
you're omitting semicolons just remember
do not study your line with these three
and obviously right now we haven't
learned enough enough much to actually
start my lines start aligns with these
three characters right so right now it's
not a problem but you can't omit
semicolons in JavaScript that's what the
standard says and that's what I actually
prefer as well okay with that being done
let's just move on to some mathematics
and stuff so I want to do some
arithmetic addition subtraction
multiplication division that's the
standard thing you do with languages
when we are learning them ok let's
create some numbers so I'm gonna say let
num1 is hundred and i'm gonna say let
num2 is 200 and now i want to add these
numbers so what I can do is either I can
write console dot log statements but as
I said you that if they are in console
we can basically ignore that thing so we
can just go about directly writing down
one plus num2 you see that it gives us
300 which is expected we can do
something like num2 by num1 which is
division which is correct because num2
by hundred is obviously 200 by 100 is 2
we can actually subtract num2 and on one
and we get hundred that is two hundred
minus hundred gives us hundred we can
multiply them num 2 times num 1 we get
two thousand is that no 20,000 right 200
times hundred is 20,000
and there we are so these are two basic
addition subtraction multiplication
division operators we have other
operators as well for example let's say
I have let enum 3 is 5
let number 4 is let's just say it's 2 so
what we can do is I can write down 3
modulus numb for hit enter we get 1 now
why is that numb 3 is 5 number 4 is 2 so
5 modulus 2 actually gives us 1 so why
is that 5 modulus 2 means that I keep on
dividing 5 with 2 unless I cannot divide
it any further so what happens is that 5
if we multiply 2 times 2 it gives us 4
we cannot go beyond because we will just
cross 5 so 2 times 2 is 4 and the
remainder is 1 so that's what the
modulus gives us we can do 5 by 2 it
gives us 2 point 5 and we can round it
off using certain functions inside the
math library which we will take a look
later on in the video so let's say I
want to do a calculation of 5 raised to
the power of 2 so what I can do in that
case is to something like 5 and these
two stars means a raise to the power of
and I to 2 so it means 5 squared is 25 5
cubed is 125
don't get confused between 5 double star
and 5 star 5 times 3 is 15
but 5 is to the power of 3 is 125 so
there we are with some basic maths and
stuff ok now let's discuss a little bit
about datatypes available in java script
we looked at a couple of them already
that is strings and numbers and yeah I
guess I missed the comments 1 so you can
add comments in JavaScript with two
backslashes and this is a command and
obviously a comment is not parsed by the
language when it is executing you see
that we get no output and we can write
this is actually a single line comment
so I can write a multi-line comment as
well
so this is a multi-line comment and this
would not end unless I write this thing
and you can see now the color is changed
from green to normal that means we are
now in the execution environment so you
can see that's how we do comments in
JavaScript all right now let's just come
back to the data types so we have
strengths we have numbers we have arrays
and we have objects now we have this is
mainly what Java Script offers us
obviously there could be more or less
but what you would usually interact in
your day-to-day life if you're working
with Java Script is peace for
essentially so string numbers are
raising objects we have took a look at
what strings are so what I can do is my
string is this is a strength but let my
num is 15 string numbers let my array
now arrays in JavaScript is basically
just the same concept in any other
language status they help you to store
they help you to store values inside a
single variable another catch with
arrays is if you're coming from a
background like C or C++ something like
that
in those types you cannot have different
kind of elements in your array but in
JavaScript you can have an array which
consists of strings as well as well as
in teachers at the same time so yeah
that's the thing so we can create this
my array and to create an array you use
a square bracket opening and a square
bracket closing and everything basically
is just the same just the normal
variable so I can write some cool
numbers and I can range something like
ten teen twenty something like this and
hit enter
now if I write my array here you see now
we get the array which we had written
and this is the length of the array
which is basically which basically means
the number
elements in our array now I can access
this this particular element the end
element by writing my array of n where n
is the index what we call as index of
that particular element in this case it
would be 0 for some cool numbers 1 4 10
2 4 15 and 3 4 20 so if i write 3 we get
back 20 if i write 0 here we get back
some cool numbers right we can do some
fun stuff with arrays in JavaScript so
what I can do is basically I can say
something like let last element is my
array dot popper now what it does is
that it would remove the last element
from my array and give it to last
element variable so it's doing two
things at a time this pop thing removes
the element from this array and gives it
to the last element so for hit enter and
write my array here you see that our
length is changed from 4 to 3 and we we
do not have 20 anymore and last element
consists of grid
obviously you can get the last element
of the first element with the index
itself so we can say let first element
and if you want to do a similar thing
with first element you can say my array
dot shift now what this does is if you
hit enter now if you write my array you
can see that we got rid of that some
cool elements and if I write first
element here you can see that we get
some cool numbers here and our array
consists of just numbers now so this was
some basic working with arrays ok with
arrays being done let's come to objects
in JavaScript so object is basically of
the off storing key value pairs in
JavaScript so if you're coming from a
Java background this is kind of the
hashmap you call in there so you have a
key you have an associate an Associated
value with it but again JavaScript just
like arrays JavaScript is fixed flexible
inside objects as well you can have any
key you can have any object you
key can actually be another kind of
object which we will take a look at that
soon so let's create an object and we
can name this object as let's say let my
object is and create an object in
JavaScript what you need to do is write
a Kohli brace here right and end a curly
brace here so arrays are created with
square brackets objects are created with
curly braces the key value pair ones so
I'm gonna write the name of my key first
so this is my key one and a column here
which denotes this key has particular
value so let's just say this is a value
right then I separate the key value
pairs with a comma remember you have to
put a comma here it's not optional so he
too could be my favorite number is 4 and
key 3 again could be something like 100
any random number right and when we are
done with this I can hit enter now what
I can do is write my object dot key 1
and hit enter you see that we get this
is a key this is a value I can also do
my object dot key 3 and get back 100 you
see that we are writing dot here so
basically if you think about it a little
console is something like console is an
object which has log and it's something
like this so that we are able to do
console dot log and then write some
parentheses here which should take a
look at that what they are and why do we
need them and write something like this
and it prints it to the console so this
is a way to actually access keys now as
I said we can have any kind of keys but
whatever you write here after the dot
should should follow a certain syntax so
for example if I create an object lit
object to is something like key - 2 and
less
I created this key inside codes you can
write codes around the keys as well so
what we do here and this is weird and
access and it enter and if I try to do
or check to that key - - it does not
work because how it is interpreted is
it's JavaScript sees that oh okay so you
want to access object to that key and
whatever that value is you want to
subtract 2 from it hmm that's not really
what we wanted so how do I tell
JavaScript that I actually want to
access this key - 200 by the way this
shows us some something which is no less
not a number which we'll take a look at
that as well later on when we come to
the math section all right so how do I
tell JavaScript that I want to access
this step so just like in arrays we do
my array of index what I can do with
objects is write object of the key name
so right here it's object of key to hit
enter and you can see that we get access
to our object here so this is the way to
access non writable key names after non
writable key names from the objects
obviously this works just fine with
normal keys as well so you can see that
if I write my object of key 1 it still
works
and my object of key 1 is still the same
so what are these both of these are same
it's up to you what you want to use the
advantage of this approach is that
actually I can use a variable to get the
value but here I cannot use a variable
for example if I say something like LED
key name this key one so what I can do
now is I can say my object of key name
and hit enter you can see because key
name is 1 it's replaced here and we get
this is a value but I cannot do my
object of key name because now it's
actually searching for a key name
property inside mal'chik which does not
exist so it makes sense all right okay
with that being
let's come two strings and take a look
at that how we can manipulate and work
with strings in JavaScript let's just
create a cute little string cute string
this is my cute string right and I can
write cute string here now what if I
want to split this string into an array
so how can I do that I can do that by
let's say let cute string array is cute
string dot split something like
something called as split now right here
inside these brackets I can specify on
which delimiter I want to split for
example if I if I split on space then my
every element which it would separate
every element on basis of space for
example this would become an element
because there's a space just after this
then is would become an element because
there's a space just after is my would
become an element and so on and so forth
so if I hit enter you can see that cute
string array is actually consisting of
five elements which is this is my cute
string which makes sense and then again
we can make use of push we can use your
pop-up and something like that to
actually remove the last element you can
actually make use of something like cute
string array but push versus a hundred
and what it does is that it just adds
that particular element to the end of
your array so if I hit enter you can see
that it returns us it gives us six and
what this means is the index of the new
element is the length of this new array
right so if I write cute string array
right you can see that it consists of
six elements now and it has
automatically added this hundred now
what I can do is cute string array dot
pop which just gets us gets rid of the
last element and gives us that so I'm
not storing this element in anywhere so
it just it's printed by console so what
I can do now is take a look
add what this is and what I can do is I
can reconstruct this string from this
array by saying cue string array got
join and right here I would write the
delimiter with which all of these
elements would be joined so for example
if I write two spaces here now and hit
enter you can see that now we have two
spaces instead of one and this string
right so this is the way you can work
with strings obviously we have a lot of
other methods for example huge string
dot to uppercase would convert this
whole string to upper case right what we
can do is once we have this upper case
string we can convert it back to lower
lower case and editor you can see that
we get our lower case shrink back after
converting it from upper case right so
we can actually work on these methods
directly as well to lower case hit enter
you can see that it converts it to lower
case right so this is basic manipulation
with strings and obviously if you have
like cute cute string dot let's just say
split and if you do not specify anything
then your array would be splitted and
array of string would be splitted by
character every character and you can
see that we can basically access any of
the character and do whatever we want
with it
so that's basic string manipulation okay
let's just take a look at numbers now so
we have let's say let num1 is 50 and
let's say I say num1 the two fixed now
what it does is that basically it would
fix my number to a particular decimal
place for example if I write to fix to
you see then we get a string back
instead of a number which is kind of
okay you can convert it back to number
we will see how so it gives us this
string which is 50 points
which means that I have fixed the
decimal value of this number to two
decimal places and this is actually
useful for example if you have num -
let's just say fifty point four five
right and now if you do something like
num - not to fixed one you see that it
runs off nicely according to the rules
of rounding off and gives you 50 points
sighs all right now there are other
things you can do with numbers and if
you are using this console you can see
that it gives us kind of a lot of things
so you can convert it to exponential as
well so if you do something like this it
gives you the exponential notation of
that particular number which means
basically that 50 0.45 into 10 raised to
the power of 1 so it's kind of useful if
you have like num 3 is random thing and
I do num 3.2 exponential and you can see
that it gives me a nice representation
of that particular number in exponential
form okay with that being done less has
come-to functions in JavaScript now
functions is just a way of writing a
piece of code which you can call and
repeat over and over again so that you
can execute the same set of code with
some variables changed or something else
change but basically the core of the
code remains the same so to create a
function in JavaScript and by the way
all of these cons will go to log to
fixed to exponential they were functions
so to write a function in JavaScript we
can do write a function keyword if you
ENC tion and the name of your function
which in my case would be my function
and these two curly brackets not the
curly brackets these two parentheses and
followed by these two parentheses would
go your curly bracket and your curly
bracket here as well now here
whatever you right here would be
actually executed whenever you call this
my function so for example I can write
console dot log my function called and
hit enter now whenever I call my
function and write
two curly brackets in front of it and it
enter you see that we get JavaScript
calls the contents inside this function
but if you write just this my function
what happens is that it would return you
the definition of whatever you have
written
whatever your function is right so let's
say you want to actually add two numbers
so how would you do that using functions
so if we can do is actually accept what
is called as arguments in functions so I
can write function add nums and I can
write a and B right and basically what
we can do is write console dot log a
plus B just like that and now I can call
add nums 5/10 I can do add nums 22-8 I
can do add nums minus 1 1 and we get
correct answers all along so this is how
we are creating functions in JavaScript
and this is basics of functions and
we'll just come back to functions later
on as we proceed in the video
now obviously JavaScript consists of
boolean type data type as well which did
not cover earlier but what it does is
that it would just give you true or
false if you write true here you see
that we the console prints true and
false console prints false all right now
what's interesting with this is that I
can do something like is 5 greater than
2 yep that's true
it's 5 less than 2 mm-hmm that's false
is 5 actually let's just say 5 minus 3
is greater than 3 no because 5 minus 3
is 2 and 2 is not greater than 3 and so
on and so forth now when we have once we
are when we are done with this boolean
operations what we can do with these is
that we can make use of these true and
false conditions inside our if-else
statement so before going to if-else
statement let's see the different kind
of comparisons operator we have so we
have as we stick you took a look at we
have greater than operator we have less
than operator of 5 is greater than 3 yep
5 is less than 6 yes we have equal to
operator and what this equal to means is
5 is equal to 6
no that's not a typo actually we
actually use two equal to signs when we
want to compare the stuff right so what
happens here is basically that if I want
to compare two things I would make use
of double equal to but if I want to
assigned a particular thing to a
variable I would use a single equal to
for example if I created my awesome num
is 5
I would use a single equal to because
I'm assigning to that particular number
however if I want to actually make a use
of that my awesome number and check
whether it is my awesome number is it
equal to six
nope that's not the case but if I do
something like six then it assigns that
to my awesome number so now this would
return true because it's not in fact six
so we have greater than less than equal
to we can have and and/or as well so
what we can do is we can create
something like let mine down one is face
item two is ten and I can say mine one
is equal to size and my num two is equal
to ten hit enter that's true
because my num one is in fact safe and
mine empty is in fact 10 is it the case
nope
minam one is five but madam two is not
11 it's actually ten so it gives us
false
so that's how and works we can also
write or so for or I can say is Milam
five or is minam 211 yep that's case
because Milam five is in fact five so
we're just asking JavaScript that one of
the condition at least one of the
conditions should be true if that's the
case JavaScript would say true to us so
basic basic operators and stuff which
you should be aware about we have
covered right now okay with that being
done let's just come to if and if else
thinks now there would be times when you
want to check whether some condition is
true and depending upon that you want to
take some actions so let's just say how
create let condition is condition
variable is ten so I can see if
condition variable is in fact equal to
ten
I want to run this piece of code right
so if you write if then your condition
whatever you want to do
if it is true so I'm going to write
console.log condition variable instead
so you can see once we run this we in
fact int or condition okay condition
where you able to stand that's correct
but if I run something like else what I
want to do is console.log condition
variable is something else right and I
can say 11 here so you can see now we
get condition variable is something else
so that's if-else so it would check the
condition inside here if it is true then
it would run this thing otherwise it
would understand in the last part as you
saw we took a look at some and and or
operations so we can combine them here
as well if I can say is condition
variable is 11th or condition variable
is tend I would say condition variable
is 10 or 11 hit enter you can see we get
the condition variable is 10 or 11
because the second statement is true
right
the first is not the second is true so
it runs this piece of code and else is
run if the if pad is not correct so I
can do something like if this condition
is true and safe
what we have is let us say if condition
variable is 10 so we can do here is 10
just a second you can make this 11 we
can get rid of this so what we have here
is we are writing if condition or Ubud
is 11 i want to print this otherwise if
condition where you list and i want to
print this otherwise i would you say
console.log something's wrong
something's fishy so we can't right now
as condition variable instead now if I
change condition we're able to let's say
25 and run this piece of code again you
can see that we get something's fishy
as the answer so what you can do is just
put this thing inside a function
and then you can just check call that
function with condition variables value
passing it to that function okay with
that being done let's just come to
Turner your praetor's in JavaScript but
ternary operator is just like writing
if-else statement but for the cool kids
so just you are able to write it fails
the Holyfield's thing inside one line
itself so for example let's just say I
write net age is 18 let's just see so I
can say if age is greater than 18 I
would say something like console.log you
are above 18 here's your license
something like that else console.log you
should not be driving of the code right
now
something like that and hit enter you
see that we get you should not be
driving a vehicle right now
that's Google but it's four line of code
when we're the cool programmer the cool
kid can write this thing in one line
with the expense of readability a little
bit so what you can do is a conditional
operator a ternary operator how this
works is that you write condition here
if it's true then true true code runs
otherwise false code runs right okay so
let's just convert our if-else statement
here inside ternary operator
so for turn everything what we're gonna
do is just write directly console dot
log and basically what I want is this
string if it is greater than 18
otherwise this string so I'm gonna write
my condition which is is is greater than
18 if that is true I want to console.log
this string otherwise I want to control
log
this day and if I get rid of this
enter you can see that we cannot
directly get you should not be driving a
vehicle right now because my age is
actually 18 it's not greater than ideal
right the other variant of this
console.log could be because right now
if you are doing is just writing this
inside console.log so what I can do is I
can say base telling age is greater than
18 if that's true I want console.log
this thing otherwise I want to
console.log this thing so that would
work equally well but that just
increases our code a little but that's
okay okay you would add being done let's
just come to something known as switch
statements in JavaScript so obviously if
else is a good thing but sometimes what
you want is a sweet statement now what
that is is that for example let's say
you have changed your age - let's just
say 55 and now you want to switch over
your age so what you can do is you can
say case I'm your age is let's just say
54 oops
Casey our age is 54 what I want to do is
console.log you are 54 years old and now
just see what this break is real quick
case 55 console console dot log you are
55 years old and default I'm going to
come to this console dot log I do not
know your age hit enter you can see that
okay we made a mistake here I did not
write break here which I should have
written so it's now even difficult for
me to explain this code to you right now
as a beginner so anyway so what's
happening here is let us see you are 55
years old and I do not know your age so
listen let me just run this code one
more time but this time
the break here and hit enter so now what
happens is we get this you are 55 years
old so what's happening here is that
switch age takes a variable it matches
it against all the keys value so we
write case and the value which I'm
expecting it you have so for example in
this case it would start with directly
case 55 it comes to case 55 it runs this
statement and if you do not break out of
this what happens is that it flows down
the code so you get you you are 55 years
old and I do not know your age if you do
not write break here what happens is
that your execution would not get out of
the switch statement unless you manually
break it out or unless that is your last
statement in your code so that is why
when we we missed the break here the
default one act also ran because it just
flows down inside a switch case
statement so if you take the look here
if you make the little reordering here
case 55 and 54 and make this 55 and 54
as well you can see okay so we can just
get rid of this trick here as well you
can see we get all the statements
because it starts here and we have no
break in place so it just keeps carrying
on keeps going down the line and keeps
friending all the stuff so it's not just
limited to integers you can do home
strings here as well so you can say my
STR is my string - let's just say is
what is it
hello so I can say switch my string -
and I can see case ok console dot log
hey there
and case hello says console dot log
further something like that and don't
forget your breaks
break and just break here right okay
oops there we go so you can see that we
get hula hair printed you can actually
add a default case as well just in case
nothing matches
so this default over the run so
console.log just two question marks here
so now if I change my string to what and
run this thing again okay my strength to
actually do what and change this again
you see we get these two question marks
which is exactly what we expect all
right let's just come to loops now now
the loops loops is a way to make your
code short and do some tasks you can't
do manually so loop is a way to repeat
set of code again and again and again on
your particular condition or number of
times specified so for example let's say
I have an array of let's just say array
of numbers 5 10 15 20 25 30 hit enter so
now I want to print all the elements in
the array x 2 x right 2nd obviously do
array of 0 times 2 array of 1 times 2
and so on and so forth but what's the
problem with this approach is that I
first of all need to know the length
which okay I know about that and
secondly this is kind of hard to do
manually and if I want to change let's
say the name of my array here then I
would have to change all of the
occurrences down the line so that's not
the obvious approach so what we can do
is just write array here and write a for
loop or a while loop or a do while loop
which is the 3 kind of loop there's also
for in loop for objects so we'll just
take a look at that as well so let's
just write a for loop here I'm going to
write 4 then a bracket then let I equal
to 0 which is my initial declaration is
finished
initialization of my loop variable I'm
gonna say I equal to zero
high is less than era dot length witches
which is six right now so area dot
length length is a property of this area
and in JavaScript just remember that
everything arrays your functions and
objects are objects themselves so this
array also has some keys and values
apart from the indexes so length is one
of them
so length stores the length the number
of elements in that particular array
which is six right now so as less than
arrays dot length I plus plus and
actually yeah I did not talk about this
so I plus plus it basically just means
that you're incrementing I by one so
it's it's it's similar to I is equal to
I plus one it's the same thing there's
slight difference we'll talk about that
later on
so I plus plus and looked in this
console dot log array of I so if I hit
enter now you see we get 5 10 15 20 25
30 which is cool and now what I have to
do just is just multiply this by two and
we get all the elements and the correct
order so that's basically how you would
work with for loops and you can do
similar thing with while loop but while
loop is kind of a little more limited
because in for loop you get three kind
of placeholders first one is for
initialization second is for checking
the condition till how much the loop
should run and third is what what you
want to do once why nitration of the
loop gets completed so the order of the
loop is for this this this particular
code would run just once on the start of
the loop then your this thing this
condition would be checked and after
that this thing would be run after that
this thing this kind this statement
would be executed then this condition
would be checked then this study would
be run this statement would execute this
condition is checked this thing would
run and so on and so forth but with wine
loop if we have as wild condition and a
curly brace opening right here so
basically as long as this condition is
true this code would run so I can write
wild 1 is equal to 1 which would all
always be true so if I hit enter right
now we would run into an infinite loop
so which I do not want to do so what I'm
going to do is picture my wild variable
is also safe 10 so I'm gonna say while
while variable it's less than 20 I'm
gonna say while variable plus plus which
increments this variable I'm gonna say
console dot log while variable there we
are and hit enter you can see it gives
us all the numbers till 20 from 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 Center on blah blah blah
okay so that's while loop for you now
the two mile loop what it does is
do-while and the while is similar your
condition here so what we can do is just
create a net do-while variable it's 15
let's just say how to do while do-while
variable is less than 10 so just pay
attention here so I'm gonna say console
dot log do-while loop run and hit enter
so you can see even though this
condition is wrong 15 is less than 10
our loop still ran for one time so
that's the case a two while loop who
would run at least once if it is
executed right so if you want to run a
statement at least once and loop it over
as well if some statement becomes true
somehow inside that code block then you
make use of this do-while loop otherwise
while loop and for loop are just fine
okay this is quickly took you take a
look at for in loop as well so let's
just say this is my foreign object and I
create an object key one value value one
and key to value two let's just keep it
to that so what I can do now is I can
say for LED key in for an object and I
can say console dot log key and hit
enter you can see that we get the names
of the keys inside this particular
object so once you have the names of the
keys inside this particular object we
can actually get the values as well and
I can write multiple console.log
statements by just putting a comma here
so I can write foreign object of key
because you know we discussed how we can
access dynamic keys here so that's one
case use case of that so I can say key
one has a value one key to add value to
and remember that in JavaScript the
order of these keys is not sixth so you
should not rely that when you do a loop
like this key one would always be at top
JavaScript does not guarantee the order
inside these objects object literals
however the order is guaranteed to be
the same inside arrays so if you want to
have a fixed order use arrays otherwise
you can go with objects as well alright
again we can make use of break in loops
to do an early exit instead of waiting
for a particular condition to become
true for example I can do while true
console dot log this should run forever
but we can't prevent that by writing a
break here you see that we get just one
statement executed and then we break out
of the loop
permanently
now we can write if you write break here
you can see that we immediately break
out of the loop so that's the thing
right we have something known as
continued as well inside the loops we
just skips the I tration which is just
break but it actually doesn't break out
of the loop it just you know does not
execute the code below it and would skip
to the next titrations for example if we
have let continue array is 1 2 3 4 5 hit
enter for lead che is equal to 0 J is
less than continue continue array dot
length J plus plus I can see if J is
equal to 3 then what I want to do is
continue otherwise otherwise I just want
to console dot log and notice that I
haven't written else here I've just
written continue I just written if block
so I want to print Kunti new array of J
and hit enter you can see here that we
do not get 4 and the reason for that is
that J when J is 3 it's 0 1 2 3 so third
index 4 is on the third index so it does
not get printed so this is how we can
work with break and continue statements
inside our loops and one more thing if
