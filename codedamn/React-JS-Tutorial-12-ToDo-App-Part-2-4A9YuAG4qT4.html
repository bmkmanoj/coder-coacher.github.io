Mei who are welcome to your twelfth
reaction tutorial in which what we are
going to do is we're going to take out
that Li part from hard-coded to some
word a semi hard-coded think we're not
going to exactly create the app
perfectly right now in this tutorial but
we're just going to make use of some
sort of good stuff so that it just at
least looks like it's not hard coded
right like that
okay anyways so we'll just get rid of
piece right there and what we are going
to do is move to our very first script
Dodge here and right here what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create an array of
stuff list task list and we're going to
say some random tasks task 1 and task 2
so this array would be our array to
manage the tasks actually which would be
displayed on the screen
so we'll just pop it in our to-do app
where the dot equals dustless like that
okay so now our main degeus has some
props right there
and you can just use them and send them
in constructor if you want but it's not
really necessary unless you want to make
you the list of props here otherwise
it's just useless to do so you can just
get rid of that anyhow right so okay so
we have task list here so what I want to
do is actually I want to pass this task
list again to do the to do at list
because we do not have anything to do
right here so we can again pass this
down by saying tasks is this dot props
dot what we are getting it done
right so we have got something from the
parent and we didn't touch it then see
it just pass it down to to-do app list
and inside our app list what we are
going on to is
I'm going to say to our items equals
this dot dot dot dot right so now we
have this array of tasks right there so
what essentially we are looking for is
to create an Li out of them each out of
them so we can just make use of map here
that map and an ESX folder and we can
say brick done something like a lie and
we can say actually using this piece of
element their element a lie something
like that right
and then finally inside our return we
can make use of this items so that we
just populate the UL with all these
allies right ok looks good let's see how
it looks on the browser ok so it saves
me up warning that each child in an
array or key I traitor should have a
unique key property now this happens
because if you said that then react
would have a good time and figuring out
you know or actually if we don't set
that then react would have a hard time
in figuring out which element was
updated so it kind of would be a little
expensive on the dorm so we can say Li
key is the element and I which is the
index of that particular element inside
map and if you're not familiar with this
then you might have to see some es6
videos of mine I guess I have explained
that there so Li key is I was just good
to go you can see that the warning is
gone and again the task 1 and task 2 are
sort of semi hard-coded now they are
still not coded inside our script or
cheers if we add another task like task
3 but at least they are not direct
according to code right now so that's
all for this video and in the next video
what we are going to do is we're going
to make this completely from here only
from the input field and would see how
we can add some tasks to our to-do app
so that's all for this one and if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
then in the next one real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
