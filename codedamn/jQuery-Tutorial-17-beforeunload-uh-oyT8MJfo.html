17th jQuery tutorial in which we'll be
learning about an event method called
before unload in jQuery now this even
method is fired immediately when the
user tries to close or navigate away
from your webpage
this event would help you to save a
bunch of visitors from leaving your
website and it kinda gives you a last
chance to do are basically the
JavaScript client side to save the
visitor from leaving the page so how
does work let's see so we have got a
script here and I want to attach this
before unload to the window and I'll use
on before a load to bind this method to
the window and now here we have some
limitations in JavaScript standards
which I'll tell you right now let's say
get back
and we're ready so now it's a browser
let's reload this and now let's try to
navigate away from this page so let's go
it says goodbye are you sure you want to
leave the page if I click on stay on
this page then it will not have a gate
but if I leave this page that it will
navigate as you can see so this is our
odd before basically the before our load
even attached to the window
limitations I'm gonna tell you right
here is that you cannot show any
graphical representation when you are
firing the part before onload because
this is not loud in a MCA or basically
in JavaScript standards so you cannot
have confirmed Alec box like you want to
leave
like this you cannot have such dialog
boxes so let's try as you can see this
does not work on reload because you
cannot have user interactivity on this
event because it's written in some
standards or JavaScript and it just
can't be done so this is about on before
unload in jQuery and how it works so I
hope this would be helpful to you in
your future projects let's then meet in
the next tutorial which would be live in
no time so thanks for watching and don't
forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
