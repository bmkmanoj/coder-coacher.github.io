hole and welcome to your seventh angular
2 tutorial in which we'll be discussing
a bit about decorators and metadata in
angular so in the last tutorial we
described the simple program which just
displayed a button on the screen and
just updated the counter at how many
times we have clicked it so what we made
use of in in this is the template and
basically the component well when you
just add this tag right here my app in
HTML this looks like a regular tag but
how does angular you know how does your
HTML and your browser know that angular
is associated with this so tell the
browser we make use of something known
as metadata we attach some sort of data
with this tag and we attach that
metadata using the component decorator
so we are importing this component from
angular 2 slash core and this is a
decorator as a function and component is
also function so we are making use of ad
the rate and the name of the module we
are importing and then we are making use
of this decorator to assign some
properties or some information to it
like the selector is my app now we know
that we are referring to this tag using
angular so component is a decorator
similarly we have other decorators as
well like inject which we'll be looking
on after some time and we have some
decorators for routing as well so that's
how basically you know decorators are
and metadata that's how it works
metadata is assigned to the stack so
that we can just let know the browser
that angular is an action so this was a
quick tutorial on you for you guys to
you know to just make sure that you guys
are aware of the terms that what is
decorator or what is a metadata so in
future if I just you know just say these
terms
and you certainly don't scream out and
say what the heck is this
so yeah so that's what that's all for
this tutorial and I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
