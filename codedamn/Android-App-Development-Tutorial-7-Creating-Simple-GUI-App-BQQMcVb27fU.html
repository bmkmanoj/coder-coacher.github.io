Android application development tutorial
my name is Mei hole and in this tutorial
I'm just gonna show you how to pretty
much build up a basic Android
application using this activity main.xml
but with the help of design so Android
does provide you a sort of GUI interface
if you are just if you just want to play
around with your application and you
could just probably make some more stuff
by just getting rid of this bottle right
here right there you can see then what
happens is that you could just make use
of all of these widgets text fields
containers date/time and this this
custom tools right there to create your
application the GUI way well that is
pretty cool and awesome you just delete
these things and you can just drag this
button right here on your screen you
would just resize not really but from
here actually we just said it's text
this is the ID we'll just take a look at
that later on we'll just say that this
is my awesome but hit enter and as you
can see it changes its size
automatically you could just align it as
well with the help of your cursor only
and if you just see that it's pretty
much in the center of any screen you
switch to even the TV one so we are just
not looking at TV right now but it's
just good to know that your code works
universally so you can just take a look
at how this works then you could just
add some other things like large text
just place on of this then you can
change this to like hello world and you
have a bunch of options here as you
would see that this is text size you
could just specify a task like a TSP it
enter and it crews like
anything so you know and with this SP
stands and with this DB means we're
gonna discuss about that later on in our
tutorials not for now because all of you
guys who are coming from the web
designing background would probably make
use of this px but no px for Android
because Android is installed on a very
large you know diversity of devices so
this px is not gonna work at all
properly actually it would work but not
probably so we're gonna make yourself
either DB or SP and I'm gonna show you
when to make use of DP or when to make
use of SP and what that really means but
anyways what is our concern right now is
to create a very stupid app so let's
just concentrate on that and you can
just resize this yeah then you could
just even Center it there should be a
gravity somewhere in here
all right here we go
then you could just select this as
central vertical what gravity actually
has a very special meaning which we are
gonna learn in our text mode but for now
in the GUI mode as well what you can
learn about gravity is that it just
switches your gravity inside container
so just to consider that this is your
environment and then you switch the
gravity so you say the gravity is top
that means that all the elements would
be attracted in this box towards top so
for now it is just a text then gravity
towards bottom would be the bottom then
if I select both you could see that it's
the equal attraction so Newton's third
law applies here well anyways then for
left we have the left gravity extraction
but it's still it's already on left so
nothing on see here then for right it
just frozen right and you can just play
around with these buttons then we just
go with hide as well then there's our
there are a lot of options and very much
only some of them are you
not all so we just play around a little
bit and you could actually just switch
the gravity to central for now and if
you just run this on your phone you
could see that it would pretty much look
the same as it looks like on that
emulator stuff so you can see that this
is my awesome button and it kind of
responds but you don't have any even the
dash to it and we've been learning about
that later on so that's how pretty much
you create a custom application using
all this all these tools right here and
feel free to try some more tools from
here like radio button or checkbox
switches and all that stuff and once
you're done then proceed to the next
tutorials so if you like this tutorial
