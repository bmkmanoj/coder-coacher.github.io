angularjs tutorial and from this
tutorial onwards the difficulty would
escalate quickly so I highly recommend
you to pay attention to all of the
tutorials from now onwards because we
have finally covered all of the beginner
stuff in angularjs and what it takes to
you know just know the basics of
angularjs so now from now onwards will
be working with angularjs MVC
architecture and MVC stands for model
view controller so before actually that
I was telling in the last tutorial that
I'll teach you controllers in this
tutorial I thought that it's necessary
for you to know that what is actually
Model View controller and if you are a
big guy from coming from a PHP or ASP
background then you should already know
this what MVC is and how it works but
for all of you right there which are new
to this MVC let me explain to you model
view controller is basically you can say
it's a design it's a pattern for all of
the web applications on the Internet
so it stands for three terms Model View
and controller simply it says that model
is basically how the application
kinda behaves with data view clearly
says that whatever is visible to the
user and controller is the coding which
would act between model and view so what
this controller do is that it would act
like a link between model and controller
so we have a this kind of structure
which is Model View separated isolated
from each other and controller acts like
a bridge between them so Model View
controller or MVC model is popular only
because that these two run in isolated
environments and the logic of the
application is completely separated from
the user interaction so controller kinda
receives all the requests from the user
and passed on to model and model
similarly whatever it do with the data
passes us on to controller and
controller may or may not modify that
data and pass it on to the view so in
angularjs we would be mainly working
with controllers and which is the link
between these two so
the controller would kind of work to
respond to the user data as well and to
the model as well so you can can imagine
model and view like two persons standing
on the opposite ends of a bridge and
controller is the bridge itself so those
two persons are isolated from each other
but the bridge acts like a link between
them so that's it for the MVC
architecture and we'll be working a lot
in MVC with angularjs because it's a
Model View controller architecture a
framework and I hope that this much
introduction to MVC is good for now to
understand and work with controllers
from the next studio so don't forget to
subscribe keep watching my videos and
I'll see you then good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
