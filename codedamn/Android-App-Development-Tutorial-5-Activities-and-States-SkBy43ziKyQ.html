mijo and welcome to your fifth Android
application development tutorial in
which I'm gonna discuss about something
known as activities in Android and
actually I wanted to discuss about
activities and activity lifecycle in
this tutorial so starting off with
activities
well what activities are well actually
activities you can say that activities
are pretty much pages of a book if your
application is a book then activities
are its pages well a book is of no good
without pages unless it's Kendall well
anyways so what activity means is that
it is sort of a page which you could
present to your user and you could just
throw off your user from one page to
another as well using some button or
some event or you know whatever and you
could just pass on the data as well from
one activity to another so think of an
activity like a page of your book and
you would probably be able to relate it
so what this main activity means right
now is that this is the first activity
which would be launched whenever your
user starts the application so what
happens is that Android gives you a lot
of control over each and every point
whenever Android considers that you
could add some sort of functionality or
some sort of behavior so I have googled
it and I found this image right here
which describes pretty much in an ugly
way how activity lifecycle is there so
each activity has a life cycle well
obviously if this activity is right now
active it won't be active forever on the
user's page it's not your home screen or
you want anything else because you were
user would eventually just go to just
press the brought back button or just
exit your application anyways or if you
just try to hang your application
deliberately Android would automatically
your application without any mercy so
what this lifecycle means is actually it
says that when you tap on your
application for the first time that
means your application is not open in
the background so what happens is that
on creator this oncreate function is
called now when this oncreate function
is called your application has not
pretty much initialized even it is in a
state of starting so on critters like
you are waking up from a sleep you are
not active actually but you know what
what is happening you are under control
then on start ants that means that you
are pretty much awake a little bit so
you can restore your previous state
you remember that where you sleep where
are you sleeping right now our you know
how much time it has elapsed since you
are sleeping so onstart pretty much
means like that then on restore instance
I guess where's it I guess it's not in
this figure so what on restore instance
is that it restores your previous state
like if you have you know if you have
unsaved data for your application like
your application is a form and you have
somehow managed to save data when the
user was closing your application we'll
learn about that later on so on restored
restore instance it would run so that
you could just restore a state if needed
then onresume would finally this
function right here would resume your
application and now your activity that
particular activity is running or in
other words it is kind of visible to the
user so the next thing is that what
happens like somebody is browsing your
application and
the phone call comes in between so what
happens is that Android would
immediately take over and instead of you
know giving priority to your
applications activity it would just show
the user phone call so in that case what
happens is that on pause our on pause
function is called well this on pause
functions means that your activity is
actually you know it's it is still kinda
in control but it is partially partially
visible so that it could be like if you
are you know browsing if you your user
is browsing their application and their
battery is about 15% so adder gives a
notification in a pop-up type that
connect to a charger so in that case
your activity is you know disturbed in
between so Android would automatically
call this on pass function so that you
know you do not lose any sort of data
you were transmitting in between or you
know you just know that something has
happened to your activity in between
that meteor app activity kinda out of
you know out of scope or of touch out of
you know it is just partially visible
user cannot actually interact with your
activity but actually can see it then we
have this unsafe instance State now what
this means is that your activity is kind
of closed so it is no longer visible
that means that your activity is Guara
you know you have switched activities
with intense which we are gonna look at
later on what intents are well that's
how pretty much unzipped instance state
works it just works when your activity
is no longer visible that particular
activity obviously for which so whenever
these things happen your activities in a
paused state then on resume would be the
function whenever your activity is back
to you know your activities back to
activeness so your activity is still
visible again this onresume function is
called and your
DVDs again in a running State then from
paused itself what could happen is that
user stops your activity or Android
stops your activity then what happens is
that on stop function would be called
well this unsafe instance shouldn't be
here
on stop would be called and on stop
after on stop your application is
stopped now when your applications
stopped this ondestroy function or the
process killed is called as well
well this function is not always called
you should not rely on this function
because this on destroyed would be only
called when Android is happy with your
application or there's no sort of memory
management going on or Android is not
busy because Android can't forget to
call this on destroy and it is not a bug
it is actually the way it is because on
destroy is kind of meant to clear up
things and not you know just put
important stuff which you want your
application to perform when it is
destroyed now once this happens your
application goes out of scope
immediately and it is destroyed so that
is how pretty much how lifecycle of an
application or an activity in Android
works and don't overwhelm yourself with
all of that information this is Carla
not really important at all you would
learn it yourself when you would start
coding applications and you would make
use of these all these methods and one
method right here you can see in
mainactivity.java is that this is
protected word on creator the same
method listed right here so this one
query would be called whenever your
application is kind of starting when you
are kind of waking up from sleep so this
is when this method will be called so
that's all pretty much for this tutorial
and from the next tutorial onwards we
will be probably starting off with some
coding stuff we'll be coding some
awesome Android applications and I don't
know why
heck this always kind of goes in a
minimize state from a maximized one
automatically so if any of you have a
solution for this just let me know
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
