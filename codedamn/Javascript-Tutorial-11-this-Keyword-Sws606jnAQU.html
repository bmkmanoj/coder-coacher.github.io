JavaScript tutorial in this tutorial
we'll be discussing something called
this in JavaScript in my earlier
tutorials I have used the keyword this
many a times but not explained properly
what this do now technically this
keyword refers to the owner of the
function or any object you're calling in
for instance if I create a function X
with an alert of this and we call this
function down here then the order of
this function is obviously the window
superglobal because we haven't trapped
this in anything so the owner of this
function X is the windows / global and
thus it would alert the super global
window object window as you can see
but for instance if I do something like
supposingly I want to change this value
of text on clicking so what I would do
is I would create
on click event attribute and it called
the function X and let's modify X a
little bit and we'll do alert this now
what would happen is it would still
alert the window superglobal because
though it is called by an HTML element
still the owner of this function is
window but if we pass a parameter this
in the function right here in the HTML
we get the this reference with the
keyword or any keyword E or even
whatever you like and alert even then
what we'll just see is that this key
word right here refers to this element
this HTML element because the owner of
this function right here right now is
this this particular HTML tag which is
the div ID 1 but inside this function
the disky word again refers to the
window superglobal thus you can see that
this can modify its values from place to
place even in the same function
for instance the event right here refers
to the reference of this inside this
function let's try to run this code and
see what happens
okay now we have this div and on
clicking we should get two alerts first
with the event which refers to the this
keyword of this tag and then the
original this which refers to the window
superglobal let's try to click on this
and as you see we get the first alert as
object HTML development because this
keyword here refers to the div of HTML
that is div ID 1 and we are passing this
as it is in the function as the argument
and receiving it here in the alert box
now on clicking on ok we get object
window therefore this keyword has
changed its value from objective HTML
element to its original window super
global here so this was a short
introduction to the keyword this I hope
you're clear with what this does and why
this is used is okay so in the last
tutorial I told you about the objects
and why should we use this keyword in
the function and constructor function
basically one stance let's create a
function with
my object and let's create some
properties this star X's will 200
district was 200 let's create another
function
with returning value of this dot X star
they stood why now supposedly I create
an object here with this constructor
function is new my object
now let's console.log okay let's create
a variable where a is equal to 300 now
called
let's console.log Oh dot a now what
we'll see here is undefined and I'll
tell you the movement way and let's
create another variable or let's call so
long this really world are the property
of the object and we'll see hundred
let's console on the property and we'll
see
we'll see 200 finally let's consult our
method and we'll see what you say
okay so let's verify the results first
so as you can see
the line lets's undefined
this
this should return a value let's see
okay perfect now the first is we have
created a variable a if you look back to
my variable scopes tutorial in functions
and JavaScript you'll see that this
variable is local to this function but
this keyword right here refers to any of
the instance we create with this
constructor function now instance is
basically a fancy way of saying creating
an object from a constructor class
that's it
that's the difference between instance
and a kind of object okay so this
keyword here particularly left first to
the object we have created with the new
keyword now for instance we have created
a object Oh with new my object and when
we access the property Oh dot a then we
get undefined because this a refers to
this function scope only and it cannot
be accessed by any other objects we
create with this base class or
constructor class you can see but all
that X here refers to the
basically the property here in the
object now basically this doesn't
directly look upon this object
constructor class and I'll tell you why
this first of all if we do something
like ordered X is equal to 300 and then
we refresh this page you can see the
value has changed but why didn't it get
the value of its constructor class now
here comes the thing prototype and
prototypal inheritance in JavaScript
which we'll discuss in future tutorials
because it would be some time consuming
and would need a lot of attention and
focus ok coming back to this tutorial we
have ordered X here and ordered X has
this keyword attached to it which says
that I want to access the value of this
particular constructor class objects
created that means that this keyword
does not refer to this function because
as I told you earlier in a function this
key word refers to window superglobal
because this refers to the owner of a
particular function or an object so here
we are creating a keyword or a kind of
object
now the owner of this function is over
here so this refers to the object Oh
then we are doing over dot X now this
refers to oh and then o dot X is
obviously the functions X which is 100
and does it return 100 but if you modify
this then we are into something called
prototypes and prototypal inheritance
which I'll discuss in the future
tutorials so this is all for this
keyword this in the Java Script and I'll
see you soon in the next tutorial and
