Mitchell and welcome to your 14 angular
6 tutorial in which we're going to
discuss about something you will usually
and always need when you are not
building single page applications with
angular which would be the case almost
every time that is struggling so let's
get started alright so in this video
we're going to take a look at what
routing is why you would need rounding
really quick and implementing routing
channel from scratch so what is routing
displaying different content on
different pages is routing you can split
up your content on different pages for
example if you want to show some things
for authenticated people and some things
to unauthenticated people you can do
that with routing you can do a lot of
other stuff for example if you website
contains a lot of stuff then you can
split that stuff you know about
tangey nation right we have every word a
blogs which has a lot of post then they
show these numbers that can be
profoundly rounding that is one example
of rounding rounding is everyone on
internet so let's just implement a
stronger module really quicker so
implement this what we have is that less
is create two components really quit so
we would create two components here and
less is quits per component ngg see a
shortcut equator component and let's
just say this is my home so i have a
home component ready with me and a few
centons okay we are and i will need
another component that would be ngg see
data right so we have our home component
and we have our data component and what
I want is that our application starts
from AB component that bootstraps from
AB component what I want is I want to
import something known as without from
module
from from angular router DVR and now
what I want to do is since it's a module
remember module goes into inputs so I
want to do an import of router module
but with this import I want to define
how my route should look like I'm going
to say for route and you can see the
definition here it gets it sets the
first parameter as an array of routes so
you can just import this router array as
well to add types route validation and
all that stuff but other talked about
that in the first video that is not
really necessary for smaller
applications right so we can be safely
on the back okay so in this array of
routes what we have is a property in the
subject of path and a property of
component now what you need to remember
while writing these objects is that
these paths the more generic the paths
which are which can be matched to a lot
of URLs should be placed weight in lower
than the ones which are exact for
example for example let me show you this
part of blank would match pretty much
anything
not only anything I believe but it
matches a lot of stuff right so I'm
gonna show you that this wait a minute
let's just say component is this is own
component so yeah what I was talking
about with that suppose that your
application has localhost / part 1 /
part 2 then your application also
handles localhost / path 1 so if you
placed this in a higher priority if this
then what would happen is that when
usual with this path the component for
this would render because angular runs
analyst router ones on a first so
strategy so and you know the elements in
a in an array are preserved so it starts
looking from the first element it keeps
looking unless it's found a match once
it pounds a path match it would render
that component into an HTML tag
known as around
now let me just clarify that for you
really good let me just write it one
more rule here and you see what I'm
talking about it so I'm going to write a
path of data and the component that
should render when that happens is data
component and they all have everything
in place because of angular CLI so there
we go
now what's happening here and before I
tell you one last thing
instead add component on HTML they we
have outer outlet pass the tag already
now one final thing one final one final
thing is that inside our data component
actually just moved
ah let's chill out here let me just
controls that a little and we should be
able to get a HDMI back already
so here goes my HTML for data component
and all throughout it your back and what
we need to do is one last thing is to
get this thing as well so inside my ng
or in it this is my service then we will
have objected the service and finally
we will just make it available through
our component but injecting it and
obviously with the spillover cause
earlier this would be one path down all
right we are good to go okay so let me
just quickly go over through what we
have done so far
stay with me we imported the router
module we imported that into our app
through the imports way we defined
routes for this application so this path
data what this means is localhost total
EU / Delta whenever that hits it would
render the component we specify into
something known as this router outlet
tag right router out that would display
components which this route them what
you will tell City right so once it's
data it matches it finds component it
stops if this this is one data we go
further down in the array we find a
blank pad which is our home page and we
get our home component here all right so
we need to do a couple of things more to
this home component as well and that is
home books of the can write a router
link which is just angular so you are
telling that this is not an external
link it is a special link which should
not be reloaded paramon is a protein
database
alright so that was quite some work and
now we are ready for Showtime
you can see that we get homeworks and go
to database later but I'll check on this
you can see that our data gets loaded
now if we see this one more time
what you would observe is that at this
point in our application the fine dot
PHP file is not loaded now the reason
file dot PHP is not loaded obviously
because handler is not loading all of
your components at once inside the
Psalter module so when I go to this data
page you can see that this file dot PHP
file was loaded you can see that you can
display at it and if I go to it and
directly then also this thing works now
because under the hood web pack
development server just transfers all
the requests angular script but that
will not happen obviously when you
deploy it in a production app there are
different ways to do that won't come to
that
very late on in here pushing this
application to action servers so anyways
that was a very basic route setup and
what we can do is that whatever you
write here I hope you get my point
this will always display because this is
independent or router all right so it's
always gonna display I can see that this
will always display will always display
now the reason for that is because again
as I told you that this is not a part of
your router router outlet so this would
all be display you can this add a
backlink to this so that it makes kind
of more sense so instead of a H ref
we're gonna see a router link go back
save reload
go to the data page go back go to the
data page go back now you can see that
angular is not caching these requests
right so this is actually could and
should be the default feature because
your data might change in between so
angular does not want to show hold date
that we users so go back go to data page
and that's that's how it works so yeah
that was pretty much it how basic
routing works how you basically create
how you basically even create routing
and get stuff from a local server and
artists and that is all for this video
