hole and welcome to your seventh
electron tutorial in which we're going
to take a look at how you can develop a
frameless window in electron and we're
going to pretty much get started with
another or rather or first up for
electron because I think that going by
the documentation slow and just pretty
much grasping and grabbing and pretty
much just seeing that how things work
wouldn't work for you and at least it
doesn't work for me when I'm learning
something new I need to get my hands on
do that thing so we'll be developing an
application which would be pretty much
like image editing and this has been
suggested by someone in the chemist
sorry bro I forgot your name but yeah I
thought this was a good idea and here we
are so let's just do this so for this
tutorial I'm going to keep it restricted
to how to create some frameless windows
I don't quite it actually looks quite
nice at least for me the frame kind of
sucks right now for electronics so let's
get rid of that so to do that what we're
going to do is go to our index J s and
set this frame is false right and once
you do that what will happen is that the
default frame with the menu would
disappear we can just change this to a
little low value I'm going to get rid of
this at all right so okay so then we can
say electron dot in our directory and it
should fire up or soon and it
okay I guess avast screwed it up okay so
the last is detecting electron as a
threat
nope it's so false positive I know what
I'm doing bro electron electron I don't
know whatever it ass is to it what the
heck I actually never use rust really
anyways okay so my antivirus just
screwed up my development environment
give me a sec okay so look I had this
fixed by restoring the app and now you
can see that we get this ugly black
window and that is it
because it is frameless and that's what
pretty much we wanted right well not
exactly so let's just do something about
it so what we can do is the go-to style
of CSS and I guess I move that device
well anyways and we get to score down in
the middle right looks cool but what I
want to do is actually make it movable
right right now it's just it's a stuck
nowhere so what we can do is create
another thing that's header and let's
say this world inside content and right
here we can say
class after cross and do not option this
is just a bar to minimize right and
finally what we're going to do is
instead of body I'm gonna say that this
is content and yep and forehead and for
the div id of text let's say I'm just
making it right now let's scroll while
and I guess just if I content center is
not what we need and for header again we
can say that this is display flex flex
Direction row reverse and just if I
content click start right so we can just
go to background off Tripoli for now to
distinguish it from the bottom stuff and
for content yeah that looks good okay
let's take a look what we have got in
here right so we need to make this one
where this flex Direction row or rather
column and there you can see that we
have got our header but it doesn't look
a lot nice right and actually we can
just fire up developer console to see
what is going on right now so what we
can do is we can say anywhere a line
cells have stretch
and that would pretty much make it fluid
and for the option rebus option you can
see the color is black right now and you
can see that we are getting there now
right but the thing is how do you
actually our wait a minute yeah how do
you actually make it movable right
because it looks cool but you still
cannot move it right and that's not what
we really want so let me just fix them
some styles in here and then we might be
able to see properly and well it's so
large okay and now what we can do is
simply say something like option for
word background red and cursor:pointer
right so that is very much what we need
for this so it looks good but again it's
of no use for us now how do you fix that
well actually chrome allows you to do
something like word get app region now
what this does is that it defines some
area or whatever selector you're working
on as draggable right so this is
actually a feature
of chrome packaged apps but it is
available for electron as well so what
this does is just like title bar of any
application is kind of draggable web get
a vision when specified with CSS makes
it more or less like your title bar only
you can drag that application window
with the help of the thing you are
targeting right so we'll just see that
in a moment what that means and this
actually pretty much eats and kills all
of the events like click or hover or
whatever evens you have so you've got to
be careful when using this right so if
we take a look again you would see that
we are able to move this window now and
that is right useful actually but what
you will see that we lose our horror
access these horror styles or you know
it's kind of not very smooth it does not
fire the events properly right so how do
you actually fix this thing how do you
actually make them forward properly
instead of just randomly sometimes
o-ring and sometimes not to do that what
we can do is we can make option regions
as no drag right because of the region
which is draggable would eat all of the
events most probably all the time
right but the when you set any specific
region as no drag then it would have its
the events and callbacks return to
itself so if you take a look now you can
see that our cursor has become pointer
and the events are now properly fired
for these two buttons but again you lose
dragging options for these two I don't
think so in Windows as well you can try
with these right here so that kind of
makes sense to do so again you have your
own title bar and you can drag with it
so yeah that's pretty much it for this
one we can just
as a matter of fact Center this thing so
we can say with it justify content
central a line item thank you on display
place and we'll be good to go
so that is not very much you make a very
simple frameless window with the
electron and that is all for this
tutorial in the next one I'm going to
create or start with the new application
I was talking about so yeah that's all
for this one and if you liked it then
please don't forget to subscribe like
the video and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
