seventh Google Chrome extension
development tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be developing a fancy
toolbar for your Google Chrome browser
now Google Chrome basically does not
provide any specific API to develop any
toolbar like this one the bookmarks one
down here but we can use a workaround
and sort of a hack to insert a toolbar a
custom toolbar with any contents in it
on every page user visits with the help
of your extension so let's go ahead and
create that first of all to do that this
is our previous extensions code from the
last tutorial and in this extension we
don't need this URL overrides the
background switch the content scripts
would be okay let's use jQuery
to simplify the code
and yeah we're good to go
the one thing we need to use this down
here in your manifesto JSON
now we'll declare something called web
accessible resources now what it does is
supposingly we want to insert our
toolbar from toolbar dot HTML now in
your content square when you type like
iframe SRC toolbar dot HTML now what it
does is this code down here would be
relative to your page inside which the
iframe is inserted now we don't want
that because we have our own toolbar dot
HTML so by declaring down here this code
would actually look for something Chrome
extension and then your local path and
then a toolbar at HTML so we need to
actually declare everything down here in
the web accessible resources we were
which which we want to use in the
content scripts and which would be
available for the user to see so let's
declare another thing which is standard
CSS
and let's put it CSS down here
style of CSS and what does that mean is
just like in content scripts the jeaious
included here would run on every page
this wild card the Stine sheets down
here would run on every dispatch every
page which matches this wild card so
let's create a style sheet first
this gaelic style of CSS let's create a
tool bar file dead
notice that are not using the style file
down here to link with the stool bar
file I'm using the style file to style
the iframe we are gonna embed in the
page so in the my script dodgiest which
is our content script
let's close the unwanted files okay now
in the my script which is a Content
script let's create an iframe kind of
string so let's do it
iframe SRC now down here let's get the
URL of the toolbar dot HTML file first
to do that we use the chrome API growth
not extension dot get URL notice the
syntax because it has to be exact same
and in the parenthesis past the file
name you want to retrieve and now in URL
we have the local URL of this tool
butter HTML file and now we can use it
in iframe so let's use the SRC URL and
now
we have ID of let's say my own custom
first toolbar make sure you give it a
very very unique ID which is possibly
not to be find found on any page because
if you give a similar idea to the page
which already has it the CSS clashes
then your Styles could be overwritten by
the default CSS of the page so I have
given this very unique ID to this and I
don't hope any page or the internet
would be using this ID and now let's
close the siphon now we are good to go
just a couple of more things we'll be
applying the height of this iframe data
back away
I'll tell you the reason why you have to
hide down here
let's
luckily let's create a variable height
let's give it to let's say 35 pixels
okay so I have created this height
dynamically in the iframe because we
have to use this hide down here for one
another task and I'll tell you what it
is now first of all let's go to style
dot CSS and let's start this toolbar now
we want to give it a position of
absolute if you want to make this a
sticky toolbar then you can move on fix
this position down here position fixed
but I'll just make it on the top then we
have top:0 left:0 with 100% and height
we have a cell as already given now we
have the tasks over for now let's give
it a background off black so that it's
visible color white okay
now if I just simply do like iframe dot
append and body then what would happen
is it would over appear over the content
and would basically block the content so
let's go to Google let's see what
happens our wildcard matches Google as
well because it matches every HTTP and
HTTPS page
and
let's see
we have I friend oops this should be
body not a band I say
let's try again
reload
refresh
and here we go you can see the stop bar
this is actually our own custom iframe
now what's happening here is we are
actually hiding this content of Gmail ad
it looks pretty awkward because we don't
want to stop the rendering of the
original web page so what we need to do
is we want to shift the body down to
some extent but since we are already
appending - to body we need to do to
append this iframe to the HTML of the
code and then we can shut the body using
translate wire now the reason I'm using
translate why is because using this we
could actually shift the fixed elements
of the page as well so let's try let's
apply the CSS
let's give it
from phone
and the value ass translate said why the
height would be
the height we have given in the above
variable
so
so we have the CSS down here on the body
and I don't think many of the sites
would be using transform on their body
itself and translate why and if you want
more then we can use actually a WebKit
keyword but that doesn't matter because
Google already supports the translate or
basically the transform property without
the WebKit and if you are worrying about
the the layout and the DOM and the
standard of the HTML that then don't
worry because we are creating this page
dynamically and this will not appear if
you do access this page from any other
page which does not has any other
computer which does not has this
extension installed so now we are ready
to go and we have shifted the body down
the height of the iframe so now let's
reload this extension let's see what
happens
see oh sorry we don't need a semicolon
out here let's reload this code
try again
here you go now we have this pretty
awesome iframe embedded but still black
add nothing visible on it so let's open
our toolbar dot HTML file and add some
content down here okay so now we have
this document and let's say hello world
out here let's reload this and see if
something's life
as you can see the iframe is actually
black so
let's change the
that's
basically let us do some
internal studies the body should be
color white now basically these styles
we are applying here applied to its
spirit which is actually an iframe so
these styles will not be narrated by the
original page let's remove the color we
don't need here let's give the bottle a
zero let's give a tool bar a light shade
because we don't want it to appear
absolute duck
I'll use this feature of growth the
color selector or basically the back of
water
and I guess
this looks cool let's convert it to hex
value values copy and business pretty
simple
now we haven't done with the styles
it's real of this extension let's reload
this page now we get a sweet hello world
popped up down here now inside this
toolbar at HTML file you can use
literally anything you want because this
is a normal HTML file and made it like a
toolbar in every page you can customize
this HTML file file just like you
customize a normal HTML file so here we
have a toolbar ready and we can do like
margin:0 or anything you can create your
own search boxes and pass the
information to the contents will create
your own buttons social profiles ad
blockers or anything special or unique
you think you can put in the toolbar so
this was a tutorial on creating your
custom toolbar in google chrome with the
help of your extension and the next
tutorials I don't know we'll be
discussing something more interesting
about Chrome extensions but stay tuned
till then and don't forget to subscribe
