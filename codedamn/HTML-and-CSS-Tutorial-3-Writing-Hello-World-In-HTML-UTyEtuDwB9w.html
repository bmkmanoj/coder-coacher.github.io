your third HTML and CSS tutorial in
which we'll be discussing about the HTML
syntax and we'll be writing our first
hello world program in HTML so to write
your first program in HTML what you need
is a text editor now a text editor is
pretty much like notepad which comes by
default installed on Windows PC and you
have various other text editors like the
sublime text right here I'm using this
is sublime text if you wish to download
then we have notepad plus plus which is
also a very good text editor if you ask
me then I'll personally suggest you to
use no dot plus plus right now because
it's awesome it's simple it's clean
basically and
the navigation menus and the buttons
would help you to familiarize yourself
with various commands and it has also
got a autocorrect basically a spell type
check so it helps a lot but if you want
to look some like a geek or a
professional then you're free to use
this sublime text which is free text
editor but you have to purchase a
license for it after some time so here
we go now let's write our first HTML
HelloWorld program now in HTML most of
the things are done by the browser side
that means you don't have to really
think much about doing stuff in HTML so
first of all open let's say I create a
new file down here and let's close this
file 3 dot HTML let's delete it as as
well so let's create a new file untitled
and let's simply write hello world in
this or whatever text you want to appear
so now
press ctrl + S and save it like 3 or any
of your file name first followed by a
period dot HTML now people save usually
save it like HTM as well and it would
work as well but I just don't prefer
this method so i would use dot HTML
hypertext markup language and save it
and congratulations you just wrote your
first HTML hello world program now if
you see it in the browser and reload
this then you'll see hello world appears
in your browser for the URL this this
means space just Chrome would escape
that so this is the file URL and hello
wall appears like a charm so that's how
you write a hello world program
quick revision of this tutorial would be
choose a text editor that suits to you
say create a new file write some content
in it save it as your final name dot
HTML and launch it in a cool browser
like Google Chrome so that's how you
write a hello world program in HTML and
in the future tutorials will be going
deep into this topic and we'd be looking
at at this bad boy
and all of its stuff so stay tuned with
me and don't forget to subscribe thanks
