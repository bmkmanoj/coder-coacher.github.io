embarrassing okay let's try that one
more time
welcome everybody to 11th PHP tutorial
and I guess I should now speak my name
as well and which channel is doing this
video so as to avoid that black receives
no people these days are finding new
ways to steal content online so from now
onwards I'll be giving a little
introduction about this channel not
introduction but just I mean so let's
try it one more time
so hello everybody this is me hole from
code on comm are in this tutorial what
we'll be learning about PHP is break and
continue statements now in the last
tutorial we looked at what loops are in
PHP and how to work with them but in the
last tutorial I hope you guys remember I
told you that even this loop syntax is
valid but this code right here under
this would run infinite times well
obviously that's not physically possible
but it would run as long as your
hardware allows it to so how to deal
with that let's say you want a loop to
run as many times or you want to loop to
run in finite times but you want to give
a certain condition inside the if to
bring it out so what is that well that
is a break statement
now a break statement would jump out of
your for loop or your while loop or your
do-while loop as soon as it is
encountered so let's say I have the
statement I equal to 1 and let's say I
type for since we have already
initialized that I is less than our eyes
not equal to xi let's say I plus plus
inside this I do echo I now this would
print I from one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten we have already
seen that but let's see somehow I want
to stop whenever I is seven let's say so
one way I have is if I is less than
seven less than or equal to seven
then I won't do like this so what it
does is eventually it would check that
if I is less than or equal to seven this
would acquire then only but this would
create a kind of memory loss to your
program because when the statement when
the I is not when the I becomes it even
then this loop is running so that eats
some sort of memory and in bigger loops
when you are iterating over hundreds and
thousands of elements then this becomes
a huge performance issue so to overcome
this what we can do is we can make use
of something called break statement so
let's say I want to break out of this
loop whenever is seven so what I'll do
is f I equals to seven break now what it
does is when we are running this loop
the control is here right here the
cursor where the cursor is blinking so
control comes to next line checks this
condition for I equals to 1 this is not
true skips over it comes here and then
goes again here as long as the condition
met so it comes here goes here comes
here goes here and it's incrementing I
as well obviously so once I is seven
this condition is matched and it goes
inside this block of code and it
encounters this break statement the
break statement would bring out this the
control right here after after the for
loop which is just like here so any
statement about after this the control
would immediately be called here
so any of the rest iterations which were
left would be left forever so let's take
a look at this program in the browser
let's reload this so you see that we got
one two three four five six seven only
and how do I place this echo under this
can it guess what would be the output
well we won't get seven because before
in the previous case what we used what
we were doing is we were first of all
echoing the I then we were checking what
it was but here we are first of all
checking what it is and then we are
echoing that so similarly what you can
do is we can omit this condition as well
and I can write if I is eleven then
break out so this would work similar to
the original loop and even you could
just do like that and increment it below
so you see that we got rid of all the
three expressions and recreated them
inside the loop body itself similarly
with the wild one or I guess I should
talk about continue first so just like
break let me get back a little bit in
time so just like we have break we have
something called continue now continue
would technically skip the iteration so
what that means is let's say I have echo
Wow here as well let's just give it a
new line so that it is not messy so
continue what continue would do is that
it would just skip that particular
iteration so I guess if I do Wow
and this all together then it would be
much more meaningful for you so I'll
just just remove this so let's run this
in the browser and as you can see we got
one Wow two three four five six but no
seven now why not seven
is because once I was seven I passed and
continued so continued what it does the
control which was here which was about
to go on next slide when encountered
continue skipped the iteration and went
back to the for expression all these
three expressions and the I was
incremented condition was checked and in
the loop ran again
so you see that there's a huge
difference in break and continue the
break brings you out of loop whereas
continue keeps you inside the loop but
just increments the creation so similar
thing could be done in the while loop as
well so let's say if I say while one is
one which is obviously true this would
always be true that one is equal to one
so instead of this you could also write
like while true is true or just while
true
so all that makes sense while one while
two while three all of that would work
but not why zero because we have zero as
false which we would be learning in few
tutorials so what we can do is while one
is one so echo echo I I could say if I
is equal to ten break and here we would
increment the eye so let's reload this
so you see that we got one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten so
similarly this thing could be done in
do-while as well and I hope you guys can
now do that yourself and do-while so
that's kind of your assignment for today
so do that I'll let me know what the
outcome was and that's it for this
tutorial so don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
