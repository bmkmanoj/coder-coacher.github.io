bootstrap tutorial I'm a whole and in
this tutorial we'll be looking at how to
add some content to the content area and
bootstrap now so far we have created a
jumbotron at a navigation bar using just
bootstrap and now I have learned the
style sheet as well to work with
external styles because we're gonna need
that real soon so first of all let's
just container can create a container
which will contain our data and let's
just go ahead with h1 and let's just say
by some Facebook Likes from us that's
got a weird because of the jumbotron I
guess I said we cells worst worst most
quality facebook likes and that kinda
makes much more sense now and now with
this you can make use of small which is
automatically styled by bootstrap and
here you can write or basically this
would go inside this h1 only you won't
regret and if you look then you see that
this is cara left aligned but we can
make use of our another class we can say
just this is my own class let's just
pick this up and
our style sheet let's just see
text-align central simple enough next
what we can do is we can make use of an
image from facebook
and the net doesn't seem to cooperate
right now don't worry i will stop on as
well so we just need to get one image
ok
I guess this one would do
yeah the internet slagging right now and
do it dad okay now we can just say this
is mage and I want this to be war center
and let's just take a look at it first
if it works or not alright so there's a
sales by some Facebook Likes from us
what we can do is now we can quiz some
awesome bottles with bootstrap and then
we can say give us some space and let us
create some purchase buttons and if you
look at the tutorial number six or five
or four yeah so we have got all of these
bunch of buttons right now if you see
then I guess we would have a primary
button right here good for a payment so
we can just say this to be on a wire
paypal
fifty dollar for half 10k likes I hope
I'm not charging much so you see that
this bottle of beer see right here now
we can send it this one as well by
either supplying this would I guess
center class and I know I guess this
would be a better alternative to create
a text align center at a margin job of
30 pixels okay so we have got this
button and I know this page looks like
full crap but don't worry that's because
we don't know most of the things in
bootstrap and I don't think that I
should start right away from like grids
or like doing like div class call sm and
all that mobile version but don't worry
we'll be learning about grits real soon
and I guess that's a sad end to our
worst web page online with bootstrap and
the series as well so don't worry this
miniseries are here not the series so
don't worry from the next tutorial will
be working on grits in bootstrap and
then we'll be working on a web page when
will finally learn something about
bootstrap which is solid and can be used
as a base or foundation for our web
pages so that's all for this tutorial
