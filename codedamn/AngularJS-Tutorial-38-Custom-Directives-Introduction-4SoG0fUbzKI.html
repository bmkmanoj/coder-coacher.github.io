welcome to your 38 angularjs tutorial in
which will be finally starting off with
our custom directives now we already
know what directives are you can see as
well the ng app is a directive the
controller ng controller is a directive
and we have used a lot of more
directives as well in the past including
the ng model or the ng bind so all of
these directives as you can see are
prefixed by the ng that means they
belong to the angular library but in
angularjs you can actually create your
own directives as well and directors
pretty much you know allow you to
customize your HTML and make it a lot
more dynamic so for example let's say
you have a website on which you you know
usually have to parse some JSON response
data from the web server into a
beautiful table and you already have the
Styles ready so what would you do you
can't always you know just create a
controller and then go to your script
files and then do a whole lot of coding
and again just for another table do the
same so what you can do is you can
simply create a directive called you
know my table and then what you can do
is you can just you know with your div
class table and just add your directive
like that so that would automatically
turn your JSON script into a table well
enough of talking let's get started with
a simple hello world program in
angularjs with the help of a custom
directive first of all let me just get
rid of this okay so the first thing you
need to do when you are creating a
custom directive is you need to decide a
name so for example when I write a dot
directive and here goes the name just
like we do for controller or any factory
or whatever and here goes the function
definition and right here what we're
going to do is we're going to return an
object and this object is the master you
can say all of that
work all of that working of your
directive is programmed right here so
the naming convention about this
directive is that let's say you have you
want to name your HTML tag or HTML
directive as less a div class something
and then you want the directive to be
named as my first directive now to do
that what you get what you have to do is
you're inside here you have to make use
of camel casing and for those who don't
know what camel casing is camel casing
is basically just capitalizing each word
of your story of your string with by
replacing a dash or whatever there's
between so for example let's say you
have a string my first script and you
want to camelcase that so what you have
to do is just write my and then instead
of this - write the capital F first and
instead of this - write a capital S so
this is the camel cased version of this
drink so similarly in angularjs we make
use of the camel casing instead of this
and when you make use of camel casing
you have to use dashes in HTML so to
make this directive available what you
have to type here is my first script now
right here what we have to do is we have
to simply return a template just like we
used to do in the routers so while
routing in angularjs I showed you that
we can make use of template then play it
and you can pretty much return anything
you want and it would be shown up on the
screen so similarly with here as well we
can do the same thing so if I do like
template hello world
and if I run the script on the browser
okay so we have a mismatch right here
never mind
so you see we get a hello world here
with this angularjs directive so so yeah
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial I will be covering a lot more
on custom directives in angularjs soon
so that's all for this and don't forget
to subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
