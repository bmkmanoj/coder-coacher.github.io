JavaScript tutorial in this tutorial
we'll be revising what we have done in
the last nine tutorials because from now
we'll be doing some bad boy JavaScript
coding which will require a lot of focus
and attention so before beginning with
that advanced JavaScript
I would like to revise whatever we have
done till now in the JavaScript in these
last nine tutorials okay
to start with firstly we learn to know
how to write a simple document or write
program to write hello world on document
then we learned how to transfer stop for
example if I write divided a world
I died right here hello world and I want
to change the text of this hello world
ID Dave then what will I do is document
dot get element by ID
in the world
okay supposingly I have to alert the
text of this and these are the following
methods we can use inner text then we
can create another day
then we have document dot query selector
they've you know text then we have
document dot query select
it selector all div then index of zero
we want first if there are only one Dave
and the document still we need the index
because it returns an array then we have
by day for document or we had elements
by tag name Dave zero dot in that X if
we try to console log all of these my
day
my DIF too
my tip 3
my live for
then what we see is
yes
as you can see every variable returns
the string had a world therefore these
are the four but not all methods to
treat text or edit text inside any
container if you want more information
on that go to my tutorial of
transversing the dom and you will get
much information there the next thing we
discuss about are the functions and
variable scopes using the keyword
function followed by a function name we
can create a set of code lock which we
can repeat multiple times by calling it
anywhere in the document when stands
when we call this then this code of
block runs once let's see
if I do document dot write one two three
and call this function down here then
we'll expect to see one two three here
well world is from the state
okay
the next thing is the variable school
let's say we created a variable if you
see 100 now this variable is global here
because this is in the scope of window
object let's say we do document dot
write ABC plus let's create another
variable here 200 now this variable it's
local to the function and it is not
available globally and therefore the
scope of this variable D EF is local to
this function now if we the document or
try to do ABC dot plus d EF then what
you'll see is 300 as usual because ABC
is global and DFS local but if we try to
alert all these variables obviously
you know what would happen is this would
return hundred but this would return
undefined and I hope you know why
hundred
and it should have thrown an error
because it's not defined yet okay so
this was about variable scope the next
thing we discussed is eros eros and
JavaScript are pretty much container
holders to hold multiple values at the
same time they are special kind of
objects in JavaScript for instance let's
create an array 1 2 3 4 5 there are many
other properties are discussed in the
tutorial area and objects you should
watch that if you want to know more
about these properties like sorting
arrays and pop and shift and unshift
what they are and how do you insert and
edit the values of array on the fly
instance if we want to sort this array
in the descending order what we'll do is
sort and will supply a function here
let's say
to sender let's create a function
let's return just a - B or B - a
let's give it power meters I'm just
going to love this
and as you can see this is turns the
console log of 0 1 4 5 4 3 2 &amp;amp; 1
okay so coming to the objects now in
JavaScript literally everything is
object will discuss objects in very
advanced way in the future tutorials I
promise that but for now let's learn
some basics of objects we have discussed
in the tutorial maybe eight or seven I
don't remember to create an object we do
our object the name of object and the
object literal now in JavaScript you
have basically two means to create an
object that is the object literal and
the constructor function now what does
construction for constructor function
means is I will discuss this in the
future tutorial because this is kind of
advanced but for now just remember that
constructor function is kind of
blueprint of what your object would be
for instance with the help of object
this kind of curly braces object we do
the property
is value method function it on X this is
a kind of you know blueprint I have
written here which means properties
value and method should return a
function value return something inside a
function so this is an object literal we
create objects like this or we use a
function as a base class to create an
object as I said I will discuss in this
in future tutorials because this is kind
of advanced and would take longer
tutorial duration for now just learn
that constructor functions are kind of
blueprint to your objects when stands
let's create another function my object
let's go
here wait this
X is equal to hundred they start wise
200 and this note said is equal to
function returned a star X star disk or
wine let's set some values here this dot
X 100 is 200 this dot Z is equal to this
dot X this Y good now if we do a console
log of check dot X then it would return
us the value hundred
let's see
okay and objects with object literals
you don't use the keyword this because
it's already in the scope of the
we're able
and moral worth
we use the collar actually to do this
let's try to add this keyword again see
what happens as you can see this is not
required in the object literal but yes
it is required in the constructor
function which we'll discuss in future
tutorials now if we do console.log X
then it returns us the value of this if
we do Y then we get 200 and if we do Z
then we get the function the function
gets written in the console.log but to
call this function as you know you need
to open two parentheses one open and one
closed and this would run the function
as you can see it returns to product for
two hundred and hundred now if we do
this with my object what you will get is
first of all we'll need to create a new
object from this base class
I will do is will to wire object is
equal to nu by object and then we are
good to go set the values what did you
return is hundred as he expected the
wire would return 200 and the Z would
return the product of these two
obviously you need to put parentheses
so this was a quick revision of what we
have learned in the last nine tutorials
if you want to know in detail what we
have done so far you're free to watch
the playlist I have organized all the
tutorials in a cool place you can hit my
channel and go to the playlist section
and watch the tutorials and from the
next tutorial we'll be going on to
really advanced level so stay focused
and stay cool and don't forget to
subscribe my channel to get latest
videos updates thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
