third Android application development
tutorial my name is mijo
and in this tutorial we are gonna
finally start Android studio for the
first time and see what it has got for
us now Android studio is an IDE
developed by Android over Google
actually because Google owns Android and
it runs on IntelliJ platform which
provides auto completion and all other
cool features so once you start your
Android studio you would probably see a
screen like this and what you have to do
is say start a new Android studio
project and you click on that now you
would come up with a screen like this
your team might be like team or duck
team mine one is dark but if you have
like light colors right now so don't
worry you could just change that to dark
only or to light only which I'm gonna
show you later on so first of all it
would ask you for your application name
which is obvious so you just have to
enter your application name so let's
just say this is my first application
now this is a company domain and you
could just probably enter your URL for
your website without any HTTP or
anything just like plain URL so let's
just say I'm gonna go down calm so this
package name is the name of the package
which would be available when your
application is you know just build into
an apk file so this is the one which
this is this name is the one which
Google Play Store makes use of when
people you know launch their
applications on the Play Store so if you
have ever visited Play Store from a
browser you would see that it's URL is
like calm place TOCOM slash the
play.google.com slash then this gone
toward something name so that's kind of
package name the name of your package
you could even edit it but for now I'm
just gonna leave it the default one then
this is the project location you could
just change it but still I'm gonna leave
with the C users may whole Android
studio projects and first application
this is the location on which we are
gonna work just click on next now the
second things are the phone and tablet
now all of these are the things you
could target but for now for this
tutorial purpose I'm just gonna go with
phone and tablet and we could take a
look at this Android variables TVs I
have no idea about this Android auto is
an Android glass later on so for phone
and tablet you can say that minimum SDK
now minimum SDK would be the SDK which
you certainly need for your application
to work like you know you have your
application has you know want some
access some certain access which are not
available on a certain mobile device so
for that you need to select your minimum
SDK and don't worry if you have no idea
what to select now let's just leave it
to API 19 you could always change that
in your application anytime you want to
you want at the build time or actually
just before the build time so it also
shows you the information that by
targeting API at 19 and literally your
app will run on approximately 73% of the
devices but it also shows you that lower
API levels target more devices but have
fewer features available so that's kinda
you know a greedy kill you if you go
greedy you kill your app if you don't go
greedy then you kill your app it's up to
you so just click on next
with Android API what we have is 19 for
now now there's next column which is add
an activity to Mumbai now this is
interesting as we're gonna discuss about
activities later on because activities
is a major part of Android applications
because later on you're gonna learn that
almost every application is made up of
activities only there's no sort of like
actively thing there's only you know the
activities are they're arranged in an
order from one place to another place
you could just go from one activity to
another activity using the links in the
activity itself or using special buttons
or menus so right now I'm gonna go with
empty activity and what it's gonna do is
it's gonna simply add a plain activity
to my android project you could go with
these activities as well but later on
because if you go like the navigation
drawer activity it's unnecessarily gonna
add a lot of code to your application
and as a first time user you've got a
struggle to learn a lot of things you
should learn so just go with empty
activity for now and it would be good to
go now the next thing is it's asked for
me for the activity name now this is
different from application name because
in an application I can have a lot of
other activities but this activity name
would be the main activity which is
launched when my application is started
so imagine it like this when you have a
fool then you start an application
alysus you start Facebook so the first
thing which appears when you freshly
install Facebook is the login screen so
that login screen can be referred as the
mail activity which is the first
activity which you will see if you start
their application so I'm gonna leave
activity name as main activity only you
could just name it anything just keep
the layout name as activity mentally
then this generate layout file should be
tagged so that it just simply generates
the layout file for your activity and
then just click on finish now it would
just create a project for awhile so it
says that it's creating for phone and
tablet that means your application would
be compatible with phone as well as one
tablet so it's just building your first
application and Gradle is the build
system in case you are wondering what
this is so just give it a few seconds
and once it's done
we're gonna continue so here we are but
it's still not done because down here
you can see that there's some sort of
progress going on right here as well
executing tasks Gradle is building so
just wait for it so that things go
smooth later on and as you can see all
the statuses and all that stuff is gone
so now we are just left with pure code
and our imagination so we do have two
tabs open by default and this looks
interesting this has some sort of GUI
application you could just organize
these things then we have a phone here
so let's close this for now and inside
text you could see that we have XML
filled right here and we're gonna
discuss about all that later on
so this is our device you can see you
can just switch to any other device you
want to and these are all other devices
available for us for now and you could
just select your app team as well from
clicking here there are tons of options
you could just say this is black or
black title no bar and then you will see
that it kind of looks more like an
application instead of just plain raw
text and then you could just say that
there's some other device and you do
have tablets in here as well I guess
and you could just pretty much play
around with this interface and from the
next tutorial onwards we're gonna learn
how to actually create applications with
the help of XML and this Java and
probably learn all of the stuff which we
have in here and how to make use of them
properly so that's all for the story of
pretty much and if you liked it then
