hole and welcome to your sixth angular
tutorial angular 2 tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be looking at something
called as evens in angular 2 well evens
are we are very much familiar with them
we have used them a lot in JavaScript
and in angular 1 as well and those are
pretty much like how you make use of the
click event or you know any other
regular JavaScript even like
double-click or Mouse down mouse keydown
keyup mouse move and all that events so
if I just hop over inside this template
and change this a little bit let's just
say this is a button simply say is that
either
h1 for that I don't know so here we go
and if I look here is the big button
well actually I have zoom the page you
can see that anyways now how to assign
an event to an element well there's a
bit of syntax change in angular 1 what
we make use of is that ng click and the
function name here but in angular 2
there's nothing such like so in angular
2 what we make use of is the parentheses
and inside this is the even name which
actually is the name of ng star here
whatever even we used to write here so
if it is ng click then inside
parentheses this is click ng
double-click then this is double-click
and so on so what this ng click means
that we are actually registering for a
click event we want something to happen
when this button is clicked and what is
the function name here so this would be
less to say mouse clicked me and this
function right here where it would be
coded well
you could probably guess it by now that
will be coding dysfunction inside this
because like in the last tutorial we
just wrote an expression here and the
value was coded here for this expression
similarly for this function we will be
writing this function right here so this
is the function and we don't need a
function right here you know because we
are working in a class and again I can
just simply do like a lot
I was clicked something like that
and if I pop a word to this webpage
again click it you can see that I got
the alert I was clicked again again
similarly you can kind of make a counter
out of it by saying that I was clicked x
times you could just update this this x
0 or you can just do x equals 0 anyways
it's good and this dot x plus plus 1 2 3
4 like that so as you can see now that
it just increments it well you can make
use of the double-click as well
so that it increments on double-click so
if i just simply click it it doesn't
update a simple click doesn't update it
but a double click would updated you can
see i have to press it a bit faster the
both clicks so like you can make use of
the mouse move as well and you see just
runs like crazy because every time my
mouse moves from one pixel to another
this counter increments only on this
button so yeah so you can just pretty
much make use of any
right here and yeah so that's how you
work with events in angular2 and you can
just go ahead and try out any other
event but make sure you enclose the
event in these parentheses and yeah
before just closing down this video if I
just show you what this event is then
that would be good so if i just
console.log this event let's just change
it click again so I just reload this
click you see this is Mouse event and it
contains a whole lot of properties like
your type click off set your page X page
where position then if the even was
bubbled or not client X which is used to
get the position of the mouse then we
have a bunch of stuff as well so you can
you know just probably access all of the
properties of this element right there
so yeah it has a target as well so if I
do like even the target then you have
virtually the access to this button
actually so you can just get all of the
attributes or the HTML or whatever that
was associated with this button so yeah
so that's how events work in angular 2
and that's all for this tutorial and if
