your 32nd HTML and CSS tutorial in which
we'll be discussing about external
internal and inline style sheets in HTML
so I guess I have told you about inline
style sheets previously but if not then
no harm because I would be doing it
right now so let's say I have a PITA
right here and it has hello world so one
way of styling this PETA right here is
like style and doing like a color black
or basically blackest by default so I'll
just do color red and let's reload this
and I'm lazy enough to change the title
so we got hello world in red color but
let's say I just want apply this color
red specifically to this piece so I know
we got some methods to do that in the
styler right here like B ends child 1
but to make things simple right right
now for now I just show you how you can
apply Styles some Styles directly to the
elements so to do that
right your element name and press the
spacebar
and write the attribute style and inside
the double quotes just paste your
property and value now you must notice
here you have noticed here that we are
not using any Collie braces or the
element name because already the HTML
and the CSS knows that we are applying
this style attribute and a specific
element
and these styles would be applied only
to the contents of this particular
element on which we are applying this
style attribute so even if we do like
this the results would be same so this
thing right here is officially known as
inline style sheets now inline means
that we are actually doing Styles in
line in one line so this is referred as
inline Styles so it could be like pretty
much complicated if you do inline style
sheets for example let's see if I have a
thousand of P tags on my website and I
all I want all of them to have color red
background black opacity 0.5 and let's
say box shadow of 10 pixel black so
we'll have a lot of a bunch of lock tag
for that a lot of text for that and your
file and your document would eventually
become heavier so in that case we can
use this internal stylesheet now
internal stylesheet refers to whatever
you write inside this style tag the
opening style tag and the closing style
tag so you have to remember that style
is a tag as well and an attribute as
well for every element so with internal
style sheets you could place your Styles
inside a opening style tag and a closing
style tag but what if you have a
thousand elements on your website Alice
say you have to create styles for
individually for every element like this
and
inside this they all have a lot of
properties and values as well so this
would create a kind of messy this will
appear like a fuss so to avoid this we
have what we call as external
stylesheets now external stylesheets are
pretty much like giving a reference to a
stylesheet
outside this document and telling the
document to load that stylesheet and
apply all these styles to the door we
have so to include external stylesheet
what you need to do is let's remove
these style tags type a tag with the
name as link give it a space the
attribute href the same one as we used
with the a links and Link at R if your
style but CSS now make sure to end your
file with CSS because CSS stands for
cascading style sheet which is the
official name official abbreviation the
expansion of abbreviation of CSS and CSS
actually refers to all the styling you
do so CSS stands for cascading style
sheets and in the edge stress you give
the path to your style sheet a link at
shrift CSS style of CSS type
text/css now this text/css
would actually tell the browser that
define your including is a CSS file so
it would interpret it as a txt one and
the CSS one now we have another
attribute inside this link tag to denote
that we are actually including his
timesheets and that is rel now rel
basically defines a relationship with
this element so the relationship of this
file with this document is that it's a
stylesheet so link rel stylesheet' href
style dot CSS and type is text CSS so
that's how you pretty much include a
external stylesheet to your document and
as you can see right now i don't have
any external stylesheet name the style
of CSS so let's go ahead and create one
so i'll just type ctrl + n to create a
new file and i'll just give it a space
i'll save it as style dot CSS in the
dialog box make sure to save it the same
name you have given in the link tag so
let's save it and we have got our style
dot CSS file right here and as you can
see sublime already changed it XR icon
to css3 one so
let's do some things with this external
stylesheet and one thing you need to
notice we don't write any HTML inside
the CSS one because the browser already
knows that when you are including a
stylesheet then it should directly
styles start with the Styles actually
and directly end with the styles and
noting HTML no fuss so let's say a your
body a background or black so that's how
you write a a string of this and that's
how you write a external stylesheet in
your document so once I remove this link
right here then this page has no idea
where to locate this time file but once
I add this then it knows that load all
the styles from this file and apply them
to this document so I hope the
difference is clear between external
internal and inline style sheets and
that's all for this tutorial I'll see
you there next time don't forget to
