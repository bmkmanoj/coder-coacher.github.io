Google Chrome extension development
tutorial and third in the series a mini
kind of series of our own extension
Twitter social toolkit development so in
the last tutorial we learned about how
to create our own context menus on the
based of selection of user here we have
and to alert a message now let's create
this application a little bit dynamic
let's apply this function with the
parameters selected text
and let's alert
selected pegs Dodd
selection
next
now what it does is it would alert
detects the user has selected so let's
see it in action let's reload this
application and here we go now select
something right click click on this and
bingo we have the set the selection
which the user has selected so let's
click at this we get the whole sentence
now using this we could pass this text
to the Twitter handle and we could do
something like this I'll show you now in
Twitter we have I guess we do have yeah
so we have share text is equal to LC
let's see
if you load this page then Twitter would
automatically fill this text into a text
box for you where we supply this ABC
parameter so let's remove this I let's
copy this URL let's say chrome thought
to have start create CR EA te URL should
be text and we would receive the text
star Alex selection from the user so
here we go just comment out the flight
let's see if it works I reload this
white flag click on this
and Bank we got our selected decks
inside the box the box of the user we
could manipulate this a little bit to
make it a user friendly for Twitter to
handle by encoding this text into HTML
entities or like that for the parser of
Twitter to work perfectly so now using
this API we were able to select this
text and on clicking this we were able
to share this on Twitter so in the next
tutorial we will be discussing about how
can we differentiate between a text
selection and a normal page or right
click page on the link right click on
all that stuff so stay tuned with me and
don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
