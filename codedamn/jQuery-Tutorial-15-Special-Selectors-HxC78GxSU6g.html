your 15th jQuery tutorial in which we'll
be discussing about some special
selectors in jQuery now basically in
this tutorial we'll be not learning
about jQuery but kind of CSS selectors
some special CSS selectors which you
could use in jQuery as well so in the
last tutorials we have been using just
simple CSS selectors like ID then we are
using a class and then we are using a
element selector so sounds pretty simple
isn't it but we have some more bad boys
selectors which are kind of some
wildcard selectors could be used for
selecting a wide range of elements not
just typing a hell lot of code for just
selecting some elements so first of all
I would like to start with let's say I
have an element here MC
the b d EF thus suppose i want to apply
a event handler or kind of an action to
both of these so instead of doing like
this dot something and this not
something what can i do is i would just
remove the one i will just place both of
these together and would separate them
with a comma just like you do in a CSS
file so what would happen is jquery
would select both of these and would
apply this even method or whatever you
call down here to both of these so this
was about first now the next thing we
have is the wild card now
this white card basically is a star now
this star down here means that apply
something this event to every element in
the document so let me show you an
example
let's console.log this let's see what
happens here we have our browser down
here so let's check out the console
and we get nine elements so what they
are HTML head meta title script two
scripts the one is che query one here
you go the one is jQuery and the second
is our own script then we have body do a
TV context document which contains the
properties that we have learned then we
have some jQuery basically JavaScript
objects and methods links linked in the
prototype chain then we have selected
and we have prototype chain so the
basically now star applies to every
selector and if we do like star dot CSS
that's the background and that's a
yellow now what would happen is we'll
refresh this in the drum section when we
see then HTML is applied barren yellow
head is applied yellow body is applied
yellow then we have a applied yellow be
applied yellow
and all the way to all the elements the
reason this was not applied because this
is inserted by some of those extension
down here as I told you in the previous
tutorial so don't worry about the style
tag this is nothing but some lot of code
inserted by some of the extensions in my
Chrome browser okay so the next thing we
have is a contained selector know what
that means is for example we have class
but if then I have class
Madoff so these two have same classes
but let's say I have a sentence I am
coding in jQuery I love JavaScript so
let's suppose I want to edit the
sentence which has the word jQuery so
what I'll do is I'll go to my jQuery
file alright dot my Dave
let's say okay we have my data as the
class and will allow write a comment and
contains bracket and will supply the
word we want to check for let's say
Jerry now we are targeting only the
staff because this def contains jQuery
if I create a copy of this then will
target both of these no matter if I
change the order of the sentence or
change the contents but the world jacory
should be present let's we have already
applied the sides so let's refresh this
page and I guess you can see that the
first two are highlighted because they
are having the world jQuery and then the
last one is not highlighted though
having the same class because it doesn't
contain any more chicken
so moving real quick let's get to the
next special selector and
we have it's great a link
some external side that calm
external site let's say it create an
internal link apart
index traditionally so
now we have external links as this one
and internal links starting from a part
so supposingly i want to target every
external link in my document with the
help of jquery selector so what I'll do
is I'll go ahead and would write a which
is a tag name and then I would write H
ref okay so lets me explain the
attribute selector first inside of this
so let's say I have some span tags
assist are close span open stand close
span and let's say I give data expert
said some tasks so suppose I want to
select only the status so since this
data Express that is a custom attribute
therefore we don't have any daughter
hash to select this path so what I'll do
is down here I would type span dot and
I'll copy this attribute down here and
would write it in a angular brackets so
what would happen is it would locate
this span tag and it will search for
this attribute down here for inside any
span tag
and once it encountered that and we'll
just gone to lock this so here we go now
let's write something inside this
anything would go let's reload this and
here you go
we get only this band of these Santa's
detectors and then let's write in this
for the verification
and as you can see we don't get any
content except this data XYZ attribute
so have here's how you target attributes
with the your elements so coming back to
the stuff we were talking about we have
this link down here which is one is
external and the second one is internal
so let's target the external links let's
see how we do that down here let's first
of all target the element down here this
great H ref equals
let's say HTTP now what would happen is
it would target every link which is only
HTTP so basically then the selector down
here would target this link but it
completely makes no sense we don't want
this so what we want is any link
starting with HTTP should be targeted
and to do that we use the symbol which
is above 6 on your own number on your
keyboard so just hold shift and press 6
on your keyboard hopefully and you'll
get this kind of up arrow and this means
that select every a link having a chip
attribute and starting with HTTP so what
it would do is it would select every
external link in your site I would
ignore all the other links so let's say
dot will use dot CSS
background black and color white
so it would change all the external
links to black background and white
color as you can see external sites are
change to background node internal are
unaffected so let's change it to some
other URL let's say Kindle
let's say Google and so on then it will
return us black background and white
plain color for external websites so
that's how you use the HF and the up
arrow and the selector and basically you
could do this for anything for any
attribute you want for example if I
create a spand plus my own class 1 2 3
and ABCD and span class my own 4 3 5 or
whatever you want
alright TEF so what would happen is
let's use this I'll write class and I'll
do the same thing but I'm using to check
every class inside the span tag which
starts with my own keyword so we have 1
&amp;amp; 2 which starts with own keyword so it
will target both of these
so let's refresh this I'll see what
happens how we get both of these has
blocked though they don't have anything
common between them okay so next thing
we have just like the symbol down here
on the ship on the six number is used to
target anything starting with we have
the dollar sign which is used to target
anything ending with so by this what I
mean is let's say I have ABC and I have
done here ABC so I'll do ABC now what
would happen is it target all the
classes inside the span tag ending with
ABC it doesn't care about what is
understanding what it just means is it
would target only the classes having ABC
had their extreme end so let's refresh
this are as the same result we get the
same thing down here so this could be
useful for example
if you create a bunch of images at your
site let's say my jpg image dot jpg for
example you create my PNG for PNG and
suppose you want to target only the jpg
image is I want to do something with
these JPG images so what you'll do is
we'll do my IMG SRC as we have
associated out there and what we'll do
is we'll you lose a dollar sign and
we'll type jpg and rather a torch APG so
this will insure us that we are
targeting all the JPEG images so let's
try to reload this and since they may
just don't exit but you can see that
this jpg browser
this image is turned into a black
background so that's how you target the
last of the string and that's
how you target the initial beginning of
a string so okay so the last thing I
would like to discuss with you is the
not selector no but not what I mean is
let's say let's say I have a div of ID
ABCD anything that go hello world and I
have an ID but let's just make classes
class
hello world again so let's target this
div and suppose I want to select let's
say I have another death in a world tree
and so on
I've got deaths down here so I want to
target all these tips except this ABCD
class having the death during the class
as ABCD so how we'll do is we'll do this
not inside this our classroom or our ID
name if you wish to and then we'll just
use the normal jQuery methods that use
color red so what it's doing is it's
targeting every Dave not having the
class ABCD so basically we are targeting
every Dave except this which has the
class ABCD so let's reload the same
browser and as you can see every Dave
not having the class ABCD is converted
or basically has been applied the CSS
color red so these were some of the
special selectors I would have liked to
discuss with you now when you know these
selectors go ahead and do some your own
codes with these selectors and andhaka
new tutorials will discuss more about
these selectors and would learn more
about such even methods so that's all
for this tutorial I'll see you next time
