Mei hole and welcome to your 12th
angular 6 tutorial in which we're gonna
take a look at how to make HTTP requests
with your angular component or with your
angular services and let's get started
alright so in this tutorial we're gonna
discuss about something known as HTTP
client module in angular with which we
can make requests with the angular
application right so what does HTTP
client is how do actually make HTTP
requests using a service because that's
an appropriate way as angular suggests
and getting response back is also a task
a little bit of task here and angular
and then we would see how to actually
cast that response so that you actually
get you can actually access values you
want to would come to that and something
about rxjs
as well so let's start ok so starting
with importing the HTTP client how do we
do that well to do that what we're gonna
do is go to our module file and right
here we're gonna import our HTTP client
module which would be HTTP client
come on tool from angular common and
HTTP there we have it so this client
module as I said what you will should go
into imports would go right here and
then what we have is that now we can
inject this particular module as a
dependency in our service so let's just
quit or actually you already have a
service record service here so we're
going to make use of that service only
so if is take a look at record not
serviced RTS right here you can see so
what we can do is now we are injecting a
service inside injecting a module inside
this service so when I import this again
HTTP right there
and this injectable decorator I guess I
miss that in the last tutorial what it
does is that this tells angular that
this service can also have some
injectables in it so we need that
decorative right there so I'm gonna do a
private inject of HTTP and let's just
call this HTTP client because that's
what it is and now we can access this
dot HTTP wire this dot HTTP right I mean
the HTTP client wire this dot h t DB
okay so how do we actually get the how
do we actually make a JSON request so
first of all let me just get it out of
the way and what I'm gonna do is let's
just say I go here and what I do is I
also say create a test directory here
taste like go inside that and what I'm
gonna do this is touch file dot JSON
file here and I can just paste this data
which I have right here let's just
put a curly brace with a key-value here
or let's say my object something like
this so that we can make a well JSON out
of it
and that should be good now what we can
do is you want a very simple one two
three fours over here so now it is
serving our JSON file right here now if
we take a look at the intro we can see
one two three four right here and data
or what we have file dot JSON right you
can see that we get our data so we are
getting some error
expected string so let's just fix that
first
you
you
okay so we have to put that actually in
key value pairs encrypted and coded as a
string so let's just do that really
quick
finally so right here
what we can do instead is select all of
these right here
and actually these records are
duplicated right so we can just go with
these two are these for me
oops
we have problem but anyways so that is
it or we can just get rid of these
because right here and what we can do is
replace these with this
and there we are so let's just keep it
with these only and now we have a valid
JSON at our hands and and now what we
have is localhost 1 2 3 4 hit enter and
now if we take a look you can see that
we get a valid JSON out of it
cool all right now what we want is that
we want to fetch this thing and get some
data out of it so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say this dot HTTP dot get and
then I'm gonna pass in or are we really
writing HTTP dot kid and I'm gonna pass
in the URL so the URL is HTTP localhost
1 2 3 4 then what we have is data dot or
file of JSON right and once we had this
thing what I want is actually subscribe
to this thing now what does this mean
well this is the subscription is
operator of rxjs which is reactive
JavaScript and what this is is that it's
it's just a way to handle asynchronous
tasks so rxjs takes a completely
different approach from whatever you
have tried or used earlier if you
haven't used rx yes obviously because
the rxjs is based on a pipeline model
so for rxjs an asynchronous request can
be thought of as a pipe where your
endpoint would emit certain events every
time and you can subscribe to them right
so in this case we have the event when
this HTTP module will return us some
data and you're subscribing to it so
that's pretty much it you need to know
right now or rxjs but we're gonna
discuss that later on in depth if we get
some time so yeah so we have the
SUBSCRIBE will get in return is the data
so what I'm going to do is pretty much
just console log because
right here okay so we are here and now
in our app component we are injecting
the service and we're getting the
records right here so let's just see how
this looks like in the browser so I'm
going to go back
and I'm gonna go back one more time
inspect the element go to console so
what we have in here is our okay you
know access control all ours in just a
minute okay so to fix this what we can
do quickly is actually let's just see
what we have
you can change the file name to file dot
PHP and if you open this in to be a
score only so we can do is actually say
header access control allow origin the
value of star and we should be good to
go
right add one more time what we can do
we can say is content type application
JSON here to send a JSON response and
there we are
a unexpected hitter
you
right so now if we do the HBS localhost
1 2 3 4 hit enter reload the app
you
how it is oh we have not updated the app
so we're gonna change this from file dot
JSON to file dot PHP it's safe
and
there we are so we have this object
which contains information about our
records right but there's a problem
let's see if we do data obj what happens
if I reload this now
okay so this is not really a problem it
gives us the objects but what we can do
instead is that we can actually create
an interface out of this thing you can
see that the linter gives us an error
that property object does not exist on
type of check because that's not really
a way to do this now to do this actually
what you have to do is create an
interface which specifies what kind of
response you are expecting so what we
can do here instead is we can create a
kind of interface here interface and
let's just say my data we just say is
object is a type of object right and now
I can do something like HTTP dot get and
I want I am expecting the kind of data
to be returned as object which contains
object right now this is a simple one so
now if you take a look in the browser
you can see that we got the response
correctly all right
now what I want to do is actually give
this data back now how do we get this
data back to our component so what we
can do is instead of subscribing here I
can actually subscribe right here right
now if we save this thing and actually
we would need to actually change this
from here to our component file here
and now if you take a look at the
browser
you can see that we still get the same
response now what do I want is I want to
actually update this dot records this
dot the chords is data dot obj and we
are good to go now so that we can sit
back and relax and see that it populates
our data with the information so we get
an error here but we get to kind of find
it differ so putting object of type
object ng for all these opposed binding
to I tribals such as arrays okay
so what we are missing here is that our
records was an object initially said
three was an error but now it should be
fine yeah so that is pretty much how you
perform an HTTP request in angular and
trust me you're gonna do this all the
time when you're creating an application
because you cannot obviously offload
everything to client side at once you
need to it perform HTTP requests again
and again so yeah that's pretty much it
how you perform HTTP requests and that's
all for this tutorial
and I'll see you then in the next one
with some really awesome stuff again
with angular 6 and one more thing if you
