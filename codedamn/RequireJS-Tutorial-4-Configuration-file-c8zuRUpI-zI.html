hole and welcome to the fourth required
GS tutorial in which I'll be showing you
how to program configuration file in
require.js
so here's our configuration file and as
I told you that this file would be the
base file for your required use
application and all of the instructions
you want to send to requires library can
be found here so to start with just
write require.js config and all of that
stuff comes up from this library as you
can see same key word we are making use
of here so requires your config and the
next thing I want to do is I want to
write a base URL because obviously I
won't like every JavaScript when I want
to load them to have like URL like this
public HTML HTML
ww or whatever lalala whatever it is so
you provide a base URL once and then all
of your JavaScript would make use of
base URL first and then their path
supplied so for now as you can see
inside the J's folder I'm making use of
these 1 2 3 4 5 JavaScript files so I'll
just write the J's here because that is
the base URL directory which I'm going
to use for example if I had GS libraries
new then I'll make use of something like
this just libraries new and like that so
for now I'll just make use of the GS and
the next thing I'm to do is I want to
set up what libraries I'm going to use
or what scripts I'm going to use with
this required years so with the use of
the paths I can make use of that and
then right first of all let's just write
angular and this angular is the name
which will be making use of in define in
require J's which we'll be taking a look
later so for now let's just write
angular as
angular dot min Dutchess would you have
the next XCore Xcode chess then we have
jQuery jQuery dot MnDOT cheers and you
know you get the idea that how this is
working
mootools document or chess and if I
hadn't write this base URL as chairs
what I have to do is how to write every
single file something like this but by
default since I have written this as GS
as the base URL I don't need to write
anything except that you are just making
use of this same directory that I'm just
telling that require just just make use
of this directory and you will file all
of these files here and one thing I have
done wrong here is that I guess I have
put this these J's extensions so if you
remember that I told you that you don't
need to worry about these J's extensions
because require.js would automatically
consider all of these as JavaScript
files so just omit those if you have put
them by mistake so the next we have got
is SWF unchecked and for that SWF object
and nodejs
so yeah so that's pretty much it for our
files and so one thing I want to tell
you more is that you can make use of a
CDN as well inside your path so let's
say I want to have a CDN for this jQuery
so I'll put this in an array and what
I'll do is I'll first of all here load
the jQuery CDN and
let's just make use of the angular CDN
instead just just get rid of that and
making you the angular CDN would be
something like that
and again just get rid of this chairs
yeah in the absolute URLs as well so you
know required GS will just take care of
that so what happens now is that angular
since it is being fetched from two
resources
require would first of all fetch the
first resource that is the CDN URL and
it in some cases it fails to load your
angularjs from this page like you're you
know just the computer of the user has
some dns settings or the ISP has blocked
some URLs or whatever the reason is or
maybe Google is down well whatever
then it would load the second which is
the local copy of your angular file and
you can just have a more another URL
right here which is another CDN and then
you can write your file name or you can
have a lot of Syrians so you know that
would work as well so for now I'm just
making use of this angular dot min or
Jas nodejs and yeah so that's pretty
much it for our configuration file for
now let's get back to our for dot HTML
and then what I want to do is I have
access to all of these libraries now in
my code and obviously they are not
loaded at all by now so I'm just going
to create another script here let's just
say folder custom scripts and inside
here I want to create a file which would
be a let's just say jQuery file dot GS
inside here I want to make use of the
jQuery file so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to write custom scripts
and
jQuery file now notice that after I have
loaded this config the GS the base URL
is automatically J's so I don't need to
add another J's
slash custom scripts jQuery file this
would work only because we are already
inside this J's folder so if I reload
this page for one for required keyword
what was that okay so I guess I had this
left out so as you can see that we have
four files loaded right here the first
one is the document then this requires
es which is manually hooked up a power
by us then this configuration file which
is called
here or here wherever you like to say
then we have this jQuery file which is
called upon here so yeah so yeah so this
file is currently empty now right now
and whatever I want to use jQuery in
here so to make use of that I'll be
demonstrating that how to make use of
jQuery because it's not just simple as
that because as you can see jQuery is
still not loaded here do we have that
ready in our configuration file so how
do we make use of that so we'll be
looking at that in the next tutorial and
that's all for this one and if you like
