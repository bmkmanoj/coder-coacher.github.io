my name is mijo and welcome to your
twelfth mongodb tutorial in which I'm
gonna show you what post Mahdi no not
post actually what push modifier is and
what this modified does is that it adds
an array to your document and if it does
not exist obviously and if it does exist
then it adds the elements associated
with that to the last of it
well let's just see that in action so
I'm just gonna say that this is DB dot
new collection dot add actually insert
you know dad and this will be named mijo
right so I build this see that's a DVD
collection dot like that and then what I
want to do is say DV dot new collection
dot to update right and the criteria is
that name is mijo
and once that's done what happens is
that I want to add another array field
right so what I'm gonna do is make use
of this push and now what I'm gonna say
is that this would be foods I like and
this would contain things like favorite
food as pizza right and not so favorite
what should I write there let's just
write something like that alright so now
this would be appended as an array right
so if I
this thing and inside my terminal or
shell you can see that it is actually an
array a sort of and this is an object
and whatever you do now with this thing
push and then this one it would be
appended to this array right so if I
exchange it to like wow this then I say
true and the builders build this one as
well you can see that this thing is
appended to this array right it's not
prepended it's appended it's at the last
not at the first right so well why the
heck is that
is it useful then well you can actually
make use of this to kind of create your
own you know what you call that as a set
right set a set is sort of something
which would you know not add a value if
it already exists in the array like it
would not actually give you an error but
it would just ignore that if it already
exists for example like you need to add
an e modifier as well with this like if
I add something like an E and let me
just get rid of these quotes get them in
quotes and say here Meho right so now
what's happening that is it's just
looking for me hole and then if it's
present then food won't are if it isn't
then it would so if i now build this and
run it right here you can see that this
object already did exist so it is not
added again right but if i get rid of
this thing right so if i just simply
write me hook and do this
you can see that it's added two times
now right so that's that's a kind of you
know you can say an application like you
can just pass in something like that and
it kind of saves your day you don't have
to do a lot of stuff because Mongo would
just take care of all the duplicates so
that is how pretty much you make use of
the push and you can actually just make
use of something known as add to set as
well which we'll just take a look later
on but for now I guess push is something
clear and yeah so that is all for this
tutorial and if you like that then don't
forget subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one
