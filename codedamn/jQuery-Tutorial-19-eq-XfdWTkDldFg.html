your 19th jQuery tutorial before
starting this tutorial let me tell you
an incident which happened with me today
and a couple of days back I broke out my
mic microphone which I used to record
these tutorials and I went online to the
site flickr.com
it is our Indian site for ordering
products online various kinds of
products so I ordered a Lenovo a headset
I guess it was like
b15 9 modeled something like that but it
was really poor looking and cool and the
specs were also good so I ordered that
Mike the guy delivered in no time he was
at my doorstep maybe in a day or so
maybe less so I was very impressed by
the service and when I opened the Mike
it looked good to me I plugged in I
shooted a couple of tutorials and when I
tried to run these tutorials in will see
media player on my computer and what I
saw you will not believe that there was
no single voice my voice was then
recorded and I checked if I either plug
the switches wrong into the CPU but all
was good and I performed some tests
- records and found that there was a lot
of humming noise and background noise in
this microphone and it was just a piece
of crap so basically I literally wasted
my $30.00 on this microphone
so I picked up picked up my screwdriver
post madam my previous microphone and
here I have this lecture ready with this
working old my favorite microphone and I
hope that it is recording this audio
right now because of it if it isn't and
you guys are never gonna see this video
so coming back to the tutorial we have
the EQ selector in this 19 tutorial and
what this does is it would allow you to
specify a index number to select
elements from for example let's create a
list alive item 1
I turn to
and item 3 so here we have a list with 3
atoms and another list and down in the
script what I want to do is I want to
modify this first item so how will I do
this traditionally would we would apply
some ID or class and access it which
agree but suppose you are fetched this
data from another side and you cannot
modify this directly and you want to
select this li first li and want to do
something with it so in traditional
JavaScript to be fancy in valina
JavaScript we do document or get
elements by tag name Li and it would
return us all these allies in the
document and we'll use an index number 0
front stance to select the first one and
then we'll do the methods or properties
you want to do so in jQuery what we'll
do is first of all using jQuery selector
and the constructor function will select
LS now we have all the elements all the
allies in this
let's say in this variable and I want to
select D for Stella so traditionally you
would think that will do something like
this but this won't actually work with
jQuery because of a standard and how it
works so what we have to do is we have
to use a special event method called EQ
now EQ would act like a like equals now
it would say if Ally equals the index
which we would supply in the parenthesis
as an argument and then it would perform
some functions whichever we supplied to
that so let's say zero now we have
selected Li which equals to zero at
index which is the first Ally that is
item one right now so let's say let's
get it text
so let's alert X now
let's launch it in our browser down here
so five nineteenth so
there you go let's reload this again as
you can see we can item one as a result
now what if I remove this what would
happen then so now this Li is punch of
all tags all allies on the document so
what would happen is this is a kind of
object return or object of Ares return
and jQuery would combine all the text
that is one two three and would alert
out X so let's see what happens reload
and as expected
jQuery combines these three and alerts
out them in the variable X so this was a
tutorial on using EQ you can use this
not only with elements but also with
classes and other attributes you like to
have and that's what you do EQ in jQuery
