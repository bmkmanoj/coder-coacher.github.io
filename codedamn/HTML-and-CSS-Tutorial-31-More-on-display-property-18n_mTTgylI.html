HTML and CSS tutorial in which we'll be
looking at more on the display property
the display CSS property which we
learned which you basically started in
the last tutorial so let's have a look
so first of all let's go to span tag and
let's say I am a line one another span I
am in line and let's say a div
and locked so when I reload this on the
document then I got these two in one
line as separate elements but this one
in a separate line and from now onwards
I'll be making use of this inspect
element and if you don't know what this
inspect element is let me tell you that
this inspect element is a very handy
tool
just in case when you are trying to edit
or make some changes on the live site
when you can just go and edit the file
every time and load it to your server
because that would eat a hell out of
your time and basically using this
inspect element you could pretty much
add some your own JavaScript we would
not be discussing about this console in
this tutorial and the series actually
you can go ahead to my JavaScript one
but with the console we can actually
edit the HTML apply some CSS events the
effects we want to have in the CSS which
you would be learning in future
tutorials but in this tutorial let's
have a look how can we use this inspect
element a little bit so I have a span
element and let's say I want to make it
a block 1 so I'll go ahead and click on
this little plus right here you can see
my mouse is on that + and once I click
this I get the span automatically
inserted and said the inspector style
sheet now this inspector style sheet is
a dynamic style sheet located inside the
chrome URLs and it's the style sheet is
only available to you while you are
editing this page so once you refresh
this this inspector style sheet is lost
just to span I'll ride the property name
and it would try to order Phil for you
because it already know the set commands
the set properties and the values for
CSS so now you see when I hover over
this then you see this blue pattern all
over which signifies the width of the
particular element and when I hover over
this then also we get the full width
because ban applies to all the spans in
the document and this div is obviously
full so once I remove this will get the
fixed width which is the width of only
the content as the container with as
well but once I check this property to
make sure to enable this property I get
the full width of the container so in
display if you see we have got a bunch
of a lot of properties which are
replicate box inline box block compact
flexgrid inherit initial inline inline
block and line flex grade table and all
that stuff so the most important I think
you should know our table row table
column table self table
none
inline-block inline and block obviously
and all these so i want you to know
about first of all the inline block so
inline block so let's say i have only
one span on the document and I removed
one span by clicking over the span and
pressing the Delete key on my keyboard
just in case you missed that so I have
only one span on the document so with
the help of display:inline-block what
you do is let's say if I have display
inline which is by default the browser
style sheet applied to the span element
so the span is right now inline block so
let's say I apply a padding off 10 pixel
do it so what you'll see is this padding
is applied but this is not basically
followed by this tip down right here so
why is this soap when I click on display
block inline block sorry then
this padding becomes basically this stay
right here down here notices the span
and would arrange its position
accordingly
when we were using the display:inline
which was the default and the bearing
was not applying on top and bottom as
well so what is the reason let me tell
you so in line elements basically would
you can say kind of apply your padding's
and merchants actually margins as well
to top to top and bottom but the other
elements won't respect that so basically
what does that mean is what I'm giving
display:inline right here then these
margins you see the green one the green
one right here is the padding which is
visible to you and the oranges shade one
here is the margin one so inline
elements won't apply your padding and
margins on your top and bottom but
obviously they would follow left and
right and this is because of CSS boxing
model which we'll be discussing in a
couple of tutorials after this so the
next thing we have for inline is you
cannot actually set width and height on
inline elements so let's say I have
displayed inline and I say width
500 pixels and once I hover over this
you see that it's still something like
eighty one point zero nine three eight
pixels but I had actually applied a
width of 500 pixels to it so why the
heck it didn't change it with so that's
the basic difference between aligned and
inline block elements so the things you
have to remember is inline would follow
the left and right margin and padding
but would not follow the top and bottom
margin and padding and align elements
you cannot set width and height to them
so if I say width and height 500 pixels
so this should be technically a square
of 500 by 500 but it's not following
width and height because it's set to
inline and by default also the span tag
is in line and your inline blocks would
actually respect the padding and margin
on the top and bottom as well and so the
height and width so once I change it to
inline block then you'll see that we
have got some changes right here and
once I hover over this we get five 20 by
5 20 because 10 pixel buttons - 10
pixels are for margin and padding you
see so we have a box of 525 525 once I
remove this we get our usual box with
little width and which is non flexible
so most of the cases most of in cases we
make use of inline block but it will
actually depend on the demand what the
situation is and which we have to use so
that's pretty much about the difference
between inline and inline block and
before closing this tutorial let me show
you another display property which is
none and none it's very much like
display nothing so whatever you do right
here would not basically actually the
element is not visible so there's no use
of all these properties so display:none
would technically theoretically would
remove the element from the Dom tree it
would make like the element is actually
not in the Dom tree at all
so display:none said to disband or
deleting the span is one and the same
thing except I guess in JavaScript
libraries you can actually in some way
access the display:none properties of
elements as well so that's all about
display property in the stu toriel and
we learnt about display inline
display:inline-block display:inline and
display block so I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial and to summarize again a little
bit so it is like that display block
would follow your margins and padding's
on the top bottom left right and with a
line break so you could not have
elements placed right or left to
display:block display:inline-block
padding:0 damn about top and bottom
margins and padding's and with
display:inline-block the
display:inline-block
acts like display:inline but would
follow width and height and padding's
and margins in all four directions so
that's all about this tutorial and I'll
see you the next time don't forget to
