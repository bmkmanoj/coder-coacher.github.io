Mei hole and welcome to your sixth
angular six tutorial in which you're
going to take a look at what components
are in angular and all about them so
let's get started okay so in this video
we're going to see first of all what is
a component how to create a component
using command line then how angular
actually declares the component itself
when we use command line or how you have
to manually declare it in your route
component if you do it manually right
and some basic component usage with some
string interpolation and all that stuff
so okay so here is our code right and a
component as I said in the stabbing
tutorials it's pretty much just a piece
of code which represents something on
your screen right so you can break your
layout into components so for example if
you're using headers multiple times on
different screens then you can create a
header component which would be reusable
on pretty much every page you want so it
is an independent thing a component
which you can import into any file and
use it so by default we see then what we
have here is this AB lot module has a
declarations array which contains app
component which is our route component
and this bootstrap from app component as
well so this app component file right
here what it does is that contains a
component decorator which we learned
about in the last video and a class
which actually acts as a logic for this
component ok so this class what it would
do is as I said it would contain all the
logic for this particular component so
what we can do right now you can see
that inside the HTML file I just have
hello world
which is displayed in the browser as
well so let's just create a custom
complaint using the inbuilt terminal
which we escort gives us
so we can do that by actually writing
something like actually let's the seed
into the directory and then write ng
generate component and then the name of
your component so in our case let's just
say this is hello and hit enter they
would see certain changes done by
angular you can see that there are four
creations and one update so for
creations are these four files but what
this update is well this update if you
take a look at AB dot module dot TS
you can see that angular automatically
adds a Hello component to our
declarations and it automatically
imports it as well so what's happening
here well to use a component in order to
use a component in your angular
application you need to declare it
inside this engine module decorator
that's how angular works it needs to be
aware of what components you're going to
use in your application in any time in
future so that's this part and then
these four files are created which again
contains the HTML file CSS file type
script component file and one
specification file which is used for
testing but we're not gonna make use of
that right now
and you can see that this component
automatically implements this on and it
method which we discussed this is the
lifecycle hook which we discussed in the
last tutorial so yep
so let's just add some HTML to this we
can say like this is our custom
component
and it's safe and right here what we can
do is inside our add the component or TS
this files HTML we can add like
something like custom component says and
then the tag name of this component we
have app hello as the selector so
selector pretty much means that whenever
I make use of this in a file which
imports this component the template URL
is content or templates content would be
rendered in that HTML block right so if
I import this component into my main
component file that is a plat component
of TS by import
hello component pol NT from hello hello
component if I do like this and save it
now my other component dot HTML file
whenever it sees this because the hello
components typescript definition say is
that the selector should be app hello
and it sees that here it would replace
the contents of this template URL after
applying these styles into this HTML so
let's take a look in the browser you can
see now we get the output as hello world
custom component says this is a custom
component so that is how pretty much you
work with components and yes that's all
for this one and in the next tutorial we
will not discuss about services maybe or
some more information about angular how
to work with expressions in angular we
have a lot to do so I'll see you then in
the next video
