angularjs tutorial and the part two of
the to-do list in angularjs and let's
just continue off from where we left in
the last tutorial so now we need to add
a task which the user has entered right
here so for that what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a variable of era
first an era sorry so this will just
hold all of our tasks for the
application so let's just say or when I
just create this inside the controller
itself so let's say school dot tasks is
an array why not
and here I'm gonna push the text which
is written by the user right here just
after it presses the user process entry
we'll grab this text and we'll push that
inside this tasks array okay so now what
we have to do is to get this thing right
here and for that what I'm gonna write
as go dot tasks dot push and what is
being pushed here is the text right here
inside this input box but okay so we
have bit of a problem now we can
actually using javascript retrieve this
text right here by using some document
calls or whatever but doing that and
pure angular is let me think how we can
do that yeah why not
we just bind this to some variable yes
so that should work pretty much so I'll
just find it to task
ng-model tasks and right here what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to add up
this scope dot task so yep so we are
just binding this task to the input box
and it's going to update every time this
is updating yeah so that should probably
work so let's just consular scope task
every time this happens so let's just
try it out okay
okay so let's just try to type anything
okay so it gives us undefined
okay
this is try to console multitask see if
it works now that can work ngmodel task
this is desks
oh no no oh my that we are working with
29th file this will study Adam
that's such embarrassing I'm so sorry
for that alright so now let's just get
started
I'm just going to add a bunch of things
here let's say ABCD now we got ABCD oh
tango anyways let's just do this now so
we've got ABCD first Wow next alright so
this works now we have a way with our
tasks now the next thing we have to do
is to clean this input box so the user
doesn't mistakenly hit enter twice and
thus you know just adds tasks for no
reason and also I'd like to check that
scope dot task is not empty and instead
of doing here we can just use that here
scope dot task is not equal to mg now
let's just reload this and if I try to
do nothing and press ENTER you see it
doesn't work so it works with WoW but
not with an empty string and about that
clearing that thing we can do like scope
and whoa okay I guess I messed up with a
little bit of keys they're here the
tasks should have the empty value let's
reload this wow this is now empty okay
so we are getting things in JavaScript
and in the next tutorial we'll be
looking at how to actually populate this
area with this area right here so that's
all for this tutorial
