welcome to the second tutorial for
angular 6 playlist on the web and in
this tutorial what we're gonna do is
we're gonna set up angular CLI and our
angular project so that we can actually
start working with angular 6 and create
some awesome applications with it okay
with that being said what I want from
you is to have something known as node
and NPM installed on your machine and if
it is not installed what I want is just
make that that's here a little bit
bigger what I want is you to follow the
link in the description it shows you
exactly how you need to set up node and
NPM on your machine with it is Linux Mac
or Windows and once that is done what
you can do is run NPM you should get an
output something like this and node we
which will give you a node version
should have installed I know that I'm
running a very old version of NPM that
because I need to work with react native
which kind of doesn't work with endian
worst 5 forwards so yeah that's the
reason once you're done with that what I
want you to do is install an angular CLI
now how how to do that
go ahead and write NPM in it
why or rather you can just skip that as
well if you want to anyways because
we're going to install it globally so
what I want you to do is npm install g
and then add the rate angular slash CLI
had a relay test once you do that it
enter and install angular CLI for you i
have already done that so i'm not going
to repeat this step once you're done
with this
would you have access to is something
engi now if you write mg - we what it
would do this would it would show you
your angular CLI worship your node
version your OS type and angular as well
angular version as well if you are in
the directory of your project now I'm
using a beta version of angular CLI but
you would see a stable release just the
version number here so okay just a sec
so you just see a version number here
that should not matter okay so once
that's done what I want you to do is
write ng and then leave and the name of
your pod shape in our case it would be
intro right so let's say I write intro
to angular as I approach it so once I do
that and hit enter what it would do is
it would start installing packages for
project right in our case I have already
done this because it's quite long so I
have already done that in a directory
called intro so I'm just gonna remove
intro to angular that tree right here
and CD into intro
once we CD into this directory what you
can do is write ng - V again this time
what you can see is that we get angular
CLI as 1.7 and angular as six point zero
point zero B touch we now what's nice is
that angular 6 is being used in this
directory which is exactly what we want
and in your case it would be angular 6
Olli don't worry if this is angle of
five point two point four then you are
then basically angular six is not
released as a stable version it's still
in beta but you can still follow along
with the series because you would only
see angular five point two point four if
you're watching this video say within
one month of its release because that's
how long angular
five point two point four is going to be
there as the default installation
candidate for angular CLI once you have
done that what you want to do is to ng
hit enter once you do that what it would
do is it would start all the web servers
wetback compression local server you can
see that it's bundling the modules and
it also gave me a URL which I can open
on my system to access my angular app
let us just process the information and
you can see that webpack compiles
successfully I can go ahead and paste my
url here you can see that inside this
intro we get welcome to our app and an
angular logo so that is all for this
tutorial and in the next tutorial we're
going to take a look at adding some file
structure or some interesting stuff so
see you then and good bye
