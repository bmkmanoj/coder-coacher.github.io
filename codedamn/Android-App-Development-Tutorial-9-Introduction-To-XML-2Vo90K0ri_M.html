your ninth Android application
development tutorial my name is Miho and
in this tutorial I'm gonna show you a
little bit about what this XML file is
and pretty much why Android makes use of
these XML files
well in Android you would find a lot of
XML files when you are creating your own
application like this one your strings
are actually stored in XML file and
we're gonna learn about these things
later on how they are coming and what
happens is Android you have to kind of
it's good practice to store your strings
which you are making use of in a
separate file so that when you are
creating a translation of your app you
could pretty much do it in one go
without you know just going ahead and
editing each and every activity and then
just no beating your head on the
keyboard because of that so Android kind
of saves you from that the next thing is
that why does Android makes use of XML
files well and what could have made use
of some other language like JSON for the
data organization but it's just like
kind of XML Escarra easier to see and
you know relate to your interface
because you know XML just allows you to
have things like button and textview and
all these attributes yes when well JSON
would also be would have been fine but
the people who developed Android were
kinda like that so nothing can be done
about it so we gotta learn how to cool
in XML well the next thing is that so
far we have designed only using this
design panel right here
and you could just switch from code to
design with these two tabs and what
happens is that in design panel you
could actually yes you could just you
know just pick any of these and just
throw it on the screen and it's resize
it from these properties but this is
kinda boring
because it does not involve coding and
you know you would realize this later on
but designing an interface yr GUI would
gotta make you less powerful with your
interface because you know you are bound
with the things available to here only
because yes there are almost everything
available right here but for some
functionality you would probably need to
go to the coding area and moreover
finding options right here is kind of
tedious and you would eventually get
bored but when you are regularly typing
in XML you want at least I don't so
we're gonna make use of this XML and as
you can see that for every thing right
here like we have this plain text feel
large text medium text buttons
everything you see here we have an
equivalent of the score because
eventually your design transforms into
code itself so it gotta have that so you
can see that there are a bunch of
attributes as well associated with each
of your XML tag and these kind of
instruct you your layout how to behave
because you know this button says that
okay our button but what else well you
need to instruct that button that what
it its width should be its height should
be what text it should contain and you
know some attributes are optional
actually so what position should be of
that button on the screen and so on and
so forth so there are different kind of
layouts as well which I'm gonna discuss
later on and this is kind of very
interesting topic and layouts one
because you can say it's kind of
foundation for your UI because layouts
kind of decide how your things go in to
your application so yeah relative layout
is one of the most popular one used then
there are linear layout grid layout on
that all that stuff which we'll take a
look later on but for this tutorial I
just want to give you
a brief introduction to XML and prepare
you guys for starting off with XML
because it would be a lot fun to code
with XML instead of just picking up and
throwing up some bunch of I don't know
some fields on the screen so yeah that's
all for this tutorial and if you liked
it then don't forget to subscribe thank
