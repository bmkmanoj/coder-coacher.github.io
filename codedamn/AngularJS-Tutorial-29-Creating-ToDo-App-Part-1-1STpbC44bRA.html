welcome to 29th angularjs tutorial Hanan
the story we'll be starting off with an
application in angularjs and that is to
do list application with angularjs now
in the studio list application what I'll
be coding is I'll be showing you two
guys that how a user can't come on your
side and enter some information he wants
to do like some tasks or whatever and
then you could even store that in the
browser so the tasks are not lost when
the user refreshes the page then edit
those tasks then update them when the
user sets them as complete to strike
them off or remove them from the list
and all those tasks like that so to
begin with let's just create our basic
HTML first I'm not interested a lot in
styling this form because what we are
concerned is more with the functionality
and not with the styling so I'll just
keep the things clean and simple you can
go ahead and customize it if you want so
I'll just write here add a task for the
input box it would be text and I'd like
that to be in center of screen
I'll just set it to a block element and
pairing off five pixel Alphonse size of
I guess 12 or 15 pixel won't harm much
let's just see how it works okay so we
have God the Box incentive but not the
heading so let's just get that as well
okay so we have
all the things ready now the first thing
we want to do is we want then that
whenever the user adds some things here
and presses enter key then the task is
automatically added somewhere right here
but for that we need to know when the
user has friends pressed enter key now
we can do that even with custom
directives which we'll be learning we're
soon how to create your own custom
directives but for now I'm gonna use the
conventional approach with which we have
learned earlier and that is to monitor
each and every key event and look for 13
which is the you can say the key code of
the Enter key would so I'm just gonna
write here
ng key up is search enter and inside the
spirit let's just quickly populate this
up
and we have no dependencies for now
okay so now we have this function right
here search and true so I'm just gonna
write scope not search in true function
and obviously need to pass in the scope
and what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
for now console.log the key code
well modal teasers one on the same thing
you can use either one in Chrome so I'm
just gonna reload the page I'm just
gonna hit some key so I get 65 for a
which is correct so let's just see what
I get for interval that is 13 which I
told you so right here instead of the
slide I'm gonna write if he went dot
which or key code is 13 then return true
return false
all right so okay so now we don't need
something like return true or return
false
we need a functionality here called
let's just say add tasks to this
function and why not
scope to add tasks so I'm just gonna
create scope add tasks add a function
here and what we are gonna do and this
function is will somehow get this text
create a container place that text
inside that and remove it from here so
that's what the score function is gonna
do I'm gonna show you that in the next
part so stay tuned and don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
this one
I'll see you them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
