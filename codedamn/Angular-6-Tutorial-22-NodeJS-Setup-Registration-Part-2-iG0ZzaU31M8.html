Miho and welcome to your 22nd angular 6
tutorial in which you're gonna take a
look at how to set up back-end for the
registration app we have been working on
so far
registration plus login so in this video
I'm gonna show you how to move to node
because PHP is not really my choice you
can use any back in language you want
but it's just up to you at the end of
the day so let's get started okay so in
the first part we almost completed the
front end thing though a lot of work is
still left there as well for the data
displaying purposes and editing Fila and
all that stuff but basically for the
registration stuff that is done for
validation we have a basic just one
check validation but that's okay for now
for debugging for development right for
back in let's get started so for the
back end what we need is let's just say
I go back a directory and create a
server folder here and I initialize this
as an mbm project I'm gonna make use of
node and just a minute I'm gonna make
use of node and if you don't know how to
setup NPM or node I have a video link in
the description do check that out and
you should be good to go so how to
actually install how to actually set up
a node server really quick so I'm just
gonna install Express here to serve our
application
okay with that being done we have
Express in place we also need Mongoose
and Mongo later on but Express right now
I believe should do our work so what I
have is if I just open this in sublime
text
so inside sublime text if we take a look
at this file package the JSON says
Express as a dependency I can create an
indexed or chase file here and quickly
start a server so I can say Express is
acquire Express and then I'm gonna say
my app it's just the Express so we're
here and we can just say add dot listen
what we had one two three four just
console dot log so listening at one two
three four right and here we can define
what we had for the API and that is our
API slash or destroy path so I'm just
gonna say AB dot post API register and
we actually need some middlewares as
well like body parser so that we can
actually make use of
JSON require body parser and I believe
it ships out a separate package now npm
install
yup so we have the body parser and we're
gonna just make use of body parser dot
JSON here because we're gonna
communicate in JSON with the server so
add that post so this gives us requests
and response and now if you just console
dot log response dot
request our body here what we're gonna
see is our server so I can just quickly
started with Nordmann index dot j s
right here and we get so we're listening
at one two three four now if i go to
browser open up my console go to console
here write something like may hold one
two three four one two three four hits
summit inside a network's tab okay
there's no request going on and that is
because that is because this tree user
okay so our registry user event is being
called
favours total length is equal to zero
not greater than zero now if we take a
look again may hole 1 2 3 1 2 3 its
summit you see that we hit a request to
register but we are not returning
anything from our node server so you can
see that on the so we get user name as
may hole and pass what else 1 2 3 so we
can do is pretty much just say constant
username and password that's how we are
sending it right is request body and
then what we want to do is actually
store store this data on database so
what we're gonna do most probably is
something like our user model dot Save
and then we're gonna pass this
information and then inside our model
we're gonna define a method which can
we'll do like process data before it's
get saved like if you want to hash your
passwords before saving that's a good
practice to do actually so you can do
that so that is how you're gonna work
with this angular application and this
is pretty much it for setting up the
database setting up the backend pad the
next thing comes setting up the database
operations so that is all for this
tutorial and in the next one we're gonna
set up Mongo and see how to make use of
it with our angular application so
that's all for this one and I'll see you
then in the next video and one more
thing
