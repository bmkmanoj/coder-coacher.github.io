May ho and welcome to your very first
tutorial for WebSockets and in the
series what we are going to do is you're
going to take a look at what these
WebSockets are and how you can make use
of WebSockets
to develop pretty cool applications
which communicate with each other in
real time I like you kind of load a web
page it takes some time but with sockets
it's just real time just like you do
chatting so it's kind of real time or
you know calling somebody
well what sockets are actually is that
you are using sockets all the time you
don't you know realize that but even if
you're opening a web site like can I use
comm you are opening actually a socket
on both 80 right so HTTP protocol works
on both 80 HTTP works on both 443 and so
on so these port numbers and the IP
address technically this is just a
domain name but it has an IP address is
kind of forms a socket right and you can
create a program which listens on the
socket so on your server on this on this
website server what there is is that
there's a program which is listening on
port 80 right and whenever it gets a
request it sends back some data
depending upon what user wants right so
sockets in one or other way work in a
similar manner right so what sockets to
is that you can actually keep a socket
alive between a server and a client so a
socket can be thought of as a tunnel
between your computer and the other
remote computer or a server which is
connected all the time as long as you
know you want or the server wants so you
can just flow in and flow out data out
of it
just like you need so there are various
kind of protocols on which your socket
could work like TCP or UDP but we're
going to talk about that later
so what happens is that on the web
javascript has access to web sockets
which it can use to communicate with
this other server right and therefore
this technology makes it pretty easy and
handy to create real time applications
like if you are streaming a video from
your camera you can use sockets to
transfer your video over your I don't
know maybe a LAN network to you know
make sure everybody in the LAN network
has access to what you are recording
with your camera life right and you can
do many other things like you can just
stream your video on your land with the
help of I guess VLC also has that
feature so yeah you can do that so yeah
that's all pretty much what sockets are
and from the next tutorial onwards what
we're going to do is we're going to take
a look at how we can implement
WebSockets with JavaScript on the web
and with node on the backend right so
that is all for this tutorial and if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
