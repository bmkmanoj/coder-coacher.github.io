and welcome to your 12 noches tutorial
in which I'm gonna show you what events
and even amateur is in OGS so events are
pretty much what we had in the
traditional JavaScript on the browser
and that is just you attach some events
and assign a function particular
function with that and that even is
fired whenever you want it so that's
similar to the front-end JavaScript and
that is the main reason of the node.js
high-speed as well because no GS is a
single triggered language and that means
it just has one thread to operate on so
it cannot just split its tasks into
multiple threads so for instance in Java
you have multiple threads supports and
with Java what you can do is you can
just create another thread of a same
program and run some other code on that
thread and run some other code on that
thread so that kinda just lowers the
load of your code it makes your program
a bit faster as well with no we don't
have that but we have events which would
do the cut off same thing so let's get
started so I'm just gonna show you how
to make use of events real quick and
this video tutorial so let's just create
a variable events require events and
this is again an inbuilt module so you
don't need to do much out there event a
metro is require II where oh no no this
would be new even start
even Evie ent amateur and that's how you
create an event emitter and this even
emitter is nothing but just what would
the node.js would need to fire your
events so
this would be used to create your events
and then this would be just used to
assign and fire them accordingly so
let's create a simple event let's just
say he went amateur on my custom event
EVLT our function out there let's say
console.log event fired
alright so now let's take a look in the
terminal right Noches cryptology is oh
no script watch a yes okay
or even Evie &amp;amp; Diaz required Evie and
here's all right so we have a diaper out
there now this is even a mature TT yeah
here you go okay so as you can see
nothing happens right now because we are
technically doing nothing but just
assigning this event so the equivalent
of this a simple equivalent on the front
end would be like document query
selector your tag whatever the target is
on click a function here so that's
pretty much what we are doing in here so
in here what we are seeing this is the
even name sorry this one is the event
name right there and this one is the
function which would be fired and yeah
so that's pretty much it and then what
we can do is I can just set a timeout of
two seconds let's say then I can fire
this event ID too far this event what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write even
time meter not omit the even name out
here so my event name is my custom event
so if I take a look in the terminal now
after two seconds as you can see this
console logs even fired and what if you
have your custom parameters in here or
the arguments let's just say this is my
r1 r2
I'm just gonna say our 1 plus r2 right
there and to just pass your custom
arguments you just have to pass them
along side your Emmet even name and then
your arguments so this is my string 1
and this is
the strain - so again let's just load
this and after two seconds it shows me
string 1 and string 2 so that's how
basically how you create an event and
work with event immature and just emit
some events and you could actually
attach multiple functions to a same even
name so you can have like argument 3
again here this function would be fired
whenever there are three arguments to
your function if I do something like
argument tree and probably not I guess
this would be fired anyways so let's
just take a look so if I just do like
the string tree as well so let me just
take a look what happens all right so
you see that both of the events fired so
yeah so that's not kind of what you'd
expect in Java so yeah so both of the
events would fire and since this one
doesn't have a third argument to store
so it doesn't show that up so you can
attach multiple functions to the same
even name and pretty much all of the
events would fire off so I'll just leave
that to a single event right now a
single function for a single event and
the yeah so that's really much how you
just create a basic event and just run
it so that's all for this tutorial I'll
see you then guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
