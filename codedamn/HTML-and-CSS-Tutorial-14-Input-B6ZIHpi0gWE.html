14th HTML and CSS tutorial in which
we'll be discussing about input boxes
are basically continuing our previous
tutorial in HTML and CSS series so it
lasted oriole we learned about forms and
how they work so in the story we'll be
looking on some elements of form and to
be more precise we'll be looking at
input boxes in form so let's create our
very first form in HTML so to create a
form first of all we have to use make
use of keyword form and this form
element would accept a number of
attributes useful but for now let's just
create a simple form tag and let's close
this this is a container tag so this has
to be closed and now we like to create
an input box and input box is kind of a
container where user can type a pretty
much like anything or any information so
let's see how we can create input boxes
in HTML so let's say you want the user
to register at your site and you would
like to have some information from the
user like their names and email ids and
what their password should be and all
that stuff so let's create our input box
to create an input box we use make use
of the element input and this accepts a
bunch of attributes and let's see some
of those type know type would specify
what kind of input you are accept
expecting from the user so type text
means that user could pretty much enter
anything and we have a bunch of values
for a type attribute as well and we'll
see it just now so first of all let's
see it in the page and we have the input
box ready down here so now we can pretty
much type anything we would like to in
here so the next thing we would like to
have is a submit button so whatever the
user types here would be submitted into
our form so let's create a submit button
let's use a make use of BR which is
break rule and which would act as a
newline let's create input type
summit now summit is a special input
because it won't create a kind of box
for the user to enter but it would
create a button for the user to press or
click when the user is done with the
information and is ready to send the
information to your servers and when we
do input type summit just this would
create a blank button and would have no
value so it would be kind of look like a
crushed button in our case it doesn't
appear at all and this is because we
haven't specified any value inside this
button so let's give it a value of
summit the fall
let's reload the document and see what
happens now we have this button summit
the forum and whenever we click this
button then
this form is submitted which contains
only one text field and where this form
is submitted this input type submit
would say - this form a form I'm ready
with all the data user has entered and I
give it to you and form right now has no
idea of what the heck to do with this
data
and let's give form some meaningful
instruction that what should be done
with this data so for that we have the
attribute form action now form action
would pass on this data entered by you
to the file or the URL we specify in the
action and the action attribute so let's
see if I specify the name of this file
file itself then form would basically
send all this data to this page itself
and this page literally does nothing
with the data so that should be okay
with for us and let's reload this and
now let's see I type hello world and
summit this form so basically this data
is submitted to this page itself and
this page is reloaded so this page
reloads so quickly that you are unable
to see that it is reloaded but anyways
now let's come back to this type
attribute of input element
and let's give it a value of let's say
email now in HTML 4 we didn't have many
values for this type attribute but HTML
5 brings a lot of values like your email
your number your color and all that your
did and all that stuff to this type
attribute which is very interesting
so now input type email would as I said
you would accept or expect from the user
to enter their email in a kind of email
format and this inbuilt parser will not
submit the form unless it accepts a
emails so let's reload this and let's
enter some random bunch of text and
let's submit the form now we get this
alert box from the user kind of alert
but kind of a notification when we
submit this form that please include the
author read in the email address this
string the jacket whatever this is this
is missing another it so now let's make
it a valid email address at said to
include an after it and let's some of
the form but it says again please enter
part falling other it
Chrome is smart enough to understand
what is the basic template for a email
address so now let's enter a valid email
address let's say my email address and
now let's summit the swamp and now the
form submitted successfully without any
error popping so that's how email works
and we have a bunch of more values for
example input ID button would create a
button itself just like the summit but
the difference between button and summit
would be
answer on clicking this submit button
the form would be submitted but this
button would literally do nothing so
let's reload this we get a crush type of
button because we don't have any value
specified so we can use the value
attribute again here to specify Emma but
now let's reload this as you can see we
get a more button whenever you click
this nothing happens so
and say we create input type color let's
remove the value we want it from the
user and now let's reload this now as
you can see we get this black button a
button inside this black rectangle and
when you click on this then we get this
color popped up colored notification box
popped up and you would choose your own
custom color down here I'll click on OK
and it would select your color so these
input types are basically in beat status
right now and not supported by as you
know Internet Explorer yet but let's see
now we also have a date which is pretty
much interesting and I like this let's
reload this and as you can see we got
month month date and year year year year
format and on clicking this small down
arrow we get a nice calendar opened in
Google Chrome and whoa
you could select pretty much any date
you like to with this calendar and
that's how it works
so you basically increment it as well
and yeah let me show you number as well
so using number you could not actually
enter any bunch of text but it would
only accept number so if you do like
this and some at the forum it would say
please enter a number so to enter a
number we would look that will do like
this
that'll summit and it would work so this
was a tutorial on input boxes are
basically this was only limited to the
type attribute of input boxes and in
further tutorials we'll be looking more
on form elements and how they work so
