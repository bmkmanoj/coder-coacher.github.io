15th
HTML and CSS tutorial so in this
tutorial we'll be learning about text
area in HTML and in the last tutorial we
learned about input type basically input
boxes in HTML in this tutorial let's see
what our text areas are how we can
create one so here's our browser
and let's create a text area just like
it sounds it is a tag a closing tag
instead of just a empty tag like input
and it is pretty much like it would
create a like this thing right here
which you could basically modify it size
with your mouse itself so this creates
this thing because of the enter I
entered here so if I do like this thing
then it would be clean as you can see
now if I type anything like here hello
world then it will appear inside this
text box so we don't have any value
attribute for this to specify because
this is a container tag instead of empty
tag
so basically text areas are used for
writing long messages which could not be
returned into one line input type boxes
so these are kind of multi-line messages
for your form for example if you want
some suggestions or comments from your
users then instead of using one line
input box you would use prefer to use
text areas and we have a bunch of
attributes for this text area and let's
discuss what they are
so let's have a look we have calls and
rows attributes in text areas and many
more
but these are two kind of required I
guess and you get you can see like 50
calls
20 rows just to show you what does these
two mean let's reload this and as you
can see we have successfully modified
the text area size now what does this
mean actually that there would be 20
lines down here and to be more precise
let's see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
14 15 16 17 18 19 and exactly 20 lines
as rows and 50 calls means that there
would be 50 characters in the slide
let's see 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 100
rather than a tonight daddy daddy was a
30-30 wanted better success than 38 the
night body 41 what - 41 over the Bible -
voiceover the f1 950 Wow
we just counted for one 250 and you were
fast in your class a so now as you can
know now as you know now that called
stands for the number of characters in
one row andrew stands for a number of
lines in your text box so you can modify
the size of text area with calls and
rows articles but I would recommend
going with CSS which would be learning
in future tutorials to modify the size
of this text box and basically we have
and another attribute which would allow
you to limit the number of characters
entered in your text box and let's see
what that attribute is
now in your attribute and your were
element type max length
and set it to 10 and now let's reload
this
let's just remove this let's reload this
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten and whoa I cannot type any
further in this text box because we have
set max length to ten it would block any
further input in the text box so you can
remove your input but it will not be
able to add input beyond ten characters
in my case and you can modify this value
200 or whatever you like so that's all
about text area in forms and that's how
they work
and they are pretty much flexible for a
messaging and all that stuff you need
when you need to write some long
messages and so I'll see you then in the
next tutorial and we'll be discussing
something cool about forms in the next
tutorial and share that
and I'm going for dinner so see you then
good bye and take care
