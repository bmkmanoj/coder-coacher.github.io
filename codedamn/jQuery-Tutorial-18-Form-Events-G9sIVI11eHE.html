your 80s jQuery tutorial in which we'll
be looking at some form event methods
which would prove useful to you when
you're working with forms in jQuery and
HTML so let's get started and create a
dummy fault let's get off idea of my
form let's see let's get a label input
type text that's
let's give it to ass exchange good
name
I'll just copy this so that I don't need
to type much let's give it a mail do we
have an even down here that's all let's
just make it text anyways who cares down
here let's give it some it
and a value of gold so here you go we
don't need any label for this so there
you go and now let's close the phone
for sure and here we go now let's reload
this we have got a nice simple form
and so for example
suppose when the user loads this page I
want let's just give it a break because
it's kind of confusion and let's move
these labels to the left of these boxes
good so now it's a pretty much good form
and
whenever the users arrives at this page
I want this field to automatically focus
it so wrongdoers down here in our jQuery
file
let's see document a very fashion let's
say
I want to focus this input automatically
so whatever you do starts typing it
automatically appears in this input box
so first of all I would grab something
unique to this input box for example
let's assign it ninety focus down here
describe it
focus thought to focus this in the
browser what I'll do is and use the
focus
pretty simple what'll happen is whenever
Ally reload this page it automatically
gets focused into this box as you can
see whatever I reload instead of just
doing like this it automatically gets
focused into this and we can use this
event actually to trigger when the user
focuses on something so to do that we
lose focus and we'll pass a function
down here let's stay alert
I'm a focused I guess we need some
escaping down there so let's reload this
whenever I focus on this I get alert and
focus now how this is different from
click I'll show you now now when I use
the tab key as well to get to this input
box I get this alert so whenever I use
tab key to browse even then this is
considered as a focus whenever I get
active in this textbook that's how it's
different from a traditional click event
so this is about focusing and you should
know for your knowledge that focus is
equal to four percent so there's no
pretty much no difference between these
two so we use focus down here and it's
similar to focusing okay so let's see
another event focus out as you have
expected this would work whenever I
focus out of this so basically on tap
I'm inside this and on tap
when I'm outside this focus that is even
despondent okay good now what else now
we have got h h even down here now let's
say change change basically let's select
all the input process we have 2000 right
now let's pass a function which console
logs
this dot texts are basically based on
value so I hope you know now this
keyword if you don't know then go ahead
and watch my previous tutorials in this
playlist and you'll be easy with this
this concept so let's write something
down here has been C on changing this
this input is fired and we get the
results in the console so as you can see
this is fired every time we handle a
change so if you want immediate results
then we can use key up and key down
events in jQuery so to do that we have
key up events which would fire every
single time I use a key up and as you
can see it fires every single time key
down as well
which would fire every single day
there you go so that's how you work with
input boxes and the last thing I would
like to have you do explain is that this
summit one now traditionally
you'll summit this what would happen is
when I click on go then this
automatically redirects somewhere but
since we don't have any part with this
so it would just get back to this page
for example if I want something custom
to happen when the user clicks on the
submit button
so what I'll do is my form that summit
alert you submit in me and just to stop
browser from you taking the default
action I'll pass in return false down
here so let's reload this and whenever
some of this it says you've submitted me
and there's no redirection as compared
to the previous one so these were some
of the form even handlers in jQuery and
I hope you liked the tutorial and learn
something from it and that's it for this
