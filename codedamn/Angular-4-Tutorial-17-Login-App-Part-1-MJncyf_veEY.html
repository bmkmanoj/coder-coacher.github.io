angular tutorial in which we're going to
take a look at how we can create a very
basic login application with angular and
what this application was pretty much
need is service and some components to
work with and routing obviously so that
we can create different sections of the
app which are accessible only by people
who have authenticated we're going to
implement all of this application on the
client side only so there won't be any
database and other stuff
so again this application is not for you
know taking your website or your any
confidential details public with only
this applications other means to secure
them again you would need a database and
you know back-end stuff involved to
actually authenticate a user so anyhow
let's get started and see how we can
create a very basic login application
with angular folder so we're going to
first of all I'm going to say ng
generate component and we're going to
need let's say your header right then
generate component I'm going to say this
is login form and then we're going to
say ng can create component footer I
don't know we would if we would even
make use of footer component but anyways
so we have the setup footer on login
form so what we can do is in our app
component which just say this hello
world for now we can redeem and say that
this is full page and we can say right
here this is app header and this app
header by the way would be the name of
our tag which would be here which is the
selector which would show this header
component HTML template so this is our
hospital this would be our at the login
form and again I'm not making use of
routing right now
but we'll just implement that later on
and you can find all of this code in the
description if you want to just follow
along and don't want to tag on the code
yourself so I'll just post that link in
the description so now if you save this
you can see that we get header works
login form works and Photoworks which is
nice so what I'm going to do is pretty
much go to this header and they do it go
down and why not let's just introduce
this in header and we can go to its own
specific CSS which would be applied to
only this component so we can simply say
header is a display or it's actually
display block itself so we're going to
say text-align:center we can say it
padding 20 pixels 0 font size font size
is 30 pixels and we would get go down
like that
or we can just give it a border bottom
of 2 pixels solid so I'm just going to
apply some more styles and more HTML to
this login form and would get back to
you then alright so I'm back and I have
just styled this form a little just
create a username and password field so
if you take a look in login form you can
see that it's fairly simple form with
the div class input with the input type
text field which is user name and then
we have a password field right and in
footer we have just the simple notice
and then this login form has the full
CSS and by the way this host what this
host does is it actually targets this
thing right here which is this app login
form tag right so all the CSS since it
is all locally scoped inside this so in
order to actually target this app login
from tag we need to make use of this
host right so again I'm making use of a
Flex container
so that we can just arrange that nicely
and all sort of stops all soft layouts
so now let's just get to angular work
I'm going to go with login form and what
I'm going to do is say farm summit which
creates our one-way data-binding
I'm going to say login user and for
login form component we can say login
form component that type script and we
can't really much go in here and say
login user if the method which just
gives the split event and this could be
anything but we need to pass in the
event even right here and what we can
say is the wire username is equal to or
we can actually we could have done this
with ngmodel as well it's up to you how
you want to do this we can say e dot
elements dot since it would be the first
field dot value and war password is e
dot elements one dot value now we can
very much this console.log username and
password to see if everything's working
fine Center and login actually it's just
returning us so it's
be submitting the form so let's just not
make this summit but rather button and
what we can do is very much but then I
guess we would have some problems so
let's just stick to this and say II got
free-range default right here and now
let's just add some text and hit login
so we still see some errors which is the
console dot log let's just say right
here what we get we get this is an event
and they actually do is either target
not just E right okay so now if we take
a look and enter some text and hit login
we get SDF NSPS as a username and
password so now what we need to do is
compare this to a particular value and
then perform a redirect if the value is
that particular things so let's just say
username is admin and password is admin
as well what I want to do is actually
authenticate the user and more or less
something like redirect him to the
dashboard so before doing that what we
need to do is actually implement routing
for the dashboard so that we can
actually make that so what I'm going to
do is go again here and say ng generate
component dashboard area or let's just
make it to dashboard only so now we have
the dashboard with us or what I can do
is pretty much you are authenticated
like that and now finally we can go to
our app modules to actually write some
routers right so we can say router
module and routes from angular routes
router rather router module okay so now
inside inputs we can say router module
dot for route and there goes our a
browse right and then we can say a
browse is roast which is an array of
routes which consists of part as a login
or do we have that no dashboard actually
- food and component as what we have in
here as a dashboard component right and
then what we can say is a fast distinct
component as a login form component
right so now what we need to do is make
use of router outlet right here inside
our app component dot HTML so right now
instead of app login form what I'm going
to say is routered outlet right here so
if we save this we see no change right
here but if I do something like where do
we have our login
form type squad right so if username is
admin and password is admin as well so I
want to say that this dot router dot
navigate to dashboard right but we need
to add a dependency injection for this
router inside our constructor so I'm
going to say this this is pirate router
router and again we're going to need
that imported as well router from
angular louder and if we see that it's
recompiling so it's wait a second okay
so it saves me it has recompile and now
if we take a look and say admin admin
and hit login you can see that we get to
dashboard and we are actually
authenticated as well so we can pretty
much add a link right here and this
should be actually router link which
just saves us to now we do not need that
in square bracket say it's go back and
we can very much just go back to our
home page but the problem with this
there are a couple of problems first of
all that we do not actually know which
user is authenticated so that in
dashboard we could show something like
hello then this particular user right so
we can fix that problem by introducing a
service and the second thing is that
that everybody pretty much can visit
this dashboard like that and would see
this message you're authenticated go
back right so now that is what pretty
much the logic of a login app looks like
but we need to implement these two
things or rather fix them in our app to
make it actually workable so we're going
to do that in the next video so that is
all for this one and if you liked it
