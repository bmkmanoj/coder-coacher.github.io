Mei hole welcome to your ninth
typescript tutorial it's been a while
since I created some but let's just
create and finish the sky trip series
and so here I am well what we did in the
last tutorial is that we just created a
basic function I don't remember exactly
it was some sort of area calculator and
we just passed in a bunch of arguments
with their data types like you know
whatever this can be so what we did is
that we just basically created the type
of arguments but what happens is that
sometimes you don't need to actually
know a particular argument like if
you're creating a function let's just
say this is area of ellipse so what you
need is that what you can do is actually
you can just say that this is your
radius one this is a number obviously
but in case of a circle you don't need
the second radius so if the user
actually calls this function like area
of ellipse like two then obviously the
user means that he or she wants to
calculate the area of a circle with
radius 2 because this is redundant to
provide the same value for a circle
actually because it's radius the same so
what you can do instead is that you can
make the second argument optional and
for our case what's the best thing to do
is that we set it to r1 itself right so
what happens here is that in your
default arguments like that you can make
use of the arguments which are already
specified earlier like for example if I
have another argument here like R naught
and this is anything you know then you
can just simply do like ah not like
there but this will produce an error
most likely if you pass in string or
something else so you know you can
manipulated but you cannot do something
with arguments earlier which are
declared so you cannot do like r1 is
equal to r2 this won't work because r2
is declared after r1 so you have to swap
their positions if you want to make this
code work well I'm just going to get rid
of this are not as well for now and
pretty much this are not here as well so
let's just return mad no I the r1 then
r2 right so whenever the user passes on
you were on argument then r2 is
automatically assigned to r1 otherwise
they are just working separately so if I
just build this you can see in the
compiled JavaScript what happens is that
this area Philips function accepts r1 r2
obviously we don't have these data types
like statically typed language because
javascript is not a static type then
what we have in here is a condition if
r2 triple equals y 0 and this y 0 is
nothing it's just kind of like undefined
written here
it's one of the same thing it's just
like you know what 0 is a safe sort of
undefined I don't know you can just make
use of undefined there as well or maybe
tell typescript as well to do that but
anyways is it just returns undefined
there right so it's technically written
if r2 is undefined and triple equal to
you know it just works too you know you
just don't typecast either of the sides
automatically so if r2 is actually
undefined
that means r2 is not supplied at all
then r2 is r1 which is exactly what we
want then return math dot pi and then
the
in code so this should be pretty easy to
run and this will probably return us the
area of the ellipse or this case the
circle with radius 2 so that is all for
this tutorial and actually I can show
you that as well if you want me to and
just check the console and here you go
so that is all for this tutorial and if
you liked it then don't feel subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
then in the next one real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
