Mei holes and welcome to your sixth
tutorial for ionic framework version
three atom this tutorial what we're
going to do is take a look at the
application generated by ionic the tabs
application and how this is actually
working and what this ion now and all
that stuff is so we have this app dot
HTML which would be the first file which
would be loaded as a component and it
consists of this root property binded to
root page and what this is this iron nav
thing is that it is the navigation
controller for ionic now ionic does not
make use of angular's navigation
controller instead it introduces its own
navigation controller to add some fancy
effects while you're popping pages or
pushing pages on the controller itself
so with this iron ass controller what we
have is something known as pages pages
in ionic ionic right so pages are pretty
much just components only which can
which you can push on the top of the
navigation controller so right here you
can see inside pages folder we have a
couple of or maybe four five four pages
right now and what they consist of a
simple view the sass file and the
controller the component file which is
pretty much what a component in angular
4 consists of so pages are more like
components only but it's just ionic
convention to call them pages so right
now if you take a look this ion nav
consists of a root property binded to
this root page and if we take a look
inside the component file we see that
this root page is actually tabs page
alright so the stats page we are
importing this from page taps tabs so
tab star HTML right here we see I on
tabs now again I on tabs pretty much
just sets this right here this tabs
interface and it's again built in to
ionic so that is provide
a kind of a native look so this eye on
dabs consists of again the individual
tab by referring it to eye on tap and
this eye on tab again consists of this
root property binded to some tab one
group that guru than that field okay
again the subtitle is pretty much
obvious this is the thing right here
which is displayed and that icon is the
icon which is displayed so we can
actually just get rid of this tab titles
if you just want to stick with the icon
versions only and we will just find so
if you take a look inside the tabs or
HTML script you can see that we are
getting this down one root tattooed and
that's reroute from three other pages as
well so if you take a look inside this
home dot HTML you would see this thing
which is exactly the same thing which is
being displayed right here now I on tab
what it does when you make use of this
eye on tabs is that it would select the
first tab as the main tab when it loads
right so what's essentially happening
here is that the first of all with our
AB dot HTML we are loading a root page
as our main page so this root page is
this full HTML content you see right
here then this root page is actually the
stabs page which just places the stabs
right here at the bottom of the screen
then tabs what this does is that it
selects the very first tab you have
right here which is the Home tab and
displays it on the first attempt on the
first whenever you open the document for
the first time you can change this
behavior by saying here selected index I
believe this was the case to some other
value let's just say one and it's safe
and we should see that About tab is now
opened instead of the Home tab which was
be selected index of zero right so it
starts from zero so if you go here zero
then it doesn't make any difference you
go to 1 then by default the second tab
would be opened if you would do it and
by default the third tab would be open
so you can see
David and there we go so again I untappd
consists of all these root property
binded to different different pages and
pages and ionic are pretty much a way to
actually create a view to the user which
would be usable as a full-screen page or
you can show it as a pop-up modal page
as well so yes that's all pretty much
how this tabs application is laid out
and in the next tutorial what we're
going to take a look at is what pages
are actually in ionic and how we can
push and pop some pages to add some
interactivity and by default ionic also
provides little nice fancy animation as
well when you push or pop pages so yes
that's all for this one and if you like
that then please don't forget to
subscribe and you can check my patreon
link in the description as well so if
you want to help that would be great so
that's all for this one again and see
you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
