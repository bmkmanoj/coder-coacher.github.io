and welcome to your third required
Shia's tutorial in which we'll be
covering about the required keyword well
I said that I would cover the
configuration file in this tutorial but
I guess I missed this one
so yeah so before doing the
configuration file let's just quickly
hop over to what this require keyword is
so as I told you that data mean accepts
the configuration file of your
application and for now it is just a
config dot J's which is a blank file and
yeah so after this script loads itself
that is this require - one two - then it
would load this one and since they are
in the same part so I don't need to just
add GS or something like that and the
next thing I'm doing is I'm using the
require again so what required does is
it would load a file as just like you
are adding a file out of script SRC
so this technically means that this
bunch of code here means that we are
doing something like this only but
you'll say that hey we already did that
in the slides so what is the use of this
code right here so I'll just show you
that in a minute so right here what I
told you is that this script file would
load itself first and then this config
dot GS right here which does not require
a dot J's extension so you can just make
use of this as config and not config dot
J's so what happens here is that this is
an asynchronous call so when this
required - one - two loads this
asynchronously calls this config file so
that means that it doesn't restrict your
JavaScript code below this script tag
from running so for example let's let me
just show you a quick example so that
it's more clear to you just add a script
and an alert
and let's just open the inspect element
and reload now pay attention to here
this alert just stops the execution of
this page unless I click on this okay
button so here we can easily see that
for now just three dot HTML and require
- one - two is loaded and there is no
reconfigured GS file loaded yet so when
I click on OK
you can see the configures loaded now so
if I want like if I want to have some
method from or some variable from this
config file and I try to use it just
after this file then it won't work
because this is odd I told you is
asynchronously loading this file so the
code below this script might or might
not run at times see you might not take
any chances
now what about that with this if I write
a lot in here and then I reload then as
you can see this conflict not gist is
already present so if I can show both of
these together hello it before require
keyword and alert after require keyword
and if I reload this now as you can see
the before require keyword fires before
the config dot JS file is loaded and
this after require keyword is
immediately fired after this conflict GS
is loaded so this is kind of a callback
function you can see which will be fired
when this file is loaded and don't worry
about duplicates require GS will
automatically handle and know whether
your file has been loaded once or twice
and it will decide or accordingly so
even if I remove this code you can see
that require GS would still load the
config file right here because of the
state of Maine attribute and if I kind
of removed this as well
then also require the gesture load the
config file as you can see now this
config file right here is loaded because
of the JavaScript code this one and the
previous one was loaded of data main
code so yes you need this data main
attribute if you want your config file
to be a configuration file and we'll be
looking at how to program a
configuration file in require.js
in the next tutorials so so that's it
for the story alar if liked it then
