metal and welcome to your 15th ionic
tutorial in which we'll be starting off
with another application for ionic which
will help us to learn some more things
about ionic just like we learned a lot
from the last application the newsreader
one well if you haven't watched that one
I would suggest you to do that one we
discussed some good things in angular
and ionic as well in that application so
what I was thinking about this one is
was I kind of create a timer sort of
application we just count downs from a
time supplied by the user to zero and
then when you know just the timer is
sort of over then you perform some sort
of action may be just like an alarm
application or something like that so
yes that is very much doable in ionic
and yeah that's pretty much which we'll
be talking about in this tutorial and a
couple of more tutorials as well so to
begin with again I need to add my
application so I'm gonna say ionic start
and let's just say this is timer up and
I want the activity to be pretty much
black so I'm just gonna write like here
like and hit enter so it will just fetch
you some resources right there so just
wait for it to complete it will complete
in a second now and you could have just
selected tabs here as well then you
might have to just get rid of the CSS
JavaScript added by ionic so I just went
to blank one let's just say that it is
initializing the project so yeah we have
got
all the files pretty much but let's just
wait for the confirmation message
all right so here we go again we have
the same sort of layout which we had
last time so you can see that it's
pretty much installed now if I just go
to my timer app WWE folder we get all of
that stuff which we got for newsreader
app similar stuff so I'm just gonna open
index right here and yeah say ionic and
pretty much first of all just go to my
application ionic serve and hit enter
okay so now we have got the same sort of
application which we had last time so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna make
use of a timer application so we are
gonna create a timer sort of application
and I'm just gonna open all of these
files which I require pretty much in my
workspace for now I'm gonna hide the
sidebar so first of all let's just get
stuff accordingly so let's change this
to timer app and then we are gonna
change this module to timer application
as well and change this to a war of my
app again my ab dot run and right here
I'm going to create my app dot
controller
our own controller which would be pretty
much just let's just say this would be
ng-controller timer control and here we
go now for this application we require a
couple of things from angular and the
first one would be obviously the scope
but the second one would be a timeout
now timeout is pretty much just like set
timeout in JavaScript but this is
sort of an angular equivalent for
example not it would just sort of update
your digest cycle because if you just
don't use make use of timeout you'll
just make use of scope dot apply so
that's one of the same thing you just
have to let angular know that you know
you are just messing around with some
variables on the page so just pass in
timeout and right here we can show off
our controller inside this ion content I
can say that div ng bind let's just say
this is my timer and you could actually
just make use of that expression sort of
thing as well my timer right here that
will work equally well let's just make
use of that only so I'm gonna say this
is div ID of countdown just in case we
need to customize it somewhere and I'm
gonna define this first of all scope dot
what it was my time all right and let's
just say this is for now set to 60
seconds as you can see it's updating in
real time so I'm gonna create a function
which would pretty much first of all
let's just create some buttons button
let's just name it
ng click off start and let's just say
pretty much start the timer and after I
BR I'm gonna say button ng click stop
stop the timer
alright now what I'm gonna do is just
simply create these two functions which
would start and stop the timer scope dot
star is a function right and this would
again not pretty much accept anything so
I'm gonna say
that school dot my timer - - and
actually since we need to do this thing
recursively unless the user clicks on
the stop timer button so I guess it
would be a better approach to create a
function out of it so let's say that I
have this function scope dot my custom
timer and this is a function so I'm
gonna say right here instead of in scope
dot start so now we can just keep the
track of timer my timer - - and I'm
gonna again say that all right so we're
gonna make use of timeout so we need to
store this in a variable as well so this
would be war my timer variable I don't
you know get a lot of names in my head
to name this function so well this looks
sort of odd so I'm gonna get rid of this
pretty much right here I'm gonna just
declare this for my timer what it was
custom type my timer variable or
something like that so right here I'm
gonna say my timer variable equals now
we're gonna make use of timeout right
here so I'm gonna say timeout no not set
timeout timeout function and this
function actually is just like it's like
a google it of set timeout here then a
function then the number of seconds
after which that function would be
called and remember that this is set
timeout not set interval so this would
run only once so that is why we are just
calling this function again and again
and how do we call that well we call
that by simply saying scope dot my
custom timer instead of the function
writing the function right here and just
change it to a thousand seconds now
what's happening here let me just get
the things around so we have to find the
undefined variable for right here and
I'm saying that my time variable is time
out of scope dot my accustomed timer
which again runs this function after a
thousand seconds now again this would
run till infinity unless we stop this
somehow so we need a base condition the
base condition would be if scope dot my
timer which is the timer we are making
use of is zero then what I want to do is
pretty much I want to time out cancel
and this all comes from angular and
since we have registered this inside of
my timer variable I'm gonna say my timer
variable here and yeah that's pretty
much it for the start function and what
we need to do again in the start wand
just need to send in my timer variable
as time out scope dot my custom time or
a thousand seconds so what it does is
pretty much it just in the scoreboard
start when this is called then my timer
variable gets initialized with a timeout
and again this time out this function
right here inside a timeout for example
when we call this scope dot start first
of all this timeout runs after a second
and then this function again wants the
same time out after a second and returns
that reference to the same variable so
that we can refer it do it again and
again and again I am referring this my
timer variable instead of just making
use of something like this is because we
need to cancel this timer right here and
also when you will create the
functionality of the stop this button
stop the timer then we need to make use
of this my timer variable so so far
seems good and yeah so let's just try
that
out like click on start the timer you
can see that it started decrementing by
a value of 1 per second and looks cool
so yes this is a basic start for our
timer application and yes we can do a
lot of things with this like you can
just create a circular sort of diagram
which just you know just defaults itself
kind of whenever our value is
decremented so that simple kind of you
can say you just have to create a div
and then set it water radius to 50% and
a border and just decrease the weight of
the day or you know we couldn't just do
that pretty much with CSS easily so
that's pretty much how this looks like
and let's just wait 10 more seconds to
see that whether the timer actually
stops or not five four three two one
zero
all right so it doesn't stop kind of all
right so if scope dot my timer is zero
then you want to set alright so yeah I
guess I got it we need to return false
here and what this would actually do is
that what happened actually is that yes
the timer was cancelled but actually
after this if block this code ran again
so it just created that timeout system
again so this line doesn't really have
any effect because even it said timeout
if you have done that in JavaScript the
code actually runs even if you clear the
timeout so if you have like a set
timeout block and then inside that set
time of said timeout block somewhere you
clear the timeout then the code below it
would still run for one time
that's for set Tyrone so that's pretty
much it for this one and let's just
quickly see that with a 10 second one so
let's just start the timer and eight
seven six five four three two
and here we go so the timer just cleared
itself out and returned false to the
function so that this thing doesn't
execute anymore so that's all for this
tutorial and in the next tutorial we'll
be looking at the stop the timer button
and pretty much just customizing this a
little bit so it really looks like a
sort of mobile application instead of
just a bunch of HTML buttons on a
counter so yeah guys thank you very much
