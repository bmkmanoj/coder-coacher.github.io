Mei hole and welcome to your xxx angular
6 tutorial in which we're gonna go
through over custom directives in
angular and how to create one basically
how to work with them so let's get
started alright in the last video we
covered what directives are how many
types of directives are there
essentially just two what are in build
directives and we looked at examples of
each well let's just come to custom
directives and it's just basically
simple stuff what we have done so far
comparing with that it's so we can just
go to our code and right here I can open
my inbuilt terminal here and I can say
ng generate directive now let's just say
I create a directive which is red black
and I'm just gonna tell you what that
means so I wrote ng generate directive
it created me two files and updating the
module let's see what it updated inside
our module file you can see that it
added red black directive inside
declarations right and it has included
that as well oh very nice very nice now
we can do is just look at this red black
directive dot T is file here and you can
see that it has a selector of app
red black now what angular does is that
it prefixes your directives with
something so that you do not clash with
angular's inbuilt or some other
libraries inbuilt directives by mistake
so this is just a security measure you
can save from angular team you can
change this to whatever you want but I'm
just going to keep it this way and this
is basically the directive name you need
to add to your HTML elements in order to
let this directive who run so I'm just
gonna go right here and I'm gonna create
a paragraph and I'm gonna say
paragraph pra grf pH is a normal one and
I'm going to create another one and say
this paragraph is a custom directive
what and I'm gonna add this a bread
black direct so now let's just cool what
this app red black directive would look
like okay so the obvious thing we need
to customize the HTML element we are
working on is first of all get that
element right so right here we do not
see any way to get that element so what
I'm gonna do is inject a dependency of
that element and I'm gonna instruct
angular to give a reference
give me reference to that element so
what it does is that it gets us to that
particular element on which I have
placed this directive so as a matter of
fact let's just console.log this alga
right now so now if we go to browser and
see and resolve actually the s code
always gets this wrong this should be
just angular cool right and now if we go
here you can see that we get this as
paragraph as a custom directive one but
inside console we get this element
reference so you can see that we get a
native element reference and once we get
that native element it's the same as the
one on the page so we can mess around
with that so let's just mess around with
that
I'm gonna say il native element now this
gives us access to the P tag we have on
the web page so I'm just gonna style it
and say color or text color I don't
remember really let's just assume it's
text color make it white and I'm gonna
do the same thing with the background
color and make it black
see yeah it should be actually color or
should it be background color is black
color is white okay that makes it work
but I don't really remember what the
property name was here let's just take a
look from here only the element or style
dot color is white style dot text porn
or the hell is this
you
you
okay so it was running some know what's
happening let's just save this and we
load it again
damn you angular you were running a
cached copy or something
so yeah this works we have a custom
directive which is customized according
to our needs right so yeah so what I can
do is basically say something like e l
dot native element dot inner text plus
equals to rendered by app red black so
you can just add a notice or something
like this or actually okay rendered by
app red black we get it like this but
what I want is
okay so let's just take a look if I had
a debugger here go to console you see
that this directive is called before the
element is rendered so at this time what
happens is that the directive we are
this thing we are working on is empty so
we do not have access to whatever inside
this element is so again you can add
something like ng on in it here and add
a debugger call here as well play this
thing reload play this one and now you
can see that ng on init is called after
the content is rendered so this is why
messing around with content inside
constructor would not work and you will
need to place your stuff like this
inside your ng on in at hand we can just
create this element as element R if I
can say this dot element is here and
then inside ng on an end I'm just gonna
say this dot element yep hit on play
reload this guy and you can see that
it's now in order this paragraph is a
custom directive one rendered by app red
black so this is basically how you would
work with custom directives in angular
and yeah that's pretty much it for this
tutorial and thank you for watching I'll
see you then in the next one and one
