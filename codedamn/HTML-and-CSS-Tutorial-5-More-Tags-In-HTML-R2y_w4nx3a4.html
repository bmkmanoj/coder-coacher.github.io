your fifth HTML and CSS tutorial in
which we'll be learning some more
interesting tags in HTML let's just
scale it down a bit so it's visible okay
so in this tutorial we'll be learning
about some of the important tax like
title your bold italics and underline
and all that cool stuff so let's see as
I told you suppose let's see this is
your browser window and you want to give
a title now this five dot HTML matches
the file name but doesn't look much
fancy when you're creating your own life
sites so what you want to do is you want
to give a custom title to this browser
right here and just like when you tie
Facebook facebook.com then Facebook
appears here instead of facebook.com so
how do you do that is with the help of a
title tag and since this is an
information provided to the browser and
not to the user basically this is used
by the browser to show in the its title
of the tab so this title tag should be
placed inside head so how do we do that
let's see
title is attack and I must tell you that
in the studio in this tutorial series I
would be using elements and tags
interchangeably many times so just
remember that element is equal to tag in
this whole series so let's come back to
this tutorial write the word title and
title is an element inside head so this
is let's indent it a bit so you can
understand the nesting layout and I
would like to give this title my first
title and anything you would like to
place to be placed in the title will be
find let's reload this and as you can
see the title changes from five dot HTML
to my first title and we have a bunch of
more tags in HTML for you to learn
before we get started with CSS and those
are suppose you want to bold this text
so how do you boil this text is we use
the tag be simply be all these tags are
in built and would require you to open
the tag the content and closing the tag
and that's how you build a
text which is bolded let's use another
tag which is BR no PR would come handy
with you because PR is a break rule
now what does that mean is when you type
something in a Word document then you
press ENTER for a new light
similarly BR would act as they enter on
your HTML document so suppose you type
HelloWorld and you want to move to the
next time and you want to say hi world
so now if we reload the space you can
see that these two appear our next our
separate lines so this is how beer works
it would switch your browser's line to
the next line
so let's come back to the P example the
bold one and let's see another example
which is I now I would italics your text
let's see with an example what it will
do so that lets clear to you you tagged
would underline your text so let's see
what it does do and one thing is you
know that P tag should be closed attack
should be closed you tab should be
closed but we are not closing be attack
and the reason I would explain in my
tutorial
opening the opening tax versus closing
tags so make sure to watch that tutorial
it's coming in future so let's see
what's the result of this in the browser
let's reload this page and okay as you
can see right here I guess this is
visible to you
so hello world when we used B then the
text become bold and let's just use
hello world without any formatting
now let's reload this is without any
formatting then be bold the text I
attack
italics the text which is makes it a
kind of slant and you tagged would
underline this text now we have another
tag known as strike
now strike would basically cut off the
text let's see let's reload this and as
you can see this line this middle line
appears and on this text and what it
denote says that this text has been
cancelled so basically this strike could
be used for like offers like not dollar
ten but this is dollar five now so
that's how companies do like discounts
for setting up discounts you could use
the strike tag to cut off the price and
display a new one so these are some of
the many many tags in HTML and I just
want to welcome you guys to the HTML and
won't like to burden you with all these
tags all those of tags in HTML all those
unrequired tags and unnecessary tags so
