Mabel and welcome to the day zero of
making go damn and in this playlist or
whatever this would be I would be
discussing the progress I would be
documenting how I am creating code down
and what happens every day at code them
so this day was not so productive in
terms of coding but yeah got a mail from
someone who has a group somewhere or let
me just see it was discord app so this
is a very nice ID I haven't actually
heard about it before so I just joined
this discord and these guys what they
have is something like a community kind
of thing which consists of all these
groups and all so that code damn also
I'm thinking to create something like
this
this interface is really nice I'm in
love with this interface it's so elegant
so cool so yeah basically so that's what
this is in this community and they
changed a little bit of logos and colors
and description of the github repository
basically all my day was gone into
basically contacting Apple for replacing
this Mac save cable you can see that
it's turning yellow in the front of
connector I'm not sure why I just
contacted their support they told me to
go and visit a service center nearby I
visited them they just said it's kind of
do it or something
I thought it was overheating but this
has told me that the pins would have
actually burnt or something if it was
actually overheating so anyway so that's
where today's day went by and yeah just
gotta sit here and do some commits right
now for the repository
nothing any no comment from you guys for
now I have these issue the I created
these issues as well right now this day
only so I have decided just three issues
right now which could be converted into
a PR so go ahead and give it a try if
you want to just sum it some code or
something and get started but go down so
that's all for the day zero and I'll see
you then in the day one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
