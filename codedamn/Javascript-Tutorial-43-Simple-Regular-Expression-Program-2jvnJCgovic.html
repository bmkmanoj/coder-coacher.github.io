43rd JavaScript tutorial in which we'll
be continuing with regular expressions
and we'll be taking it a bit slow
because this is a kind of very important
and it kind of bit difficult to
understand at first go so let's start
with building a simple regular
expression program and just for your
knowledge regex
re GE X is a fancy way of saying regular
expression because it consists of put
break for regular and X for expression
so let's get started so let's say I want
from user to enter something and then I
would like to separate out only numbers
from the user input so first of all
let's build something for user to input
and let's say the
it should be prompt
enter some value and prompt would
basically just show a alert box just
like the alert but it would actually
give an input box as well to the user
for something to write
so just for a knowledge remember prompt
is a function which you don't use much
except for the educational purposes and
for teaching people so that's how it
works
and it's just this
let's bring it up and we have got a nice
input box so that we can enter something
and now this input contains this value
we have entered right now so now let's
create result and let's create a real
gigs first so that it's simple for you
to understand now what you want to do is
we want to match every digit and from
the last tutorial do you remember that
to match any digit which is a number we
use the
backward slash and addy now this is a
special character or you can say
technically this is a quantifier in
regular expression which would match any
number and as I told you regular
expressions have a special ability to
just stop whenever they meet their first
match so to keep this program really
running I would add this G character
right after these two backslashes and if
you don't know why then go back to my
last tutorial in regular expressions and
watch that and you know so let's get
started and in the result we have input
dot match breakings now this is kind of
just writing this thing right here but I
just wrote it in a different variable so
that it's cleaner to look so now what we
have got we are getting some input from
the user we are applying a regular
expression which matches every digit and
for the whole string of the user not
just for the first occurrence and then
we are gathering all the digits in the
result variable and let's do some kind
of debugging let's say console or type
of result first of all then I would like
to
- lovely result itself now has the
browser window let's keep the inspect
element ready and here you go now let's
reload this page and let's enter
something some random thing with some
digits as well you can see in between
there are some digits now let's click on
okay so what you've got here is first of
all we got the type of has object
because return type is an area even see
here and the result has got every digit
as separated though we wrote as many
digits together but regular expressions
separated out every digit so why it is
so so basically right here this D not
try to understand this this D what match
a digit only a digit that means one
digit at a time and since we are
applying a
Global fungi modified to this regular
expression then this would run for the
whole program hold strength we have so
it would kind of your basically match
every digit every separate time so if we
have the input as it c 1 d EF 2 aren't
really any random string and we have a
double digit number right here so what
you'll do is it will start from
character 1 and see if it's number no no
no yeah it is so it will push it into
the array then it will move forward no
no no yeah move it to array no no no no
yes so now it stops here it would
consider 3 &amp;amp; 4 as different elements
inside the array so how do we fix that
so to fix that we make use of the plus
symbol right here with the D quantifier
know what this plus would do is I'll
show you let's see first of all what it
would do now let's read of this Alice
from and the Sun values and a digit also
values are just and so on so now we have
a much cleaner and
readable type of output from the regular
expressions now we are getting all the
digits and not that basically separated
out digits we are not getting like two
three eight seven four as separated but
we are getting all the numbers which are
together ask together so let's see how
and
how this plus is basically modifying our
output so much so when we wrote our
program without the plus sign then what
happened is it matched let's say the
string a B 1 2 3 de 3 it matched the
string as separately as I told you
before but when we made use of this plus
symbol right here then it matched the
preceding
string or basically expressioned one or
more time so this plus okay so this plus
what said to JavaScript is that in the
first one we have got a B so these are
not digit so ignore them then once it
got one then it looked for the next
character and it said yeah
the next characters also a digit so
before pushing one to the regular
expression or sorry to the array of that
regular expression let's lay take a look
at two and it moved to two and it took a
look at the next character to do which
is also a digit and said to the regular
expression that 3 is also a digit so
let's move to 3 and when it looked at
the next way to do 3 it found D which is
not a digit so the regular expression
for D terminated for this bunch of
string right here numbers right here and
this was outputted as a single element
inside a array and it's just a single
digit single digit number so not much
problem with this let's reload this and
paste the same output and as you can see
it works as expected so that was a
simple program on how regular expression
works and I hope you got this program to
summarize this we put regular
expressions inside two slashes this D
right here means match any digit any one
digit now this global flag would
actually run this regular expression for
the whole string we entered instead of
just terminating it after one run and
this plus modifier says that match one
or more characters which are similar to
the preceding one and for this case we
have eight character as digit so before
closing this tutorial let me give you
another quick example so the C plus
let's see what this would do C plus E
and let's see we have got enter sound
value and okay so pretty much our work
is done here and let's reload this and
I'll show you what it does actually
let's reload this and let's enter C 80
cat so we have got C a as the output
now where's the soap so we have got like
C plus a now we got C and plus sign now
it signifies that include at least one C
in the strength so if at least one C is
present in our string which was then it
would match C plus a so if I write like
see a
d-dad then only then also it would just
run with CA because we are instructed to
have multiple seeds but only one a so
that's the reason we still get see a
because our of output because of the
strength and will still get see a but if
we do like C and 80 then we'll get all
these C unless it encounters a so if I
remove this a as well and let's reload
this and let's write anything so it
would match see only so this technically
means one or more occurrences of C so
basically we are only matching C and in
this case this basically means just like
this one so there is no difference
between this and this because what would
run for the full string and basically I
should say that there's a little bit
difference between these two because if
we run it like this
then what we'll get is something
different let's copy this and we got
like this but if I write C plus then it
would continuously look for the input
and we still got this because I guess we
didn't had a lot of
seize together and let's copy this and
in the plus sign we got output as this
remember this and now let's remove that
and now let's reload copy the same and
click on ok now we have got separate
characters so remember that plus would
actually match unless it encounters are
basically until it encounters every
character one or more time which is
proceeding itself
so plus proceeding plus is the Cu
character and it would match unless sees
all C's are present in a particular
given string together remember that the
C's should be together to be matched so
that's all for this tutorial we where we
created a simple regular expression
program I hope you found it fun to learn
