hole and welcome to your second MongoDB
tutorial in which I'm gonna show you how
to set up MongoDB so that you can start
working with it super easy so just click
on this download button on MongoDB car
and on your download section choose
community server and choose your
operating system if you are running OS X
then go with this one or if you're
running on Windows or Linux or solar is
whatever then go with the particular
operating system just download this
package and it would start your download
in a minute I have already downloaded it
right so I'm not gonna download it again
and once you have downloaded it you
would get pretty much you would get
executable file which you can just run
and you would just install MongoDB and
once you have installed it go to your
computer PC and go to your C Drive then
it's in Program Files Mongo DB server
3.2 bin right and now just click on this
task title bar or whatever you want to
say that it's copy this whole path right
and go to your properties of the
computer advanced system settings
environment variables just select this
path click on it edit and add it right
here just like I have that so once you
are done with that now just hit win key
and are actually and write CMD and just
write Mongo D right and hit enter now
you would probably see an error right
now and if you see that it's pretty cool
because you should see that on the first
install so what you have to do is
actually go to C Drive and create this
data folder right square data and DB
with these two folders because MongoDB
requires you to create these two so just
go ahead and create data in C Drive and
inside that create DB and just leave it
blank I'm getting some data because I
have a couple of data base was running
so just leave it blank or you should
actually have it blank
only so once you have done that now go
ahead and write Mongo D right and if you
see something like this and the last
line say is that waiting for connections
on put whatever this is so we are pretty
much done with the installation and you
are ready to rock and roll so in the
next tutorial from the next tutorial
onwards we're gonna take a look at how
you can work with MongoDB and create
awesome stuff with it so that is all for
this tutorial and if you like this one
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
