angularjs tutorial and in this tutorial
we'll be working more on routes in
angularjs now in the last tutorial we
discussed about how angularjs routes are
working and what you need to do to set
up your first angularjs route and we do
that inside the configuration of our app
which in this case is main app and we
specify it with ng app so here's my
controller file and I've already defined
up inside my controller dot GS and
dependency is the ng route which we need
so now let's quickly say app config and
what I want to do is I'll just provide
an anonymous function here with the
argument as route provider and this
thing comes from this dependency so if
you remove this right here then this
code would not work because this
variable comes from this thing alright
so now what you have to do is just say
route provider when the page is this
then
what should be displayed our code here
then when the pages let's say hello user
then what should be displayed and all
that stuff so let's just give it to
otherwise otherwise is the default
whenever there is no match found in
above when statements so it's just like
if you have done switch loo switch
conditional statement the otherwise
Clause is just like the default one we
have in the switch 1 so this is kind of
a switch statement only so otherwise
I'll just write redirect to homepage all
right so now in the last tutorial what
we discussed about is we just create a
template and supplied some bunch of text
some HTML all that so when you are
working on a very large site that has a
lot of information and a lot of content
to show the users
you cannot just simply write everything
in a mess in one single line so we want
to do is we would like to separate out
all the contents in different different
file and to do that we have something
called template URL now template URL
would technically accept a value like
page dot HTML here and in the same
directory launch a
Ajax request to this particular page and
then feed the content inside R and G
view right here so now you have noticed
that I'm working in C's amp it she dogs
angularjs instead of my Dexter folder
and not the Dexter one instead of my
directory where I had all the tutorials
angularjs chrome and all that stuff
together because in working with
template URL angular needs to do a
request in a Jack's request to this page
and as you know that a jack requests are
not permitted under file protocol so we
need a local host to work with all right
so now let's quickly create a new page
add on this new page what you wanna take
carries off is that don't include that
traditional tagging and all that stuff
so this should not be included simply go
ahead and write your output you want to
display and I'll just save it as page
dot HTML
and the reason is because angular which
will fetch this page take out all the
content as it is as it is and would feed
inside this div so if you include like
doctype HTML HTML head and body and all
that stuff then angular would not care
and just pick up all the stuff and would
insert inside this div and then the
browser would have blog rooms to parse
out the code all right so now we have
got the page dot HTML set up let's say
template URL hello dot HTML let's just
quickly create that as well hello user
and otherwise we are good to go alright
so
here's my browser window let's reload
this and you see hello world because on
the page one we have got hello world as
the content so now alright so you could
actually create a hyperlink here as well
and you could just say that go to ello
you to say hi anything would go and just
reload this and we have got this
hyperlink here and when I click on this
you see that the hash changes and so
does the content so if I take a closer
look here for you for you guys to
understand it better then you see that
this is the ng view which was initially
on our 13 dot HTML page right here so
this is the ng view and angular
automatically adds a ng scope class to
it and inside this we have got all the
stuff fetched from different documents
in angular and if I go to network and
reload this page then you see that right
here
you can see here yeah this thing so you
see that this request this Ajax request
is made by some angular this file here
because of our routes here set up in the
controller dot GS so angular needs two
attacks request the files you want to
include inside your page so make sure
that the files are under a same file
tree because most of the modern browsers
do not allow cross-site Ajax request
because that poses a kind of security
vulnerability to all of that browsers so
in this tutorial what we learned about
is quickly is just a introduction to
this template URL thing which allows you
to clean up your code and helps you to
organize your code everything and yeah
one more thing so let's say if you are
using template here as well so if I say
this is template and now your guess is
what would happen now this time it would
load only the template are not the
template URL so if I go back to the page
and reload this the
alright ok I need to put a comma here
and now let's reload this and you see
that it just loads this is a template
and what if I move it down so even if I
move it down then the order of the
template and template URL does not
change that is the template one is
located first in the angular and then is
the template URL but both won't execute
together
if template is specified then template
URL won't be loaded so just make sure of
that thing because if you are using like
template URL n template as this then
obviously your code won't work or
basically it would but it would just
show a blank output so that's all for
this tutorial
and we'll be discussing more about
routing in angularjs and basically I'm
interested in teaching you guys about
conditional routing so maybe in the next
coming tutorials will be discussing
about that let's say if there's a login
page here and I don't want a direct
access of the user to the login page
then how do I check with if conditions
not technically if but we would be
similar doing something similar like
that so that's all for this tutorial and
I'll see you then next time take care
