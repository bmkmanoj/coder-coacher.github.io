34th JavaScript tutorial in this
tutorial we'll be learning about
something called recursion in JavaScript
the recursion is not limited to
JavaScript but is a kind of ability of a
language to call a function within a
function itself now by that what I mean
is you can actually call the same
function within that function itself
unless a base condition is met for
example if I create a function hello
world suppose I want to write hello
world on the screen ten times so there
are basically two approaches I can take
in this first one is a creative approach
that is using a temporary variable
incrementing it to 11 and incrementing
it and then doing document dot write
hello world looks pretty easy
creative approach and then we have a
recursive approach
now in recursive approach what we do is
we call this function within itself
unless a base condition is met
so in recursive approach let's commit
this outdoor or
okay here we go add in recursive
approach what we do is let's create a
function hello world and you'll
understand better let's let's say we
want to call this in a well function ten
times now we'll call this function hello
world with it itself so what we'll do is
while
then do hello world
and down here do a document dot write
hello world and now I'll explain what's
happening here first of all let's see
what happens when we execute this okay
we have it called dysfunction in the
body yet
here we go
now now what's happening here in the
score is first of all we are creating a
variable set to ten now in this function
hello world each time the structure is
call we are doing a document dot write
hello world with a break line and then
we are checking while I is greater than
one that means this loop would stop when
I is equal to zero therefore it would
run 10 times we just want to increment
or sorry we just want to call this
function again
so what that does is when it dysfunction
arrives on this line that it checks for
this condition decrements I and then
calls this function again again this
function is called it checks for the
condition decrements is again calls this
function again unless this condition
becomes false so let's see some real
time use of this approach let's say you
want to build a factorial program in
JavaScript so I hope everyone knows here
what a fractal is
if not then factorial is in mathematics
if factorial of a number means
multiplying that number decrementing its
value unless you are reached to one for
example 10 factorial means then into
9 into 8 into 7 into 6 all the way to 1
similarly hundred factorial means 100
into 99 into 98 and all the way to 1 so
this is known as factorial of a number
so let's try to create a factorial
program in JavaScript both in recursion
as well as in creative methods to start
with iterative let's create an if
trading method let's name it factorial
number you want number from input from
user and down we here have first of all
let's set some validation if number is
less than 1 that means sorry this should
be minus 1
this should be number and if number is
less than minus one or basically a beret
should be less than zero actually number
is less than zero then obviously that
factorial is not possible because minus
1 factorial could not be stretched to 1
all the way to 1 so the number is
invalid then we have if number is equal
to 0 or if number becomes 0 then or
basically if number is supplied as 0
then we turn one and because 0 factorial
is 1 and if you want to learn the proof
of it go to some mathematical channel
they'll explain you why is your
factorial is 1 and then the last thing
we want to do with this our loop is the
main function and let's create a
variable any temporary variable you want
products double we are for setting the
products to number and then we'll just
run a while loop we'll just do
- Magus is greater than two I'll explain
what's happening here I will do products
is equal to row dark star number or you
can use shorthand as well
now here this look would run unless
number is equal to one so basically this
line would also run where number is
equal to one and that won't make any
difference because any number multiplied
by one is the number itself so here is
our iterative approach to factorial
program so let's see if I create a
result variable and call this function
well let's say factorial off to first
keep it simple first let's check in
console
sorry it's going to lock this I always
forget to do those result here we go
okay oh sorry we are not returning
anything return products you go finally
here we get 2 because 2 star 1 is 2
let's take some bigger numbers now let's
take factorial of 10 we get this big
number let's verify it with Google 10
factorial
and we have three six two double eight
zero three six two double-a double zero
good now so let's take a bigger number
100 factorial now this should be real
big as you can see it's calculated in
seconds and here we go the exact same
number in the Google as well as in the
JavaScript basically javascript shows a
more precise number that Google but
anyways that's how you take an iterative
approach to a factorial now let's see a
recursive approach to this function and
how give how can we make a recursive
approach to this factorial function
let's create this same function let's
remove this code the iterative one and
let's create the same base conditions if
number is less than 0 then return
invalid
else if number is 0 then return one now
pay attention here because this is our
base condition for the recursive one now
what's happened here is I'll tell in a
minute now else
return now pay close attention what I'm
doing here number into the function
itself factorial documenting the number
y1 so what's happening here is every
time this function supposingly I call
this function with here right - so this
function number contains - number two is
less than zero this is not true then two
is not equal to zero also add this is
not true
now this command is given to this else
statement so what it does is it returns
number into factorial of number minus
one now here the program pauses for a
while so the program pauses unless until
this function returns the value to the
parent function and when the factorial
number minus one that is one returns as
one then this value is put down here so
we are basically returned with two into
one and I'll explain the working of this
recursive recursion in the next tutorial
and I'll be using my bad drawing as
usual to explain but I hope you will
understand what is recursion actually
because this tutorial is going to long
and it's already ten minutes on this
tutorial so in the next tutorial we will
be learning about the
actual working of recursion ad if you
want to try out this program let's say
100 the same factorial we took for the
iteration 1 and refresh this and we get
the same result with the recursive one
as well and I guess at the same time so
this was a tutorial about introduction
to recursion or basically I should name
it
intro to recursion and the next tutorial
will be finally ending with recursion
are knowing how does it actually work in
the memory so stay tuned and keep
watching my tutorials and thanks for
