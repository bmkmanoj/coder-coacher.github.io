hole and welcome to your eleventh
tutorial of angular 2 in which we'll be
discussing about that shadowed on thing
which I was talking about and basically
technically it is called as the view
encapsulation
well view encapsulation is kind of
angular to does it to just hide some of
the data or just restrict the access to
the data for example in this case we
have the styles so we have already took
a look at one of the three view
decapsulation which angular supports and
that is that it just restricted these
styles to the controller only so a
specific controller only so for example
if I just get rid of these styles right
here and just make use of the styles of
this one then we have mainly three view
encapsulations but before starting with
that I would just go to this website can
I use and this would just show me that
the shadow Dom in how many browsers it
is supported so as you can see the
chrome is all green the Firefox is
supported but it says that not supported
by default but can be enabled using a
flag in Firefox so you can do that well
edge is not an II's years behind well
iOS obviously you are not using iOS for
development purposes are you well so if
you have chrome that's good enough if
you have Firefox then again you can just
enable the ad using a simple experiment
to fly you can just go to this URL I'll
just take a look so in chrome before
starting just go to this three dots
right here and just click on them
settings and go down and just enable
this show user agent shadow Dom just
might be this might be take the or this
might be unchecked either ways just make
sure this is checked so once you are
done we are going to go now in angular 2
what happens is that you can view make
use of view encapsulation in three ways
so if I just include this
capsulation module from angular 2 / core
only and make use of the encapsulation
property right here I can basically add
three values to this property and those
are view encapsulation dot nine to begin
with and what it does is that it
completely disabled encapsulation and by
that what I mean is that if I just go
back to my home page here as you can see
the styles are applied to the second
module as well well why is this
happening well if you take a look at the
Dom inside the head style we can see
that all of those things like ng Coast
and all of that stuff is removed and all
we are left with is that the simple CSS
which we actually wrote here so if I
just remove this line to make you see
the difference again as you can see the
style is removed from this h1 tag the ng
ghost and all that stuff has been
restored so view encapsulation done
completely disables the encapsulation
now we have a second one as the emulated
one and this is the default which we
have already took a look at just this
this one just enables this ng ghost
attribute so even if you don't make use
of this at all that's one of the same
thing just get rid of that and then
thirdly what we have is view
encapsulation dot native so for the
browsers which support the shadow Dom
actually this would come in to work well
for Chrome it does support so if I just
go to my my shop then you see something
strange instead of the things which we
had earlier like h1 and all that stuff
we have this shadow root and open in the
brackets well the shadow root contains
the style well if you have I guess ever
worked with jQuery I don't know if you
just I don't remember how we made use of
that but somehow we can get something
like doc you
so this document everything is
accessible if my beef when you do it a
Jack's request to a web page that kind
of happens in the return response if it
is HTML and it's automatically parsed
so somehow this document is unable and
when you click that in the console then
you have the HTML tag and all that stuff
so above HTML we have this document so
similarly we have this shadow root so
you know this style doesn't know about
outer world outside the shadow so no
matter whatever you write here this
would not apply to any of the outside
element and since both of these are
contained both of these modules are
contained inside the shadow root that is
why this style is applied or you know
this shadow root is applied to this one
this module as well so if I just go
ahead and just copy this encapsulation
to this one as well just import this
view encapsulation right there and
reload now as you can see both of these
modules are separated by their own
shadow roots so as you can see this
shadow root is for this my shop the main
module then for my movies we have the
shadow root and again this style cannot
access anything except its own child's
and siblings and all that stuff and this
shadow root has no idea about what the
heck is going on here so again I must
say that the support for shadow Dom is
quite not acceptable right now but for
chrome you can obviously use that but if
you're going for a live website then I
would just recommend you to go with the
emulated one which is kind of a CSS hack
for angular 2 or you can just completely
omit that and it will just automatically
make sure to use the emulated one for
now but the shadow Dom is interesting
stuff and you should probably know about
it so that was all for this tutorial and
