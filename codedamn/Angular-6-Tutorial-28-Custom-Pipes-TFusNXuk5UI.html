May ho and welcome to your 28th angular
6 tutorial in which we're gonna cover
how to create custom pipes real quick so
let's get started alright so we already
covered about pipes that there are they
can be two types of pipes inbuilt which
we looked at in the last video and
custom pipes inbuilt
could be any one of these and the custom
how would we create a custom pipe is
that we can make use of the angular CLI
itself so what I can do is right here if
I do something like ng generate pipe and
let's just say I just say I want to
generate a pipe which which let's say
what it does let's just say it reverse
reverse pipe which reverse the strength
right so we generated this pipe what it
did is that it created two files spec
file and the actual file and it added
that to the module or TS file so let's
just see what changes what do you look T
is contains now you can see that
declaration has inverse pipe in it now
and as you can see we did a fundamental
mistake that is writing pipe in the name
of pipe because angular also does that
so let's just quickly remove that and
let's just remove our pipe as well who
wants a reverse pipe dot type and there
we are
let's just give it one more shot ng
generate pipe reverse which creates a
reverse pipe for us there we go and now
if you take a look inside this reverse
pipe ideas you can see that we get this
function automatically created for us
which is a transform function so let's
just see what is happening here if a
console.log this value and arguments
let's say I get his arguments like this
and arguments right now let's just
include this pipe make you love this
right here so the name of the pipe here
is reversed so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna write something like this is a
test string and this is another test
string all this is give it some beers
and I guess we can just make it
XML valid anyways it does not matter so
now what I'm gonna do is right here
write this in quotes and pipe it with
reverse let's just see what happens you
can see that we do not get that text now
the reason why do not why we do not get
that text is that whatever you return
from this transform function would be
actually the new value which this
interpolation displays for example if I
returned go down here right you can see
that code damage displayed here so
whatever you return from the transform
function would be displayed I see good
console here you can see that in console
we do get this is another test string
and an array of elements no element a
length 0 array so what we wanna do is
actually give it some options so let's
just say we do give it options lab
through something like this and let's
say I give it good or an SS a single
something like that right now if you
take a look you can see that in console
we get two elements the first element is
true as we slip specified and the second
element is single code so what I am
gonna do with these values is that I'm
just going to say that if arguments of
zero is true that means I want a full
stop let's say so I'm just going to
create a new string here lit new
strength is this so I'm just gonna say
new string is value I'm gonna say new
string plus equal scheme of will stop
right and the second thing we have is a
single code so I can see if args one is
equal to single code then what I want is
new string is equal to a single good
plus new string else if arch one is
double quote then I want new string is
double quotes plus a new string simple
enough and now I can just pretty much
turn this new string and take a look in
the browser so you can see if you
carefully load if you carefully note we
have a full stop in place and we have a
single quote at the beginning of the
sentence as well right now if I change
this to double quote let's save you
should see that we get a double quote
here we still have full stop I can
change this to false and the full stop
will go away just like that so this is
just a very basic implementation of
pipes there is a lot to do more in pipes
as
well but this is how basically you would
create your custom pipe now you can
format your text beautify it do whatever
you want to do with it and basically
yeah so what what else you can do is for
example you can just specify a bunch of
strings here for example let's just say
you specify some strings here separated
by a full stop or something and you can
then pipe it to displayed as a list
that's a very useful case you might need
to handle somewhere in your code so yeah
that's pretty much it how you would work
with custom pipes and that's all for
this tutorial and I'll see you then in
the next one and one more thing if you
