second part in making money online with
your series in which I'll be teaching
you guys how you can make money online
with the help of freelancing no
freelancing is basically you working
online for other people similar to you
can say jobs but this is not kind of a
job where there's a boss
and there are other people in
freelancing you are your own boss so
there are many sites for free
freelancing where you can freelance and
earn a lot while giving a little bit of
commission to the site where you are
freelancing and one of the best sites I
recommend for you guys to freelance and
for beginners as well is fever
now fever is a old site in this
competition and it has evolved a lot
since I joined that so fever is a really
nice and awesome site to earn quickly
and you know easily if you are starting
to freelance so this is my favorite aunt
and I have been pretty much inactive on
favor from a lot of times so my profile
has deteriorated a little bit but if you
check out my profile on fever then you
see that I have around 256 sales on my
programming gig 92 on my responsive 12
on this and 7 on this and I have a lot
of customer for sales as well so in
short I have earned about 10k dollars in
an error which is not bad if you see so
these are all of my reviews a little not
all of but some of them which are the
most reached recent ones so if you see
then this gig is a real old gig
set up around a year ago and it takes a
little bit of time to get good with
favor and as you can see this gig is
favorited by 164 people online so it's
just kind of an domino kind of effect
once your gig starts growing then it
will keep on growing as long as you go
working with it so fever is the first
site I suggest then the next side I
suggest for those who want to earn real
money is a Lance
now fever is basically a five dollar
site which is not actually a five dollar
site you I often get a lot of orders
which are much higher in price than five
dollars but in Lance is the site where
you can pick a lot of heavy projects
with a lot of high budgets like $1,000
or $2,000 or whatever you like but you
have to be good in your field so in
Lance is the second side I suggest so
you can use I want to find work here and
I guess I had in Lance account around a
year ago and I actually had a deal of
110 dollars there but I don't really
remember my password right now so
there's an external side which is used
by a lance for the users to create their
account and here you go you can fill up
these fields and click on get started
now there are a lot of guides on Google
how to make money with Lance which you
can Google and these guys are really
interesting and easy to read and would
help you to kickstart your earnings with
freelancing on Elance and on for the
fever I actually have a post
myself on my blog if you see that this
is my blog and if you see that yeah here
you go so this is the post and you are
free to read this I have written all my
five points which I consider for a
beginner to follow to you know just
catch up more quickly how to make money
online with favor so I'll leave this
link in the description below so that's
all for this tutorial
and in the next tutorial I'd be showing
you guys some more ways to make money
online so till then don't forget to
