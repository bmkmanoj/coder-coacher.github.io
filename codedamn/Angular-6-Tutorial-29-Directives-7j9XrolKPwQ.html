Miro and welcome to your 29th angular 6
tutorial in which you're gonna take a
look at what directives are in angular
and I know it's a bit late but I guess
we haven't covered directives yet as a
tutorial as it's a pretty tutorial but
we have me used and that it does a lot
and our previous tutorials so we're just
gonna go through that actives real quick
here so let's get started alright so
first things first what are directives
so directives as you know that they can
add custom behavior to your HTML and
basically the directives are just the
attributes you add custom attributes you
add on your HTML tag for example ng4 is
a directive ng-if would be a directive
and basically I have a list of
directives here directives can be your
inbuilt and custom we're going to go
through in build this tutorial and
custom in the next one so we have ng for
ng if ng-switch ng known bindable
you're gonna take a look at that what it
is in G class and this should be
etcetera but anyways so let's get
started with I guess we have done ng for
tutorials so you can take the look at
that that toriel link would be the
description if you want to go through
that so let's get started with the ng-if
directive so here's our code and let's
just cool too and actually we are in the
pipes folder anyway but we're just gonna
test directives and this one only white
create a separate thing
so our app component the TS is here and
the SS get rid of all of this code
similarly our HTML as well so we're
going to take a look at how to basically
make use of ng s so first of all this is
start
with a very simple condition let's just
say I have a div and I write star and gf
just like we would do inside here star
in GF star in g4 and these stars are
just structural directives syntactic
sugar or world your normal directives
and I'm just gonna tell you that real
quick later on so what the star in GF
would do is that it would evaluate the
expression inside your quotes now and if
that expression is true it would display
the content inside the state so let's
just say two is greater than one which
is true we know yes two is greater than
one right we all know that two is
greater than one now let's just see if
angular also thinks that let's just
reload this you can see that we get yes
do is read another one how about we
change this to do is less than one
now if you'd go here you can see that we
do not get any output and the console as
well no errors that basically means two
is not less than one simple enough now
let's just get on to some little not so
simple code let's say I have a variable
here let's just name it
some random variable so if this some
random variable is true which is found
in a template then that would be
displayed here I can do something like
this and right here I can say true to
this and now if I can just move it here
check I get yes if I changes to false
it's safe you can see that we won't get
anything here all right now what we can
do now is that from variable we can
let's say if this condition is not true
then what I want to do
well one fix is that you have
conditions like this right so right here
what we are doing is that pretty much
saying that if this is true then display
this otherwise this play this well this
is unnecessary this is adding
unnecessary code to your application so
what angular did is that it provides an
else thing here which you can make use
of to actually display content if this
condition is false so to do that you
have to add a semicolon after that break
else and your templates reference you
know now what do I mean by that I'd
believe I have covered that earlier as
far as I can remember I'm not sure so
let's go over that one more time so else
the name of the template here so let's
just say the reference of my template so
let's just say this is other block
content now what this other block
content could be is that I can add an NG
template here and may give it a
reference of other block content and I
can say here let's just say you know
something like that so let's just take a
look in the browser you can see that we
can get no in h1 now the thing to note
here is that I do not get this h1
surrounded by Dave so ng-if is
apparently this else block is replacing
this hold if it's not a pending this
content inside you so what you might
want to do is that you might want to
just create another template another
template for the true case as well so
that you have a consistency in the code
so what you can do is we can say that
this is false block and this is true
block let's just say we have false block
in here and for true block what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna say some random
variable is true then I'm going to show
this true block else Falls block okay so
let's just make this true block yes and
let's just get rid of this but now if
you take a look in the browser you can
see that we still get no but if we
change it or let's just make something
like just for demonstration purposes
this not some random variable
let's just get rid of this so here what
we should see is that every second the
content changes here right and whatever
we can do what we can do here is that we
can discuss to Mai's this with a
standard template block right so you you
can just separate your template logic
with your true/false logic so you can
just go here you can see now this is
surrounded by your div tag all right so
this is how basically you would work
with ng-if here now is to take a look at
the next director we have on the list is
ng-switch and in the ng-switch is pretty
much just like ng if it's the same thing
we used to do an programming languages
like for example in JavaScript if you
have if condition then do this else if
do this else and do this and would
switch you can do switch switch whatever
condition and then in case something is
something is something and all that
stuff so it's similar here I can't go
through over that real quick but I guess
you would be able to do that yourself
and in most of the cases in simpler
cases you won't need ng switch anyway so
we're just gonna stick with ng for now
what we can look at next is engine on
bind able well what this does is that
for example let's just say I want to
teach angular to people using angular
framework so I add a heading here which
says something like interpolation
alright let's get started with our docs
so I'm gonna say into polish it is way
angular uses to display variables inside
your HTML using the curly
braces you can display the safe of the
EBU
named name using nail huh looks good I
believe we should be able to teach a lot
of people right let's get rid of this to
be tagged and let's take a look in the
browser okay so we are missing a curly
brace here there we go hmm something
strange I'm learning about interpolation
of a user so I read interpolation is
their heading yep interpolation is a way
angular uses to display variables inside
your HTML okay you can display a
variable named using and something's
missing here what it is oh so we take a
look in the code you can see that we are
actually displaying the name value named
variable we're trying to display that
angular does not know that if I want to
actually display these curly braces or
actually want to echo the name variable
so to fix that what we have is your
engine on bindable
data attribute or what I'm a-saying this
is a directive so
engine on by enable what it would do is
if I write ng on by enable would pretty
much output this thing as it is you can
see that this is equal out as it is
without angular evaluating this
expression so this is how engine known
by table would be used then we have ng
class as well which you know you might
have guessed that could be used to
display a lot of classes based upon
certain conditions so let's just say
let's just say I have something like
data is line JavaScript used on web
let's say lag is Swift used on iOS right
we're good with these two only for now
let's just say I have a ul Li ng for LED
language LED language of data let info
of data let's just say I'm gonna say
info dot language is mostly used on info
dot let's just say use on obviously so
what we can do here to make use of ng
class is that I can say something like
span ng then ng class not active here
and then I can provide here an object so
when I provide I don't check here what
happens is that it would add the keys of
this class keys of this object to the
span class if those expressions are true
so as an example what I can add is
JavaScript
if info dot Lang is equal to JavaScript
just how the matter of fact so
JavaScript right should would add
JavaScript class if info dot line is
JavaScript it would add Swift
if info dot Lang is Swift right so yeah
let's just see that in browser so you
can see that we get to a script is
mostly use from webbed and Swift is
mostly used on iOS
can see that right here we get a class
of JavaScript because that was in sac
JavaScript right and right here we get a
class of Swift because for the in fact
class of Swift make sense I believe yes
so this is how your ng class directive
works and we have covered engine for as
well and Jeff as well ng switch is your
assignment engine on bind able is okay
ng class is done and there would be some
other inbuilt directives which you can
take a look later on if you require them
and yeah basically that's all for this
tutorial and in the next one we're gonna
take a look at how to actually create
your own custom directives with angular
