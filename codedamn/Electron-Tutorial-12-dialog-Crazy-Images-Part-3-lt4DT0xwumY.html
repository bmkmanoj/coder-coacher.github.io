Mei hole and welcome to your 12th
electron tutorial in which I'm gonna
create the rest of the area of the app
instead of just focusing on the toolbar
because especially that is what our app
is all about right so again since we are
making use of angular why not let's just
get into entry views let's say this is
our main content and I'm going to say
this is an interview because these are
cool and now we can play around with the
route provider we have in here okay so
we have the home controller and though
we are on the home page so it's time to
see what goes in here so I'm going to
save this to stay writing file picker
and then we're going to say this is an
open file dialog box and that's it
pretty much
so for this what we need to do is say ng
click pick file something like that and
we can say go to a big file and click
function and here the magic goes if you
want to take a look in a moment but
let's just I'll it first because styling
is important why not
so I'm just going to make it full width
which would pretty much or rather just
let's just make this one high talaguit
edge or let us say minimum height just
in case we exceed our content the place
flex flex Direction column and for main
content main content I'm going to say
flex scroll one so that yep and I'm
going to say this again displays flag
yes that should be it
I guess yep so and finally again we can
just do one more thing here and face
file picker is actually aligned self
stretch right there right here we need
to do flex direction of column here or
rather row okay again we can say with
and the person to it and we can finally
say this is a flex item as well we would
just bring it with Eagle centered okay
so I was trying to keep CSS all at once
but eventually I had to do it
individually so downward and if you take
a look again we see our open file is in
the middle and we can save some more
things to file picker if cursor:pointer
and font size 3 I guess we were playing
with pixels right we can just do one
point five frames I don't know it is
easy to write small numbers pixels is
fine too and there we go so we have our
open file ready now what do we do about
this so now what we are going to take a
look at is the dialog module of electron
which would actually help us to open a
dialog box now traditionally you can do
that with input text file as well but
with electrons dialog you get more
control like the user can just switch
your work to from custom files to all
files so you are probably guaranteed
that the users uploading at least a file
which ends in PNG if not an image but
with the input type file you can just
pretty much change that custom files to
all files and you can go about any file
then all right enough talk
let's get to work so first of all I'm
going to get my dialog which is actually
containing text remote modules right so
let's see what's happening here we're
getting remote from electron and then we
are getting dialog from remote right so
we're going to make use of this dialog
because this is a main process thing and
it's not available in render process so
we're going to make use of remote to get
access to this API and I'm going to say
this is dialog touch so open dialog and
actually you can just jump over to the
documentation as well if you are
confused so it's basically dialog - or
open dialog and then browser windows
optional and the option goes down right
there perfect so let's just begin by
saying that the properties of this
dialog would be open file if we take a
look here you can see that saves me in
properties open file allows files to be
selected which is exactly what we want
you can go with open directory as well
if you are creating an app which
requires you to upload folders right so
I'm going to go with open file now and
finally we're going to make use of
something known as filters which would
help us to filter our files which we
want the user to upload like for our
case it should be just an image file so
I'm going to go name is image this and
actually this should be something like
this and then extension should be shaped
egg shape egg PNG and I don't know let's
just keep it do these threes right now
you can add more image extensions if you
want right you just need to add the
extensions not the dot or anything like
that right so we'll be good to go
you can just read about the filters here
not there but right here there's
somewhere filters right so you can see
that we have decided this thing you can
just go with gif as well I forgot about
that so you can go with movies custom
file types anything like that so the
next thing is the callback what happens
if the user has selected something
function file and then they're going to
council the blog file to see what it
actually is right okay so lots of stuff
going on here
let's see some in action so just click
on this and we already have our errors
so open dialog is not a function and if
you take a look so open dialog is a
function bro oh well that is
embarrassing this should be actually
here right because I do not want dialog
to be just an object inside object so
let's just take a look again hit this
and you can see that we get our dialog
box open and you can see that we just
have access to this images only but if
you would have done this why are HTML
input write file tags then what you
would see something like custom files
and then you can just go ahead and push
select all files here and then select
any other file so that kind of is an
advantage so again what I'm going to go
with a one and let's just in the corn so
we got an array because it allows us to
have actually actually multiple
selections so we're getting away with
the first element being the full path to
the file now let's see if we do not
select any file in it cancel okay we get
undefined cool we can just say that if
file that means the file exists or the
user hasn't actually clicked to cancel
so we can pretty much say
the file name is or actually our file
but it is the what we haven't files zero
right so we are saying when it's fast or
style zero and we're going to need this
but somehow right so we just want to
take a look at that how will we do that
right now I'm going to redirect our
application to edit so that we can now
open the Edit screen and location goes
in here so that we have access to that
and for the right provider we can say
that when it is edit I want template URL
to be the same thing let's just change
the components from home to edit image
and edit image dot HTML and the
controller might be edit controller
right and we can just define an
otherwise twice as well just in case we
mess around we can say template for for
roll anything like that so yeah and
let's see how this looks like for the
app and let's just restart it one last
time and see what it is but we do not
get redirected do we okay so looks like
yeah obviously because this is not a
part of angular right so angular does
not know that our location has changed
so obviously we need to inform angular
that we have updated some changes and
you need to work on them angular so
again if we take a look T 1 we have some
errors what do we have I guess by
guessing from this URL I guess we have
to create components first edit
we can very much create edit HTML gotcha
just like that and II won it is you see
we get gotcha
but we get an error as well which is
some sort of beard error we'll just take
a look at that later on so that is
pretty much how you can make use of this
dialog to show a dialog and there are a
lot of other dialogues as well for
example when we allow the user to stay
we can just go ahead and save so save
dialog and that will show a save dialog
then we have show message box and that
would create a kind of an alert but a
native one so yeah that's all for this
one and if you liked it then please

to see you them in the next video with
continuing this application and
improving this a little bit more so see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
