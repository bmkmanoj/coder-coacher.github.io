angularjs and in this tutorial we'll be
getting some hands-on to angularjs so
first of all what you have to do is you
need to include a library or a framework
of angularjs which would give you the
angular object to work with and you can
do that by including your angularjs file
so this is the URL I'm using a Jack
store Google APs and this is a angular
is a Google hosted library so let's open
this in the browser
and you see here that this is the
library code which is compressed code of
angularjs and you see that it's quite
huge even it's compressed because this
is a framework and if I remove the
minified version then you can see the
elaborated and the clean version and if
you've got some time then go ahead and
try to understand what's written here
though it's not very necessary okay so
once you have included this angular file
we are good to go so angular basically
how it works is that it's kind of
different from the default jQuery or
JavaScript you have been writing so far
all right so before even watching all
these tutorials I highly recommend you
that you are you're having a good
knowledge of HTML and JavaScript and not
to mention in CSS so we need these three
languages perfect before we start
working with angular okay so now once we
have included this file we have got
access to an object called angular and
this angular or object is the core of
this file so
let's quickly write a HelloWorld program
in angular and then I'll show you what
does that do so
or let's say
let's say a credit input day text here
all right so we have got this page right
here this little code where I'm doing
three drinks which you have no idea what
does that mean so first thing I have
done is I have written a ng-app
attribute out of nowhere to HTML and
what does that mean is ng every
attribute starting with ng right here
indicates the keyword angular so ng
basically stands for angular but
obviously you can use them
interchangeably
you have to use ng and - app now this
app means that you are working with the
app in angular and then you need to tell
angular which app are you working with
or basically where to start of the code
in angular so
we'll be discussing about this ng-app
deeply in our later tutorials but just
remember right now that we need this ng
app for angular to know that where to
start your processing of the special
code we write in angular ok the next
thing we have in the input type is ng
model now there are many things in
angular like directives your modules
controllers filters which may sound
confusing right now I know because the
time I learned it it was to me like that
what the heck is going on and I usually
get comfortable with any of the
JavaScript library or framework quick
often but with angular it took me some
time to get familiar with the things
going on so ng model is a kind of in
layman's term it kind of attach whatever
you type inside this input box to a
special thing called I won't mention
variable a special thing called name now
this name whenever used in double curly
braces would output your
texts you have written in this input box
given that these two are inside your app
directive so let's view it in the
browser
and here it is so we have got input type
text oh this should be do I guess
all right so we have got input type text
right here and hello with nothing in
front of it so once I types something
you notice magically this gets
automatically updated to this thing but
in the HTML if you see we have got this
plain text which just says to print out
two curly braces name and two curly
braces so you know now that expressions
in angular are evaluated using these two
curly braces starting one then the name
between or anything you like to have and
the ending two curly braces so ng-model
attach this name one and sends all the
values whenever this is updated to here
or wherever this is used so you could
actually use it a million times
nobody's stopping you to do that and
every time you write it all of these
would get automatically updated so this
is a kind of hello world tutorial to you
guys
and getting a little bit familiar with
angular and don't worry about these
ng-app and ngmodel if you don't
understand it exactly what this is and
before ending this tutorial I could
actually make your concepts a little bit
clearer with this ng-app
so let's say your ng app is right here
and to
and if I reload this our application
still works as desired
but what if I remove this ng app
completely from the code what happens
then so now you see that instead of
getting some black space right here we
are getting output as pure text we
supplied in the HTML file so what's
happening here is that angular do not
know where to start
it's called processing from so ng app
kind of gives angular a base good from
where to start just like in C or C++ or
in Java or any other programming
language we have got the main function
to start off to kick off the program
similarly in angular we have got
something called this ng app ng app
attribute to start with and we'll learn
about what we can give in the value as
the quotes but let's keep those blank
for now so that was a
hello world program with angular cheers
and I hope you are liking angular chess
because we are gonna do a lot of fun
with this bad boy so stay tuned with me
till then and don't forget to subscribe
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
