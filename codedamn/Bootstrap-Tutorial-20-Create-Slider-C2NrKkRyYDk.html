your 28 bootstrap tutorial in which i'm
going to show you how you can create a
slider in bootstrap now slider as you
might have guessed is a kind of you know
a interface where you can just slide
images one by one without you know just
stocking up on above each other so let's
get started not to create a slider you
need a sort of you know oh god of
organized HTML for the bootstrap as well
to understand and to do that first of
all let me just split the page with the
content with the page header again and
what is this they're doing right here
okay so that's container so let's just
say this is slider and for this what we
need is we we need to create a diff okay
and inside this div and just want to add
an idea of something a glass of
something add something of something and
we'll see that soon first of all let's
create the list of slides okay so to do
that let's just go ahead and create
order list and this would have glass of
something and then I want the list item
to have a data target of what it would
target is this ID right here what we
write so i'm going to write my car so
and here as well and this ID is required
as it is so you make sure you copy the
same because this requires this is
required for the bootstrap to work
properly with your slider and i would
leave a hash here because this is an ID
and then i want data slide 2 now this
would accept number and if i do like 0
a class of active then the stills were
to slide the slider to let's just copy
and paste this again and again well just
type it and accordingly change these
numbers 0 1 2 3 and remove the active
class from all others make sure to keep
active on one only you can keep on this
one as well or this one or this one any
one of these allies which contains a
class of active would be the first slide
to show on now here what we need to our
is we need to add cars sold in D caters
and these would be the little dots that
appear then its the slider which helps
you to navigate with slider you'll see
that shortly don't worry and let's just
fix this as well it's at a class of
courcel slide add a data right of course
oh now this all of this is going to make
sense real soon don't worry now all of
this is required as it is because you
see we are not making use of any
JavaScript for the castle however it
depends on JavaScript only so you need
to make sure to follow this pattern all
of that and then when you're done with
that we need to know make sure that the
bootstrap knows that what we want to
display so we want to create slides now
here's where we can create slides so
let's just say this is course so inner
disclosed the diff and
obviously this would be the first item
which is active this one okay and then I
want this to display an image and I've
already open some images here so I'm
just gonna copy and paste a URL so let's
just say this is page and the alt is
optional you can specify it or you can't
so it's up to you so if you want to the
Avengers specify that touch well and in
your heading tag you have to write the
name the heading the main heading which
would be displayed on to your sliders
image so let's just write dodge may help
and inside the P this is the seventh
wonder of the world it's located in
India and trust me it's beautiful so
here's the description of what would
appear under this heading so yeah so
that pretty much sums up our first slide
I'm just gonna do this to a bit more
three and how many images do I have one
two three four four images so yeah so we
are good to go one two three one more
for here we go so the next obviously
won't contain the class of active cause
obviously only one slide can be active
at a time let's just make you love this
one now and I'm just going to keep
everything else same so I'm just going
change the images for these so that they
are at least distinguishable from one to
another
and here you go
okay so once we are done with that let's
just check that out in the browser and
hopefully it should work and this
doesn't look like it's working properly
does it
so let's see what we are missing here
this is a div tag carcel in order and
what is this this is my car so no
problem oh yeah okay so we haven't added
the controls yet so let's just add the
controls as well let's just say this is
left car so control and this is HF of
hash my car sold so just in case it
doesn't jump around the page car sold it
I spell if I'd yeah and data slide
should be previous because I wanted to
slide to the previous slide and
obviously underneath you can add a glyph
icon and I can search for a graph icon
for bootstrap and let's just search for
previous no just not here left yeah see
some on the top yeah so I guess this
will work let's just copy this and paste
it inside our span class of this and
span
and I want this to display as previous
yeah so that's up for this left one
let's just show the same for the right
there should be next obviously and this
should be right probably and this should
be next let's check this out and see if
it works
okay so now you see that we are able to
fastly scroll around our images on the
icons are a little bit you know the
cliff icons are a little bit wrongly
assigned but you know you get the idea
how this all is working so yeah so
that's how pretty much you create
complete slider in your boot strap so if
you want to learn more about that do let
me know and I'll create some awesome and
complex sliders and this tutorial series
only so that's all for the simple slider
and don't forget to subscribe and thank

Mahal as well and go down as well so
that's it and yeah I'll see you then
