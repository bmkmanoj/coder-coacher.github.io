your second HTML and CSS tutorial now in
this tutorial we'll be learning about
what is HTML and why the heck do you
need HTML at all so basically in a day
you will set a number of sites like
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google
Wikipedia and all that so there are
billions of site on internet so your
browser needs a certain standard or a
certain layer to understand what every
service is returning to your computer
for example when you type google.com
down here and press Enter
then your computer's goes to google.com
and says to Google okay return you
something so Google says yeah take this
bunch of code and what is that code
right click and click on view page
source now
Google actually returns you returns your
computer this code
and your computer forwards this code to
your browser which is in my case Google
Chrome so now your browser sees that
yeah this code is HTML don't worry
this is not basically HTML Google is
using some crap code anyways can't
question about Google so the server
sends HTML to your browser and your
browser parses and displaced nice and
neat content to you so HTML is basically
used to create sweet awesome stylish and
supported browser supported versions of
web pages HTML is the language which is
used to develop websites and develop
your web pages
so then what why do we require CSS so
CSS stands for cascading style sheet and
CSS is required to style your elements
for example let's say you have God let's
say you have a kind of game in which you
can rest a man with the suit the pants
and had spectacles must check all of the
dad stuff
so in that game the man would be your
HTML and the dress the colors and
spectacles or hair color or whatever you
apply to man would be the CSS so CSS
it's kind of
kind of adds magic life to your page by
styling your elements setting various
kinds of animations and selectors and
all that stuff which is used to design
your web page basically so HTML gives
you a kind of skeleton layout and CSS is
used to add life to that layout so this
was a short introduction about HTML and
CSS in your day to day life and from the
next tutorial we'll be getting some
hands-on to HTML and CSS coding so I'll
see you then and don't forget to
