Miro and welcome to this tutorial this
not sorry this is not really a tutorial
but just a demonstration of what I was
telling you that why this thing which we
have implemented for the web wouldn't
work on a real Android device and the
reason is that because when you deploy
our application like this right and
again one more thing yeah when I was
deploying this application I encountered
an error this one which said that
promise polyfill is not installed so if
you get this error while doing something
like ionic or over one Android what you
need to do is install this package
inside your directory itself and just do
it one more time and you should be good
to go
so once you do that and all that
building process has happened and all
that stuff then you would be able to see
your application something like this or
maybe this just wait give it a second
and it should load up so you can see
that we have our application here it
looks fine but it won't really work and
the reason is that if we take a look
inside chrome inspector if we inspect
this thing you would be able to well
these are not really any sort of errors
but let's just say when you log in with
Facebook you would see that we get this
dialog box which says open with browser
or use chrome the browser you can do
anything I can go with the browser but
the moment we do that you can see that
we get this error that or trace
authorization operation is not supported
in this environment and the reason is
that because firebase requires the
location not protocol to be HTTP HTTPS
or Chrome extension or whatever with a
few methods which we have right here
like sign-in with pop-up and a couple of
more I guess so you can see even though
this authentication process is going
smoothly
behind the scenes firebase has already
declared that it
would not work anyhow on this file
protocol so this is the reason you need
to have the plugins installed on your
actual application which you're gonna
deploy on Android or iOS so yeah in the
next tutorial we're gonna take a look at
how to integrate that for various social
media platforms using ionic native
plugins so again if you liked it then
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching I'll see you then in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
