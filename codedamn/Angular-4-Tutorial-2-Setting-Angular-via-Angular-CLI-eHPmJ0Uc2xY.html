Mei hole and welcome to your second
angular framework tutorial in which
we're going to install angular and set
it up properly using something known as
angular CLI or angular command-line
interface right so it makes it easy to
set up your angular framework properly
in a folder without doing much of hassle
and downloading and shifting files here
and there right so it's a kind of a tool
for you for the developers to get
started with angular so just say don't
get started and I'm just showing you
sort of the documentation way so even if
something changes in the future which
probably should not now then you are
actually good to go yourself so right
now it saves me CLI click quick start
here so it just tells me a bunch of
stuff it saves me to install angular CLI
globally on first of all for that you
need NBN so if you don't know what this
is or you know you have no idea what I
want you to do is go to this website
node.js org right and download the
latest release for your operating system
and we'll be good to go so as you can
see that angular CLI requires you to
have at least 6.9 version of node.js and
NPM three point X so when you install
node and BM would come automatically
with it right so what you have to do
then is the with your folder where you
want to set up your applications hold
shift and the press right key and open
command window here if you're using
Windows or if all your resuming Linux
ctrl shift e will open the terminal so
just type in whatever it was given here
just copy this line and inside the
terminal
just paste that into enter since I have
already installed angular CLI globally
so I'm not going to do it again but you
have to wait a minute or two for this
two installs completely and it will just
show you that right and the next thing
you have to do is to create a new
project well you can actually check for
your installed version as well by saying
ng to worship hit enter you can see it
shows me angular CLI version 1.1 it
might be a bit higher for you but more
or less is the same thing so the next
thing you can do is just go ahead and
type in ng new new and let's just say
hello world app and hit enter you can
see that it pays me to installing
packages for tooling wire and BM so it
might take some time as the
documentation says as well so I'm just
going to pause the video here and wait
for them to install okay so looks like
it's done and now what we can do it is
just CD into hello world app and the
stay ng serve and that's it
and once you do that you can see that
it's just building some modules and it
saves me to open localhost go to zero
zero and it's using webpack which is
nice so let's just open that and here
you can see that we have our angular app
running completely fine on localhost put
four to zero zero so that is how you
actually set up angular very easily
using angular CLI and yeah that's all
for the story land the next one we're
going to see a little bit of structural
overview of what angular CLI has done
and how we can actually modify it a
little bit so that we can get started
our own programming so that's all for
this one and if you liked it then don't
forget subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
