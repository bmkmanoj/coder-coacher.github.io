Mabel and welcome to your very code
reactors tutorial in which I will be
fixing a few glitches and would be
finally finishing off this tic-tac-toe
right so first of all let me just take
out the story moves logic from state
because that doesn't make a lot of sense
so what we're going to do or essentially
what you can do instead is you can
instead of using a state you can use a
game state and then go ahead and do all
that stuff but but since we have just
video space so let's just keep it that
way okay
the next thing is that we can just take
out the story moves because we need to
immediately check to the moves and check
winner so that is creating a sort of
problem for us so we can create our game
state here and we can moving board in
there and we can even total moves in
there like that we can keep these three
in there right so what we are going to
do next is instead of this we're going
to just say this start game state dot
board is equal to game state that board
game state that board yeah that's it you
do not need this right and then be able
to go and finally inside our results
check winner forgot you game state dot
board and everything else remains the
same this game state dot total moves on
if it's nine then we are going to go oh
this should be this dot game state
instead fair enough match is won by x
which is one my master strong there we
go
so that is how pretty much your
tic-tac-toe game would look like and as
an assignment what I am giving you is
that you have to create a CPU version of
this right and actually I have a hundred
on this as AI but apparently I just
created this as a two-player game so
what I want you guys to do is I'm just
going to give you this code in the
description and I want you to create a
CPU version of this and what this should
look like is like CPUs done and then
there goes some logic in here and what
you have to do in this click function
just randomly assign CPU s-cross and the
player has o and sees the turn is o then
if this does state that turn is equal to
o something like this like that and if
you turn or whatever the larger you want
here and then what's impute on
essentially do is that it computes a
random number between 0 to 8 and it does
it something like do compute random I'm
just giving you a very pseudocode while
the location of your you know grid
location on your grid on your grid is
not equal to empty right so what
essentially this means is that just keep
computing random number as long as your
location on this random number is not
empty so that essentially means that if
your computer has created a number which
is already occupied by the
user then just discard it I again run
the loop and generate another random
number which is not occupied by the user
right so just do that and fill it with
an X or you know whatever your turn is
so yeah you can do that so yeah that is
all for this tutorial and if you liked
it then don't forget subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
