Mayo and welcome to your ninth ionic
tutorial in which we'll be continuing
with our news feed application kind of
which we are developing from past two
tutorials so what we have done so far is
I have made use of this simple ng-repeat
and because of this we are able to get a
simple kind of JSON response inside each
of a list item but we want to do
something better so to do that what I'm
going to do is first of all let me just
create an H - H - and I'm going to say
news articles dot and what it would be
depends really on what I named that in
the PHP so this would be titled so here
we go okay so we have got the titles
right there and the titles actually
require a bit of work for HTML because
it's kind of encoded it has encoded the
the apostrophes and the codes actually
sort off so I'm going to take care of
that later on so for this one we have
got the title then similarly I'm gonna
make use of P tags to get the content
and as you can see this content right
here appears but it's kind of chopped
off because it's bigger than online so
it's you know it's got this much long
but it's kinda chopped off so what I can
do is I can actually just give both of
these as no white space and no white
space and inside if I just make use of
the sidebar and go to my CSS file I'm
gonna say no
like space white-space:nowrap here we go
and if I save this we load this okay
white space okay so it looks like it
doesn't actually care about our styles
so we probably add some weight to our
styles by saying white space let's see
if that helps
no not really so again I'm gonna say add
a bit of more space more weight kind of
I don't just like making use of
important unless it's very important
okay I give up
let's just make use of important hit
reload and what the hell was that are
you serious right now let me just check
this out and white space Oh actually
this wouldn't be no rap this would be
normal because we don't want no rap well
here we go and now we have got a nice
little title and description for that
news right there okay cool now the next
thing let's hide the sidebar for now the
next thing is that I want to link this
news from original source so that the
user can actually just view the whole
news item from the page where it has
come so if I just take a look at the API
again you can see I provide a link right
here for the full article and it just
it's kind of a short link for from news
and shots so I'm gonna say I'm gonna
just wrap this whole article in two or
keine I'm just gonna
make use of let me think let's just try
this out here because html5 now allows
you to wrap the block level elements in
an eh RIF tag as well so this would be
this is going to be a completely valid
HTML so I'm gonna say news article dot
link and pretty much that's gonna be it
so wait a minute okay so that didn't
really help a lot so what we can do is I
can just shift the class item to this
tag as well so now as you can see
actually this whole item is clickable
instead of just the title and the
description so that's kind of helpful
okay so next thing we have got is date
and image so image might be interesting
so I'm going to say this is my IMG SRC
and better make use of the ng SRC so
that angular takes control news article
dot image and probably we are done with
this okay so this kind of works as you
can see we are redirected to Twitter but
you know this is kind of just bursting
out of your mobile screen so you don't
want that so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna make this image shift to the left
a little bit so that the title is
aligned to the right and the content is
below the title and the images on the
left the layout we talked about later on
or I mean all you so for this we don't
actually need to
apply our own CSS though you can but why
do that when things are available by
ionic so I'm going to do item thumbnail
left and hit safe and check that out
what happened so if I can just get rid
of this so as you can see all of the
images are kind of shifted to the left
with equal dimensions so this kind of
looks better than previously now you can
just make this right as well and it
would work equally good like that or you
can just make a left and change
thumbnail to outer and you can see that
it kind of turns into a you know
circular sort of image so this kind of
looks nice but the description is sort
of big if you see then what we can do is
that you can either just trim this
description from the front end or I can
just do that from the back end as well
so that's not a big problem we can just
manage that so we are pretty much done
with this application but a couple of
things are left and probably we haven't
implemented all of the stuff on as well
so if I go to networks tab again and
probably just reload the window or I
guess we have changed pages so right
here we have the date and time as well
left so you can just make use of that
date I'm going to show the date t has
posted on then you can make use of the
news article dot date and then the time
one news article dot time
he and here we go you can see this link
this kind of small little note right
there and you can actually just bind
that into an italics tag if you want to
that was just kind of okay so it won't
tilt because probably an ionic is making
use of the CSS reset so you can just do
that from the CSS as well well that's
not kind of that much important so I'm
just gonna leave it with a dash right
there so that it looks a little bit
different so we are pretty much done
with this application a better functions
are left to implement like this reload
or the new scroller right there so we'll
be taking a look at that how this would
be implemented in the next tutorial and
if you like this tutorial then don't
really subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
