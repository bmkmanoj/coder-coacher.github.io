39 HTML and CSS tutorial in which we'll
be continuing with our HTML page which
we have been building from last couple
of tutorials so let's take a look what
we have done so far so we have created a
header with a divider logo and Diwali
advertisement and cleared the floats we
had applied to these two elements and
now we have got our header as complete
intact so now the next thing we want to
have is the navigation and
if you want your navigation
to be
inside this header inside this limited
width you can do so but if you want it
to be full width you can do that as well
but for now I'll just like to have a box
model of the page and I'll just go ahead
and write navigation inside the header
only so I'll go ahead with divided
navigation and closed the day one and
one thing I should tell you that in
html5 we have got certain mode tags
which basically specified the meaning of
everything we have got header we have
also got enough we have got menu we have
got article we have got section and many
more tags so all these tags on these
tags written here are block level and
would just act like just you are using a
div 1 so they would they are just us
kind of specifying a little bit more
information what they are doing so you
can use article for articles navigation
for navigation like instead of D by the
navigation I could make use of now ideal
aggregation so that it would make much
more sense but for now I'll just go
ahead with the ones because it's kind of
traditional so
I'll go ahead and type in Hewell and
would create some list items inside this
soldier say home about about us
contact on doctors
and dice with us okay so now
the thrill of this page and we have got
this navigation with us and this
navigation looks awful right now because
we have got these tacky bullets
everything in a separate line and no
background and colors so let's see how
we can spice this up a little bit so for
that let's go ahead and select Li in our
CSS selector and I'll go ahead with
navigation Allah this time because we
could have a lot of allies and I don't
want to style every LR on the page as
the navigation ones are being styled so
I'll just select navigation every Ally
which is inside navigation okay so now
first of all I would like to remove
every bullet and I do that with a list
style property unless Thailand specifies
that there should be no bullet so you
could actually specify the list I'll as
square
as circle and as disk so disk is normal
circle you see the changes here keep an
eye on the webpage as well because
everything in chrome dev tools is
dynamic so when I type square the
bullets change to square so I'll just go
ahead with none right now because we
don't want any bullets
asbestos and the stand sheet and now as
we expected we will flow to each of
these as well
so now we have got a problem this line
is basically on the navigation items and
you know now that why it is only
navigation items because the last Li
also says that float:left to me and then
the spirit float:left and then the stave
is not included so the possible fix for
this is using diff glass clear here so
now when I reload this we have got this
problem fixed and now
let's give this navigation a little bit
shades background off it's a black or
not black I'll just go ahead with a
little red or maroon maybe and some sort
of color as white pairing as 10 pixels
what families should be calibrated
because default font is worse
and I'll just said a default font for
whole body actually so that it's
inherited by everyone every member if it
doesn't have any fun specified
and let's just not give the padding to
the navigation I'll tell you the reason
because we could do some more cool
effects if we give padding to our ally
and here we go okay so we have got the
Slovak Asian ready as well and each of
these navigations is a separate
navigation within itself so let's say
let's add some pseudo selectors on it so
I want whenever my Ella is forward the
background should change to a little red
and we'll select this color so now you
see that each of this background is
changed to red but we could actually
customize this
a little bit so this one looks great so
I'll just go ahead with this one I'll
just copy this and this is our first
pseudo selector in this code and I want
this to appear as a cursor with a link
just like illumines
I just went before it by mistake open
the notepad plus plus and I want this
to
be a cursor and for that we're going to
do is I would make use of cursor
property and I would set it to pointer
and when I reload this then we have got
a cursor instead of normal text and
arrow so now this looks much realistic
now
and I'll just remove the border for now
because this is not required actually
I'll reload this so we have got header
and navigation ready now and that's all
for this tutorial
and in the next tutorial maybe we would
be developing a navigation with a
dropped and also so till then stay tuned
with me and don't forget to subscribe
