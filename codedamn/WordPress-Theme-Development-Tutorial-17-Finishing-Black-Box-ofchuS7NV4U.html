and welcome to your 17th WordPress team
the blocking tutorial and in this
tutorial we're gonna quickly finish off
with our black banner right there by
actually making it dynamic and changing
this stuff from dead string to whatever
we enter inside our settings page so I
reload this and say this is a cool
string and save it see that it pretty
much appears here but I wanted to appear
right here as well so the approach would
be pretty much similar to what we have
done right here so we have made use of
this get option black box and pretty
much I'm gonna make use of the same line
inside here as well so it would work
absolutely fine and the reason is that
this black box is the name of the input
field and it's kind of unique so you
know you have to make sure that you make
this unique because you are just
exposing it to every file in your
WordPress so you gotta make it unique
somehow so once we are done with this
reload and here we go and what you can
do now is actually just check the font
to just giorgia and I just Google this
font and looks like it's not actually
available for google fonts so I'm just
gonna prefer google fonts for now so
let's just look for another font which
we can make use of let's just go with
open sans only normal or maybe we could
just go with bold for now and we just
need this thing right there go to your
header dot PHP and you could actually
make this stuff as well dynamic so there
we go
this is open sans inside our style dot
CSS
and say that the font for this one is
open sans second one the sans-serif if
the font is not available
save reload and looks like here we go
so you could pretty much add a bit of
more styles like font size 30 pixels or
even 40 pixels and a light color
something like that and I guess open
sans bold it's kinda harsh so let's just
change it to open sans only so reload
and here we go looks cool and you could
actually replace the section from a
string to HTML and actually this would
probably work as an HTML as well so it
would say like google.com a save this
and here we go there's a problem
I've reload this there's a problem too
and the reason is that because we are
not actually sanitizing before actually
just writing it into our value attribute
so you can do like scale attribute I
guess that would make it work save it
reload and the grey banner you can see
that link is there but since there are
no Styles associated with it so it kinda
is just a bit shy so anyways you could
probably just change it to text only
reload here we go nice and simple so
that's all for this tutorial and from
the next tutorial onwards I'm gonna move
down a little bit more and probably this
would be our post sections so we are
going to reach
most dynamically three at a time and
yeah so that would be pretty much it and
for this upcoming event we'll see how we
can just call this out so if you like
