first tutorial for WordPress team
development my name is May hole and in
this whole development series we are
gonna take a look at how to create
awesome and cool WordPress themes for
your blog or for your business or
whatever the reason you are here and
with WordPress you can pretty much do
anything you want to do on your website
because what Briss takes in database it
takes in front-end it takes in backend
so you can pretty much do anything you
have access to the browser of the
clients computer and your own server
computer plus databases to store data
so what press makes use of PHP in case
you want to know as a back-end language
and for themes purpose what press has
got a whole documentation as well for
the code reference but we're gonna make
a team from scratch and this whole
series and this team right here you see
2015 is a wordpress default theme which
is provided by wordpress and as you can
see it kind of sucks
so this theme I don't know it doesn't
make a lot of sense to me though they
have tried their best to you know this
sidebar thing it's actually kind of cool
but this is kind of faded sort of theme
so you wouldn't like to have this sort
of theme on your business website you
might want to check out sites like apple
apple or you can check out Microsoft you
can see on these websites you see that
the navigation is elegant then you have
got a slider sort of and all of these
icons then on Microsoft you can see that
they had this large banner which just
shows a sort of thing first then if you
scroll down the things are laid
elegantly pretty much everything looks
good so
this is a sort of team you might want
for your business and for blogs you can
just route and go with some popular
blogs so finding these teams sort of is
kinda you know time-consuming but
obviously not as much as coding a team
but still if you are not satisfied with
the team and you buy it and the
developer is non-responsive then you are
in a lot of troubles so you don't know
the team development and you're stuck
with a non-working team so with
WordPress development tutorials not only
you could just code your own teams but
actually just modify your pre-existing
teams to make them look cool and better
so before starting off with the
development I would highly recommend you
to first of all learn HTML CSS
JavaScript and PHP a little bit if not
all before starting because what press
makes use of all of them and don't worry
about databases we wouldn't actually
need to interact a lot with databases
directly because WordPress framework
would take care of that but in some
cases we might need to so that's all
pretty much for this tutorial and if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
