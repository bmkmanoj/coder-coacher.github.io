May hope and welcome to your 11th
MongoDB tutorial in which i'm going to
show you how to make use of the
increment and decrement modifier to
pretty much update a value which is an
integer or a fluid or you know something
which is updateable right so let me
first of all real quick create a new
collection let's just say this is I
don't know Google Analytics right not
insert then I'm going to insert an
object and what this object would be is
something like website it's kinda like
analytics built on top of MongoDB right
so that would be pretty cool actually if
that happens but by the way I guess
Google is right now you can use a big
data or something as their solutions for
storing data well anyways so website is
go down then I want to say that hits as
zero right so let's start from the
bottom and here we are let's just build
this and see that it inserted one record
and just clear this out and say d v dot
Google Analytics dot find dot pretty
right so it shows me hits as zero and
make sure this is not enclosed in quotes
because that would be a string then
right so now what I want to do is I want
to update my hits counter whenever
somebody visits my side well the
visiting part is handled by the back end
whatever you're using node or PHP or
whatever then what do you want to do is
you want to call mongodb Organa make a
call to their database to update that
well obviously you want to updated by
one only but when you're creating some
gains like you know whatever you want to
update the score or something by 50 so
you can do that as well so how you do
that is that you write DV not what was
the name actually d b dot Google
Analytics dot update again that same
thing but it is going to make use of a
modifier I'm going to say that this is
website to be cold and calm and
obviously you would like to match the
field the criteria from website instead
of hits because you don't know hits
actually you can do that eway so
websites is hits and then what you want
to do is actually you want to say that
increment now this I and see what this
means is that you have to increment and
what you have to increment is actually
your field right there so for the arc is
its hits right so hits and then the
value to increment right so if I write
one here then it would increment hits by
one if I change it to set what would
happen is that after every hit after
every call this code would is set hits
21 right so that's not very useful what
we want to do instead is right ink which
stands for increment so now if I run
this piece of code you can see that it
and mashed one and if I run this again
and again and again and again and again
and again and again well that's enough
so now if I look here you can see that
our hitch has changed to eight right so
if you just pause the video and go back
and count how many times I did that and
again and again you would find that I
did at eight times
it's so that's pretty cool right now
what I can do instead is I can decrement
it as well and for that that's pretty in
a common I can just pass in minus one
instead of one so if I do it again and
again and again and again and then again
I so once you are done with this and you
just run that you can see that our hitch
has changed to negative 3 and that is
because I ran it 11 times now right so
now what happens with this is that
instead of like if you make use of set
then you are querying the database once
and then database returns to the code
then you are writing some code to
increment then you are saying the
database to set the new value to this
one right so it's a two way trip Connor
you first you first enquiring the
database and then you are sending some
sort of command to database to just
update the value but with increment what
happens is that you just send this code
you just inform Mongo to update this
unmon go on the place on the place of
that you know the document it just
simply updates that thing so that is how
pretty much you can increment and
decrement using this ink modifier and
yeah so that's all for this one and if
you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
