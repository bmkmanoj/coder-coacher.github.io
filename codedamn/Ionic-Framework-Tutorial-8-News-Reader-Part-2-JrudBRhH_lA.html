your seventh or eighth I guess ionic
tutorial I don't know I don't remember
the number stop nicely so in this
tutorial what we are going to do is I'm
going to show you how we can retrieve
the data from this endpoint right here
which I just showed you in the last
tutorial and put them on just get news
on our application the mobile
application so first of all what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna get rid of this
tabs layout probably we'll try this out
in some another application so I'm going
to bring back the ion content which we
remove it for the tabs layout and then
what I'm going to do I'm going to create
a simple list
now what this list would do is actually
it would just keep your items organized
so for example you go out a single news
and you know you just want image on the
left and a title then a description then
link so if you just kind of start doing
it manually then for an HTML page you
might just complete that in a half an
hour or so but for mobile devices you
need to consider a lot of stuff like you
know every mobile device has a different
sort of screen then there's different
DPI for font sizes and you know just the
things start getting weird
so to avoid all of that we'll make use
of ionics inbuilt classes and angular's
directives for our support now what we
have for ionic is you can simply go
ahead and create a simple list with a UL
class list you will let me show you if I
add Li item one and save it Li item two
you see that it got looks like a list
but it isn't actually one and trust me I
have no idea why probably we are missing
an item class here yes
so you need a list with the UL and an
item with a lie so you know you get the
idea that this kinda looks like a mobile
phone view only you know you can just
track you just stretch the things on
your mail phone that rubberband sort of
effect so actually don't need you will
and I'll add all you can just make use
of any other tag the important thing is
that you make use of these classes
because these classes are important so
for this application are not going to
make use of this UL and Allah I'm going
to make use of section and article you
can make you love Dave as well it's up
to you it's just that the section on
articles sort of just give you a look
for an html5 stuff so these are some
dummy items not coming back to the work
what we need to do is actually yeah so
we need to edit this module as well so
I'm going to change the name as ng half
from starter let's just say news up and
as you can see the things are crashing
because it's better to just name it
app right here and a semicolon won't
hurt much then up here so I'm gonna
leave that app run stuff down there
because that's important to you know
initialize your application this kind of
looks you know just technical sort of
stuff the comments also says that don't
remove this line unless you know what
you are doing so it's better to just
leave these this sort of code alone so
the next thing we need to create a
controller well I'm going to just create
a controller right here ng-controller
let's just say my news controller and
let's just say this is news controller
because my news controller looks like
kiddush sound off so controller
use controller function then obviously
we'll just pass in the good old friends
the scope-1 and the HTTP one and the
HTTP one is for making requests so what
I'm gonna do and is first of all let me
just get rid of this thing right here
somewhere I'll just close this as single
article let's just say this is my news
right there and for HTTP sorry about
that we're going to create this thing
right there I should have a method of
get then URL would be go down calm that
stuff right there don't forget to prefix
it with an HTTP already now once you're
done with this then function data let's
just say console log data for now and
probably just get this out
console all right so I guess I had no
access allow I'm not set this up so I'm
just give me a sec I'm gonna do that on
my PHP file all right Tom made changes
to my PHP script and I have allowed only
localhost so let me just window dot
reload this or location or reload
actually all right okay just give me a
sec okay so now I'm done start off and
one thing you know what is that this
this code right there this JavaScript
code this method get' would only work if
you are requesting this from exact URL
of local host and port number of eight
one zero zero so i have restricted
access to this file by a javascript file
for only boat number eight one zero zero
for localhost I know it's gonna be in a
bit so if you can then just change this
boat number if you have a different
number then change this to eight one
zero zero or if you're running this it 1
0 0 only then there's no problem so if
you are running this one then you'll see
something like this once you load this
so as you can see we get an object as a
response so we have God response the
data key right there inside the response
and it contains all of our content so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say right
there
first of all let me just create a scope
but use a denarii and I'm gonna say
scope dot News is data dot what we had
let's just name is
use data to avoid confusion use data dot
data all right now as you can see we get
a lot of data right here but this card
is trimmed because of you know this some
sort of styles are applied to this this
white-space:nowrap actually this this is
responsible for one liner of this data
so what I'm gonna do is probably inside
index dot HTML I'm going to say
ng-repeat
and what I'm gonna do is use article in
news and I'm gonna say an English
article right here okay so looks much
better but still we have got as a JSON
response so you know this scanner looks
good but you still need to parse it a
little bit to be able to you know just
you know just take this application life
for your users you don't want the end
users to see a JSON response and then
just automatically interpret like that
so majority of the thing we have done in
this tutorial and in the next tutorial
I'm going to show you how to parse the
state a little bit so that it looks
nicer so yeah that's all for this
tutorial and if you liked it then don't
forget subscribe and thank you for
