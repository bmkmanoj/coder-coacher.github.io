JavaScript tutorial in this tutorial
we'll be looking at something called
global and local variables along with
functions in JavaScript to start with
let's learn what are functions now
functions in JavaScript are followed
with the keyword function followed with
the keyword of the name of your function
let's say I create a function my
function and I create some rights of
call here down here now when I call this
function
inside the script tag then all this code
inside here gets executed for instance
if we write document all right then plus
25 then and be calling and they're
calling this function down here then it
should do a document dot write off 35 as
you can see here coming to the global
from the global variables and the local
variables let's create a variable named
name is equal to mu and alpha the
function
change Smith
is equal to
bro
it's color so many people have the same
anyways i call the function change name
here and i alert
now what you expect to see is this
should alert the way prom as we are
modifying the value of people to brown
in this function and yet quality get
asked but what actually happens is when
we reload the page you see only me hold
the word me alone this is because
the function declared in this change
name is actually local to this function
name that is if we try to alert name
here then only would show brown
otherwise outside on this function the
scope of this variable only with sides
within this function if we do an alert
inside the function then you can see
brown and then again because we do this
this variable right now is local
variable to this function to make it
global we either do remove the VAR
keyword or we do something called window
dot you know what happens now this if we
try to alert
name inside it the name is brown and
outside also the name is changed to
brown now in the first case we were
using the war keyword which creates
created a local variable with the
structure name but when we changes to
window then it modified the window
variable name which is in the root of
the script tag name and modify the value
to drop so I hope the difference between
local and global variables and be clear
in this tutorial and in the upcoming
tutorials will be will learn about
functions and these kinds of variable
stuff in detail thank you for watching
