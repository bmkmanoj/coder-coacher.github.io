your eighth jquery tutorial and instead
of continuing with the event handlers
part i guess it is the right time to
teach you guys what are selectors in
jquery and i have been using selectors
in past in my file scripta cheers like
this input selector but haven't
explained you in a while that what it
does and basically how to use selectors
in jQuery so let's see what to select us
in jQuery now selectors are basically
not anything but elements of your HTML
document so for example you have a span
down here say two spans down here and in
jQuery you do span now what would this
do is it would select all the elements
all the basically all the spans in your
document in which you are calling the
script file and this would return a kind
of object or an array to check ray or
and to you to work with so let's say I
do span
dot remove this is a method which
basically simply removes the element
from the Dom tree so let's see it in
action okay so i have this file from the
last tutorial let's say okay so we have
the script ready and this already did
its task by removing these pant acts as
you can see we don't have any span now
in the Dom tree and the style tag is
basically generated by one of my
extensions down here so no need to worry
about those so
this is kind of a selector and selectors
basically are followed by a dollar sign
or the word jquery and with parenthesis
goes the selector so we have various
kinds of selectors and selectors
basically depend on the element name or
element class or element ID and many
more things so for example if i give
this input box an ID of let's say my
input box so i have two ways to select
this input box right now first is the
input traditional input by using its
elements name and the next one is the my
input box followed by an hash idea so if
you have ever done CSS I hope you have
so you know that this would select the
ID which is my input box just like CSS
we have the selector down here to work
with my input box
so the next thing we have is like
classes we have this class a span class
a so we have if I do dot a then this
would apply to both of these because
both are having the Class A but
supposingly I want to remove only div
with class of a then what I'll do is
I'll type the element name first then
the class name so it goes like something
like this either you type only the tag
name only the tag name or you type only
the class or ID name or you type tag dot
class or tag hash ID and four of all
these four are valid so basically we
could also do like span and make sure to
write all these in quotation marks
because if you don't write in quotation
marks then they would be treated as some
special selectors which I'll be
discussing
so we have spanned out a then it would
select all these pants having class in
which is currently just one so if we try
to write the equivalence of these in
JavaScript let's see how to modify the
HTML to 123 and HTML of four five six so
let's say I want to write the equivalent
of these in JavaScript
so the equivalent of these in javascript
is i can do either document dot get
element elements by ID and what do I
have ideas is a and i would like to
selectively because div is occurring
first basically occurring earlier than
the span so the ID at 0 would be diff
and the one would be span so dot inner
HTML it is one two three so document dot
get element by elements by oh this
should be closed down here glass made
sorry
women's bike last name then we have my
class name a one inner HTML should be
four five six so this line is basically
equal to this line this line is
basically equal to the side so you can
see the difference in the syntax and the
complexity this one looks quite a
complex one unreadable and basically
looks our technical line but this is
quite user-friendly as it says select
Dave dot a and replace its HTML with 123
so that's how basically select this work
in jQuery and we'll be discussing more
on selectors in our future tutorials so
