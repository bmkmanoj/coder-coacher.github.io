Google Chrome extension development
tutorial in which we'll be learning
about something called chrome tabs API
that's been a while that since I created
a video for Google Chrome extensions
because I was busy with my exams and
some other stuff but now try to create
videos for the series because Google
Chrome has been adding a lot of new abs
with every release and I have something
called experimental features also to
discuss with you guys so in this video
we'll be looking at something called
chrome tabs API now this is not a single
API but there are many api's under this
API so in this tutorial I'll be just
beginning with the chrome door tabs and
as we move on we'll be learning about
more api's of this now if you look at
the documentation it kind of look Haffa
because there are a lot of aps and the
discussion doesn't seem to be very
pleasing so let's start with this basic
example okay first of all what does
chrome dot APR does and where is it
available now this chrome dot API sorry
the chrome of tabs API this API is
available in background page are in pop
approaches I don't think that it is
available in content scripts because you
don't actually need that to be available
actually so this is available in
background and pop-up dutchy script
that's what which appears here yeah and
using this quick you could actually get
the information of the current tab or
any other tab of the Google Chrome
browser inside your JavaScript
so and you can even create tabs and do
other stuff which we'll be doing in this
one so let's take a look how to
implement this API first so first of all
as the documentation says you need to
have the permission tabs so in the
manifest or JSON get the permissions
tabs and all URLs this is not needed
actually right now so this much would be
sufficient make sure you are running
with Bagon script or make sure you're
running with it
popup script but I would be doing that
in background script for now now I have
background purchase file here so what I
can do is I could do like Chrome Tod
tabs don't now after this we have all of
these ideas right here all of these
methods so for now what I'll be doing is
I'll be getting started with the create
one which is the simplest one I guess so
Chrome the tabs that create would
actually create a new tab from your
background or Chia script now remember I
told you that background Egeus runs in a
complete different environment it
doesn't know about what's happening
inside the current page of the users so
you need to make a bridge between the
current page and the background
JavaScript which is served by the chrome
dog tags API so let's make you the form
the tab should create and using this API
what we can do is we can create new tabs
within background watch a script now
this API is pretty simple to implement
because it doesn't require a lot of
things to do if we look at the
documentation we see that
for Chrome door tab start create we have
do arguments as object create properties
and function callback so obviously you
know that callback function is the
function which executes when this
operation is successfully done so this
would accept first of all an object and
it call that function so let's create a
function callback and let's apply some
data here let's say data I'm just going
to log the data follower and in the
create I will create a new tab with the
URL so let's check it out how it works
let's reload the extension and as you
can see as soon as I reloaded without my
intervention this new tab opened with
Google Chrome gone and if I reload this
again you can see that it opens
automatically
so this Chrome that tab should create
API can be useful when you launch your
extension on the web store and you want
to display a Talco message for the users
who install your extension so you can do
like if if first run then do like this
and you could actually customize the
first one variable by storing it in
Chrome but storage or whatever I'll
leave that up to you so chrome the tab
should create and inside the data
object you see that we got all the
details of that object and using this we
could actually crap details like also
log log data dot URL and when I will
reload this and check this out
you see a God HTTP google.com as it so
that's it for this tutorial and the next
one would be learning more about Chrome
the tabs that create and some other ApS
as well so don't forget to subscribe and
