Mitchell and welcome to your 27th
angular 6 tutorial in which we're gonna
discuss about types in angular 6 what
they are and pretty much how to work
with them so let's get started okay so
types you can think of pipes something
like which change the output in some way
or other which helps you format your
output a little so that you don't have
to manually code that functionality as a
function every time you are doing that
for example let's just say you won't do
format a number to two decimal places
right every time you want to format such
a number what you can do is you can
actually create a function in your
typescript file and then inside your
interpolation expression you can call
that function with the argument that
particular number that is fine but what
we have in angular is actually pipes
right and what pipes do is that not only
they allow you to actually look at more
cleaner but you can also nest the pipes
sure you can nest the functions as well
but then if we become very hard to read
and manage eventually so let's see what
these pipes are in this video we're
gonna see what inbuilt pipes are and
we're gonna come to the custom pipes
later on okay so in built pipes pretty
much means that you can customize or you
can basically change the format of one
type of date to another type you can
make stuff uppercase you can make stuff
lowercase you can format a number as a
currency value or as a percentage value
so these are pretty much what angular
gives you out of the box sure you can
code your custom pipes we're going to
take a look at that
later on yeah before actually starting
with the coding pad what I just want to
clear out is that if you want to
download the source code for anything
related to this web series what you have
to do is just go to this repository here
maybe lmpd slash angular 6 YouTube and
master branch is not really the branch I
would suggest you to clone just go to
this log in app is the branch which is
consists of the app when the Laughton
was complete you can clone this
registration app branch to get all the
files which are just just before this
video right so the last video in the
last video we completed kind of you kind
of completed the app the registration
apps so this goal is just before this
video so you can just clone this branch
and do NPM install and start working and
fiddling around with it and you should
be good to go okay so now first of all
this is pop back to our vs code here and
let's just zoom in a little so that it's
easy to see and now we are done with
this what I want to do is basically
start a new project anyway so let's just
say I go back to my terminal and go back
and I say something like Angie but let's
just say and let's just create this new
project by saying Angie new and let's
name it something like pipes I don't
know but that's just a couple of
tutorials so yeah fine so we just named
our project pipes and I will let it
install its dependencies now I believe
it might pick something from cache but
I'm not sure so let's see
okay so once that's done if you take a
look inside pipes and I say let's say I
say and you so here
you can see that the build has started
and meanwhile it's building let's just
open this in vs code all right so now if
we take a look inside our app component
here we would be able to see we have an
HTML file here we can just remove this
and we can say hello world something
like this here and yep hello world and
what we can do is just go to localhost
for two zero zero you can see that we
get hello world in place and what
happens if we do something like my hello
world somebody owes me amount right so
what if my app component right here has
amount equal to hundred just a second
while stabbing ambition so smaller
anyways so yep
let's just say this is one 11.25 let's
just say so now if take a look in the
browser you can see that we get somebody
owes me 1-0 1.25 not so useful and what
I want to do is actually formatted other
currency let's just save and see what
happens so you can see that what angular
does is that it immediately adds a
dollar symbol here which might not seem
like a lot of improvement but how we are
using this filter is important we are
adding a pipe symbol here and then we're
writing the name of the filter since
this is an inbuilt filter it's not a
filter it's a pipe since it's the
inbuilt pipe we can just pretty much add
this pipe symbol here and write the name
of that inbuilt pipe now what's the
common convention of the common syntax
or rather not common the actual syntax
is your variable here then your pipe
pipe one option one option two option
three so on and so forth then pipe two
option one option two so on and so forth
right so what I can do here is I can do
something like currency and then write
INR so what what it means is that now if
we reload this you can see that instead
of a dollar symbol we get a rupee symbol
which is the symbol for Indian currency
for example if I write e you are here
which is for euro euros we get a Euro
symbol right so the option one which the
angular team has decided for this
currency and build pipe is the actual
format in which you want to display that
currency similarly if we take a look
here inside this currency pipe you can
see that right here we can see
what angular team has decided so you can
see that the first option is the
currency code the second option is the
display the third is digit info and the
fourth is the location you can see all
the description here the currency code
is what interests us right now display
indicates whether you want to show the
symbol for that particular currency or
not right and that's what pretty much we
have done right now
and what we can do is for example let's
say I want to toggle between different
currencies so what I can do is I can
create a button here which on flip says
toggle INR and USD let's say right and
what it does is toggle currency and
instead of hard-coding this we can say
format here something like this so now I
can define the format as INR and what I
can do is not really INR but what we can
do is define it as a get property get
format is let's say return INR is true
then I want to return INR otherwise I
want to return USD let's just quit this
INR variable here which is true but this
what I do not obviously but what we want
is that once I do run this method this
store INR should be toggled right so now
if we take a look inside browser you can
see that we get rupees here I can toggle
currency changes to dollar I can toggle
again rupee you stall our peace dollar
not so helpful in case of currencies
because you want to change the amount as
well then so what you can do is you can
actually define this amount as a get
property as well
you can see that if INR is true or
rather this dot INR is true what I want
to do is let's say this is my private
actual amount in USD is let's say 50 and
if INR is true we're gonna do something
otherwise you're gonna return the actual
USD amount if INR is true that means I
want to return the price in Indian
rupees so let's just take the conversion
factor of 65 here let's just assume that
so now if you take a look you can see
that we get somebody who's made three to
five zero we can toggle it and it
converts to $50 thing you can do with
other filters are the predefined filters
we have right here you can see date
filter upper case lower case currency
and person and you would be able to find
the options for these filters inside
your angular documentation only and you
would basically require them as and when
you need so this was a quick tutorial on
how to make use of pipes in angular and
basically the default pipes so that is
all for this tutorial and I'll see you
then in the next one and one more thing
