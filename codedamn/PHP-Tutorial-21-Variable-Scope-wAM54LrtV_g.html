welcome to a 21st PHP tutorial in which
will be looking at a function scope in
PHP now variable scope is usually a
function scope in PHP because I don't
know PHP is made to work like this so
what happens with a variable is that
lets say i have created a variable my
war is one here and i have a function
here let's say test function and here i
want to echo my water now this won't
work and why because in PHP inside a
function you cannot exist the variables
declared or used outside a function add
the variables declared or used inside a
function you cannot use them outside a
function now these two statements have a
big difference so let's say I have my
bar equals 100 so here now this is
defined but this isn't overriding the
value declared here so if i do like echo
my wire here then this would still echo
1 but if i do like test function here
and i echo a new line here so as to
separate the view then this would echo
hundred and this would echo 1 so let's
take a look I'll just forget to enclose
that in double quotes so you see the
first one is 100 and the second one as
well so you see that the value of my war
isn't over written by this function now
what happens if I remove this now
obviously this function doesn't have a
chance to know what my bar is so forth
it it is undefined right now so if I
reload this you can see that notice
undefined variable my war and all that
information right here so that's a scope
working in PHP and this is how scope
works in PHP so you
can't have variable access which are
declared outside a function in the
function and declared in the function as
outside a function so it's kind of a
thing like on what happens in a function
remains in a function so yeah you can
interpret it like that but there are
some variables are you can say some
Global's as super Global's now we would
be learning about those in a few
tutorials only and those super Global's
can be accessed anywhere in your script
so they are that's why they are called
super Global's so we'd be looking at
them what they are and how to make a PHP
script using them and that's it for this
tutorial and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
