Mei hole and welcome to your fourth
tangela tutorial in which I'm going to
discuss about components and this
decorator component in angular so
angular has been using the es 7 syntax
for decorators and what that essentially
means is that angular with the help of
this component decorator provides extra
information to the component what the
component is and what it's going to do
right so as I have told in my angular 2
video as well right here inside your
component you have this selected tag
which is a fruit which informed that
this component is targeted on this tag
right here right and the template for
this component would be this after
component or HTML and the style URL is
an array which consists of all the
Styles used by the component so
basically what happens is that a
component
area and then let us say you have footer
as well so you can pretty much
distribute all of your website into
different components right so every
color is another component and you can
have components inside component and
then finally what this is right here is
your root component root component right
so right now our app root is the root
component of our application which
consists of the full application and
then further we can just split our
application into different sort of
components depending upon how our
application should look so if you are
kind of developing a blog template or
something so it would probably look
something like this only but you know
you get the idea how components are
actually how you can map them to
graphical interface right so more or
less the components consist of what you
see as individual on the screen and then
if you take a look and the documentation
in the metadata properties it says it
tells us a lot of properties which we
can have but currently we are having
just three the selected template URL and
style URLs which is enough for us to get
started
so you can see that we have this
animations and ideas this one is new in
angular 4 so we have animations change
detection encapsulation and all that
good stuff they're going to discuss
later on in our application so again a
component is nothing but a part of your
webpage which is laid in your
application right so what you can do is
you can actually create components who
are command line as well so that open
command window here and start writing
like ng space chief component and then
let's just say how to create a header
write a nice intro
now you can see that it saves me that it
has created header components CSS HTML
typescript
echo typescript and die trip so what
essentially a component consists of if
we take a look in here is the CSS file
which defines all the styles the HTML
file like it saves me header works which
is the view and the typescript file
which is the logic of the file so more
or less angular is model-view-controller
type of framework where this is your
life script file is your file where all
the little chicken goes then this is
your HTML file which is your view file
and then finally we have the CSS file
which is used for designing your
component right so I can see that we
have pretty much two components the
first one is our root component which is
you can say this creek gray box right
here and the second one is our header
component which is this orange box right
here so that's how really much you
create a component and that's what
components are in angular so that's all
for this one and if you liked it then
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching I'll see you then in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
