sixth PHP tutorial in which will be
looking at how do you do automatic with
n PHP so let's create some variables
number 1 100 number 2 200 now let's say
I want to print there some so what i can
do is echo or print whatever you like
number 1 plus number two well the space
doesn't matter you could actually do it
like this or like this or a one like
this so that pretty much does matter so
if i open this page on the browser added
enter then you see that the output is
300 so obviously we know that 100 plus
200 is 300 now let's say i want to
multiply these two numbers so i'll do
echo number one x number to the
traditional way of doing that plus
stands for addition start stands for
multiplication this bar stands for
division and what else this stands for
modulus I hope you guys know modulus
what it is if you don't then don't worry
and then that stands for subtraction so
let's do them one by one quickly so here
you go plus minus divided
and what else plus minus multiply divide
and modulus ok so lets it go a break
whoa hey go let's reload so you see that
it gives us 304 addition correct two
stents hundred thousand one stands
hundred thousand under the lab 200,000
for the multiplication well that's
embarrassing and then the subtracting
100 from 200 gives us minus 100 dividing
hundred upon 200 gives us point five and
modulus now if you don't know what
modulus is mod of a number means what
remainder it leaves when i divide
hundred by 200 so when you do hundred
from 200 then obviously
you get 11 sorry this should be actually
200 that's not seriously embarrassing so
we get the quotient as zero and we
subtract here minus zero and we get the
remainder as 100 so this 100 is a good
here so number one mod number two which
is hundred mod 200 means what would be
the remainder when we do 100 x 200
simple as that so this was a little
tutorial on automatic of PHP well you
can say so that's it for this tutorial
and in the next tutorial we'll be
starting off with some real stuff and
BHP I know it has been boring so far in
PHP but it's going to get hot from now
so don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
