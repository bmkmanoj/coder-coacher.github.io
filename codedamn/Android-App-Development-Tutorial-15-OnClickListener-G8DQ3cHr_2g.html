May ho and welcome to your 15th Android
application development tutorial in
which I'm gonna show you on click event
for Android
now one-click pretty much works same if
you have worked with web like unclick
fires when you click on an element but
the analogy for mobile devices is that
on click would fire whenever you touch a
particular view now what happens is that
like if you want to add some interaction
with this button what you can do is you
can set an on click event to this button
and it would fire that particular method
which you have in your main activity so
unclick or actually events are pretty
interesting because you have a couple of
ways to do so for Android now you can do
that in XML or you can just purely do
that in the activity itself well
actually you could pretty much do
everything what you are doing in XML
into your activity so that is because
this XML kind is rendered by your Java
file so eventually in one way or another
you are actually coding all these things
for your device only so I'm gonna show
you the very first method for setting up
an onclicklistener and that would be to
make use of Android on click now pay
close attention here because these
things are going to save your life later
on so Android on click would accept a
name of the method you want to fire
whenever this button this particular
button is clicked so let's say this is
my own my first method let's just say
that now what happens is that this is
the name of your method and this would
be fired whenever this button is clicked
so let's just move our go to mirror
activity dot Java and now what you need
to do is that many people would do this
wrong make sure your method
is public and this is very important
because XML doesn't actually XML has to
access this particular method but it is
not called from your particular course
so if you just change this to private or
protected XML wouldn't be able to call
this method now the thing is here that
you are making use of XML to set an
onclick event method that is why you
need to set this to public if you have
implemented that if you have had
implemented that in this java class only
then you could have said this to private
or protected whatever you wish
but with XML you need to set it to
public because XML needs to call that
instead of Java now so public void my
first method and what you need to do
here is given up view of V or whatever
name and just import that if it asks you
so so what happens is that whenever this
button is clicked and where would throw
in information about this button as well
as a view in the argument for this my
first method automatically so you could
have access to all the properties
related to this button using this V as
an argument but I'm just gonna right now
say that toast dot make text and I'm
gonna say that this is good application
context then I'm gonna say this is my
text I was clicked and I guess I haven't
explained toasts as well so anyways this
kind of looks you know self-explanatory
but I'm just gonna explain that later on
then long or short you could have either
on going on there and don't forget to
show the toast so what we are making use
of is this method again with an XML and
then this method defined inside our XML
inside our in Java class so it's time to
fire off gain emotion and they start
application for that so here we go start
the phone
let's just wait for it so here we go and
you could actually close that once the
emulator is on so just say that let's
just wait for it to boot up so we are
and probably let's just go on and hit
that because the time it would take to
build would be sufficient for it to
initialize its settings so as you can
see the app is building and you could
just now we get around a bit so let's
just wait for it for now
and we are still waiting for it to build
and it's installing now here we go
so we have three buttons just like our
layout showed us and if I click on the
school button you can see that I was
clicked popped up as a toast and you
know this is the thing which made that
happen
and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
show you another method for creating the
same click event but with the help of
good now so actually I prefer myself in
the code one because you know it is kind
of XML kind of is used for layout
purposes it's like you know you don't
just create your layouts in Java and
append them actually you know if they
are not kind of dynamic so you don't
need to actually make use of even
handling in XML XML has its job to do UI
it's not you know it should not be
related where the event handling it
should be just related with the UI so
even with this you could actually make a
click event happen now what you need for
that is that number one thing you need
to somehow get this button so in Java
your Java right now it doesn't know
about that let's just make sure we write
our code above the override or below it
so your Java doesn't know about this
particular button right now so we need
to make sure that Java knows about that
so what we can do is I can write button
as my first button and the reason this
is a button because it is a button so
this is a type inherited from view and
was it some wizard but it's still love
you
so but in my first button is what you
have to do next is say find view by ID
now this is why IDs are important
unnecessary because you could then
target particular elements with the help
of Java easily so these this have an ID
of b1 and I'm gonna say this is our that
ID dot b1
now what the heck is our here well our
is a special class this is odd or Java
it's actually a class and your Android
itself and let me just change to project
first so I don't Java is actually a
class which is built which is created on
one time and it contains all the access
to your resources basically so our dot
Java would contain access to this b1 ID
under one time so you can kinda this our
file is a bridge to your programming
interface and your application interface
which the user sees so it still gives us
an error because it saves me
incompatible types which is required one
is required one why the heck is it
flickering require one is our own widget
button and found this under view view
now okay so we can fix that by
explicitly saying that hey Java this is
actually a button so the reason we need
to do this is that Java would by default
just find an element which has this
particular ID which are returns and it
doesn't care about how it looks like as
you can see that it says fine view by ID
instead of like fine button by ID or
find anything else so you need to
explicitly say that we are expecting a
button from this ID that particular ID
so that would kind of make it work now
the next thing you have to do is say the
next thing you have to do is actually
move to on create method now once you
have targeted your button you need to
move into on create method
so what you have to do is actually I'm
just gonna make this line as well into
my own career because I want access to
this particular button when the activity
is created not before that so that is a
handy tip you have got there so make
sure you write that in oncreate method
instead of just writing it outside so
say my first button dot set
onclicklistener and what it would do is
that it would accept a onclicklistener
for your view so you can say that this
is new view dot onclicklistener
and what you have to do in here is say
and actually just need to do like that
so it is a constructor call for this
class view dot on click listener and
what you have to do is say public void
on click and make sure that always well
so what do you have now access to is a
view we so saves me what
method invocation on click listener may
produce travel angle and for exception
and why is it so anyway so let's just
leave that for now and see that dost dot
make text to get application context
then I'm gonna say I was clipped and
let's just say this is toast dot length
shot not sure so let me just see that
first in action and then we'll make sure
that if it's saying something or not and
she's probably not create a null pointer
so it doesn't apparently I guess I have
found a fix for this and that would be
actually initialize this button right
here as now so that we just have to make
sure that we are pointing this to this
one I don't may seem stupid for now but
actually Java allows actually requires
you to declare you know such things so
that you could actually avoid a null
pointer exception a null pointer
exception would happen like if this my
first button is blank or you know
nothing is returned in here so you first
of all initialize your button so you
don't have to do that right here so you
know right now it's probably saying that
it would somehow contain some sort of
response from this I know it may sound
stupid because it sounds stupid to me
earlier as well but right now it makes
sense
so now if I run this as you can see the
exception is gone now that would have
worked as well but
actually I just need to make sure that I
don't mess up with all right so as you
have notice that this code without when
this was in here it was still working
but Java just allows you to perform best
practices so when I'll just follow that
so I'm a cool button and yes indeed it
is because it says that I was clicked so
that is all pretty much for your on
click event and if you like this
