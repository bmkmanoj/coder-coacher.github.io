Mei hole and welcome to your third
tutorial for ionic framework with the
firebase and social login in which we're
going to take a look at how we can
create a card out of this information
and right now since we are not
requesting a lot of data just a default
one which Facebook already provides us
anyway so we're going to stick with the
display name and the image URL and
probably the email address as well if
the user provides it so what we're going
to do is head over to the UI components
and let's take a look if we can see some
cards here right so we can see that we
have got some nice cards in here right
so yeah we could go with that one but
that won't look a lot nice on the users
made as a pattern right
this one looks fine though not this one
but this one right so let's just copy
this thing and right here inside our
home dot HTML right here Lester space
this and what I'm gonna say is something
like I guess there's some sort of
problem with the indentation but anyways
so ng-if Facebook logged and right so
we're going to do the same thing with
here but for this one I want to do
something like this and for this one I
want to do something like this only
right and what we're gonna do right now
is pretty much say right here that the
Facebook logged in this dot Facebook
logged in is true right here this dot
Facebook logged in is false
and finally we're going to say Facebook
logged in right here oh where did I get
that square root symbol Wow that's
option plus we if anyone is guessing
right so Facebook logged in as false by
default and yeah so I'm assuming that
nobody has the Facebook logged in by
default which is pretty much a good
assumption anyhow
so yeah that should do the job but now
what I want is the Facebook dot name
right
unless why not just create a object
because that would create if you do
individual naming that would create a
hell lot of mess Facebook is an object
login logged in is false name is nothing
let us say profile URL a profile picture
is nothing and what else
email is also nothing right and then
what we can do is not logged in is true
facebook.com banners false right and
right here we can say this dot Facebook
dot what else name is response we're
going to take a look here what responses
so if we kind of store it as a global
what the heck okay so we take a look
anyhow we would be able to see that
response dot user gets us to the users
information and the name is the inside
display name this dot Facebook dot in is
response to user dot email and this dot
Facebook dot
it sir is what we have in here profile
picture is the response dot user dot for
the URL fair enough and
we can again replace it like Facebook
dot profile picture and right here if
you take a look in our card what we have
the name here and these three buttons as
well but we do not have those right now
so if we can do is I can just do it like
right here text-align:center why the
heck not I'm going to say Facebook dot
ml and yeah that should probably work
let's take a look so if I reload this
thing I login with Facebook I get my
response back okay so what just going on
here
Facebook lotto okay so we have a problem
here this Facebook dot dot n right I
forgot to update things here and there
we go right let's reload one more time
login with Facebook get us back and okay
okay okay come on
well
Facebook dot like then write this dot
Facebook does logged in is true we are
using arrow functions so this should
probably point to the correct one okay
so we have got it I guess I will need
some sort of loader or something right
here while it's processing it right so
we have got a low quality image here I'm
sure we could probably request it as
well from Facebook somewhere the
dimensions console dot lager
we can just console the blog the
response anyhow and we could have also
logged out of Facebook anyways so again
let's just log in one last time let's
just wait a little
we got the user and I'm not sure what's
taking a lot of time to actually put
this thing well we do have the
user right so why the hell does it take
a lot of time to actually reflect the
changes I'm not really sure but anyways
I'll try to figure that out later on but
anyhow it works and this time it worked
quite fast I guess
but anyways might be my internet
connection so you know you get the idea
that how you can make use of these
things to actually set up your own
custom login flows and yes that's all
for this one and in the next one we're
going to take a look at how to implement
let's just say Google login with the
same flow and interface so that's all
for this one and if you liked it then
please don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching I'll see you then
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
