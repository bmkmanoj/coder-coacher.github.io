fifth angularjs tutorial in which will
be discussing about expressions in
angularjs and I'm sure that we have done
this before expressions are nothing much
fancy but just the expressions enclosed
in double curly braces which we have
used to output our ngmodel
binder inside a div so let's say if I do
a name here let's say hello and here's
my Chrome window
here you go
let's reload this and they've got this
yellow one and this one as well let's
keep it aside say
Meho so you see whoops
you see that it appears automatically
whatever we type inside and one thing
you have to notice is that this modifies
the text of the element and not the HTML
so whatever you write as HTML would be
displayed as text so expressions do not
actually work just for this one but you
could actually do like some calculations
as well inside them so you could say
that 10 times 10 equals
100 similarly it would work for other
automatic operators as well the
JavaScript ones
and the plus one obviously so that's
very much what expressions are usually
used for either they are used for the ng
model or ng in it or they are used to
perform some automatic operators so I
know that they are not much of fancy
using angularjs but you know we need to
tell you every aspect of angular cheers
to work with it so that in future
whenever you encounter with double curly
braces then you say and you thank me
that hey I've got this from the code
damn channel so that's one for this
tutorial and I'll see you then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
