mayo and welcome to your second part of
learning javascript unlocked series in
which you're gonna take a look at a lot
of things in javascript in one compact
crunched video so if you haven't watched
part one and you wish to begin with
JavaScript I highly recommend you to
watch that because this part is in
continuation of part one where we left
so without wasting any time let's get
into it
okay so last time we left ad doing loops
and all that stuff and basically let's
continue with the typeof operator
actually I would have done that in the
last video itself but there were some
touches with the audio and the video so
I was not able to do it so let's just
continue with type off and we're gonna
proceed from there onwards so what we
know is that for example if I create let
my string is hello now let's say I want
to do something like if I want to just
do some sort of operation all if I know
that my string is actually a string then
only if I want to proceed then I need to
use something like type of type of as an
operator which would return you the type
of a particular variable you wanted wish
to know so if I do type of my string is
string so let's just quickly create a
function which just says add nums a
comma B right and I'm just gonna do if
typeof a is equal to number and type of
B is equal to number
then only I want to add those numbers
right return a plus B otherwise I
actually can just get rid of those
semicolon otherwise what I want to do is
just return invalid numbers right and
what I can do is just add nums minus 1
and well this is C will get 0 I can do
add nums of a and B we see you see that
we get invalid numbers because obvious
type of a here is string and Bieri
string as well coming to math dot random
now let's see you are creating some sort
of game which requires some sort of
randomness in your application logic so
for that movie halves Matt Matt oops
Matt not random and what this does this
function is basically this returns you
value between zero and one so it's zero
inclusive and one exclusive so for
example is to say we create an array of
numbers this is let's just say 5 10 15
just like that and let's just say I want
to pick up a random number from this
array so we can make use of math dot
random here I can say I want to select
and index now this index should be
random right so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna say that this index or actually
not let's not create this using lead
because we would not be able to change
it later on so I'm just gonna put it
right here only so I'm gonna say mad at
random right but there's a problem this
is a fraction there are a couple of
problems we get a number between zero
and one which is obviously both what we
don't want and we get a number which is
fraction so how do we fix the first
problem well I can scale a number from 0
to 1 to 0 to end by just multiplying it
will end right if you think about it you
have a number which is received to 1 and
you want to scale it to 302 n you have
to just multiply it by n so I multiply
it by the length of the array there we
go now we have a second problem as well
that is these numbers would be
fractional so we need to just flow them
down or rather make them in teachers
with matter flow function and since math
dot random could not be one anyhow so we
will never get end which is the length
of array so we would never run out of
the index for example the length of this
array is 1 2 3 4 5 6 right so this would
be 6 times something
6 times something which is very small
then 1 but not
so we would get something like 5.99 a
nine and a nine right and when we flow
this down I'm telling you about the
maximum number we can get it when you
floor this down we get five which is
zero one two three four five
that is correct because we do not want
to access the sixth element because
there's no sixth element so if you go
ahead and it hit enter on this you see
we get 15 if we go ahead and do it again
we are getting random numbers every time
which is cool okay with that being done
let's just come to something known as
set timeout in JavaScript so a lot of
times you want to have some sort of
actions running again and again just
like we do in a loop but basically doing
it in a specific interval for example
you want to want to count down or you
want to maybe animate some stuff but
that's another thing because for
animation we have something better than
set timeout but anyways set timeout
using set timer we can basically do
interval kind of stuff so you see I pass
in a function here I created this
function here only you can't create it
separately now whatever I pass in this
would be repeated year one every X
milliseconds as suppliers for example if
I say every one second which is a
thousand milliseconds I want just
console dot log hey boy and hit enter
you see we get hey boy not really every
one second but just after one second
because set timeout
what it does is runs a particular piece
of block of code after the specified
interval not every specified interval
I'm sorry about that
that is something known as set intervals
job so when you do set in the wall of
this we get this console.log statement
running every second however set timeout
does it jobs only one time and then
exits now you might be wondering what
these strange IDs here are these numbers
which are returned so these numbers are
basically the idea is assigned to these
intervals and all that stuff
so for example if I want to just stop
this interval I'm done with it
so what I would do is strike clear into
wall and paste the ID returned by this
interval you see that our counter now
stops similarly if I want to just cancel
a set timeout before it has fired then I
can just clear clear use clear timeout
instead of clear interval and then pass
this ID but anyways it has completed so
it's no use now and obviously in real
programming you would just do something
like let X store this and then if
there's some condition met in here then
inside this only you would say clear in
the world of X and you can see that it
kind of behaves like a set timer because
you just run at once and then you just
quit the timeout ok now let's discuss
about hoisting in JavaScript so if
you're coming from a background like C
or C++ it might seem a bit weird for you
to do something like LED result is my
number then a then let us say five and
two and then later on you're defining
mine arms here as a B which basically
just returns a times B so you see that
result is still 10 now this might be a
little bit weird if you're coming from C
or C++ because there you need to define
these things both or basically before
you use them and since JavaScript is a
is a you know language which originated
kind of from C only it might be a little
bit weird for you guys to actually see
but what happens here is behind the
scenes what JavaScript engine does is
known as something known as host hosting
right so what these guys do is basically
they would copy all the functions and
place them at the top so functions and
declarations always paste it on the top
so this result is basically transformed
into something like let result and that
result is equal to mine arms and I
believe that
let calls are not hosted so you
basically get something like this only
but if you use something like var X is 5
then what this is interpreted as who are
X and then X is equal to 5 then here
goes your all other code right
all of the code goes kind of here and
then basically declaration is always at
the force plus the functions and
hoisting is and you know initialization
is at later on stage so this hosting is
a reason why you are able to access
functions every eight variables before
they are actually available let's just
look at an interesting example here so
what we can do is basically say return
safe return let's say armed ok this is a
return type of X right and what i'm
gonna do is write a function X here and
say something like nothing basically so
what should happen technically is if you
are coming from any language background
you should be knowing that when you
return from a function nothing below it
should run right but again hosting is
not done at the runtime it's done at the
not really at the compile time because
javascript is not compiled it's just run
before the JavaScript actually runs so
what happens is that the compiler would
place this function at the top in its
own scope obviously it would miss just
not tear up on the function and place it
at the very top obviously it would take
it at the top place it right here just
before this return and then we have X
defined and we would be happy then so if
I run like my nums hit enter you see we
get function as a return type however if
I do something like if I remove this at
all and then run mine arms you see let
me get X because X is already kind of a
defined variable right here so this is
good get rid of something like this and
do like now you see we get undefined now
because this variable is not defined
however if you just do it one more time
for the sake
of functions so we can just create this
thing this boy right here you see knife
I call my name's we again get function
because of wasting all right now let's
come to variable scoping and this is a
bit of a kind of new thing with let and
cons keywords which was not the thing
with the warty word
so with war keyword variables were
scooped inside your blocks so for
example let's just say you have a loop
let's see excellent is an array like
that and I do something like for war I
equal to 0 is less than X dot length I
plus plus console dot log X off hi like
that you see we get all the elements
nicely but if I hit I and hit enter you
see that I is still defined here which
is kind of a feature which might be
useful in some cases but not really not
for example if you just I'm not sure
it's it's useful if you if you know that
it's working right like this because you
might use I unknowingly thinking that
its scope is over but instead it would
return you a particular value which was
not what you expected so to fix this
thing
what we have is let so for example when
you initialize a variable inside let
it's it's kind of bound within the scope
of whatever it isn't running int so for
example if I do like at index of 0 index
is less than X dot length index plus
plus and do the similar thing console
dot log X of index hit enter you see
that we still get the same thing but now
I'm not able to write index and access
because it is scoped only for this
particular block it loses its scope
right here similarly with functions as
well we can create method functions
obviously we can create global variables
so this is my global
r5 I can access it in a function just
like saying console dot log Global War
great let me just change this name as x2
and I can run x2 here you see that we
get this Global War logged in and
basically inside functions if you write
a similar variables for example if I do
let Global War is six what you would see
is that I get six instead of five
because every function has its own scope
right so when you define a variable
inside its inside its function then the
chain starts from something like this so
it will look inside it function if the
variable is not found then it will look
inside its parent then if the variable
is not found in the parent as well it
will look inside its parent and so on
and so forth this is basically a kind of
model with on which JavaScript
inherently works on which is called
prototypal inheritance model which we
are going to talk about later on so for
now let us remember that every function
has every object every block has its own
scope so just make sure you don't mess
up your scopes otherwise you will be in
trouble okay so now let's just come to
this keyword and by this I literally
mean this keyword so this keyword in
JavaScript which is basically maintained
by the JavaScript engine when it runs
your JavaScript code and points to a
very specific thing which is in which
context the particular code is running
so for example if I write this so this
code ran any global context that's why I
get window now what you have to
basically remember is that the context
of this usually changes when you go
inside objects and by that what I mean
let me just refresh the page real quick
here and what we can do here is I can
say let my object is consists of
let's say a function which is my method
is a function here which is basically
console dot logging this oops this right
here right so now if I do my object dot
my method right here you see that I get
my method has the value of this however
if I do this right here I get window and
the reason for this is when you run a
method inside a function which is inside
an object then the value of this changes
this does not change when you run a
function directly like X Y I said I get
console dot log this and if I run X Y I
said I still get window however let me
just surprise you a little bit if you
did not notice before if I do something
like let my function is my object dot my
method now my function is basically the
definition of the function just guess
what would happen if I run my function
now with the value of this B window or
my method or basically something you
have never seen before so if I run my
function right here you see that we get
window now the reason for that is once I
run this line my function is pointing to
that particular function it's no longer
going through that object to call that
function just make it clear in your mind
that when you're calling something
through an object then that object takes
this value right now to to actually
overcome for example if you just want to
have this pointing to global only what
you can do is make use of arrow
functions right here so if I just clear
this thing a little bit and say Lam
let's now check to and if I make you
those arrow functions instead of our
function keyword hit enter and if I do
my object to dot my method right here
you see I get window has the basically
the value of this now this is because
the
our functions that are implemented in
such a way that they always point there
this always point to the parent which is
calling them right not the global not
always the global only the parent which
is calling them so this is a little bit
information on this okay so lets us now
talk a little about what Dom is which is
a document object model which is
basically the thing you see right here
so right now you see that there's not
pretty much a lot of things going on
inside the Dom but what you should
basically know as the kind of a thing
for JavaScript developer that the storm
is constructed by the browser but it is
accessible fully through JavaScript and
a lot of other languages have other
libraries which can access storm it's
not just specific to JavaScript only you
can access Dom in various other
languages so javascript is just a
language to access and manipulate Dom
for example if I go to like site like
google.com here we should be able to see
that it's Dom consists of elements like
this div this div you see all these
kinds of elements this logo and all that
stuff so for example if I want to get
reference to the Dom what I can do is
basically make use of document keyword
here so the document is the route of the
dorm so if I do document dot and go down
a little you will see all the properties
I have for these so if I do something
like get all let me just curry selector
and IMG which is the image you see I get
the first image which is found on the
webpage and apparently this is the
Google Images logo itself and if I do
query selector all of IMG you see that
there are a total of four images right
here we can see and all the properties
associated with them as well so
basically you can make use of everything
we have learned so far
while querying for these images and
working on them
basically working with the Dom so doc
you there are tons of methods on
manipulating DOM and you can basically
just google them and find what's
necessary for your use and learn
according to how them and practice them
later on but basically the crux of the
thing is that if you want to modify and
tamper with the Dom you just have to
make use of document object and
basically let me just give you access to
everything so document dot cookie is
basically gives you access to the
cookies of a particular user and
obviously I'm just gonna log out my
account right now because I just made my
account cookies public which is kind of
a weird thing to do so that you're not
able to access my cookies hopefully
Gmail does not have a vulnerability well
you can just copy and paste cookies and
you get access to account but anyways so
what we have right now is basically this
document and just manipulate around it a
little bit we also have something known
as a window which is sometimes work with
people call as browser object model and
if you pay close attention this is what
this pointed just a few moments ago do
and if you do something like this is
window which is which is not really a
right thing to do in case of objects but
okay
so this is actually window only right
now so window consists of all the
methods which you want to access like
alert hello there you see we get hello
there as the pop-up then we have window
dot confirm do you wish wish to do this
action and you see that it gives me two
option ok and cancel if I do ok it
returns me true that if I had done
canceled would return me false and then
we can do something like window dot
prompt as well where I get just an input
and if I it ok I get that input back to
JavaScript so there are tons and tons of
other methods with window as well which
allow you to play early
around but not really specific to
JavaScript these are just
implementations of the browser mind you
that javascript is not limited to
browsers only so document and window
objects are not available in
environments like node.js so these are
just browser specific things I just
wanted to touch them a little bit okay
so basically that's it for this part and
what I want to do is just create two
more videos which would be the one would
be on covering the aspects of JavaScript
in browser and the second one would
basically be covering the secrets of
JavaScript kind of things which people
usually overlook and do not really know
or basically the things which are
actually entrusting but I'm not really
read by most of the developers which
would be probably titled you don't know
JavaScript so that's all for this video
I'll see you then in the next one
and one more thing if you like this
