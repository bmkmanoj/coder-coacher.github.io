Google Chrome extension development
tutorial and in this tutorial we'll be
finally finishing off with our extension
by spicing up our rich not fire a little
bit so so far and so forth we have been
using we have been coding just the cool
functionality of the extension how it
would work and how would the debugging
process take place and all that stuff
but now it's time to spice up our
extension a little bit so what the heck
I'd rather prefer to kill Firefox
and now the moment when your task
manager does not open so here it is
I'll just kill it goodbye fire foxy Wow
Wow that's what a coincidence man
anyways getting back to work so where
were we
yeah so to spice up our extension so
let's reload this and see that
right here we have got a very ugly kind
of modifier we can actually spice it up
a little bit so let's see how we can do
that so first of all right here let's
leave it here as it is but for here
let's modify some things so let's say
you got a new notification on Twitter
this is applied by Twitter naughty fire
message is this one the next thing we
can address contact context message this
message has got a dim message which
appears at the bottom so we can just
write our extension in here
don't forget to put a comma and what we
can do is to make our extension more
interactive we can create some buttons
in our rich snort affair which I haven't
taught you till now but I'll teach you
now how to create buttons in your rich
notifier in Google Chrome so let's see
so to create buttons for free can do is
we'll just write buttons and a colon and
something like this because there would
be more than there could be more than
one button and the title here should be
or without course actually title here
the title of the button should be open
link and you could actually also give an
icon URL of your icon which appears left
to this link but for now I'll just leave
it to blank that means I won't give it
anything so if we have got a new button
right here and let's see how our
extension looks right now let's reload
this
and obviously we need to have some work
done
and
the last one we have
retweet less than three to death
and we have got a notification like this
so you got a new notification on Twitter
me hold retweet video under the notifier
and we can actually open link using this
let's see how you can do that so we have
got our button now working on a new
notification new notifier so let's see
how you can attach link to your button
and to do that first of all we have to
do the same thing we did in a couple of
tutorials or maybe more back so chrome
dot notifications start on button
clicked dot
listener if function obviously and this
function would take maybe one or two
arguments one is notification ID and the
second one I don't remember frankly so
since we have only one button right now
so we don't need any arguments because
this function would be fired only when
our sorry this but an open link would be
clicked so I'll just like to open the
window
to the notifications page that's it
all right
so that's not it so we have successfully
developed our extension so let's see it
in action so let's say I disable this
and why not just apply the icon as well
in the manifesto chair so-and-so icons
should be
this should get caught
32 icon dot PNG 64 icon PNG 16 while we
don't revise 16 so that should be good
enough
and listener will this reload this and
we have got this nice nice little icon
the first Twitter notifier
let's close this let's disable this one
now let's first of all let me remove all
of my activity of the retweet so we can
just have a look at how it looks now
finally so I'm just removing all the
retweets I did and in the chrome
notification area
the may are the latest to derive goddess
may hold retweeted you alright so now
let's start our extension so that's how
it would appear when a user installs it
user will get this one time whenever the
user launches this or our browser then
he or she can close this get started
with us work with the window closed
obviously and whenever some strange
visitor like this one does any activity
then automatically will get that in how
many seconds
it is yeah in 20 seconds so that's got a
long duration I can actually drop it but
we would be getting the notification any
time now and 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 3 2 1 now
whoa that's embarrassing
come on come on come on this should be
it
well not strange let's check out what
happened
and the background paid as well
the array is not updating so there is no
notification here as well so where did
it go
let's reload this now
and Twitter is at fault now because it's
not updating notifications about the
favorite of tweet
let's retweet this
let's favorite this
way to eat
all right so we have got this link a
whole theory to do a tweet let's open
this link and bingo we have got the
space opened by default and the best
thing about this extension the user
actually need not to authenticate his
Twitter account with some oats logins or
all that stuff so you can basically just
go ahead grab the user information from
Ajax request this HTML data filter it
out a little bit and with some awesome
jQuery library code you could make such
powerful extensions with nice chrome
effects so I hope you like this tutorial
I'll see you then next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
