metal and welcome to your 27th android
application development tutorial in
which i'm gonna show you how to create
pretty much a better ListView and with
the custom UI and you could actually
place images and text and headlines and
all that stuff which I told you earlier
and yeah so let's get started well if I
just show you what we did last time and
let me just load that you can see that
pretty much it sucks right so this is a
very plain user interface with minimal
list V ListView and okay so what I want
to do instead is I want to pretty much
create a custom list view layout right
and populated with items as well so what
I need to do is that I need to create a
new Java class and what this class would
be like if you want to populate your
list items with learn languages Eliane
guh yes
right so what this would do is that it
would just help us to hold that data for
every ListView item right so what you
can do is you can say like this would
contain a private string of this would
be the name of language right then we
would have private end of the image ID
and we need this as an integer because
we will access the ID from our dot
drawable and then some image you are
imaged name which would eventually turn
out to be an ID right so the next thing
we would need is a private less
and tutorial number which would be the
number of tutorials available for that
particular language like 25 or 30 or 40
whatever so now we need to make an our
constructor right so I'm just gonna say
generate constructor and then I'm just
gonna select all these three and boom
here we go so now we have this
constructor which just gets in and sets
all of these particular values to the
respective integer respective variable
values then what I want to do is I want
to set in the getters and setters as
well so just go ahead and get image ID
set actually I don't need this set set
or sorry so let's just get rid of these
setters because we are already setting
that in constructor right so yeah so
that's pretty much what our prototype
class would look like so this is a
prototype of what our data would pretty
much hold like you would have a name of
language and an image ID then the
tutorial number of tutorials let's just
name number of toriel's that kind of
makes more sense right here we go
and get number of tutorials makes more
sense again so in our main activity what
I want to do is I want to get rid of all
this thing right so let's just start
clean and we'll just import that as well
so I'm gonna say this as first of all
let me just create a private list out of
my this class right so that I can just
create in a list of objects which I want
to mess around with so this list would
be of the type long languages
and then what I'm gonna say this is it
will languages which is the available
languages is new ArrayList right and
then this would be a solid right so this
will just create an ArrayList out of
wrong languages and just assign it to a
list so for this class you would be good
to go
now we don't need access out of this
class for this list so I'll just name
this private right so now what I want to
do is I need to say list or actually
what's the name I will list a language
actually dot right so this would just
add this to list and we need a new
constructor right there so I'm gonna say
new learn languages and inside my
constructor call I'm gonna initialize it
with the things right so the first one
is image ID hmm so let me just kind of
move an order a bit because I would like
to give the name of the language first
then probably image ID and then tutorial
right so I'm gonna say that this one is
HTML then for now I guess I'm just gonna
keep it to our dot would this work
I see launched right so I'm just gonna
keep this to this image right now but I
would just change it later on if I
wanted to
so the next thing would be the number of
tutorials so let's just say that we have
40 for this one right so now I have
added a list item but I need to add a
lot of them right so I'm just gonna do
like that and in a typical life app what
you want to do instead is that you want
to loop over this thing over a data set
and the dataset would come from an HTTP
request from your server or whatever and
we take a look at that as well in the
next application which will develop
later on and that would be the
newsreader only which we developed
earlier with ionic so I'm just gonna say
for now
this is JavaScript then PHP Android or
child actually then I can be same let's
just say this is 45 then 21 46 random
set of data
okay cool till now but what next well
what you need to do need to create a new
array adapter right but now this time
will not fall backs to the default one
because we now need to customize our
layout a bit so that our HTML text is
displayed in the HTML field and this
image is displayed in the image field
and we'll just create the layout as well
later on but for now I'm gonna say this
is array adapter and this would be of
the type long language right so this is
the type long language and then I'm
gonna say that this is again my adapter
is new then what I'm gonna say is that
this is custom at a true right instead
of our adapter so what this custom
adapter would do is that we would pretty
much make use of this to actually
alright the method get' view and the get
view is the method which is called again
and again on each and every foulest item
so with the help of that particular
method we can override there is this
text is displayed or you know this image
is displayed right so what happened with
the previous tutorial is that we pretty
much just give it get the control to
Android only and since that was a simple
application as well it just had only
text view in it
so our adapter knew that it just has
placed the text
in the text view right so that's simple
but where these three elements right
here the image ID the tutorial number
which is an integer and this text our
adapter would need our help
to know where to place what sort of
element right so I'm gonna create this
as a new class right so I'm gonna say
this is public class and actually and
just make it private as well it's up to
you private class customer doctor right
so you need to extend it from re adapter
and then again this would be of the type
learn language so that and what you need
to do and I hope you understand what
this is a blown language because you are
this objectives of flow and language
type right so that should be pretty
simple so what I'm gonna do is again I'm
gonna create a constructor from generate
constructor and I'm just gonna call it
with this constructor right so you can
pretty much say that this is context
resource then what I want is the thing
this evil language which would be our
what this is our data right so you're
just calling the superclass method as
well for this thing and you could
actually just just keep it like that
okay so next thing I want to override
this method so let's just see what
methods are available to be all written
so I need a getview method right so this
is I got fue method so just open it and
it comes with a bunch of arguments right
so what happens is that it would allow
you to mess up with a view which would
be a single list item right so you want
if you want you can just mess it up or
you know why mess it up
to say that you can just modify or play
around it a little bit so it's up to you
actually so if you want that if my view
is just a dummy code is actually like I
don't know it's like PHP then just
become overexcited excited and just
prompt the user to recommend it strongly
recommend user to learn this language
like that otherwise just play around
with the norm of U so this is a
overridden method right so make sure to
remember that this is an override method
that means this method already exists in
this array adapter but we are all
writing with this our own method so that
we can get in more control so what I
want is that this convert view is the
view which is passed in which is the
list item like if I show in paint so if
this is your app this would be this
would be this the first one would be a
kind of a view which would be passed in
as a convert view for the first time
right so I'm gonna say that if convert
view is equal to now I want this convert
view to be equal to get layout inflator
it would just inflate your layout with
this XML code r dot layout and actually
how I added this let me just see this
one okay so actually we haven't actually
created the layout for our application
at all so let's just lets us name it for
now my layout right so again we need a
layout lower literal and I need to
create this file so again this would be
a file similar which we created earlier
layout but again this would
be the prototype of what our layout
would look like so let's just do it
with the design right so and change it
to relative actually because you need to
create sort of items right do you
understand so I'm gonna say this is my
image view right so you set it to image
view and SRC is what we have here map
map
I see launcher right so right now I'm
just gonna make use of this other dummy
image right so I'm gonna say that okay
so let's just keep it in the back corner
so I'm gonna say this is maximum height
of 50 DPS maximum width of 50 DPS so
that even if we get an abnormally large
image from server it doesn't just takes
up our app space and it looks absurd and
viewed then I want to have a headline so
this would be our where is it the text
view text view where are you right so
let me just go with large text only so
you know we can pretty much or actually
what it would do is that our layout
inflator would replace it with this the
values which are right here right in a
moment which will just code so we don't
need to worry about what we write in
here because it would be eventually
replaced so I'm gonna say that this is
my heading heading whoa so this is my
heading right then we just close these
then I want a plain text view right here
and this would be our disk
right description there we go and what
you want to do is you want to change
this image view to left icon ICO right
like that then what I want is actually
just you need to do that stuff as well
because this is relatively out this is
my heading right therefore you need to
do stuff here as well then this is my
description like that so now what we
have done is that we have pretty much
just created our layout you need to pass
in the parent and then yes that's pretty
much it so what this will do is that it
would just inflate your current view
with this layout file and by inflating
it just converts this XML chunk of code
into is it right there into an object
which would be then passed by Java and
displayed on the screen so we able okay
so you can actually just get rid of all
that right you could just say that
resources are dot way out dot my yeah
and then this could be main activity dot
this remember that this is not this
because then this one will refer to the
dis of this class right so make sure you
just write main activity dot this
instead of your simple this right so no
more errors in the IDE at least and what
happens is that if you run this right
now you wouldn't see a lot of exciting
code but let me just show you what
happens
and is it don't changes to apply one
that's heartbreaking
wait a minute what did I just press we
went up no no boy not this one
so looks like our changes have not been
reflected and that is pretty weird so I
guess I need to do it on install of this
what I want to do is again build this
application I'll actually you want to
return your convert view hero
so I'm late a bit I guess so
okay so we are highly an incomplete code
and I'm trying to run it I don't know it
might crash up or end up like something
so let's see what happens because this
should be convert view actually instead
of that long thing so so so you see that
pretty much nothing is appearing because
you are just getting this as convert
view not returning it at all right and
you need a pretty much a bunch of more
statements right here to make it work
because you have actually just
overwritten the view method but you are
not pretty much doing anything at all so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say that
learn lower languages
this would be my current language equals
to what was now checked name not this
one this is no this one available
languages dot get position or actually
get position right so what this would do
is that this would from this position
right here this integer it would
actually give me access to that
particular element which is being called
by this are basically the
of that particular element which has
been passed into getview so if you have
if the Android calls getview for item
two then this would be position one
right because you know this is position
zero this is position one then we would
get an integer of position then I can
access that particular list item with
that position so for position one I
would be accessing this JavaScript boy
right there so what I want to do then
address is accessing it I want to say
that my image view which is my image
equals image view then want to find it
in my convert view dot fine view by ID
then I'm gonna make use of the same ID
which I have in the layout because this
is a layout which is called again and
again so this is left ICO and actually
our dot ID left ICO like that then I'm
gonna find my textview right so this
would be textview my heading equals
textview let's just import that convert
view dot find you by ID ID ID textview
or actually this should be what this is
getting right so this is heading and
then again I want to just copy and paste
this then this would be my description
and then this would be description
alright so looks like we are done here
now what I want to do is as a being a
intruder in Android get view and all
writing it it's my duty to set that text
on my view right so I want to say that
my image dot set image resource and then
I'm gonna say my current language dot
get image ID right so
just check if I have that right on
languages yet imaginary right so this is
where our class comes into play and that
is why this thing is useful now you can
see that instead of just messing all
around and just you know wandering from
where do I get this thing which are
passed in I'm getting it pretty
comfortably with this method the getter
which I have in my class right and it
just turns yellow because it has been
used in the code and name of lying
actually why the grid okay so I'm
mistake so again I want to set similarly
my heading got set text instead of set
in each resource and I'm gonna say this
is my current language and this my
current language is the object of this
one which is referring to that
particular object so you know I hope you
can make out how things are working
daaad get Ling Li name of language tuo
can speak right so again I'm gonna say
my description got set text get number
of tutorials and again because get
number of tutorials return an integer
value and you are setting it out of text
you want to set it to to string no no
not to string actually just need to like
that or what you can do is you can say
string dot value of where the heck did
my current language go right so that is
another way of doing the same job right
a lot of brackets in this region right
so yeah pretty cool and a lot of work
has been done right so again what we
need to do is return to our oncreate
function and right here I was writing
our array adapter
so pretty much we are almost done what
we need do now say that list view my
list equals let me just see no not this
one the activity main my first list view
list view and actually just name it my
first rest be only why not fine view by
ID r dot ID my first list view three
sweet now we need to do my first to
dispute set adapter and then a natural
so everything's now looks like
everything's good right and oh there's a
typo in there so okay so I just custom
adapter right so I just copied that and
pasted it so it didn't make any
difference but let's just fix that hmm
so looks cool right so let me just get
off this let's just see if this works or
not so let me just sit back in my chair
and see if this works or not well well
well so application stopped unlock at
says that the reason it is is because
add view is not supported and view
layout from interest
where's that layout and say true wait a
minute wait a minute
here's my code mainactivity.java right
so pay rent and I guess I need to pass
and false as well here are the third
argument I don't want it to a - - parent
right so wait a minute I want to perform
a full build and that is why I like the
real devices because they don't suck
that much but anyways so let's see if
this works or not finally and the Gradle
is building so real you better build
that right because I don't want to shoot
this tutorial again and okay so alright
so looks cool right so this pretty much
looks exactly what I wanted so in my
layout if I switch to design view you
can pretty much see how my application
was intending to look like intended
actually and that is how it looks like
so pretty cool and pretty resembling
right so this is the place where I
wanted the icon to be then this is the
heading which is replaced by HTML then
this is description which should be
actually tutorial number but anyways so
you see that pretty much you have
created your own custom list view and
you can what you need to do if you want
to change this like pretty much if you
want your image to be here instead of
whoa where the heck did all that go so I
guess I need to do the left off and like
stuff like that and - you know you get
the idea you just have to change the
layout from
this page right here from the design
view and pretty much you would be good
to go so if I just change it back to
here you can you know you can just mess
around with this layout and you don't
need to mess around with code at all nah
because your layout is grabbed by this
file and you would be good to go so
again you can change these icons
individually by creating another array
of images where the right here or you
can just modify this class as well to
add images by just saying that my image
dot set image resource and then my
current language dot get image ID or
actually yes we already do have place
for that so if I change it like do we
have some other images other than this
Android constantly just watching me no I
see launcher we movie I see launchers
right now so anyways you know you get
the idea you just have to change image
here from I see launcher to any other
image and it would reflect nicely right
here so that is all for this tutorial
and if you liked it then please don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
