maple and welcome to your fourth
tutorial for es6 in which I'm going to
go a little bit over what the arrow
function notation is in es6 and why this
is the future
so es6 brings us this fat arrow notation
or what we just call as arrow functions
which is essentially just I've gained a
sort of kind of a syntactic way of
defining functions but it brings us with
one major feature rather or disadvantage
or whatever you want to call it
depending upon what your code actually
does and that is the scope or rather
what this key would mean so first of all
first things first let us see what this
actually is so what we can do it regular
Java square we define something like I
don't know let's just a test function
and we say something like function and a
definition goes here we can say
console.log just work right now we can
just call this function just like that
how we get this works nothing fancy
going on here again we can just define
something like function test function -
and it's more or less the same thing and
we can just a console log this works -
right and yeah so that works - test
function - there we go so what we can do
with our functions is first of all how
do you actually define them what can
define an arrow function you can do one
or lists two will let because of es6
what it will just work with war as well
I'm just going will let because with
trying to do es6 now so I'm going to do
test functional 3 is and now what I'm
going to do is actually make use of
these two parentheses now what we would
rather do with es5 is write function and
bracket now let's just see how to switch
this to es6 first of all we get rid of
this function then
after these parentheses what we do is we
write this pad arrow which is
essentially what we call a spatter or
notation so that's it yep this is your
function you can just say console dot
log this works cool and hit enter and
you can just go ahead and call test
function three and there we go we get
this works too as the console log and
what this essentially means is that
right now we are not passing any
parameters right so what we can do with
es6 is that we can find the score a
little bit more if you pay very close
attention and that is very much that if
you do not include these parentheses
what happens is that by default this
code or rather let me just show you
first of all let's say I say something
like this world trolley right and if I
change this to test string and hit enter
now what should be desperate according
to you well obviously there are a lot of
choices here but to you can see that
this is a function rather it's not a
function one of the first we call it you
can see we get this this works now what
would happen what is happening here
under the hood is that this function is
being expanded as or not really expanded
out but how you can take a look at this
is that this the function then we get
rid of the Spadaro
and we get a result okay so where the
heck does this return come from well
that actually happens whenever you do
not apply these curly braces right so
it's kind of useful if you just want to
return another functional value or you
don't you are just spreading a function
to return some other thing with some
modification so without curly braces
this pretty much means that there's a
return worth sitting in here okay so how
do you pass parameters to these
functions well to do that or you can do
is let's say we create a function this
is action and we create some
function parameters like from middle one
and parameter two and we use pattern
notation and we define something like
clicked on parameter one let's try a
little to write again if you take a
close look we can trim the score down a
little and we can get rid of this return
but now we want to still JavaScript that
actually we want to return only this
value and there's nothing else in this
function going on so we get rid of these
curly braces as well and that brings us
to only these definitions so this pretty
much means that except two parameters
and return this done so if we enter our
Las Vegas is function and we can take
ten credit
you see we get 30 which is exactly the
correct answer okay so that was it but
we're going to take a look at something
known as the lexical scoping of the
fifth key word in these es6 functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
