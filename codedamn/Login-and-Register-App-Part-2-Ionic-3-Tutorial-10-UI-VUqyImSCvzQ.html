Mabel and welcome to your 11th ioniq
tutorial in which you're going to
enhance the layout a little bit we're
gonna not work with the storage yet but
we're going to improve this and create a
signup page as well and probably move
this login page into its own page so
first of all let's just create a new
page so I'm going to say IRL images
ionic generate page and let's just say
this is login page and we're going to
generate one more page that would be
ionic generated page that is the
register page let's say and that should
give us a start so if you take a look
now inside a login page we can move this
thing inside our login page right and
it's safe and for the home page what I'm
going to do is want to say something
like social network anything you want
and then we're going to create a bunch
of buttons right here which will just
say the login and sign up thing so we
can just keep it minimal right now and
just create two buttons we're going to
say sign in and register so sign in for
the sign in one what I'm going to do is
inside our home door type scripts we're
going to say first sign in is this dot
nav control dot push and this would be
our login page and for register RG is
ter and say this dot nav control dot
push and that would be a register page
which we have so again let's just import
those real quick import login login page
from what we have in as the login login
and I'm going to do the same thing where
the register one as well that would be
register and
register and register page just like
that so now we are done with the home
file so let's just copy these two things
and make sure to add that in our app as
well so we go to app modules and we
import these two things register and
we're going to go up one more directory
back pages pages just like that and say
login page register page as well so
login page login page register page and
there we are so we have our home set up
and we can actually what we can do is
instead of doing this as block we can
actually create parent with state their
ID
top buttons and again we can just make
use of some basic HTML right here and
inside our home dot sass file from that
SES file now if you're not familiar with
SPSS it's kind of like CSS only so
whatever CSS you write it would be valid
as CSS as well or valid sass as well but
it kind of is a powerful version you can
create nested tags and use variables and
CSS and all that stuff but don't bother
if you do not know about it a lot just
remember that for any component you're
gonna if you want to make the Styles
local for example for the page home we
want to make this whole thing this whole
thing home is wrapped actually wrapped
inside this page home tag if you can
just take a look right here you can see
that this whole thing is wrapped inside
page form so whatever we write inside
this page home would be local to this
home page only right so we can just make
use of that and say top buttons is a
display flex right now and again I do
not have the sass styling on so it just
shows me plain text but doesn't matter
I'm going to say that for top buttons
buttons flex 1
and hit save I'm going to give it a flex
direction of row as well so again this
should have weather does container top
buttons right here we can see that our
Styles did not work really or did Bay
right so I just flicked it by actually
restarting my ionic project so I just
quit the project and said next server
again it just works fine now I'm not
sure really what the problem is but it
just worked fine so now what we can do
is since we have our flex box ready and
this thing right here or we can say is
that when we click sign-in you can see
that we get our form and for register as
what we going to same form so this is
first of all fix this thing
and we can say here register and save
and if we take a look for the home de
taille profile if you click on this
register you can see we get register but
it has got nothing in it
so first of all let's just open register
dot HTML and the page would more or less
be the same for login and register so we
can just copy this thing instead of just
writing here we can say something like
create account and username password and
right here we can just say register okay
so we can just say register user right
here and for login for login dot HTML we
can say sign in sign in user like that
so we can now say login dot d s inside
right here we can create another method
sign and user and right here we would
just say console dot log would sign in
with the this dot user dot value and
this dot password dot value we can just
create that thing real quick as well we
can just say user rather view child and
what we have right here the user name as
the user we can create a view child
again password with the password
the name so we can just import view
child from the angular core and though
we should be good to go with that for
register as well we're going to do the
same thing so register we're going to
Google just er dot typescript and it
would be pretty much the same thing only
but for this method right here we would
create this method and say just a user
would be console dot log would register
user with this dot user W and this dot
password dot value and value right there
okay so again I'm just going to copy
paste these two lines because that would
be similar and for the info we can just
encode this view child right there and
that should be good to go
okay so for the resistor part now if we
take a look if you sign this up go to
console I will say Meho may-who and hit
silent we can see that would sign on
with maple Mayo and for the resistor we
can say one two three four five six or
whatever that was just so we're just a
user with one two three three four five
so now we have basically setup our UI a
little bit again you can add some icons
here if you want to or customize this
thing a little you can customize some
colors if you want to but I'm just going
to keep it to the basics right now and
with the UI completed we're going to
move to the functionality and see how we
can make use of storage to actually
store the users we are creating and log
them in so that is all for this one and
