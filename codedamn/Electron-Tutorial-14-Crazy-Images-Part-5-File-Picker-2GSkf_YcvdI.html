Mei hole and welcome to your 14 electron
tutorial in which we're gonna improve
the layout of our editor for now real
quick right so let's just make this
button a bit more bigger and better so
we're going to go with image controls
and say that the direction let's switch
it back to row and say flicks wrap to
wrap and what this would essentially
allow us to do is create bigger buttons
and there are probably two buttons in
one row let's see how we can do that now
I'm going to say that this pivotal
effect type is ah with 50% and we can
say that this isn't itself is display
flick center and you see that it is not
stretched so we can say this is
stretched we get these full boxes right
and if we can just paste it here and we
can finally say that the font size for
this is to rent 1.5 would be good I
guess
for now let us change the font family
for now to calibrate because this
current font holds my eyes for now so
move from some lay galleon 3 and E 1 we
can say this looks at least better okay
so next thing is we need to pretty much
design what happens when we click one of
these buttons right so in the preview I
showed you that we would get a slider
sort of thing here and we can just
adjust the brightness and contrast and
all the features and let's just pretty
much do that only so first of all let me
just add all the effects which would be
let's say this is cursor:pointer and the
effect list would pretty much be all
rather Alice's take this out of business
and see inside of our edit controller we
can say scope dot effect and we can
create this as an object and we can say
that right yes the righ D brightness is
another object or yep
which would have or what just happened
have a value of 4 100 at the beginning
we want the minimum to be 0 we set the
maximum to be 200 right then we will
have contrast and similarly some other
sets so I'm just going to do that real
quick so here we are and I have added
another thing which is the delimiter
which would be pretty much how the
things will end because things like you
rotate makes more sense with a degree
instead of a percentage and the blur
would make more sense with a pixel
instead of percentage right and yep that
is all so these are the fixed we're
going to add in our application and the
what we're going to do is insert our
image controls we're going to say this
is div class of what we have and style
effect type right yeah
I'm going to say ng-repeat effect and
crops and effects that's what we named
that I guess yep
and we can just say it is Spectre and
this should probably work you want at
this you can see that we get are all our
effects in order and that's cool
actually
so let's just add a click event to all
of these as well so that we can just
actually get what we are clicking we're
going to say ng-click is that image
effect and we're going to pass in effect
as the parameter so if we create enough
function scope image effect this
function which is the effect name and
just console.log effect name and see
what happens
and take a look again II when it is we
open console and we click on brightness
you see we get brightness contrast in
wood and the actual effect name so now
actually we can just go ahead and start
playing around with CSS properties and
start adding effects so that is all for
this one and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and in the next one
I'm going to start off with actually
making the core of the application that
is how we can edit the image so that's
all for this one and if you liked it
then again don't forget subscribe don't
forget to like and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
