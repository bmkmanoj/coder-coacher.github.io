JavaScript tutorial and the video title
says doomsday 2038 because on this year
in this year on day 19 january twenty
thirty eight time 314 it according to
UTC or gmt the linux clock system would
crash and yet that's true and we know
that by this in the last tutorial I
showed you the get time function
actually it turns the number of seconds
elapsed from the base time now what does
that mean is for instance will create a
new date set to the base time let's say
1970 we have the time staff the base
time just 31 let's get the time and this
is the unix time staff for the base time
because as you can see unix timestamp
the sign 32-bit integer so it can hold
values from negative
do one for 748 3648 to positive this
number okay so now what happens actually
when we reach this moment in time i'll
show you the gate time returns right
here the unix time step if we do y and
create the Doomsday date and we supply 9
in january twenty thirty eight and 03
1408 like this and get the time step of
this
you have got this number okay now let's
try to add these two and we'll get the
actual time elapsed and by adding these
two I mean simply putting a subtract
between the absolute values of those
because adding a negative to a positive
is basically subtracting a number
basically I need to basically add this
sorry what we are doing here actually is
we are subtracting the negative from
you're subtracting a negative and which
literally means positive how we get this
number 2 1 47 48 364 and if we look down
right here somewhere we check the limit
of the integer the maximum value which a
32-bit integer can't hold we get that
it's exactly the same just the eight
right here is because this is the
crashing time and if I create a new date
like seven
and then get why not get date
yet time sorry then we get the dooms
time that means this would be the last
second on the unix time staff system now
if we try to do like you say what if
they try to do like to 138 what will
happen then as you can see this stuffed
works right now because in javascript we
have the maximum value for a number
allotted as this one now this one is a
very huge value this is basically this
raised to the power of 308 or basically
it means something like this I don't
know what this evaluation actually means
but it is something raised to the power
of something maybe the power of 10 or
whatever but this is a very huge number
but the unix time staff is using just a
sign 32-bit integer which is likely to
crash on this date and wikipedia has got
a very nice image of this if I load this
image and let's see what happens when
the time approaches the dooms time and
as you can see this stuff works right
now correct and on the 8th second it
should break down the decimal as you can
see and the integer overflow occurs
right now as you can see the decimal
turns negative now what happens is this
negative integer is converted into unix
timestamp and this unix timestamp
resembles to the date 19 1
12-13 and whatever we went into huge
past now to solve this problem we have
what is this
not solve this problem we have to use
another time stab are basically
upgrading unix timestamp to 64-bit and
you need not to worry about this because
we are pretty sure that by 2030 it will
get another time staff and this doomsday
would not be occur so we just saved the
world in this tutorial so thank you for
watching and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
