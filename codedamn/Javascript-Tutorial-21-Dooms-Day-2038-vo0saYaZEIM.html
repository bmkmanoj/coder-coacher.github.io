shell script tutorial and the video
title says doomsday 2038 because on this
year in this year on date 19 january
2038 time 314 8 according to UTC or GMT
the Linux clock system would crash and
yes that's true and we know that by this
in the last tutorial I showed you the
gate time function actually it turns the
number of seconds elapsed from the base
time now what does that mean is for
instance if you create a new date set to
the base time let's say 1970 we have the
time staff the base time just 3 1 let's
get the time and this is the unix time
staff for the base time because as you
can see unix timestamp the sign 32-bit
integer so it can hold values from
negative
two one four seven four eight three six
four eight to positive this number okay
so now what happens actually when we
reach this moment in time I'll show you
the gate time returns right here the
unix time step if we do why and create
the Doomsday date and we supply nine in
january 2038 and the ER three one four
zero eight like this and get the time
step of this
we have got this number okay now let's
try to add these two and we'll get the
actual time elapsed and by adding these
two I mean simply putting a subtract
between the absolute values of those
because adding a negative to a positive
is basically subtracting a number
and basically I need to basically add
this sorry what we're doing here
actually is we are subtracting the
negative from you're subtracting a
negative and which literally means
positive now we get this number to one
four seven four eight two three six four
and if we look down right here or
somewhere we check the limit of the
integer the maximum value which a 32-bit
integer control we get that it's exactly
the same just the eight right here is
because this is the crashing type and if
I create a new date like seventh
and then get why not get did get time
sorry then we get the dooms time that
means this would be the last second on
the UNIX timestamp system now if we try
to do like you say what if I try to do
like two one three eight what will
happen then as you can see this stuff
works right now because in JavaScript we
have the maximum value for a number
allotted as this one now this one is a
very huge value this is basically this
raised to the power of 308 or basically
it means something like this I don't
know what this evaluation actually means
but it is something raised to the power
of something maybe the power of 10 or
whatever but this is a very huge number
but the unix time staff is using just
assigned 32-bit integer which is likely
to crash on this date and wikipedia has
got a very nice image of this if i load
this image and let's see what happens
when the time approaches the dooms time
and as you can see this stuff works
right now
correct and on the eighth second it
should break down the decimal as you can
see the integer overflow occurs right
now as you can see the decimal turns
negative now what happens is this
negative integer is converted into unix
time step and this unix timestamp
resembles to the date 19 1 1213 and
whatever we went into huge past now to
solve this problem we have
now to solve this problem we have to use
another time step or basically upgrading
UNIX timestamp to 64-bit and you need
not to worry about this because we are
pretty sure that by 2038 will get
another time step and this doomsday
would not be occurred so we just saved
the world in this tutorial so thank you
for watching and don't forget to
