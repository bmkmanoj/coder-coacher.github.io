Mabel and welcome to your second video
tutorial for ionic framework and we're
going to take a look real quick how you
can set up ionic on your Windows or Mac
computer and if you're on Windows you
might want to watch the next one because
I'm going to show you the exact same
thing again on Windows the process is
99% same for Windows and Mac and if you
want to set up with the market or you'll
only on Windows you can go ahead and
follow along so what we have right here
if you take a look in the documentation
it saves me to install ionic wire and BM
and for NPM you need to have note
installed so if you have note installed
then it's good for those of you who do
not have that and are running Mac what
you can do is go to google and type home
for you and this homebrew what this is
is a package manager for Mac OS and it's
quite handy you might want to use it all
the time like if you want to install
something like my sequel you can just go
ahead and reinstall my sequel and you'll
be up and running with that so just copy
paste this line in your terminal and
paste it and I'm going to do it and
because I already have homebrew installs
so once you do that you should be able
to type for you here and you would see
something like this so once you are done
with that
what you want to do is right Bri you
install node and this is for Mac users
once you do that it will install node on
your Mac and I already have that
installed so it should just say me that
it has just found installation you can
see that it gives me a mod warning that
node is already installed well that's
good for us once you do that you should
pretty much see a message like note is
installed on your Mac once you do that
you should be able to get access to this
NP and think so yeah now we have NPM
ready with us now we want to do is
install this Cordova and ionic on our
Mac and what the stored OVA is is pretty
much it it is the base engine of
wrapping up your HTML CSS in JavaScript
into a native application ionic is just
a wrapper around it
I already provides you a lot of
components and ListView the navigation
and all that stuff so that your
application might look and feel a bit
more native instead of just a simple web
view so ionic kind of makes sure that
your application doesn't look like a web
page and Cordova manages your
application so that you can actually use
that HTML CSS app I'm JavaScript on our
stuff on your device itself so I on it
technically is built on the top of
Cordova so again we can just go ahead
and install Cordova and ionic with a
global flag and once you do that you
should be able to see ionic and Cordova
installed on your Mac I'm not going to
do this because I already had that
installed so you could pretty much -
Cordova version and you should get the
nope you should
working back and similarly with ionic as
well you should pretty much get
three-point-something version as the
version right so once you have done that
you should be able to now start an
application for ionic and to do that
what I'm going to do is go to desktop
and let me just clear this open the code
down folder open the tutorials folder
and we have the ionic here but let's
just leave that I'm going to say right
here just like it saves me ionic start
my app tap so I'm going to say ionic
start hello world and that's now what
this does is that it creates an
application in our case it would be
hello world and it would be a dad
application which would mean that it
would just give you three tabs at the
bottom of your screen as a boilerplate
to get started with and hit enter and
you should see that it would create a
directory for you I don't download all
the resources and wants to for this
application
should take a minute or two for you to
get to this point and you would see this
link this app you're ironing i'm not
going to cool with that for now so you
can see that our application is not set
up and if I go into hello world and
right right here if you take a look at
the documentation it saves us to run our
app just go to our folder and right
ionic serve now this ionic sir would
start a local development server which
you can make use to take a look at your
application while you're developing so
you do not need to have any sort of
emulator or anything like that to
actually look at what you are doing
because again ionic works on the HTML
CSS part which would be visible on your
browser itself so you can see that it
opens on 4 8 100 it should just open
anytime now you can see that we have got
our application simple application like
that running and this is the tab view I
was talking about so you can just put
these tabs and this is the boilerplate
ionic provides with that thing we had in
here with this steps so yeah that's all
pretty much it for this tutorial and
that is how you would set up a very
basic eye on ik application or Mac and
in the next tutorial when I take a look
at how to set up same thing on Windows
so if you have done that correctly on a
Windows machine as well you are free to
go on the tutorial number I don't know
next to next maybe it's 4th I guess yeah
so yeah that's all for this one and if
you liked it then please don't forget to
subscribe and again I have my patreon
link in the description if you feel
generous you can donate some amount
there I would really appreciate their
and yes that's all for this one again
and see you there on Windows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
