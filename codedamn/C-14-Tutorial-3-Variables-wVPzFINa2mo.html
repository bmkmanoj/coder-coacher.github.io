third C++ tutorial in which we'll be
discussing about something called
variables in C++
now variables are pretty much like
container holders for values of
different kinds now if you have ever
been into JavaScript then there's no
distinguishing between different kind of
data variables because in JavaScript you
could change the value even the datatype
of that particular value on the runtime
itself but in seed must pass to define a
variable we need two things already
defined by the programmer that is the
data type and the other thing is the
name now these two things are very
important in C++
now data type is nothing but what the
variable would store actually the type
of value the variable would store so for
example you are let's say getting the
ages input of a lot of people then what
you want from them is a natural number
obviously but let's say if you are
getting a test marks from the students
of your class then you would like to
have decimal support as well
for the children getting 0.5 or in the
multiples of 0.5 marks so you see that
we have different types of data types
right here now I'll begin with the
simplest one that is the integer now
integer from your maths class is
something like this
white and it's in the computers also
it's still the same the only difference
in the computer world is that this thing
has limit and this thing has a limit too
because in theory in mathematics we
could talk about infinities but in
computer science no because we need
infinite memory to store infinite
integers so everything has a physical
limit in computer science so anyways
getting back to the topic an integer
variable is defined by the keyword int
which defines is datatype and you must
have already noticed by now that why the
heck we are using this int right here as
well now I'll tell you the reason behind
that in a couple of tutorials but you
have to wait till then so create integer
value a variable type int and type my
first variable and that's pretty much it
and yeah remember every always to end
every statement in C++ with a semicolon
that's how the compiler knows that the
statement has ended and it begins with
the next statement in a different way so
if you leave that without a semicolon
then you will get a compilation error so
you see that it shows me error expected
initializer before C out so it simply
means that there was continuation of the
statement and the statement was not
terminated so anyways now we have this
my first variable defined as integer but
what does it store right now we don't
know it is just a simple variable
assigned by the CPU to you now you could
use this variable to sign your own value
let's say I define it as 10 now if I use
C out
my first variable and compiled bill and
run the program you see I get the output
as ten now it must be pretty useless for
you right now because you are most
probably thinking that why not just do
like this but variables are actually
very important very very important in a
program because their values could be
modified so if I do like my first
variable 10 right here and my first
variable is equal to 100 here and I see
out the statement again then what would
happen is I get 10 as the first print
and 100 as the next friend now the
reason they appear on the same line is
that c++ doesn't know i want to print
this one on a new line we have something
special for that to happen but let me
just talk about only datatypes in this
tutorial now the next datatype we have
in c++ is the float now note what it
would do is it would give you access to
store decimals as well in c++ now by
default let's say Astro 10.12 here 100.3
4 here now let's see what happens when I
compile or build and run the program so
you see that even though I stood 10.12
in the first variables the output was 10
and even though I stood 100.3 for the
output was 100 now the reason is that in
C++
when you define a variable with integer
data type then it has to be integer it
cannot be something else if it is
something else then the compiler would
automatically try to typecast that into
the data type
it was previously assigned
now to fix this error of not an inner
technically to make sure that we get
point 12 as output with ten what we can
do is change the data type of int my
first variable to float now float
literally means a decimal and yep I just
forgot to tell you about the comments so
comments just begin with double slash
and these won't have any effect on the
output so fluid just means a number like
with some decimals and obviously these
decimals also have a limit you cannot
have like 200 or 300 decimals so these
have also a limit so let's build and run
the program now so you see that we get
10 point 12s output now and 100.3 4 as
output now now you might be thinking
that why don't use float every time
instead of integers now there's a well
you can say established reason for that
as well suppose you want to do some
arithmetic which I would be discussing
in the next tutorial but let's do it
right now suppose you want to do some
automatic like 10 by 3 let's change it
to end now we all know that 10 by 3 is 3
point 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 till the end of
the universe but we don't have that much
space and moreover this is the kind of
integer so it won't store all this thing
so what would be the output as is just 3
now this is this number is not rounded
off don't think that this number is not
at all rounded off because in C++
integer won't pound off the number it
would just take off the integral part of
that so if I do like then by
for then the result should be 2.5 now
this number rounded off would be 2 3
because by convention we round off 0.5
the next greatest integer but I'll just
show you that it never runs off to the
greatest or the least integer so you see
that we get to only now that's why
sometimes we use integer when we are not
really interested in the decimal part at
all anyways now we have float we have
integers and we have character errors as
well now characters are used pretty much
to store a single character so if I say
corrector Q is M and I see out Q then
you'll see that we get M as output now
one problem with C and C++ we have is
that there's nothing such as a string
datatype do we have that in a header
file known as string dot edge string
more precisely not dot H because we
don't include dot edge and C++ modern
compilers so using this we could get
access to string but there's no native
string datatype in computers so what we
used to do is create a character a array
of characters now array is a complete
different story and we would be talking
about errors after some tutorials but
I'm just telling you guys that to store
strings in C++ we need to have a
collection of alphabets which pretty
much serves the purpose of that so that
was a quick introduction for you guys
two different data types and how to work
with them in the next tutorial we'll be
probably looking at the automatic
operations or numbers
and decimal points in C++ so that's it
for this tutorial and don't forget to

and thank you for watching I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
