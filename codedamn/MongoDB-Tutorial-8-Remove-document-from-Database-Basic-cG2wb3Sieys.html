your I guess eight mongodb tutorial in
which i'm going to show you how you can
remove data from your MongoDB database
and well it should be actually just
MongoDB because MongoDB cada includes DB
as well which stands for database so i
probably don't need to say MongoDB
database well anyways getting back to
the tutorial what we have right here is
pretty much nothing so I'm gonna say or
actually let me just work with sublime
only so right here if you see like I say
print hello potato and build it you see
this me hello potato and by as well well
that's rude but anyways now what I'm
going to do is because this is our shell
only so we have access to all that stuff
which we were just making use of right
there so i can say like use MDB and then
i would say like MDB or actually DVD md
b dot insert and i'm gonna say that this
is my object or actually let me just say
that this is an object and right here
i'm going to create a war or check and
say it like named Mabel and then you
know web site hold them right and then I
want to create another object right so
what i can do is i can actually insert
multiple objects at a time and we'll
just take a look at that how so i'm
going to object to name as da da da and
actually let's just keep it in da da da
because it has been recently news a lot
so i want to change the website to
facebook com and if you know what i mean
so not if I actually just change to
object to and if I want to insert
multiple objects at a
and what I'm going to do is put them in
the array right on Jake one and object
to here we go now build this boy and see
we have got the bulk right results
instead of right results which we got
earlier now what we can do instead of
this thing and I could just actually
show it as well dbm DB dots show or
pretty much find dot pretty and build it
I can see that inside here we get a lot
of duplicates because you see that we
are running this code a lot a lot a lot
a lot a lot of times because we are kind
of building it each and every time so
this is not a kind of alternative for
our manga shell so probably let's just
work on mon with shell only so I'm gonna
say Mongo and right here i'm going to
say use md b and d v dot drop database
and true and then say exit I'm just a
Mongo i'm going to say use MDB i'm gonna
say now i'm going to say object one or
licious do a direct insertion now MDB
insert to be like name mehul let's just
keep it to that only for now and name da
da da right there and wait a minute d b
dot let's just change it to names and
true right there you can see and oh I
guess I mr. Brackett right there it
should be like that right so now if i
write to md b dot find T V dot empty
without find hit enter well got pretty
much nothing actually because this is
names right so now you see that we got
may hold me whole
da da da because probably this one right
there so it wasn't expecting the second
argument but anyways now actually in
this tutorial what I wanted to do is
show you how to remove the data right so
if you want to remove a data you need to
specify what sort of data you want to
remove you don't want to remove vibe of
your database in one command you wanna
say DB name's not remove and right here
just like you insert you would pass in
an argument which would contain an
object which if matched would remove
that particular record or the document
or whatever the heck you want to say
that and in this case let's say this is
da da da I'll let me just change it to
me so that we can just get rid of two
records right there so hit enter and you
can see that in right result it runs me
how many documents it has removed so now
if I probably I can adjust my mouse
right there right there ok so if I say
now d b dot MDB not find well well again
the same mistake names not fine you can
see that we are now only left with da da
da instead of all that crap which we had
earlier well that is how pretty much you
remove a database entry from Mongo and
there are kind of advanced way of doing
that as well with regular expressions or
with other advanced things like Griffin
matching anything else like your integer
values rather than something or you know
there are a lot of ways to do that but
for this tutorial I'm just going to keep
it real quick and simple so earlier or
later on we're going to learn more about
removing database the advanced removing
database candlelight would be the title
so that is all for this tutorial and if
you like that then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
