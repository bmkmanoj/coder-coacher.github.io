your I guess eight MongoDB tutorial in
which I'm gonna show you how you can
remove data from your MongoDB database
and well it should be actually just
MongoDB because MongoDB Cana includes DB
as well which stands for database so I
probably don't need to say MongoDB
database well anyways getting back to
the tutorial what we have right here is
pretty much nothing so I'm gonna say or
actually let me just work with sublime
only so right here if you see like I say
print hello potato and build it you see
it's me hello potato and buy as well
well that's rude but anyways now what
I'm gonna do is because this is our
shell only so we have access to all that
stuff which we were just making use of
right there so I can say like use MDB
and then I would say like m DB or
actually DV dot m DB dot insert and I'm
gonna say that this is my object or
actually let me just say that this is an
object and right here I'm gonna create a
war object and say it like named Mabel
and then you know web site old BAM right
and then I want to create another object
right so what I can do is I can actually
insert multiple objects at a time we'll
just take a look at that how so I'm
gonna do object to name
da-da-dah and actually let's just give
it to da da da because it has been
recently news a lot so I want to change
the website to facebook.com and if you
know what I mean so now if I actually
just change to object to and if I want
to insert multiple objects at a time
what I'm gonna do is put them in the
array right on Jake 1 and object - here
we go now build this boy and see we have
got the bulk right results instead of
right results which we got earlier now
what we can do instead of this thing I
could just actually show it as well DB
dot M DV dot show or pretty much find
dot pretty and build it I can see that
inside here we get a lot of duplicates
because you see that we are running this
code a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot of
times because we are kind of building it
each and every time so this is not a
kind of alternative for our manga shell
so probably let's just work on manga
shell only so I'm gonna say Mongo and
right here I'm gonna say use M DV and DV
dot drop database and true and then say
exit I'm gonna say Mongo I'm gonna say
use m DB I'm gonna say now I'm gonna say
object 1 or let's do a direct insertion
now M DV dot insert to be like name Meho
let's just keep it to that only for now
name dadada right there and wait a
minute
DB dot let's just change it to names and
true right there you can see and oh I
guess I'm nice to bracket right there it
should be like that right so now if I
write M DV dot find T V dot nd without
fine hit enter
well got pretty much nothing actually
because this is names right so now you
see that we got may hold me hold on
dah-dah-dah because of probably this one
right there so it wasn't expecting the
second argument but anyways now actually
in this tutorial what I wanted to do is
show you how to remove the data right so
if you want to remove a data you need to
specify what sort of data you want to
remove you don't want to remove vibe of
your database in one command you want to
say DB dot names not remove right here
just like you insert you would pass in
an argument which would contain an
object which if matched would remove
that particular record or the document
or whatever the heck you want to say
that in this case let's say this is da
da da let me just change it to me hole
so that we can just get rid of two
records right there so hit enter and you
can see that in right result it returns
me how many documents it has removed
so now if I probably I can adjust my
mouse right there right there okay so if
I say now DB dot m DB not find well well
again the same mistake names not fine
you can see that we are now only left
with da da da instead of all that crap
which we had earlier well that is how
pretty much you remove a database entry
from Mongo and there are kind of
advanced way of doing that as well with
regular expressions or with other
advanced things like written matching
anything else like your integer values
rather than something you know there are
a lot of ways to do that but for this
tutorial I'm just going to keep it real
quick and simple so earlier or later on
we're going to learn more about removing
database the advanced removing database
Candlelight would be the title so that
is all for this tutorial
and if you like that then don't forget
to subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
