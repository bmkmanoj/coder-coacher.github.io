your very first ionic framework tutorial
and in this tutorial I'll be just
rushing over through what ionic is and
we'll be learning a bit about this
frameworks history and what we actually
need to learn this well first things
first
well this ionic framework would make
your life a whole lot easier if you want
to code a simple web application like a
simple web application for your website
like your mobile web application which
just allows your users to make use of
your website even if they are on the
mobile so ionic kind of is a SDK
framework which would help you to make
super cool applications for your mobile
for with the help of the angularjs frame
what we have and the simple HTML we
already have so I on ik is the supercool
framework and it would be super easy to
make some cool applications with ionic
because it works kind of with angular
and we already have learned angular a
lot so if you haven't then I would
highly recommend you to learn things in
this order so starting off with HTML
first of all on some HTML then with the
CSS well you will HTML and CSS and a
mixed way only if you check my playlist
I have just taught them simultaneously
so that you can just see the dots
connecting then we have then you have to
learn JavaScript after that and once
you're done with JavaScript then go to
my angularjs tutorials and once you have
done with that that you can come back to
this video tutorial and you can continue
pretty much so hybrid applications with
angular and ionic is the future for the
applications if you want to just build a
simple application not so technical and
but it should be kinda just cool and
simple so we
I've got this presentation cut off from
angular itself so this is the links for
the Twitter account for and the github
one for the ionic project then we have
the overview and a native app is a
simple app which just works on the
native ApS provided by the operating
system of a particular device like for
Windows it would be I guess kind of
win32 API which would be the native API
provided by Microsoft for development
purposes
well the downside of native apps and it
shows its proficiency in each platform
required entirely separate code bases
like for example if you are kind of
building a native application for
Windows then you have to make use of
win32 api and if you are making a native
application for let's say a mac then you
have to make use of completely different
API s so that's kind of entirely
separate code bases so ionic solves this
problem for mobile applications with
more platforms more problems coming but
ionic just take years of them so is
there sort of alternative yes it is then
we have hybrid apps are slow then there
are some statistics right there native
SDKs are great so common UI views all
that stuff then we have the hello to
ionic now it says that it would you make
use of the web technologies you already
know so I am assuming that you know HTML
CSS JavaScript and plus angular as well
so if you don't know any one of these
then I would highly recommend you to
learn HTML CSS JavaScript or angular any
one or more if you don't know so that it
would be easy for you to keep it up with
the tutorials then again there are some
sort of stats right there standing on
the shoulders of angularjs
then we have negative focus performance
obsessed plain old CSS and SAS is a
preprocessor for CSS and I may just push
the tutorial series for SAS as well but
for now let's just leave it then we have
ionic ons well that's a nice name for
some cool icons then we have pretty much
the UI you can create lists the complex
list types then we have you can see that
we got some sort of HTML early here so
you might feel comfortable while coding
ionic applications navigation tabs side
menus and all that stuff you can you
know you can just implement that on your
website or so your web application then
these are all sort of things you can do
we'll be taking a look at them later on
when we are just coding some
applications we have some command-line
interface for here all right so that
ends the presentation pretty much and
we'll be starting off with ionic
programming and basically the next one
would be I guess the setting up of ionic
framework from the next tutorial and in
this tutorial pretty much I'm going to
just end it right here
so yeah so once you are done with those
HTML CSS JavaScript and angular then you
are free to continue to tutorial number
two and build some most awesome web
applications for various devices the
handheld devices mobile phones tablets
with ionic so if you like this tutorial
