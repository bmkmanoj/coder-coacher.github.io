maple and welcome to your 12 angular
tutorial in which we're going to take a
look at what data binding in angular is
and how we can get it to work so to
start off with again we're going to go
simple because angularjs already had
this data binding with these two curly
braces and you could evaluate it like an
expression 1 plus 1 or any sort of
multiplication division call even
JavaScript functions so we can very much
say like result in here and we can say 1
plus 1 is equal to and result and what
we can do is in our component we can
define result as 2 and hit save and make
sure you have the app running and you
would get 1 plus 1 is equal to 2 fair
enough so that is one way and the other
way if you want to like buying this this
value to an attribute rather instead of
just showing it raw on the page what you
would do is pretty much say like input
type text and the value is this thing
right so this is one way right now the
actual meaning of this thing is not that
it's just sets the value of this input
type to input that takes the result but
it rather sets the property the Dom
property of input type takes to result
and what that means actually is that it
is monitoring this property and once the
result is changed since the property is
linked with this result and then you
have changed the result variable then
the property will also be changed right
so the difference the difference
actually if we take a look if this is
your element right let's say this is any
sort of element let's say this is input
element so when you right
importer let's just make it 20 yes input
type text and value some value here
right this value is being said as a
property of this input box for the first
time and later on when the user just
modifies it this property right here
this Don don't attribute attribute
remains still the same but when you
access it where JavaScript like I don't
know my input load value by getting this
input reference then what happens is
that you are now accessing the property
of this Dom object right
so what angular is doing right here is
that it's not setting its value it's
it's not setting the attribute value to
the result but it's rather setting the
property of this dorm of to result
and what we can do in order to see that
it's working is that very much let's
just go ahead and create a constructor
and right here let's just fire set
timeout which really must save that
result is equal to 50 right and if you
save this and change the set timer to
two seconds and save this and you can
see that after 2 seconds it changes from
to 250 now again if it were just echoing
out the value then it would just remain
at 2 here but it's actually binding to
the property of the element so it
changes the value to 50 when the result
changes right so this was an important
thing to understand to know how binding
works in angular and another way to
actually achieve the same thing is to
make use of this square brackets and
again looks like blank text is not
happy but we're still going to go with
it so these square brackets and that
interpolation syntax with these curly
braces it's pretty much the same there's
a slight difference I would just let you
know about that by the end of the
tutorial but for now these square
brackets pretty much stays again that
because if you do something like this
then angular has no idea if you actually
want the value to have to be result or
you want to let anger take control of
this value so the square bracket is
again a syntactic sugar it is still
angular that we want you to be in
control and just parse out what we have
and right here it's probably some
JavaScript and just make sense for it so
we save it and we see concede again we
get two and fifty and again it's just
binding to the property okay so well
actually the difference between binding
where the square brackets and binding
where these curly braces is pretty much
that these curly braces what they do
when you do something like this they
actually evaluate whatever inside it is
and convert it to string right so that
is one way to understand this so if you
have something like I don't know an
array one two three so you know that for
arrays they just pretty much turn into
something like this on conversion on
strings so it will just show you that
but with the the square notation what
happens is that the result is just
evaluated as it is but it's not
converted to string right so that's
pretty much the only difference between
these notations and I guess this one
looks a bit cleaner than the that curly
brace notation but again it's up to you
whatever you prefer both are correct
right so that was a real
no real quick tutorial on one-way
data-binding
with the angular and it's actually half
the part of one-way data-binding because
we have not seen how we can one-way
data-binding from the view to the
component script right so we'll just
take a look at that in the next tutorial
so that is all for this one and if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
