angularjs tutorial in which we'll be
covering on more on expressions and
directives which we learn in the past
couple of tutorials so we learned about
expressions and directives like that
expressions are used to echo out simply
a bunch of text inside two curly braces
opening curly braces and closing curly
braces and directives kind of attach
your control of HTML elements to other
elements so let's see how you can make
them more dynamic and how to make them
work together and we'll be talking about
one more directive in angular called
ng in it but it does not used that much
because of controllers in angularjs
which will be discussing soon so let's
take a look at what ng in it is so ng in
it kinda allows you to store data inside
your HTML itself so that you can use it
somewhere else
pretty much like you store variables in
JavaScript
so let's have a look so let's say I
initialize my app oh I have already done
it in the HTML section so what I can do
is I'll just type diff ng in it and I'll
type here
language equals angular GS and notice
the quotes because since we are kind of
creating a variable type of thing and
assigning it to language in it and to
output this we could simply do like we
did in like five plus five regular
expression similarly we can just type
language so it would echo out a
angularjs as its output because language
is currently set to angularjs but
however if I type code around it then
you'll see that we get language itself
so make sure just like in JavaScript we
make use of variables directly without
inside any quotes similarly you have to
use the data stored by ng in it without
any codes while calling them so the next
thing we can do with it is to create
let's say input type a text box and we
can use ng model to bind whatever we
used here so let's say if I write your
preferred language and I write hear
language and by default also I want to
show a default value to it so what
happens now is let me see
let me make you see this and it here
right here says that your preferred
language is angularjs and automatically
it appears here so whatever I make
changes to here let's PHP or MATLAB or
maybe JavaScript for some folks out
there so that's how basically ng in it
works but we won't be using it much when
I introduce controllers to you and maybe
we would be doing that in next couple of
tutorials so stay tuned with me don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
