seventh jQuery tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be looking at some cool
event methods in jQuery now even methods
are kind of actions to the selectors and
basically by that what I mean is when
stance you want to do something with
body like when whenever someone who was
over your body alright that's great idea
to give it a clean meaning let's say
divide a hello
just a simple death with hello world
let's say somebody when who were so word
is still with the mouse then what
happens is he gets an alert box so to
achieve that we have event methods in
jQuery so let's go to our script file
which we have included as an external
script after the chick ready now let's
edit this so let's wait for the document
to become ready and let's go ahead and
do use our first even tagger so to
select hello we'll use the or basically
let's just go over there right now as I
haven't explained the selectors right
now to you so let's just go and type div
this means select div on the document
this line down here means and what we
want to all of these tips we want to add
even Tyler click which on on clicked
gives us an alert of what's she doing
this means that on any of the DIF click
what you have to do is alert this or
basically run this code inside this
function so let's reload the page and I
guess we already got this let's reload
on clicking this we get what should
doing bro simple enough and let's move
on to our next event handler which are
which is double flick now double click
as the name suggests
dbl click this even fires now instead of
a single click fires when we double
click on the element so when I double
click on this element I get what's she
doing bro
okay simple enough click and double
click I hope are clear whenever these
events are fired then this code turns
down here I hope I'm not going too fast
now the next thing I would like to
discuss is the key up and key down
events and for that I need an input type
box so let's say input type text that's
it for now because I haven't explained
you selectors very well so I'll just use
minimal HTML with jQuery so input dot
here
now if you guessed it right that what it
will do is this even would fire whenever
a user presses its key over the input
box so let's say I want to hello it wow
you could type Robo so this alert this
code would execute whenever there's a
key up or basically your finger lifts up
after pressing a key so let's say I
write the letter M
okay I guess I haven't reload this let's
check for the syntax as well
the syntax looks perfect we load em so
we get an alert box JavaScript alert
says wow you could type Robo let's say I
type another letter n I get another
alert box but what if I keep pressing a
key and don't release it so unless I
don't release it this even would not
fire because this is a key up event and
this would only fire when I'll release
this key l and let's do it
so as soon as I release this key this
event is fired and we get an alert or an
alert box so as you can see it takes
even the delete keys other backspace had
all the keys which are not even
characters as input so the next thing
we'll have to discuss is the key down
what the key down one in opposite to key
of fires whenever you press the key so
basically it would fire as soon as you
press the key and would not wait for the
key to be released so as you can see
this would fire each time I press the
key instead of releasing it so I could
not actually keep pressing the key
because JavaScript Lord won't let me do
that
cool now the next thing I would like to
discuss with you is the whole one now
this whole one is special because it
would accept two functions and explain
you why this is because in Hoover
function we have basically two states
the first state where the user is
hovering over the element and the next
state where the user basically navigates
his mouse from the elements so now the
user is hovering and now he's not
covering not overing not so we need two
functions to run whenever the user who
was over the element and whenever he is
not hovering or basically he quits from
the state of hovering so let's say in
the first date we do alert let's say it
is console.log to make that things
cleaner you just
and here let's say console.log
or maybe
are you leaving me not bad so let's
check the console now and here you go
now on Hoover it gives us you just over
pad or leave it says are you leaving me
over leave overly overly for a leaf you
can do that all day if you want do so
this was our first tutorial on even
handlers in JavaScript and in the next
tutorial we'll be discussing more about
even handlers in JavaScript so stay
tuned with me and don't forget to
