and in this video we're gonna take a
look at some of the PRS I received on go
down recently and let's just review what
we have for them and what I have done
for code down in these many days let's
get started okay so if we take a look at
the repository right now there is a br
which I haven't reviewed and there were
a couple of them before as well which I
did not record so this PR says us to
make the assets local so okay it's with
regarding my issue five and this guy has
actually done some work let's see what
files he has changed so let's just get
into split mode right here there we can
see a little bit clearer so yeah he has
changed some files added images locally
and added CSS which consists of all the
fonts okay make sense and we have all
the images downloaded as well that's
good so he has made changed to the CSS
and precisely the images just like the
issue reported perfect okay so he's
linking to a local CSS file and if you
see this say yeah he is just getting all
the CSS fonts from the cached version
from the online version of Google CDN
which makes sense because I'm using a
CDN is actually useful if you want to
use a cached version for example if
someone visits another site using the
same point then my site
would not need to download that same
point again so that makes sense let's
just March this PR into the main branch
let me just do it from the complete tab
here and there we are
merge the pull request here we go
nice shot okay so what we have here for
cool down right now is that I'm just
struggling a little bit
working with tried typescript with go
down because I haven't really worked
with typescript on node.js before but
it's okay I'm learning things and we'll
be posting as well how I am doing all
that stuff so basically typescript is
right now just throwing errors on every
line these days and if we take a look
you can see that throw some errors in
the code right now as well so it's not
usable so I'm just trying to create a
typescript configuration here it just
works fine with the project and yeah
that's basically it what's up with code
base right now I would be working on the
login and sign up pad and should be able
to get it done real soon
and meanwhile you can actually
contribute to the issues I have opened
on the repository you can see that I
have added two more issues in the last
couple of hours so you should be able to
see the first one is moving CSS colors
to variables and second one is actually
you can suggest me a color scheme you
know I'm not that good with colors and
all on the front-end so if you have a
good color scheme in mind you can
suggest me and the second one is
basically just moving the CSS variables
which are often used for example
repeating background colors or text
colors you can actually make all of them
variable and just
sent me a PR and I'll be happy to review
it so I'm actually also thinking to open
a Trello board for go down but I'm not
really sure if you should do that or
would that be a great idea or not I'm
just reviewing that things and let's see
what happens in future so that's
basically it for the state and I'll see
you then in d2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
