Miho and welcome to your tenth ionic
tutorial in which we'll be adding an
infinite scroll feature to our news
application which we are building so far
and what I'm gonna do is that I'm gonna
implement something known as an eye on
infinite scroll directive right there
and what it would do is basically it
would allow us for example this is if
this is our application then when I go
down right there then it would
automatically load more news content
from you know the older news
automatically without you know just
requiring user to clicking to click any
button or something like that so what
I'm gonna do is copy this thing right
here the eye on infinite scroll and
right here just before this eye on
content I'm gonna paste this and right
here it says that on infinite load more
is the callback and that means that the
user when the user is about to hit the
down down the most you know the base of
the page you can say so this function
would be fired so let's just go ahead
and create this load more and what you
can do is actually just copy this load
more from here only so that it just
saves us a bunch of seconds now what I
want to do is actually that whenever
there's a load more function call I want
to make I want to actually load some
more articles so I'm gonna call this
thing right here
but we require a parameter and that
parameter would be passed in as I guess
there's a prime object here and this is
actually object itself so this would be
for a meter rah meters something like
that and I'm going to create a war
parameters other object and I'm gonna
say this has
an ID of the ID I guess we are not
storing and yeah one more thing I want
to mention right here is that actually
if I just view the console right here
and if I just console.log console.log
school lot news and actually just below
this line you can see that we get an
object inside the scope news well that's
not what I actually wanted this
application to have as you can see my
intent was to create this as an array
well you can say that objects are arrays
are objects well we know that in
JavaScript but you know some methods
like Bush won't work with objects very
well and for our this application what I
want is that when I make use of this I
on infinite scroll then I want to push
the new articles to the scope dot News
RA so that I don't have to just you know
just apply or make use of any sort of
angular digest cycles or something like
that
so what I'm going to do is that convert
this object into an array while with the
help of this angular dot for each now
this angular dot for each loop would
actually just accept this as a news data
or data this whole data and inside this
function it would through a single
element at a time so I can safely say
that this little single news article
which just contains all the information
like name and title image link and all
that stuff right there and I'm gonna get
rid of this and news article is just
simply and probably this should be not
push so here we go now as you can see
right here we get a simple little object
instead of that sorry a simple little
array I should say rather instead of
that object so let's just remove that as
well okay so now we have the reference
or as
use items is not defined well I don't
need it either so what I'm gonna do and
yeah one more thing we have to do is
that set a scope not news or pretty much
like scope dot news dot last ID last
let's say last article ID equals news
data data here dot data dot last ID I
guess I named it last ID only so if I
can just console.log this to verify
whether this works or not before just
going off with the application yeah it
pretty much works so let's just comment
that out as well alright now we have got
the last article ID inside our scope not
news whatever this is so we can just
make use of that right here inside this
ID parameter so I'm gonna say this thing
right there alright so now our request
is ready and what the scope that
broadcast pretty much means is that it's
gonna send even down the children right
there so if you have like a module set
to this ng-app
this ng-controller is news controller
then it would just broadcast this
message that this scroll dot infinite
scroll is completed to all the ionic
things and stuff so that ionic can just
keep your keep you know the stuff
organized what happens when the ionic
infinite scroll is complete like removes
that removing that loading icon' and
they're pretty much adjusting some sort
of CSS or HTML you know you get the idea
so alright so we are pretty much done
here what I want next is simply I want
to do a couple of things right here I
want to say scope dot news dot last
article ID is or actually rather we can
just get rid of this at all so I'm just
going to make use of the last article ID
so I just pull you that thing
so I'm going to say last article ID
would be what we are at on here as items
so this would be items dot last ID and
hit enter ok so now we have updated the
ID so that when the user again scroll
down a little bit so that the user sees
some older post instead of just loading
the same post again the final thing I
need to do is actually just keep it
right here and say again angular dot for
each functional not a function items dot
data function as an item and I want
again to just scope dot news dot push
item ok pretty much we are done here so
fingers crossed and let's check out our
application so down down down we go and
okay so it doesn't pretty much looks
like it's working it's just making some
sort of Ajax request but if I just go to
the header section and just visit this
page right here maybe I'm missing a
thing or something yeah I guess we don't
have any sort of data here so probably I
don't need this at all so if I just
reload this again and check this out
down down down we go and as you can see
we have successfully loaded some more
news articles down there and the reason
why images are not loaded is probably my
bad internet connection because the
links are working fine and you can see
that the images should probably load a
little bit later on but
they load so as you can see we have
implemented a nice little infinite
scroll sort of system and right now I
have some downloads going on in progress
so my internet is sort of a bit slower
right now so that is why the news is not
loading that much quicker but if you try
it out at your own end then I'm pretty
much sure that the news would load
faster now one problem I have seen while
scrolling is that we get some sort of
black articles this one right there ad I
have no idea what this actually is so
let's just take a look why we get this
so often I guess I got one again all
right there so looks like okay I guess
that angular is making use of this last
ID as well so we need to somehow tell
angular that do not show the ng-if news
article dot title is there like
obviously the that last ID doesn't have
sort of title associated with it so that
did the trick and in the console we are
getting a lot a lot a lot of errors so
Caesar's duplicates not allowed so what
we can do is just go ahead and track by
what you can do is news article dot do
we have a sort of unique ID for every
article no not really
we have added the ID associated for a
bunch of articles so I'm going to go
ahead with the index one ollie so right
here if I just scroll down down down
also a little bit more and about to
reach the bottom you can see that more
news unloaded automatically which is
sort of cool stuff
so here we go some more news for us
and then again down down now we go so
this is sort of a cool application which
we have developed in ionic
with infinite loading as well so you can
just change this distance to five or ten
so that it just loads a bit quicker and
yeah so I'm gonna end this tutorial
pretty much here and if you liked it
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching and probably in the
next tutorial we'll be covering
something cool with this application so
stick with me and again if you liked it
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
