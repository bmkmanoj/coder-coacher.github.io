27th HTML and CSS tutorial and in this
tutorial let's continue with what we
learned in the last tutorial about table
and one of its attribute so in the last
tutorial I showed you how to create a
simple table with just two columns and
one row with the help of a deprecated
attribute of table tag called border now
let's see how we can make this document
a html5 valid document so to do that
first of all we'll need to remove this
water attribute from this table tag
let's reload this and now we get a plain
text but we want to give it a feel of a
table so what we'll do is inside the
style tag we'll grab the table and we'll
give it a border of let's say 3 pixel
solid black so that's how you give a
border in the table but we have got a
problem here now if I reload this now
this would give it a border just like we
are giving to some div or so so it
doesn't look like our original border
attribute which we specified in the
table tag so to do that we have to do
this model to multiple selectors and to
select more than one element we put a
comma and we write these selector names
so for example instead of writing like
table model three pixels then TR border
three pixel and then TD what we do is if
the properties and the values are common
we just put a comma we write the element
name we'll just put a comma we write
another element name and so on so you
could actually use make use of IDs or
classes anything you like so I'm just
grabbing table TR and TD all at once
because I would like to give all of
those a border of three pixels solid
black so now let's reload this and now
this kind of looks similar to what we
have very first while starting this
tutorial and let's make it a little
lighter and great
and we have a nice table so let's add
something to this let's say create
another rule so I hope you are clear
with the concepts of flow and columns in
tables so if not then let me tell you
that rows are the horizontal horizontal
way of displaying data and columns are
the vertical way of displaying data so
this data one and this data one belongs
to same column and these two belongs to
same column these two data 1 &amp;amp; 2 belong
to same row and these two belong to same
row now we have another tag in your
table which is th now TD and th are
exactly one on the same thing the
difference is TD th is the bolded
version of TD attribute TD tag so this
tag is this line is equal to th and th
so if I reload the document now and see
then ok so I guess we didn't select it
th here so it showed us no butter it's
real of this so now you see that B tag
just makes the text bolder and same with
that th tag so th stands for table
heading just remember they're full forms
table heading
your TD stands for table data your dr
stands for table row and table itself is
a table tag nothing to explain here so
now we have a data set of two rows and
two columns and one thing special about
table is if you don't specify any width
to the table then it would automatically
adjust the data according to its width
so for example if you see that right now
it's data one the filling the complete
width of the cell now each data block in
the table is called as a cell remember
that I would use this term so you should
not be confused in the future tutorials
so data 2 refers to a cell data 1 refers
to a cell and similar like these two so
table by default would is kind of
reluctant to give more space and let's
say I want to make it a little bit
spacer and kind of giving it more space
for displaying this data - so the
traditional way would be to give self
padding now this attribute is deprecated
but I'm just showing you this to just
make you recognize when you see the cell
padding on a html5 document so you just
don't say hey what the heck is that I
never learned what is cell padding
though it's not required in HTML but
html5 sorry but cell padding is still
used by many old old-school developers
so just you need to correct them just
remember that cell padding and cell
spacing are deprecated
attributes for table in html5 but for
now let's just see what happens when I
gave it self padding 20 and it doesn't
require unit right here because it's
kind of fall max to in default unit I
don't know maybe it's pixel or points
but it's something we don't need so now
when I reload this with the cell padding
20 you see that we get the padding of 20
units from the data and the data is
placed in the center because from the
table also it's 20 units bottom left and
right and self spacing and am repeatedly
telling you that do not use these two
attributes but instead use the CSS which
I would be showing you right now to
perform such tasks but I'm just telling
you about these attributes because they
are they were the part of HTML standard
once so let's give spells it cell
spacing as well 20 and let's reload this
so now you are understanding the
difference between cell spacing and
cells far are cell padding so cell
spacing provides spaces between the cell
cell boundaries
and the table boundary but cells padding
would provide spacing between the cell
contents and its boundaries so now since
these both are deprecated let's remove
this and let's find a CSS way of doing
this to make the document
html5 standard so one thing I want to
tell you is that whatever you apply here
to the table let's say if I apply border
two then this would be inherited all the
way down to all these tags but with CSS
if I do just stable by the two then you
saw that the bottom was only applied to
the stable only an or the child elements
so that's that's why we need to do
multiple selectors in CSS similar way to
apply cell spacing let's say let's give
it TR or maybe TR TD is cell spacing now
right here if you know that I'm
selecting every TD which is inside the
TR but though it's not required to write
TR this would work fine as well but I'm
just writing for so that you can see
that TDS are present in the TR which is
the table rule so now we make use of the
property called padding to create a
similar effect like a cell padding now
cell padding and repair using the storm
cell padding because self padding would
add some spacing between the cell
contents and the boundaries of that cell
so let's see if I give it a padding of
10 pixels and what CSS you have to give
the unit of the numeric value you are
using because we have many units in CSS
so now let's reload this document and
now you can see that we have the padding
of 10 pixels in each of the cell we have
right here
and to create a similar effect like of
cell spacing we make use of Martian not
these margin and padding I guess are two
of the most used properties in CSS while
you are working with any of the element
let it be your div elements your span
your block level elements h1 tags
headings everything you need margin and
padding in most of the cases when you
are aligning a element in its proper
position so let's say I give it a margin
of 10 pixels as well and remember that
padding and margin two properties of CSS
and not the attributes the attributes
for table are cell spacing and cell
padding and remember that cell spacing
and cells per cell
spanning Oh cell spacing and cell
padding it should be yeah so that my
tongue just what you say so let me
gather my thoughts and yeah here we go
so let's start it again now cell spacing
and self padding are only the attributes
only the deprecated attributes of table
and the tags on the table and you cannot
actually use cell spacing with body so
though they are deprecated I am
repeatedly telling you that but you
should know that because that were a
part of your previous standards of HTML
so now let's reload this document
and let me save that okay so
okay so let's see what's happening we
have getting bearing 10 pixel
and one thing I guess I remember now is
that you can use margin with every
element in HTML but not on table
elements and specifically on those
elements which have the display property
set to table cell or table or anything
else related to table and don't worry
about this display property I would be
explaining this display and everything
like block level ad inline elements in
my next tutorial so not in the next I
guess but in some future tutorial so
that we don't break with this table flow
so to achieve that spacing we had with
the cell spacing attribute of table
first of all what we need to do is we
need to apply the attribute the
attribute border spacing border dash
spacing
to the table tag itself so if I give a
10 pixel right here and I reload this
then now you can see that the margin
between the borders of every cell and
the table itself is 10 pixel so remember
that you can use margin property of CSS
technically with every element except
for those having a display table or any
table display set to them and I will
explain this display what this heck this
displays in my future tutorial so don't
worry about that leave it to me and
that's how basically table works and in
the next tutorial we'll be finally
making a good sort of table for us to
work with and I'll see you there next
