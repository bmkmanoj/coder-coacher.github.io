yet another Google Chrome extension
development tutorial and which we'll be
continuing with our storage grande at
storage API and let's continue with our
code so last time we just created a
basic layout for extension with just
alert whatever we write inside this so
now we need a mechanism somehow to store
this who are you so if I look into the
docs then in the first example it gives
me an API chrome but storage not sink
God said and the argument is passed as
an object with function as a callback if
you notice then all right so let's call
it ourselves
so right here you have got the value
let's comment it out for the time being
from dot storage dot synchronize dot set
and right here it takes argue
one which is all the data and our cume
and to which is a callback function if
I'm not wrong
yeah it is so in the argument what as
you can see all of the data is fast so
right here it says value the value and
what does that mean is I'll tell you so
let's say if I say my line and column
value now this thing right here would
also work so we don't need any callback
function actually so my line and a colon
and a value what it does is it would
basically create a variable a kind of
you can say a kind of map that has my
line written on it and it stores all the
things you had in the variable value we
could also do that something like this
but that would make this function this
API strictly static so my line is
storing the word value here but what
this my line variable source whatever
the user supplies inside the textbox
save line which is grab the wire the
JavaScript and stored inside the
variable value so
let's check this out this example
without any callback function I'll see
if it works so let's launch the pop-up
dot HTML let's open the console in case
there's an error we could just get the
reference of that I'll write al and I'll
click on save line and nothing happens
and nothing in the console as well and
these are good signs that means there
was no error so if it passed callback
function now and stay alert success
and
if I reload this thing right here
then you see that whenever a save line
it says success so
you see that it's all the time for
writing everything are right here so the
benefit now even though even if I close
my browser start restart my computer and
to again think actually don't do the
same thing again but if I write this is
a cool line and save this line and now
even if I restart my computer and
somehow use this API instead of set to
get it then I would get the exact same
words arid wrote here from this variable
right here so in this tutorial you
learned how to set something inside a
Chrome variable and the syntax to go
over it again it's very much simple you
just write chrome top storage dot
synchronize dot set all those methods
this accepts two arguments are one
and our to r1 is an object of what you
want to store the data and RX 2 is a
function is a callback function and this
is a cloud for your gun information so
you need not to write this function
every time unless you want to verify
even if your data was stored or not so R
1 as well enough and since this is an
object will write this in curly braces
your key name your key value
there you go so you have now
successfully stored something inside
chrome storage and that's it for this
tutorial and the next one will be
looking at how you can retrieve data
from the chrome storage so still man
till then stay tuned and me don't forget
to subscribe thank you for watching
