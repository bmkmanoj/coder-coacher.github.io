Mabel and welcome to your tenth angular
six tutorial in which we're gonna rush
away through what ng forests and
basically how to I trade over data and
angular so let's get started alright in
this tutorial we're going to cover
basically ng 4 and this would be a
really quick tutorial because there's
not a lot to do in ng 4 again on its own
and actually I am fed off these
tutorials with discover a single topic
without actually linking other stuff
with it so let's just quickly go through
this and get started with some app
building which actually teaches how to
link interlink and use everything
together so ng 4 first of all way to use
it's easy wherever you see I tribals in
form of arrays or maybe your components
as well in case your angular you write
something which makes it makes your
components I tribal if you can do
something which is if then create
something which is I tribal or if you
can get something like that then you can
use energy for with it then for the
syntax pad it's easy just like you have
to write the same thing which is here
right and let's get started so first of
all let's just create some dummy data
here so I'm gonna create a data variable
which is an array which consists of an
object of Pershing's so this is a name
and let's just say we have another field
label online true something like that
same name ABC all line false say we have
name X file said all line true right
let's say we had three dragons and in
your case you would be probably getting
these requests from some sort of API or
your database or something like that so
that makes sense now what I want is that
I want to display these records nicely
on my view so if we need to do here as
that will destroy the table here we'll
just don't stop some DRS and Deedee's so
let's just say my PD his name the second
one is is online and let's just say here
I say ng 14 here so how would I use ng 4
here well let's say you want to repeat
some element so on that particular
element you would use star and g4 just
like this then you would go something
like let the temporary variable assigned
to every record for example I can say a
little record of now we can just rename
this what caused here so that it makes
more sense the core of records right and
once you write this let record of
records what this means is that every
record every element in this in this
array would be stored in record in every
iteration so now you can access it
something like god dot name
and God not all in status
okay so now what we have is that when we
access record name we'll get this record
this value Mabel ABC and XYZ right here
right and you can do is wrap this inside
a TD now we can also say call line here
right and now if we take a look at the
browser you can see that we get
something like name that is on line has
two columns so you can see that here we
get named Mabel is on line true false
true as the values we had in our records
now what we can do is actually we can
access the index values as well so for
example we can create a serial number
here something like this and here what
we can say is I and here will sell it I
is equal to index now you can name this
anything my index or whatever you want
but this should be indexed way to change
it it might index take a look you can
see that we get 0 1 2 here obviously
this to mind X plus 1 just in case you
want to start with 1 okay now similarly
what we can do is right here we can
access the even on regards as well
now this functionality all of this
functionality is provided by ng 4 out of
the box so you do not need to do
anything I can say that let even records
is equal to even and let all records is
equal to odd and then and now what we
have is that these even records
variables would be this even record
variable would be true whenever we are
right rating over even number of record
and this variable all recalls will be
true whenever we are iterating over odd
number record right so what we can say
is that let's just say we pretty much
want to add a class so let's say we want
to add a class to this TR rights
we just highlighted differently so what
I'm gonna do is make use of this ng
class directive and there's a lot about
this that this directive would apply to
and eastern flossing depending upon the
conditions you should plan so for
example I can say that I want to apply
the class this is the Audion if it is an
odd recalled RUC body this makes more
sense otherwise apply even if it is an
even required and let's see if we got
that right in take a look at the browser
if we take a look inside our inspector
we should be able to see that this is a
class of even because this is index zero
this is a class of odd because it has
the next one is this class even because
it had index two right so what we can do
now is we can say something like TR dot
even are the bad Romney black color
white and TR of odd and the background
of red and color white
okay so now if you take a look in the
browser you can see clearly what I mean
so our even records are black to zero
and two and odd records are red so now
we can just pretty much if we duplicate
these you would be able to see that we
have a nice little table in here with
alternate colors right so take a look
you can see we are done we were to use a
number syntax but we have done to get
index and how to get or even now we can
also do this first element and last
element thing so what we can do is
pretty much similar thing we can say in
here it's the same that first element
first record his first and let last
record is the last
now we can just say class only the first
as first record and last as last record
take a look here in our first record
what we have is that we get the class as
even and first and our last record gets
the class as even an elastic rate so now
you can do even more for their
customizations with it so yeah that is
pretty much it what we have with ng4 and
that's all we were probably will gonna
need basics basics that is what we're
gonna need for ng4 and i trading over i
travel data in angular and that's all
