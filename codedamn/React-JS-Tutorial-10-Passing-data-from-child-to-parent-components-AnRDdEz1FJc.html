Mei hole and welcome to your tenth
react.js tutorial in which I'm going to
show you how you can pass data from
parent component or actually from child
component to parent component we have
seen earlier that you can pass parent
component data from building components
to child components with props and
access them well how do we do that the
reverse way well the answer is that we
can just create a method inside the
parent component itself and we can just
call it from the child component and do
all that updation necessary stuff so
let's just do that so first of all
inside or actually let's create another
component and we can just say this is
something like planet properties such as
and we would need react and say this
thing as well at least a little bit
planet drop for piece right there we can
just get rid of this for now and now we
can do is that we can inside a rendered
person return button update parent
button and right there we can say planet
drop for peace and since we haven't
imported that yet we can just fill that
right now import landed properties from
and since we are in the same folder
within the school planet properties like
that
okay so now we have access to this
component and this component and pretty
much just returns a button to us so now
how do we update this state counter from
this child component well you do that
you can pass in this update this counter
as prop to this you know child combo so
we can say this as trigger parent update
we can say this at update this counter
it's the answer right so yeah looks good
now we can do is inside our planet
properties that cheers we can make use
of this prop just like we would do
normally or we can say button on click
is this this dot drops dot trigger
parent update just like that and let's
just see how this looks like so we have
update this of the experiment like
update parent button and if I click on
this you can see that our payment is
updating this is your parent this
counter lies in parent component this
button is in child component and we are
updating parent from child so again you
can just stop in some data as well by
calling a method or you know anything
like that you can just modify set state
from a parent company from child
component like that and that is how
pretty much you interact with your
parent and that's all for this one and
if you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
