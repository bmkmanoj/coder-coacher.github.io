is Mickel and welcome to another
tutorial for social log an application
with ionic 3 and angular 4 and in this
tutorial we're gonna continue with the
application and this one would be the
probably the last one which we will be
doing on the web after this I'm gonna
implement the same thing on the phone
and again there's a difference because
on the web when you log in with any of
these providers you are presented with a
pop-up but on the phone there's nothing
such as such ababa but instead you would
need to make use of some sort of plugins
which Cordova provides out of the box so
first of all we're just gonna implement
it on the web so that we can just take a
look if the application is looking and
working fine and after that we can
switch it to the mobile version so first
of all let's just add some icons to the
buttons and then we do have some icons
provided by ionic out of the box and
meanwhile you might want to update your
ionic CLI I'm not sure when you're
watching this but right now it's 3.9 for
me and you can see that we have some
icons here we can go the Facebook one
just go with this right here we can go
with something like login with Facebook
right we can give it a no break space
similarly we can do the same thing with
the Twitter one as well and we're gonna
say the same thing here
oh it's Google right login with Twitter
and once we are done I'm gonna shrink
this code as well we do have separate
methods for all of this and hey this
should be login with github No
and we do have the method for github as
well okay so we are
login with Twitter the next is github
and we are login with github and yeah
the Google one so Google Plus or Google
let's just go with Google so log in with
Google ok so now let's just shrink this
code as well so I'm just gonna change it
to one method log in with Google login
what we have here Twitter and finally
log in with github so it would make our
JavaScript a little less cumbersome
because I can see there's a lot of code
repetition going on here
so if you can do is create a login
method let's see yeah ok so let's just
create a what we say provider is now we
can just switch the language here or D
provider why not and provider let's just
name it
sign sign in provider so we can switch
the provider we can say for Facebook the
code should be sign in provider sign in
provider writer is new firebase
aught dot Facebook odd provider right
and for case let's just say we have
Twitter here for that we want new
firebase god dot Twitter odd provider
break it then we have case github sign
in providers new firebase dot dot github
author provider
and finally for Google we have sign-in
providers new firebase dot out dot
Google auth provider and make sure to
break their we can safely omit the
default case because we are hot coding
this so yeah now what I want to do is
scope with this thing and all of your
custom settings if you have anything
else specific to a particular platform
that can go right here inside these case
blocks only so once we have this we can
just do sign-in provider right here and
then get the response providers logged
in all that stuff we can finally say
logging in word and then we can say the
provider name and once we do this we can
pretty much get rid of all of these
methods right here oh okay looks much
cleaner and a lot of space to breathe
now so now if we take a look we have
some problems here and BSP right there
and SBP whirs it nbsp nbsp and b SP and
b SP okay so that works and we get the
buttons in place and we can just change
the title as well if you want we can
name it social login app or anything
like that so now one more thing now the
thing is when you click on this the page
reloads or not really reloads but the
pop-up comes up and angular has no clue
when it has to update of you so there
would be a very long delay sometimes
because angular does not know that some
things have been updated and it needs to
run its cycle you can see that we got
the response here but
thing is being updated right now it
should not be so slow so we have to
manually inform angular about this thing
and to do that what we can do is we can
manually trigger an update cycle for
angular 4 you can see that it came after
a very long delay and this should not
obviously be seen by the end-user on the
production app so what you want to do is
manually trigger a change once you know
that the view would suddenly be changed
and that place is probably right here so
to do that what we need to do is
actually include this change detector
reference package from angular core and
create a reference of it inside your
constructor with anything right so once
you do that what you need to do is write
this dot ref dot did Det changes and
what this would do is that it would
manually run a cycle for this component
of this particular component and would
see if there's anything it needs to
update and in our case that would be
this this provider logged in variable
because once it's updated the home dot
HTML file should show this card right so
angular by default kind of goes into
sleep it does not know that we have run
this function variables have been
updated because again it's not running
on a while loop so it runs its cycle
periodically so if there's anything
which angular is not monitoring and has
been changed by you in our case this
variable inside a kind of a promise so
you need to manually tell angular to do
that so now if we take a look we should
probably see that changing immediately
so here we are so you can see that the
moment we got this login with logging in
with Google our card showed up so that
was pretty much it for this tutorial and
in this tutorial what we did is pretty
much clean the code a little bit created
a reference change detector reference so
that we get immediate response on the
front there
that our profiles have been changed so
yeah that's all for this one and if you
liked it then please don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
