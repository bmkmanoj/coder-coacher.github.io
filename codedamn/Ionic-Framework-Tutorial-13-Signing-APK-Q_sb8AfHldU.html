or ik tutorial in which I'm going to
show you how to sign your unsigned apk
which we created in the last tutorial so
that you can actually upload this apk on
Play Store and pretty much install it on
your phone as well so you need to sign
an apk in order to install it and to do
that what we can do make use of is a key
tool which would generate a private key
and first of all I'll just write key to
write here to ensure that you have key
tool installed and if you just sort of
get an error like this command is not
found or something like that then it
probably means that you are missing JDK
now JDK is Java development kit you can
just go to google and download that and
once you're done with that you should
get this tool automatically in your
command line okay so the next thing if I
refers to the documentation itself it
says that we have to generate this
private key by using key tool and how we
have to generate it it's like something
like this key to generate key version
key store and then your key name right
here so I'm going to say most awesome
key error dot key store and then analyze
off let's just keep it to documentation
only a last name then the algorithm for
the key which would be RSA and RSA is an
encryption algorithm key size to zero
for it encryption and rally Duty is ten
thousand I'll hit enter now I have to
enter a keystore password so I'm going
to keep it secret lets us see let me
think what I would give this probably
like hello world because it is a secret
and I'm gonna not tell you that I've get
this password as hello world hello world
it and true what is your first and last
named Meho Mohan what is the name of
your organizational unit code the name
of your organizer Oh what was then
organizational unit whole I don't know
city or locate locality I would probably
keep it to India only state would be
Delhi to control it record I end up
generating da da da da da da da enter
key for enter key password for a last
name return I'm gonna keep it same
storing most awesome key ever alright so
now we are done with the key the next
thing we may use off something known as
jar cider so just type again jar signer
and then enter and you should probably
get something like this
and again if you get sort of errors then
you are probably messing out the JDK so
once you are installed once you have
installed JDK then what you need to do
is go ahead and write char signer
verbose sig LG sha-1 with RSA and don't
worry I'm just copying and pasting it
from a website the documentation one I
don't really remember all of this as
well so you can just you know probably
copy it as well well actually I can
probably give you the link as well the
link is this ionic framework on or you
can just google that how to publish your
APK with ionic and ionic will take you
to there or I could just paste all of
these codes down there and there you see
ice spotted us typo right there so this
would be char instead of a juror the
wait a sec okay done with my call now
again for keystore we don't need my
release because the documentation
probably shows me that but i would like
to keep it to my name only
that would be what I told it most
awesome something like that most awesome
most awesome key ever dot key store
reader not a BK allies name hit enter
enter passphrase for key store and what
it was I guess hello world it was hit
enter
alright so okay so I guess we gotta make
it to news reader probably like that and
move it out a little bit to our hello
world application right there and now
let's do it hello world hit enter jar
side perfect now if you take a look then
looks like it's signed
so jar is not time stabbed whatever so
we have finally signed there our jar or
the basically our apk file which is
nothing but a bunch of Java files now
because remember that Android has a
native language the Buddha's Java only
so no matter how hard you could at some
point you have to be in Java when you
are writing Android code so here we are
with our signed apk and pretty much we
are done with this application and in
the next tutorial I'm going to show you
how this looks like on a phone so that's
all for this one and if you liked it
