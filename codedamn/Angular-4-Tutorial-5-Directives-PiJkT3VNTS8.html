Mayo and welcome to your fifth angular
tutorial in which we are going to take a
look what directives are in angular and
how pretty much set them up get them
started with your app so if you work
with angularjs then you pretty much know
that you can have directives like
attributes so you can just say simply
like input and then you can say your own
custom directive or custom attributes
rather you would say check on enter and
then you can say typ type text and all
that stuff goes in here so you can then
create a definition for this check on
enter which will just fire whenever
enter is pressed or whatever you Lodge
according to that JavaScript so on a
similar note we have this thing in
angular and in angular basically
directives include components and the
attribute directives and finally we have
ng f and ng for as well which we'll take
a look later on so to begin with
how would you add a directive is pretty
much you just go to your view and I'm
just going to get rid of all this I'm
gonna say hello world simple as that and
if you take a look in the browser you
can see that we get simple hello world
here and what we can do is simply say
blue color google it so this is our
custom directive sort of an attribute
one so now what we need to do is
actually tell angular two things first
of all we need to tell angular that this
is not HTML directive right this is not
something like h1 and this simple like
stylers class or ID is it is our custom
directory right so angular needs to take
care of them and the second thing we
need to tell is what angular needs to do
with this directive right so you can
pretty much go ahead and create a
directive file for yourself but since we
have command line running so I guess we
should take an advantage of that so we
can say ng G directive and then we can
pretty much say blue-coloured anything
like that
and you can see that it created two
files rather updated one as well module
ideas if we take a look what what's new
in module ideas we find that in
declarations it added something as
bluella directive and you can see that
it has imported it from this file right
here so these two files are new for you
right now and the command line tool has
automatically created them so right here
you can see that we have a directive
decorator which includes a selector now
what the selector actually is is this is
the actual directive which angular would
search for in your HTML tags so this
thing needs to match whatever you are
writing here so I'm just going to copy
this blue color and paste it here so now
it makes it our custom director okay so
far so good
now what we need to do is actually
inside constructor get our element so
that we can color it blue right so how
we do that is pretty much like making
use of dependency injection like like we
used to do in angularjs like when we
used to create a controller than we used
to write a function and then when you
used to write a scope and then all other
directives all of the dependency
injections and all that stuff here so in
the same manner angular makes use of
typescript to access that tank and to
die what we can say this is our element
and this is going to be an element risk
right and this is something you need to
import from angular core so you can see
that
element is element left and you need to
do that actually you can just skip this
though you might think you can but this
is sort of provides a dependency
injection and tells angular that you are
you want an element to be passed into
this directive constructor right so for
now if we can do is simply just
console.log this element and see what we
get so inside our browser you can see
that in element R if we get this object
with this native element h1 and inside
native element you can see pretty much
that we have got the original h1 tag
only just like if we would access it
from something like console right so
this is pretty much the same tag with
all the associated properties so what we
can do is instead tag native element
here and you can see that we get again
the same thing so now finally what we
can do is we can say element dot native
element dot style dot color and say blue
other directives is and you can see that
we have two inhaler world into blue with
a custom directive and you do not need
to worry about what's going on here
because angular was just take care of
that for you so yeah that's how pretty
much you create a very basic directive
and angular and get it to work so that's
all for this one and if you like that
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
