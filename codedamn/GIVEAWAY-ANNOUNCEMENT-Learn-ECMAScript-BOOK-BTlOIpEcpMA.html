Mabel and welcome to this video in which
I just want to show you my new book
which was actually released last month
but I'm doing the promotional video this
time because I am here with a giveaway
of the book which includes one hard copy
for anyone who participates actually
wins the giveaway and nine obtained
ebooks for other people who win as well
so basically last month I released my
this book which is alone ACMA script and
basically this book is about learning
es8 features new features of es 8 now
you might be someone who is relatively
good with JavaScript or you might be
somewhat was just beginning with it so
basically this book aims to more or less
target you anyway because some concepts
are extremely good and new which are
explained in this book for example my
favorite one is about sharing our
memories and Atomics which is relatively
new and nobody really has told you a lot
about this before on the web because
this is new technology used in
javascript and should be the future of
javascript in case we get to work with
visit webassembly and stuff like that so
basically this is one of my favorites
chapter in this book share them should
air in memory and Atomics otherwise this
includes a variety of things like
working with classes and things like
proxies in JavaScript and getting
started as well if you are relatively
new so you can it does not not feel
disconnected essentially so yeah that's
basically it for
or this thing and the links for the
giveaway would be in the description so
I hope to see you participate in the
giveaway and hope to see you as a winner
of this book which I have right now
which is learning Eggman script and this
is basically learning JavaScript of 2018
