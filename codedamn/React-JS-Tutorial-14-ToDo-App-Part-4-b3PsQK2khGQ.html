welcome to your 14-3 access tutorial in
which I'm going to implement something
to let us delete the task which we have
added so for example right now what do
we have right here is that we can just
add some tasks there and that's it
there's no way to actually remove what
we have added so that's kind of obvious
to add so let's just do that
so for now what we need is that we need
some sort of button or something across
here so that you know when the user
clicks that the task gets removed right
oops right so what we essentially need
to do is that we need to update the
state after all because that's what
would they'll react to re-render the
component with the updated stuff and our
state consists of with that so that's
good so we just need to change the state
and that is it so to change the state
first of all we need to add a button to
every Ally we have right here so what we
can do is we can say this is fan class
text or we can just leave sex with
classes we don't need them not right now
so this is enniaa by the way if you want
to add a class here you cannot just make
use of class use class name right here
right so in any case if you want to add
them then which we can have as a button
right here we just simply save X and we
can say on click this start remove right
now what we need to do is create this
stuff remove so we're going to say
remove and obviously we badly need this
element which we have click so what I
want to do now there are a couple of
approaches here we can actually set an
ID on each of these Ally a unique ID and
then just look it up in the array and
then delete it
but the simplest one but not the most
efficient one would be to kind of just
look up the text user has added and just
look it up in the array and get
index and remove it right so I'm just
going to take the leave the approach
right now and do the same so we have
this touch removed right here set it up
so the value which the user has like
this element at Target and remember now
we are on button so we need to go to the
parent node then we can just find the
span and inner text so this kind of is
like we started from elemental target
here then we went to its parent node and
then we looked into span regard the text
right so yep that looks fine and then
what we're going to do is say this drops
dot remove and value okay so now we need
to pass in a props remove method from
our Manges mean the cheers because we
need to passing props from here only so
I'm going to say and remove is this dot
remove task right so now we are calling
this method in the parent right from the
child just like we did in the previous
tutorials where I explain how to pass
data from child components to parent
components so that's kind of one kind of
example here so what we need to do next
is create this remove task and obviously
we're going to get some text here and
what we can do now is we can just copy
this thing again but instead I can say
I'm going to say data to us dot index
sauce text and one now this will just
simply if your area is like 1 2 3 4 5 or
maybe we can just avoid that and 5 4 3 2
1 because that just create confusion
with index if you want to remove 4 so
updated task dot index of 4 would return
you 1 0 and 1 and then you just want to
remove one
women from that so that's thing it would
do so now we had this Justin C is
updated us okay looks good
okay last things is that we need to
create all that stuff which I told you
we need to bind these functions because
we are going to make use of this key
wording these so this don't removal just
doesn't move but buying this right again
we're going to need that in here as well
because we are going to set stayed in
there
so update task is find this and yeah
that's pretty much it looks good so
let's just see what we get in the
browser so if we add or if you try to
remove this no we get this defroster to
remove is not a function okay
this step profs don't remove is not a
function oh this should be actually for
to do up right and if I click on X you
can see that our task gets removed so we
can ask add that like ABC 23456
blah blah blah blah the last anything
you want and then you can just remove
any tasks you want and you'll be good to
go so that is all for this tutorial and
in the next tutorial I'll show you
probably how to move this thing or local
storage so that it doesn't get reset
automatically if you refresh the page
right so that's all for this one and if
you liked it then don't forget to

I'll see you that in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
