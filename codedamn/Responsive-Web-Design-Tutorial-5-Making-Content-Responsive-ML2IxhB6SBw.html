meal and welcome to your first I think
responsive web design tutorial in which
what we are going to do is move down and
see some real content right so so far we
have been just aligning some images and
text and a header and our stuff all
that's important as well but majorly you
would want to make your content
responsive and this site is sort of not
the site you would always get because
this is sort of a landing page of
something Kyle actually it's my site
only but anyhow when you will be doing
things when we will be making sites
responsive they would usually be in a
blog post blog sort of layout or maybe
completely different because every site
you know is sort of different unless
it's using a common framework like
WordPress or even WordPress has
templates as templates and all that
stuff so you know it really depends I'm
just trying to give a general idea do
you guys how you can actually you know
implement these strategies and go ahead
on any website right it's not specific
to any sort of layout so that's one
option such a weird sort of layout so
yeah right now you can see that it looks
till I hit one one three zero and things
start to mess up real close as we get to
960 and again you can see this looks
awfully bad awfully bad yeah awfully bad
um so let's just do something about it
yeah okay so what we can do what we can
do let's just take now since I am using
this nice little text short text
highlight or rather we should say as a
plugin
so I do not think I have a lot of
control because there are a lot of
things going on here right and it's not
even pure HTML it's generated by
JavaScript have not written all that
stuff right so as of now I can see two
options either we can decrease its width
decrease the font size and make it a
little bit smaller or we can make use of
CSS transform to shrink it down shrink
everything down or we can move this to a
complete new line right so I think we
should reject the new line one because
that will kind of create a lot of height
for a single language and that wouldn't
look very nice
and we can actually completely get rid
of this for the mobile devices but I
guess we are barely even hit Douglas
right now so let's just not get rid of
that this soon so what I'm going to do
is let us see we have this language and
we have this number so if I do tip top
in language C you AG make sure to spell
that right yep and then the freeze
inside it so what we can do is we can
say transform transform scale 0.5 now
that breaks things 0.89 or it may be so
it may
so small but I mess up with these two
guys right here which are the shadows X
probably and these are this is because
this is because these are before and
after stuff so if I do transform on
these guys as well
0.9 do we have and obviously we can just
get here 0.8 it was but it's a little
bit out of alignment so instead of
fixing all that stuff because there's a
lot of absolute stuff going on here
let's just get rid of the shadow part
completely and keep it to where we are
ah 1080 I guess then it looks good we
can say that and we can say
no idea why I wrote styles like that
display:none right okay so goodbye
shadows so now we have this code and
again which I think I should just
decrease a little bit of padding here so
instead of making it 270 let's just
bring it down to maybe 10 so that we can
breathe a little yeah and if I scale it
down again I think we are good yep we
can just bring down size as well a
little bit if you want this is again
around for ian's
so let me just or rather our Ian's so
for rent there we go and I can get a
similar behavior at 1080 as well so I
guess making it to 3.5 would do the work
and finally if we take a look okay so it
looks like this is not going anywhere so
let's just see what happened okay so our
styles are overridden I have no idea how
okay loading from a different file prism
dot CSS so that's why maybe there's like
sort of glitching in the order so we
just need to give it a little bit of
precedence let's just say this is div
div and we should be good to go all
right so now if we scale it down I think
we didn't change the font size yeah we
did so let's just make these buttons a
little bit smaller as well so we can
stay then as padding 4 pixel 8 pixel or
let's just rather leave them alone maybe
the Alice's keep the batting said right
so this layout looks really good for now
around 80 and 890 right so let's just
see things start breaking up and or
maybe even this is good buttons on two
lines is not a problem
yeah so let's just break everything at
720 so that's 720 what we are going to
do is get rid of this guy right here so
I'm going to say div dot language 3
display:none that's it bye bye and here
we are and do if it's not there then
what is there well our content is there
right and what the hell do I have here
what do we have here
content margin right to 0 that's it
something like that and we are good to
go again and where the heck
are we okay so it looks like there's
some sort of problem here as well so
this is language loan CSS and why the
heck is it push so bad oh I guess we'll
again get some sort of precedence issue
here right so I'm just going to say or
would we you can make a clean margin
zero margin zero let's see if you get
any reload we probably did where is it
content yeah it's not probably for like
that okay so could we get it to make it
to Dave because I kind of avoid making
use of important keyword as long as we
can just avoid it because it kind of
creates a fuzz we can just manually
overwrite this by that okay
looks cool and simple as well so yeah
looks great so if I scale it down now I
guess we do not need to do anything much
beyond this point I think it's out of
line man a little bit yeah the
containers the font size is too big I
guess so let's just drop it
to what do we have in here this content
h two to three reps font size size three
rims
and we'll be good to go
shrink it down and that's pretty much
what I am targeting for now right it's
again a little bit out of control
so we can just make it to two rims and
we'll be good to go all right so that is
how pretty much you create a very very
or actually done a very very boring
website into a responsive website and in
the next tutorial I'll be showing you or
rather and not in the next one
maybe in the next next one because in
the next tutorial we'll be fixing a
little bit of glitches finally on this
website and finally we'll be seeing how
to make this thing live so that it works
on mobile devices as well because right
now if you go and see it on a mobile it
would look pretty much the same way as
it looks like on the desktop because we
are looking a very important key element
here which I'm going to tell you in the
next or probably in the next to next
video so that is all for this one and if
you liked it then don't forget to

I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
