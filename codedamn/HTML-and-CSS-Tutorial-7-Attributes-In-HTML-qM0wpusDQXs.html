seventh HTML and CSS tutorial now in
this tutorial we'll be discussing about
tags and attributes in HTML in last
tutorial I used a couple of Doc's a
couple of attributes which are capsid
and lang
now I would like to officially explain
what attributes are in HTML now just
like we write tags now attributes are
kind of linked to your tag and supply
additional information to the browser
that what the stack does so for example
hTML is completely fine here but when we
are using Lang as a tab as an attribute
then we're supplying some additional
information about this HTML tag or
basically this HTML document that it's
language is e'en which stands for
English now here we are using the tag as
meta now this meta tag is completely
valid but when we use meta car said that
means that that we are using a character
set of utf-8
now attributes are really important in
HTML because they play a very important
role of assigning and basically kind of
using attributes in various ways using
tags and visual space to be more precise
and let's take a look at some of the
tags which use attributes as a very kind
of mandatory way in a very mandatory so
let's say if you want to create a link
to when the user clicks on a bunch of
text to redirect user from your page to
some other side so how would you do that
well we make use of a tag which stands
for anchor tag and let's see how it does
so let's type a and give it a space so
that your tag your attributes get
separated by a tag because if you don't
give a space then this would be
considered as one single tag so space
creates tag from its from its attribute
now to assign a value to an attribute
press equals to inside quotes write the
link you want
for example a tag which stands for
anchor tags is used to link to documents
among themselves
Ashraf basically refers to the link the
reference where we want to send the user
do for example whenever user clicks on
this tag he would be redirected to this
link Oh
let's close this tag and write some text
like Google now let's close this attack
now whenever the user clicks on Google
the user would be redirected to this URL
which is inside each Rev now these are
special attributes which are already
being passed by the Dom API discuss that
later so don't worry about Dom so
basically this is these are special tags
which are passed by the browser and
the your browser already knows that when
the text is enclosed in a tag and look
for each chef and on click redirect user
to this URL inside the href attribute
now
let's reload this and we've got Google
now if you hover over this then you can
see down here that the URL is google.com
which kind of appears that what would
happen they would be redirected when we
click this so once I click this I would
be redirected to Google calm or in my
case Google Lakota 10 for Indian version
so that's how tags are attributes work
all together to create a fancy and
nice-looking HTML page and in the future
tutorials we will be using these
attributes a lot a lot so just memorize
what our attributes are tags in HTML
because we're gonna need them a lot so
hope you liked the tutorial and don't
