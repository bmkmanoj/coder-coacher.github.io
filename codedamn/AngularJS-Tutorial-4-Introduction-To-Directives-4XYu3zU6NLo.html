fourth angularjs tutorial and which
we'll be discussing are in a brief upon
what our directives in angularjs now in
the last few tutorials a used ng model
and ng bind which are two examples of
what we call directives now one thing I
need to tell you is that you have got
the documentation of angularjs at this
URL which is angular Doc's angularjs.org
slash guide slash basically just the
guide one and this would give you access
to the documentation of angularjs and
trust me guys make this documentation
your friend if you want to learn
angularjs because there are many things
which I may even get skipped by our
mistake but this documentation is very
well-written for big nurse as well as as
professionals but this documentation has
got some difficult terms which I'll make
easy for you so directives according to
this
documentation of angular shares it says
are the high-level directives are
markers on the Dom element that the
language a is compiler to attach a
specific behavior to the Dom element or
even transform the Dom element and it's
children so in simple language what does
directives mean is directives are pretty
much like some sort of sticky
attachments to any of your elements and
you could actually make use of
directives somewhere else in your code
itself so from this example if I copy
these two right here and paste it now I
have a Dodge I have binded in named
directive to this div and what would
happen is whenever I type something in
this since this ng bind sees me to bind
whatever I attached as name therefore
all the texts which are type inside this
text area will automatically pop up
under this one similarly instead of this
what I can do is to call this name is to
use two curly braces and this would work
simply same so let's go a little bit
down in the documentation and it says
matching directives before we can write
a directive we could we need to know
about all that and in the following
example Gloria says that input element
matches ng-model directive so ng model
is a directive ng bind was a directive
which I used in the code and there are
many more
and normalization is just explaining
whatever angularjs tools in the HTML so
this is a nice little example which is
using ng bind as a directive and assist
normalization strips the your binder the
directive and data one which is used for
validating your html5 convert your
colons dashes or de limiters to camel
kiss and by the Hat what it means is
that if I do like ng by name then ng
bind data ng bind and
engi underscore bind and G column bind
and X and G bar technically means same
so whatever you use there's no
difference but if you are using it on a
production side then I'll recommend you
to go with data and G bind because first
of all it makes much sense and the next
thing is that data makes this angular
directive a valid html5 attribute so in
the documentation if we look down a
little bit then we have got directive
types which are special directive types
which we would be discussing in future
tutorials and we have got other
directives some of which includes ng
attribute bindings then we have got
um
these controllers which would be
discussing later on because this
documentation links every aspect with
each other thing so just follow my
advice and make this that our
documentation your best friend if you
really want to learn angular and that's
it for this tutorial for the directives
one and we'll be taking it really slow
and easy so that you understand
everything so I'll see you then in the
next tutorial until then stay tuned and
