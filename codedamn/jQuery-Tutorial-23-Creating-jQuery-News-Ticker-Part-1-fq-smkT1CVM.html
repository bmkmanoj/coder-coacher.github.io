jQuery tutorial in which we'll be
learning to create a kind of new sticker
effect in jQuery so have you ever seen a
kind of new sticker with which
automatically takes here and there based
on your click on the next and previous
buttons so you could actually make it
like a chord maker where you have codes
store in an array and you can just those
codes could automatically pop up once
the user clicks next next next buttons
and you'd pretty much understand what
I'm saying when we will finally build
this so let's create it a let's get
started with this bad boy so to create
that first of all we need to create some
sentences to work with and let's say my
new sticker and let's give it each new
sticker and I'm just creating a rotting
this is my sand dance one I'm not
standing it very much
I leave it that to you but I just want
to show you that how simple it is
we'll check ready to do such things so
let's say we have seven new stickers and
the first one being the active one let's
say out of this I create the ID next
next
and a righty previous
previous or rather this should be
spelled so that it appears in a lie
so let's check this out in a browser and
here it is so that's how it works let's
just grab it a couple of breaks so that
separated
and we are good to go
what about this
two pipes
and obviously the formatting will never
end so let's just make it right here so
in the script section let's start with
our scripts okay so yeah so let me
explain this line which is on my fingers
and this line right here technically
means the same line as document not
ready function so these two lines are
one and the same thing so document
already function is same as this line
this line is just a shorthand of this
whole bunch of text with which we can
use for replacement of this line so you
may want to use this line because it's a
cleaner version of this line and saves
you a couple of milliseconds so anyways
let's get started with the script
section and first of all what I would
like to do is
I would like to have a event attached to
these two buttons that whenever they are
clicked something should happen with
scrap the idea of each of them and since
they are created on the document we need
not to use the own one we could just
directly go with click and make sure
spell it right inside a function
let's do something now first of all what
you need to do is let's get this active
one into our jQuery and what we can do
is let's say variable active div is not
this one but just simply they've got
active so now active div is simply this
thing and why aren't not just using it
like this I'll tell you right now so
currently all the seven sentences are
visible to us but we would like to have
only one sentence with a bulb to us at a
time because that's what you sticker
does to do that let's hide it with CSS
News Ticker
now let's say a display man and I hope
you are good with CSS so I won't be
explaining much of the stuff I'm doing
right here to you you could check out my
CSS tutorials to learn the CSS 1 but
coming back to the tutorial now we have
only the active sentence as visible one
and we have got the reference of the
active div inside this variable as well
so the next thing we want to do is
remove active class from this div and
make the next one active and if suppose
we are on this div then jump from this
dev to the very first if let's program
this a bit so
first of all we would like to active
Dave dodge remove glass active and right
here we I'm using a new method I guess I
didn't explain you that in my previous
tutorial so you would seeing a bunch of
this in my this tutorial because there
are so many methods in jQuery I cannot
explain you every method individually so
you would learn all these with the
passage of time so removeclass will
actually accept the argument without any
dot or hash or basically just a dot
because it is a removed class method and
it would remove the class if present
from the element and it would not show
you an error if the class is not present
so that's really much handy if you did
not need to check whether the class is
present or not with the H statement so
remove class technically removes active
class from this div which is currently
active and now I would like to through
the control to
next div and what I will do is dot next
dot add class active now what's
happening here is
the next method would actually select
the very next element which has this
active class or which is basically
stored in this active live and now this
is the main reason and using this
variable as a reference for instance if
I just used our basically I'm sorry this
should be just active div because we are
already using the dollar sign the
constructor function right here so for
instance let's say if I just use this
right here
as this now this basically means Dave
active dot removeclass tape so reactive
and now it became like this thing and in
the next line jQuery has no idea what is
Dave not active because in the previous
line it already removed div dot active
class from every div in the Dom tree
currently only one so that is why I am
using this reference active div to work
with because even if I remove the class
from this active live the reference
remains to that particular element only
unless I change its value to something
else so now active div now we have moved
this class from this div they stay right
here but technically active dev is still
referring to this day only so now with
active live dot next next is a method
which would select the very next sibling
of this active or basically this
reference right here and we are just
adding a class of active to it
now it pretty much seems good right now
but we've got a problem
a small problem and whoa what's that so
small problem and what's that let me
show you now
let's reload this and we've got a nice
pretty sentence
let's click next next next next next and
next and next now you see that it does
not go back to the one because when it
is on this stiff then on the next one it
does not find anything and it just
simply removes the active class and this
line fails to execute so what we don't
do is we would like to check if the next
of this div actually exists or not
so we'll do if active dev dot next dot
length
is equal to zero and I'll explain you
what I what I did this then active dev
dot next dot act nope
we want this in L statement and if the
length is zero that means if there's no
element then we would like the div
dot new sticker which is the first div
remember EQ we used it right here and I
would like to add it class of active to
it so we are back on one and this thing
right here one thing you should know
that whenever you perform any Dom
manipulation with jQuery you would
always get a array of result as the
response from the check wary so when we
do like adaptive dot removeclass
then jQuery is not returning us a
boolean value here jQuery would return
is a array value here and we are not
storing it in any variable because we
need not to work with anything jQuery is
returning but right here when we are
using addictive dot next then jQuery
would return me a one single element
lamp of array and if the array is empty
that means the length is zero and if the
length is zero that means there is no
next element to this activity and if
there is no next element then what we
can do is I will just use the first new
sticker this one and I would add the
class active to it again and otherwise
continue with our own previous tasks
let's reload this and we've got a
sentence one two three four five six
seven one two three and finally you have
created your own infinite type of new
sticker
so that's how we create oh I guess I
didn't created functionality for the
previous one and previous one is pretty
much same just like the next one let's
go to the score a bunch let's replace it
with the hue and handler for previous
and for the previous one instead of next
I would like to have the proof
now this brief work similar to next just
it would select the previous element
instead of the next element and
similarly we are checking active Dave
prief dot length is zero then do this
otherwise you are good but right here we
would need not zero but the last element
so how can we do that let's see so
if you have ever been into Python then
in baton this is completely irrelevant
dude right now but I'm just discussing
with you that in Python when you create
arrays or technically call as lists in
patternless
a B and C then let's say this is some
containing a variable than a zero refers
to a a one refers to be an AC refers to
C but in Python we have a as negative
indexing as well and a negative one
refers to the last element negative two
second last negative three third last
and so on and similarly the same
functionality we have in the EQ method
and when we passed negative one to EQ
then it means that go back even to the
last last element you have of new
stickers so negative one technically
means the last element since zero means
the first negative one would technically
means the last element the negative two
would second last negative three four
five six seven and this is pretty much
handy when we are working with dynamic
you say the dynamic new sticker where
you don't know the length of the number
of new stickers you have in your widget
so now we are good to go let's reload
this
three
and these crews are all the tray around
on my balcony give me a sec okay yeah
got rid of that
so let's reload this and two three four
five and let's go back works simple now
let's check this out
next one worked like a charm and so the
previous one so congratulations you just
built your first new sticker with the
simple simple goal of jQuery so that's
how you work will check where you while
you're creating widgets and that's how
simple jQuery can make your work if you
see that all this this code is kind of
very simple to understand and it's human
readable so I hope you enjoyed your new
sticker and if I am in a good mood then
in the next tutorial we'll be working
more on this new sticker and making it a
kind of fancy one so I'll see you then
