gordon calm and in this tutorial would
be looking at something called functions
in PHP now functions in PHP are pretty
much a way of writing a code block and
then calling it multiple times with ease
so let's say for some reason you want to
have an operation which performs which
is performed on four or five numbers
let's say you want the result as a
number plus another number minus another
number multiplied by another number and
I should possibly put brackets so that
it's clear the operations are going in
order and divide the whole expression by
another number so you want to do that
repeatedly with different kinds of
numbers okay so let's say this is 12
this is 3 this is 67 now this is 3 only
this is 13 so you want to do that
repeatedly I don't know why but you want
to so one way is to do that again and
again and again until you die and the
another way is to create a function out
of it and then call it multiple times
with different values so wouldn't it be
nice if I create a functional and call
it like echo awesome awesome math and
then supply few numbers which would be
operated here and then echo or some mass
again so instead of doing this a lot of
times I guess this one looks a lot
cleaner so let's learn how to create a
function to create a function first of
all type the word function now function
would this would require you to add a
name to that particular function which
you are calling let's say I create hello
world function a simple one then after
writing that you need to write
do brackets in front of that then a
curly braces which indicates a block of
good which is under this function and
then all of your goal here so let's see
if I simply write echo hello world how
are you are why you so down here to call
this function i will just write hello
work so what it does is whenever i will
call this i would write this line hello
world with two brackets and a semicolon
what would happen is everything inside
this code block would automatically run
here as if this all was present inside
here instead of this here so if I write
it three times or four times and see the
result on browser so you see I got hello
world how are you hello world how are
you hello world how are you like that so
that's how you create a function and in
the next tutorial we'd be looking at how
you can supply an argument to the
function and make it really dynamic one
so that's it for this tutorial and don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
