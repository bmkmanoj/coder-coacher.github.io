Mei hole and welcome to this screencast
in which we're going to create an
application with ionic 3 and firebase
and ionic makes use of angular force so
that would be perfect
so what this application would be about
is that we can just create an interface
where people can come to send their
username and kind of get engaged in the
conversation with other people so I'm
just keeping it anonymous you can add an
authentication to it as well if you like
and for the database purpose for the
real-time chat application we're going
to make use of firebase now if you are
someone who is not familiar with
firebase well what firebase is actually
for our case right now it just provides
us a no sequel database which is
blazingly fast and synchronizes across
all the connected devices and almost
real-time I have used it in my
applications and works pretty well
plus it's built on the top of Google's
infrastructure so it has to be fast
right so what you have to do if you if
this is your first time just go to
firebase comm and you should be
presented with the screen something like
this just click on add the new project
and write your project name and you
should be able to create a project and
once you do that you should be presented
with the screen something like this so
for now I have chosen my project name as
ionic charge starter you could choose
any one any name you like once you're
done with that what I want you to do is
set up I on ik if you haven't done
already and if you want to know how to
set up ionic then I have a link in the
description please watch that video
where I would explain our hat I have
explained how to set up I on ik on Mac
or Windows depending upon your platform
so you should be up and running with
that in no time
ok enough of talking let's get back to
coding now or actually sauce time so I'm
on my desktop and I'm going to create a
new project by saying ionic Star
I'm going to say this is our chart so
we're going to go with the black
interface for now I'll let it just build
okay so it might take a little while so
we can by that time we can just take a
look at what we have inside our firebase
so right now you can see that it
provides us with a database it also
provides us with authentication I'm
going to keep the chat as a public sort
of thing right now that means that
anyone can come choose their username
and start chatting but you might want to
add an authentication if you want to and
I do have a tutorial on that as well I
guess in my playlist for ionic 3
tutorials so you might want to give it a
shot then we have the database which we
would be using actually in our
application and what this database
actually is is just an object stored on
the Google's infrastructure now what's
special about this object is that you
can obviously nest it down to as much as
you want so you can create an object for
this value we can have something like
chats and for the name sorry for the
values we can pass in an array which
might contain some sort of values and by
default if you set a blank array or a
null value then it automatically removes
that key so that is why I didn't show up
so we can try one more time we can write
something like this and hit enter you
can see that we get our charts created
where the key of zero something appears
now this database kind of doesn't like
arrays so any array you write here would
actually be converted as an object only
and if you do not specify the key then
it would be a random key which we take a
look
we're going to not link it to the ionic
dashboard right now finally let's just
open CD char and open it in sublime text
so there we are
so inside our source folder index dot
HTML is the file which loads the first
time and what we are mostly in stress
interested in right now is this app
component so this would fire off
whenever our page loads and this app
component actually loads the root page
which is actually our home page so we go
to pages home and the home dot HTML so
if we make it fullscreen and start the
server as well for the application so we
can say ionic serve it would create a
local development server for us and the
weekend by the time create some like
chatting application something like that
I'm going to say right here somewhere
inside a P tag enter your user name and
then we can create an ion input right
here it just binds with the username so
that we can just access it later on in
our code so if we save this and actually
just open this an ionic lab that kind of
gives a nice little interface to it so
we can switch down to iPhone I kind of
like that it's interface looks much
cleaner right so you can see that we
have got our input in place and what we
can do is actually right here we're
going to see inside components we can go
to input and it's quite convenient
inside this ionic lab as well if you
want to search for any component and
your dad is not open so you don't have
to kind of go to Google every time right
so you can see that we have got a bunch
of input labels right here and all of
these makes use of this ion list
get this little border underneath it
well you can do it yourself as well with
CSS but I'm just going to go with the
ion list only right now and I'm going to
go with the floating one that kind of
looks cool
where is it floating right there you can
see now we can create something like
this we can just paste it right here and
say just username that's right type text
and we're going to bind that with the ng
model and we're going to say this is
something like using all right how we're
going to get rid of this completely we
are going to open home Diaz and right
here what I'm going to do is actually
create a username type string set to
default right now and we're going to
create a button as well so we can just
get out of that and we can say button
and let me just adjust my seat here I on
button and this would be the or actually
rather the login button because we are
not expecting user to sign up for us
right so we save both of these files and
we take a look inside our lab you can
see that we have got a nice little
interface but we can make this block
button with just the outline so that we
can take a look now you can see that we
can enter our username we can just fit
login right now we can obviously get rid
of this be Doug doesn't make a lot of
sense all right so we have got this in
place and we can actually get rid of
this ion list as well if you want to and
it should work just fine just like that
okay
so we have got that in place now what I
want to do is on clicking
you're going to say login user so what
this would do is that it would create a
session or not really a session but will
just create an interface which would
kind of create kind of contain the name
of the user so that we can actually push
messages on the server and let user
reply as well so we're going to
implement login user I'm going to say
that we already do have the name inside
our entry model so we're going to
implement some little checks so what I'm
going to do is actually build a regular
expression right here only so if we have
something like I don't know a to Z a to
Z and 0 to 9 or we can just say that our
user name should start with that and
should have one or more characters and
just end with that as well so let's just
test some and this is true this is false
false fine
this one looks good so all this is just
a simple check on the username which the
user is typing dot test username
District username rather so all cool
otherwise this dot alert or si error and
this would be the message would be kind
of like invalid username so now we can
just create this alert pop-up as well by
going into components and you can see
inside a lot we will have a nice little
interface for creating a little alert so
we can just create a basic alert only
that would kind of do our job so we
cache
Scottie this whole thing right here
back inside are cool we can say
something like this and if not really
there's some sort of problem with the
spaces I don't know what says so anyways
let's just not take a look at that it's
kind of annoying but because there are
just two spaces but I don't know why
ionic starts project with two spaces but
anyways so I'm going to go with the
title and a message and we can just
label them as well if you wish not
really necessary then we finally need to
get the alert controller so we are at
load controller and hook it up inside
our dependencies so I'm going to say
this is a load controller we can just
make it private as well not accessing it
anywhere else all right so we can now
say that this says title now we can
actually just get title or yeah and
message right there alright and this
should be a lot okay so we have got our
basic implementation of login in place
so we want to go ahead right now and
sign in the user what we're going to do
is actually just push enough control dot
push we're going to push a page so we're
going to push our chat page with some
data and the data would be username is
this dot username just like that so that
would be as simple as that and we're
going to create a new project or a new
page real soon let's say an I generate
page chat and that should pretty much
create our new page now for the most
part what we can do is actually first of
all register it inside our app module so
we can register it like chat page
we can just duplicate this line and not
really do we have any pages yep chat
page we're going to just go chat chat
right there and finally we're going to
enter it as entry component as well so
that we can just access it inside our
ionic applications so finally we're
going to import chat page from I don't
know what this is chat chat right yeah
so that is it and now we should be able
to see our new page so we can go to chat
es and right here we can just simply say
console dot log this dot nap trams that
should be it and yes so for now let's
take a look and we are getting some sort
of problems here inside our home right
so we have a missing comma right there
and that should fix that and okay so we
have our Fe enter around user name
something like that we get another
problem this dot a lot is not a function
well not a strange person try to sync
this again one more time we've got a
title and message in place and this
should probably work
ah
all right I do not know oh okay I guess
we do have some sort of conflicts here
so we can create an alert box right here
and let's just make sure that we are
doing everything else correctly and that
should be it
I don't think there's any other sort of
problem with the code so login okay we
still are getting this dot alert is not
a function and I'm not sure why the
title string the message is string as
well let's just try to rename this
function to something like show alert
well I don't I'm not sure but that
should have worked
right and okay so let's just give it
another shot
and we are still getting this dot alert
is not a function what the heck okay so
there's something else going on here we
have the scripts running properly
because the code is not reflecting right
changes to home dot TS file so my bet is
that there's some problem with the code
not really okay so it saves me that it
has got an ionic --brush decorator but
does not have a corresponding blah blah
blah so we can just pretty much get rid
of this because we would have actually
got rid of that apparently if you were
deploying this on an real Android device
right because this error actually comes
at that time as well
when you're actually building your
application so to fix that you just have
to remove this ionic page component
right here and remove the module dot ES
file from here as well within your page
so once you're done with this we should
be able to see our changes reflected now
all right so let's just go back reload
this thing and we should be able to now
see our alert effect so now if you write
a wild one hit login you can see that we
get our nail after ends with a data with
a username okay so now it's time to
actually I'll actually let me just keep
it right here so now it's time to
actually log in the user and actually
let's just first create some interface
for the user so what I'm going to do is
make use of I on footer so what this
iron footer is is actually it provides
you a nice little interface which kind
of just sticks to the bottom of the page
every time and it is kind of useful on
actual devices because when you pop over
the keyboard when the keyboard is
visible then you want that input to
actually stick to your keyboard only and
that kind of makes sense and I on footer
makes it work as well so I'm going to
say iron input type text and again we're
going to wrap it inside ngmodel and we
are going to see something like let's
say chat or let us a message and finally
right here inside iron content only
actually we should just place it outside
iron content so that we can actually
play something like dividing chat
messages right here
okay so now what we need to do is
actually set up from firebase for our
application to work with and for that
I'm going to go back to our application
go to overview add firebase to your web
app and let's copy this thing or rather
this whole thing and just go to my app
module and just paste it right here now
you could have created a separate file
for that as well but I don't care so I'm
just going to paste it right here and
now what we need to do is actually go
ahead and do something like angularfire
- now what this is is actually it's an
official wrapper for angular from the
firebase team so the documentation is
quite good for angular fire - on the
github page itself and it would kind of
get you started so if you go to dogs we
go to installation and setup you would
see that we need to actually install
first of all where's it I love fire
- and firebase just like here so we're
going to copy that line and we're going
to hop over to the terminal second
window we're going to do the same thing
and I will just install angularfire
- and firebase in our application after
that what we want is just input this
angular 5 module and finally what we
want to do is actually send this as
inputs as well so this would actually
make us use the angular fire inside our
application I'm not really ugly far but
just the firebase and this should
actually go inside the inputs right
there we go so we are ready and now what
we want to do is actually import the
database module as well because we're
going to make use of database
and we we are going to send this thing
right here inside our modules right not
the artwork but the database one so
where we have right here inside our
declarations and there we go and not
really declarations but inside our
inputs just like the dark side so we
have set it up our angularfire and now
what we want to do is again just copy
this thing inside our chart ES and we
have got access to our angularfire
database and you can just remove that if
you want it's just to check for
typescript so what we want to do now is
actually in check the dependency so
we're going to say public DB angular
database and now what we can do is
pretty much just access our database
with this dot DV now this gives us this
list and objecting we would be
interested mostly inside a list so what
we're going to do is create a chart and
then what we are going to do is push the
new message so we're going to say the
username is this dot username and the
message is this dot message and actually
to set the username first we're going to
say this but username is this dot nap
around store data dot get or actually
just open up from start get and then
we're going to say username just like
that and we could just define the
username as strength and the message as
string as well all right so now if you
take a look you can see that we are
binding to message so that is not a
problem and now if you go back to our
application right there and take a look
what we have built so far
if I had log in you can see that we get
a chat area and we are getting a
permission denied again because our
database is not actually configured to
work without authentication so to fix
that what we can do is go to our rules
and for the read purpose we're going to
switch this to true and for the right
purpose we're going to switch this to
true as well that kind of makes it open
to all connections but would get our job
done for now okay so now what we're
going to do is again try out our
application but this time let's just
create a button as well so that we can
actually click that and let user sense
so we're going to say button unbuttoned
icon only and we can actually just get
this button as well from the ionic bonus
only icons right there and let's just
take a look inside the phone icon set
and I'm just going to search for some
send icon so yes that should be good for
us and we can just paste it right there
so this would create a nice little send
icon which we would customize later on
with some CSS I know it looks bad in
position right now but it's okay so if I
hit Send
now what happened is that I'd be back
end you can see that our chat is created
and as I told you that actually we are
trying to do a push so what bush
essentially means is that this is kind
of your acting you're making this thing
act as an array so you're pushing to
that array and what you're pushing is
the particular object
so what firebase does is that it
randomly assigns any ID to this thing
and you do not need to worry a lot about
this so this is just a random ID with
the message of blank and the username of
a std DD whatever that was so let's just
take a look
what we have in here and if you take a
look where we are the char dot html'
ng-model message and for this bar if you
can just close this homepage and I'm not
sure one two three four five its send
are okay so just a second oh okay so we
are actually stupid me we are actually
making use of this inside our ion
viewdidload so what we want to do is we
want to make use of this inside
something known as send button send
message rather kind of makes more sense
and now we're going to say this well
that was kind of stupid so we're going
to say that when I click this button
send message there we are
okay so now if we take a look at our
application we login with me whole MPT
hit login I write a message hit send
take a look in the database we have got
a database updated with the message of
whatever this is I'm username of my
identity fair enough now what I want to
do first of all is actually get this
message right here displayed because
that kind of would make a lot of sense
ban so this would send us a promise so
if we can do is then called end on it
and then do whatever you want to do when
the message is successfully sent so
message is sent and you can also catch
something if something happens in
between some error maybe firebase is
unreachable something like that okay so
now what we wanted to do next is
actually show those messages so to show
those messages what we want is actually
we want to subscribe to this thing right
and what a subscription means and
actually this is all rxjs stuff so I
cannot go a lot into detail into that
right now because that's another whole
another topic but pretty much more or
less what the subscription would do is
that it would kind of create a way for
your application to actually monitor
this thing right here so if there's any
change
firebase would actually emit an event
which would be catched by the
subscription by the observer we are
making right here so in other words it's
kind of just linking this chat thing
right here in real time with your chat
application so to do that what we're
going to say is this dot DB dot left our
object and this would be again chat dot
subscribe now this would be fired
whenever there's a change to the data so
we're going to see data and first of all
let's take a look at that what this data
actually is right and we can actually
just store this subscription
subscription subscription I can't spell
subscription I don't know this is name
it s why not so we can just create s as
the firebase list observable I don't
know let's just leave that okay fine now
what we're going to do is yep take a
look at that inside our application and
let's just wait for it to build we're
going to say something like me whole MVT
again and hit login now I'm going to add
some chat and hit Send you can see that
we got console.log here with all those
values of the chart which we had right
in the database and whenever we do
something like that you can see that we
get the response in real time
okay so what we can do is we can say
data map we can say element and then
finally we have access to all of these
elements with message and user name
field so what we can do is right here
inside our chat messages what we can say
is diff class message and we can say
that this is ng for let message of
messages and the we can pretty much just
say the diff class username is the
message dot user name and the class
message right there not mess is the
message dot message all right so yeah
looks great and now what we can do is
actually just create another object or
rather we can just assign it directly to
messages as well it's up to you so we
can just create another object right
here messages of type string array
rather object array right we can say
this dot message messages rather dot
push element all right so we can just
initialize it with us empty so that we
do not get any sort of errors okay so
now if we take a look and we write
something hit login and we see that data
that map is not a function and that is
because on the first one or let's just
take a look first of all what we have in
here and
actually got an object right okay so
what we want is a list instead not an
object because the list would return us
an array of elements and an object as
the name says returns us the object hit
login right so you can see that we got
all our bunch of stuff ready right here
so we can actually just remove this
again and all this is happening in real
time so you could see that we are
actually not replacing that stuff so
that's kind of makes it a little
annoying so right now you can see that
for the object part we are kind of
getting a nice little object so yeah
what we can do is instead of just
mapping it like that we can just say
this dot messages is equal to data let's
just see what happens so we have got our
application let's login no message let's
send some message you can see that we
get message the fader again just like
that all right pretty cool but we want
to actually make this a little bit more
appealing so we can style this a little
bit you can say that this message is
display:inline-block kind of like that
but yes that then create a little bit of
problem for you so what we can do is we
can create this glass inner message
something like that and now inside our
chat dot a CSS file what we can say is
the this inner message is the
display:inline-block padding:0 10px uns
I'm just doing it randomly background
it's color colors
I guess primary would be a good one for
now and I guess that's exactly the name
for this thing we can just take a look
here and yeah that's pretty much it for
now we can just give it a margin of five
pixels as well so now if we take a look
this Login a how we got our messages
already right there
we can send a new message as well and it
just appears here we can say color is
white and water radius is the three
pixels or something like that okay looks
nice now we can just highlight this
username a little bit as well so we can
say this username is a font weight -
maybe we can destroy it by their
username font weight is bold font size
is 80% I'm just going to decrease it a
little we're going to save same for the
message and a safe font size is 120
percent increase it a little okay so yes
that's pretty much it for our
application so we can just style this as
well a little bit if you want to we can
just move that whole thing in one single
line but for that what we can do is a
creative flex sort of thing might be a
good choice I'm not sure exactly so
let's just try that out so divide if
footer content and we can again create a
container right here div dot element
which just covers both of these they've
dot element again covers this icon this
button as well like that and now let's
just try to create a flex system so that
we can just make that in one line and it
looks nice and easy as well on the ice
so we have got our photo right here
somewhere
where is it divided right inside I on
footer toolbar okay so we have our photo
right here and I am NOT able to see our
code right there
if the HTML reflected I'm not sure okay
let's just try it again and take a look
inside our inspect element we can see
that our footer is indeed reflected
right so for the photo one where we can
say is the display flags display flex
right there
flex direction row and for the footer
first child well that's not the best way
to select but anyways you can say flex
grow as well right now we can say dot
element button border-radius
0 margin:0 and yeah that's it
so that should be it for the footer we
can just intend it a little get rid of
these and finally what we can do is
actually get rid of that margin as well
which we have right here so or we can
say for this
ion toolbar ion to go right so ion
toolbar margin:0 padding:0 and that
should have caught us okay we can just
hit an important on that and that should
be it for the project at least and again
I see a little bit of margin at the
bottom not sure why that's actually
because the input height is actually
greater than the button height so we can
say is for the footer align items
stretch and that should actually make
the width of the element hundred purse
the height of the eleven hundred percent
but not the button yep so for the button
what we can say is the height 100% and
that's not really good work
okay so a little ugly hack would be cut
off to actually do something like
element position:relative and then for
element button position:absolute I know
there would be another way to do the
same thing but I'm just a little bit
lazy for now with 100% and height is
100% as well and that should make it
full width and full height and obviously
I want this element to have a minimum
width of 100 pixels and let's just make
it 250 and again we have a little bit of
problem or the heck
we have a little problem
I'm not sure ah man that's killing me
this input thing is killing me now where
is the goddamn padding I'm somewhere ok
anyways we're going to leave that for
now and take a look at that later on so
right now you can see that our input
text is not clearing so if we can do is
right here we can say something like
this dot message is equal to blank and
our my own text actually appears on the
left right so I wanted to appear on the
right
so what we can do is again go to char
dot HTML and we can say something like
class and we can actually bind this so
we can say message dot username equals
this dot username or we do not need
actually this right here username is
true then I want message left as the
class name or if it is false then
message right ok so now if you login we
can see our messages right here but for
message diff class we get undefined
message dot username is equal to
username all right this should have
gained some value well that's I guess
some problem with ionic hot reloading
sometimes messes up by not actually
replacing all the contents but anyways
so we can just login take a look at
messages right here we can see that now
again we get undefined okay okay I get
it I get it
well that's stupid this should be
actually instead quotes because angular
otherwise is expecting these to be
variables anyway so for the message left
part what we're going to do is say float
left and for the message right but we're
going to say float right just like that
and now if you log in we get all this
crap and we can just fix that probably
by actually moving this thing inside
here and from the message itself we can
say after content blank display block
and clear both okay so now login we get
our messages and holy crap where's our
background okay
alright guys quick fix quick fix time
message in our message and in our
message just like that and that should
probably fix our background as well okay
so now we again see our message on the
left because it's not from us and we are
actually as DF SDF so if we go back
again
SDF SDF hit login a well message left it
is or actually this should be message
right well that is kind of wire avoid
making videos at night message left holy
crap
okay so now if you log in what the hell
our message is still on left okay and
that is because okay SDF st here okay
so right now our messages are on the
right so if I send it you can see our
message appears on the right and not on
the left so let's just try with some
other guy which is online so we're going
to open another tab and paste it right
here again and we're gonna say Meho NPT
now get login and we can see we got some
messages either what's up guys hit Send
we can see we got our message right here
nothing buddy just shouldn't add three o
clock and the night
it's send yoke and now we can get
another user online as well with some
other sort of browser so localhost 8:1
double zero and some other cool dude
fork and login ei hey right there okay
so yeah kind of works but the u.s.
looking and I know that and we
have got a little bit of problem with
the styling of this button as well I hit
this margin right here we have so I'm
just going to fix that now we have a
couple of things left and that is first
of all it doesn't inform us actually
when the person is leaving the room or
joining the room so that's kind of
critical to do the next thing is that it
would kind of stay right here whenever
new messages come so it is kind of not
user friendly right then the third thing
is that this background this button is
kind of messed up so we're going to take
a look at that as well
and finally we can just change the color
of this message just a little bit as
well we can do that straight away I
guess because we are assigning the color
to the message right or to the inner
message yep so for the message right
where we can say message right
background color colors and secondary so
you can take a look that we have changed
our colors and we will get all of our
messages screen now so yeah that's
pretty much it for the screencast
because now I'm feeling sleepy so I'm
just gonna fix this button and all these
other things I mentioned in the next
tutorial and we're going to add the
support for joining and leaving the
on the chat window as well so yeah
