tutorial and in this tutorial we'll be
discussing about this keyword and
basically this jquery object in jquery
so if you have watched my javascript
tutorials i hope you have because you
have to have a very strong i'm not
actually strong but actually a good
knowledge in javascript when you're
working with Chikara so coming back in
the tutorial if you have watched my
javascript tutorials then you should
know about this keyword this basically
refers to the owner of the object we are
calling in it so basically if we call
this down here then this would refer to
this document got ready function so
basically this refers to the owner of
the object and since there is no check
down here than this refers to this
function if we call this in the global
scope then this is equal to window so
let's see what this does and how
it works so for example let's create a
ul list let's say a line item 1 let's
copy and paste this who has whole day to
write that so here we go 2 3 4 5 6 9
here we go now here's the browser let's
refresh this let's go close this we
don't need the console right now in the
script or chairs let's create an event
handler which says Li dot click function
let's just keep it clean let's just say
color this it's very function about this
color this unless this dot CSS
background
parents
so let's refresh this now and let's
click on each of them so now what's
happening here is if we do just a lie
then what would happen is this would
select all the Alliance on the document
so it would color them all the Allies it
would color all the Alliance the jQuery
at once but when we are using this then
this refers to the owner of this
function and basically the owner is
right now is this event even is fired on
li element so when you refresh this then
when we click on this then this refers
to the particular Ally on which the
event is fired so this is how the
keyword works in jQuery and basically
the difference between this this and
this is that we are using the jQuery the
parentheses to
has a construct function of jQuery to
call this call basically this keyword so
this this of jQuery and this of
Sharpsburg literally means the same but
when we do this not CSS and the
JavaScript interpreter does not know
that we are working with jQuery and not
the traditional JavaScript so it would
look in the prototype chain for a CSS
property which obviously does not exist
so basically to work with jQuery event
methods we use the jQuery constructor
function which is the dollar sign the
parentheses so that's how it's different
from the chicory one so that's was about
the event handler or basically for this
keyword how to use even handlers with
this keyword in jQuery and
and if you want to be more precise so
let's see what's the technical
difference between this jQuery and this
in JavaScript so in our console let's
time this and press Enter
now here we get an object reference as
window if you see this is the object
window but when we type this key word
which means Java scripts this then we
get a kind of different kind of layout
than this one so what's happening here
is since this refers to only one entity
at a time
therefore the traditional Java Script
considers it as just a one entity but
jQuery works on the basis of model of
objects so everything in jQuery is kind
of a collection of objects or basically
a kind of Eric so this actually refers
to an array which contains only one
object obviously which is the current
reference of window so to basically this
is equal to this and it returns true and
I have used the zero index because since
jQuery considers this as a collection of
objects already in an array so this
would return technically same returns
results like this so as you can see now
these two matches but these two don't
because right now this is going to see
that as an object or collection of
object but this is a single entity and
by using the index of zero which refers
to the 0th position
this array we get the same results so
let's try to do this equal to this and
as you can see we get false results
because right now this is considered as
a connection of objects which is an
array and this is a single entity so and
we use triple is equal to ten data
conversion is not done this does not
refer to this but when we do like
referring to the zero index then it
refers to the same key what we are using
in this but we usually don't use the
zero index to call this in jQuery
because by default jQuery considers this
as this bracket zero only so if we refer
there's equal to this then also it will
not return us true because this is still
an object or kind of a single entry but
this
I guess spell up right there and right
now we also don't get because as I told
you this is refers to a array of objects
which is which contains only one at the
position zero but this is a single
entity so this was about a tutorial on a
desk keyword and a couple of minutes the
last couple of minutes were very
technical about this keyword explaining
you the difference between this and this
so let me know if you have any
confusions about this keyword this right
here I'll see you then
so stay tuned and don't forget to
