mijo and first of all happy new year to
all of you may you go to all the things
you have ever wanted to go this year
right so I've been out of touch off
going down for quite some time I know
because I'm just running on a very busy
schedule these days but what i have done
actually among these quite a few months
that i created i actually tried to learn
myself libgdx and I got familiarized
with it by you know making small
obligations and then I tried to make a
sort of a game called kids fight right
so this is not a kind of programmatic
video where I would just teach you some
things I'm just going to show you my
latest application this gets fired which
I'll actually made and libgdx oh it's
cross-platform but for now I've just
made it available for Android so this
game actually is other set built over
libgdx and I offer these three modes
which is against Android or I guess it
should be two player instead but ok
double last looks good as well so play
double player which means on the same
device and play on bluetooth which means
you can just sort of do a multiplayer
right then we got some settings and all
that stuff and I've got this three
levels like potato you were on God so
you might just guess what these are so
what you can essentially do is just
switch it over to God right and just
change it to three weapons just play
against hand roid you might have could
select this name here in the previous
screen I just forgot to do that right so
this is a game this is all about that so
I just made use of some fancy graphics
actually I purchase these two kids from
graphicriver right so you know I'm not
that good with the graphics and all so I
want you guys to try this game out
and I have left all the links in the
description for the Play Store and
please let me know if you find any bugs
or you know anything which i can add you
know which might give a very appealing
look to the existing application it's
not like you know like if you want to
suggest any thing which might make it
more you know interesting and you know
you get the idea right so I'm looking
for your feedback right so please please
go ahead and install the game I have
links in the description and do let me
know what you think about it so that is
all for this one and maybe I would make
a series on libgdx but that's something
for another day so that's all for this
one and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then with a next
series in the next day or you know in
some other day so that's all for this
one and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
