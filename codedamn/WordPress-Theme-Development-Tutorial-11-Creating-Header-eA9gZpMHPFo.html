and welcome to your 11th WordPress team
development tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm just gonna create out of
this red header from CSS and HTML start
off so you could probably skip this
tutorial if you're not interested in
designing web page and just to WordPress
stuff but anyways I'm gonna cover this
so that you guys don't miss up on
anything well let's get started with
this so for now we have just added our
team and yeah so we need to customize
this a little bit so what I want to do
is that pretty much inside here inside
Styles let's just add my team name it's
extra stuff so team name is is honor
team and I guess I have a typo right
there isn't it so let's just correct
that on our team and we would actually
need to do a couple of things again so
this would be my team's and steam is
broken obviously so just activate the
honor team and we have got rid of that
actually ok so cool now again in honor
team I'm gonna open for three functions
head around index so where were we
yeah inside the Styles so in side Styles
we have team name as on our team team
URI as go down calm let's say alter male
then author you arrived pretty much you
could add anything like Facebook / LMPD
then for description you could say that
most awesome team ever
then nobody up next I guess it's
reversion so you can add a version let's
just say this is version 1.0 and then
there's some sort of license stuff I
don't really remember that
you would just hook up to WordPress site
and check it out out and let me know as
well so we load this and as you can see
if I click on this this is most awesome
team member by me hold and Worsham and
all that stuff so pretty cool till now
now what I want to do is it said style I
want to say margin:0 padding:0 and what
that would do in our page actually okay
wait a minute I guess we haven't even
equipped with the style sheet actually
so go to your header dot PHP first and
say link and actually no not like that
let's do with the NQ function so I'm
gonna say WP function team scripts
and you again qu e pretty nice brackets
right there so I'm gonna say WP n Q and
that's not what I want so I'm gonna
write this just style then handle SRC
that's pretty helpful just to say this
is Styles official or let's just say
main styles then for SRC I'm gonna say
this is get stylesheet start sheet you
are I actually what does she do all
right okay no that's no where no media
so let's just get rid of that and yeah
so let's check that out again
okay so we need to actually hook that up
as well so again add action they're
gonna say WP e and qu e qu EU e scripts
and then your name of the function which
is in my case team scripts and Q so
pretty sweet reload you can see the
styles are now successfully loading as
well as being applied in the team
actually so now we can do our stuff now
for header purpose we need to span it
100% across the screen which it is right
now so no problem there for n 60 what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna say this is with
960 pixels margin is sudo Auto and yeah
so that's pretty much it we're gonna
need for n 61 and right here here we go
then for logo what we need is let me
just check out what this font is
Roboto light okay so we need Roboto
light so this is Roboto light just go to
google fonts open and google fonts and
let's change this to light for now copy
this thing and actually you could even
make this thing dynamic by making user
select that what sort of font user wants
for the logo and all that stuff but that
would be kind of difficult for me to
explain right now because we haven't
covered a lot in WordPress so far so
that's sort of something for another day
okay so let me just close this and for
now what I want is for logo I want font
family as Roberto reload I'd pretty much
we get something like that only so if I
just go ahead check that out it has a
font of 40 pain points and
formed sighs let's just say I give it a
30 pixels instead so if I reload you
could see it's 30 pixels wide and for
the navigation I could just say that
this is my new primary menu container or
instead what you can do is just wrap
this inside another div top navigation
and there we go I'm pretty much just
take a look now you'd see that we have
got this in top navigation just add a
new style say to float:right and see the
logo to float:left and we'd be good to
go just copy these both things inside
your styles and make sure you just
append that to your pre-existing style
and what you need now is that another
class not clear to just say that clear
after content is this display:block and
clear both so now what we are doing is
just adding clear class so that it just
clears the floats so now you can see
that the header is full width and for
the stop navigation what we can do is
that for top navigation you will ally I
can say this is float:left lets style
none margined
10 pixels let me just see how this was
okay so text transform uppercase and
that's pretty much it for the Li words
and again at the style here and for you
will Ally for you a lolly you're gonna
need to add a class style because for
dot menu actually you could say the
similar thing which we did for the clear
one so here we go
just after and you could just use single
or double columns for that so we are
pretty much done with this and the next
thing I want impart some sort of color
to this navigation and it's giving me
answers and inches I don't know maybe we
could just change this preference or
yeah right there so let's just change
this to pixels yeah so that's good now
let's measure this so it's saying me
approximately it's 70 pixels height and
what this color is is that this header
is this color right there so we could
have consistency among the PSD and
actual website so here we go and the
wait a minute oh this should be
background actually not the color so
here we go and then we have everything
else and white and you could actually
just specify that here reload and for
allies I could say that top navigation
a lie a scholar inherit and
text-decoration:none and yeah that's
pretty much it and for I could actually
just say display:block to this one as
well so I'm gonna say padding five
pixels zero let's just leave it to five
pixels Holly so here we go
and for logo one what we can do is that
we could say padding five pixels - zero
- this one actually as well so for logo
one we have this thing right here and
only thing that differs is some sort of
font so you're gonna take care of the
phone actually cancel okay
so this is Roboto regular okay so not a
problem I guess we do have robot a
regular here normal I guess so we just
need to make a couple of changes in our
header now I could say that this is for
logo this would be font weight that's
300 let me see if I'm right there yeah
and for the top navigation what I can
say is font family is Roberto sans serif
and the font weight would be 400 so
reload are pretty sweet so sky looks
like this but the font size is either
too small for this one or too big for
this one so let's just make this a
little smaller font size 10 pixels and I
guess 13 pixels is pretty cool so top
navigation Li eh
here we go and the last thing I need to
do is say border bottom 2 pixel solid
and wait a minute okay so the reason why
I did this is because what I'm gonna do
wait I'm gonna say that when somebody
hovers over this I want to change the
border color to white and if I don't add
this style right here then it would kind
of jump when I hover over so that's kind
of looks cool doesn't it so for the PSD
one I guess we are pretty much done we
are just left with the
icons which we can do later on so that's
it with our header for our WordPress
team and pretty much you could customize
it within your WP admin dashboard with
the help of menus and you could pretty
much say anything like howdy as well and
it would sort of reflect in your page so
that's cool let's just change this to
pages only and that brings to an end for
