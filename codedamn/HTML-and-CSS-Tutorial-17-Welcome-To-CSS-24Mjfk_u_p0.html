17th HTML and CSS tutorial in which
we'll be discussing about and basically
not anything to be discussed but I will
give you a brief introduction and would
welcome you to your CSS tutorials now
from this tutorial we will be using
powerful combination of your html5 and
css3 commands and properties to create
awesome beautiful HTML pages now before
starting this tutorial I would like to
clear the confusion I caused with last
tutorial with input type tail and I told
you that it accepts only telephone
numbers and I do accept only telephone
numbers but actually that works when
you're on mobile devices so let's say I
reload this page and there you go now
suppose if I'm walking on the viol then
when I click on this then my input the
touch keyboard will automatically pop up
now we have a touch keyboard down here
in windows as well and as you can see if
you can see this keyboard then when I
click on this this gets automatically
converted into a numpad so that I can
type a number
so basically that's all input type tell
works it's basically for mobile users
and not for your desktop users so I just
close that so that again not jQuery but
HTML and CSS with 17 tutorial and here
we go now so to introduce you to CSS
would be a kind of difficult but let's
take it this way now we have been
working with these raw HTML elements all
these backgrounds the white background
the white input type background this
grayish type background this color all
this is by default so basically CSS
gives you the power customize each and
everything's styled in its own way on
your document and in CSS we have a lot
of things to learn so
I would recommend you not to skip any of
the tutorials if you are not good in CSS
because every tutorial at me it would be
very useful and would contain very
useful information for you to work with
CSS in the future so I'm just
introducing you to CSS is for now is
that CSS pretty much you could customize
anything right here for example if you
create a paragraph in the world you
reload this so for example I want the
font size of this to be very large color
to be red background to be black it
should be how it should have a text
shadow it should have a box shadow and
let's say it should have a transparency
or what we technically call it opacity
of 50% so how would you do that
we have CSS for that for web development
purposes so CSS actually allows you to
work with your HTML elements and
customize them and make them beautiful
for our users to display so
let's take an example of a site without
CSS and I'll show you that let's see
let's open and
incognito tab and let's visit
facebook.com/ and why not
the mobile version of Facebook since I'm
browsing a small version so it would not
be visible so everything I'm doing here
you need not to learn right now but
let's see how Facebook would look like
without having any CSS so that's how
mobile facebook would look like if we
remove all the CSS from the speech so
currently it looks so beautiful for
mobile devices
if I remove CSS then that's how your
Facebook and vine looks like so now you
can actually understand the difference
between two and the power of CSS the
logos are inserted with CSS this
alignment with
all these fonts everything is done with
CSS so now you know that CSS is really
powerful you have to use it carefully
and it's very elegant once you
understand the basics there should be no
difficulty and grabbing your own CSS
basically grabbing a command on your CSS
properties and using them fluently
just like your mother tongue so this was
a brief introduction about CSS and why
do we need it from next tutorial onwards
we would be taking some hands-on with
HTML and CSS both that would be creating
some powerful and sweet awesome webpages
so stay tuned and don't forget to
