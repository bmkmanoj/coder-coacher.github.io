twelfth angularjs tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be learning something
about routes in angularjs now routes are
pretty much a way to handle different
URL contexts in your website so let's
say you have a website with sample com
I'm just assuming this
and
and let's say you want to set up
angularjs framework on your site and you
have something like let's say ebooks and
basically this should be an angular
something like this so whenever let's
say a user bookmarks this page and
visits this page instead of showing the
traditional homepage about your website
the user is immediately shown the
section of the books where all the books
categories and all that stuff is present
so with angularjs routing we are
basically customizing different URLs
what is displayed at which URL now many
of you who have done the server-side
scripting with PHP and Apache
they know that URL routing is possible
with HDA access as well but angularjs
allows you to route your urls on the
client-side
with very easy and simple steps so let's
begin with our first rounding and I have
separated
the JavaScript code with a controller GS
file right here so we'll be coding all
of our angular stuff in the controller
dodgiest
okay so let me create an ng view first
and let me close this all right so this
container would be all of our routes all
of our content which would be displayed
dynamically so the controller section go
to your controller section
and
we need to give our app a name let's say
this is min app let's say procreate area
book app is equal to angular Montiel
main app and here since we are using
another module in our angular we need a
dependency in our angular module this
mail app and what this would be is the
ng route so ng type here ng route and
since we need to download something some
JavaScript file to work with this n0 out
let me Google it quickly and download it
for you you can simply download ng route
by googling angularjs ng route dot JS
file so give me a quick code alright so
now you can see a new file here or
angular route minified Oh Cheers and if
you look at this this is nothing but a
simple bunch of code which is just a
module extension to
our main angular app so now let's
quickly configure our app and we'll use
the config method on our app and inside
we are supplying a anonymous function
and what this app that config is
basically doing it is country doing our
app to work with certain things which
we'll be providing and right here in the
parenthesis we have to pass the argument
as route provider and similarly we could
we could have done this as well route
provider which we did in the past last
tutorial and do something like this but
as long as you are not compressing a
Java Script this would work fine so now
simply write route provider and there's
when now this when you could write it
anywhere here or here it's your wish now
when is got a special thing
so right here inside you first got a
argument you can say you'll write what
happens when you are or when a user R is
at this path so let's say if I say when
is at you know just at the home page
then I want the template should be
user simple as that
let's say when the user is at you say
another page I want
this should be inside it
then I want them plate should be welcome
user again and otherwise now this
otherwise what this would do is it would
map all the other pages all everything
which we haven't included inside the
wine here so this technically refers to
all the pages except these two all the
locations so good also supply a template
here but I'll just simply do redirect to
and this would simply redirect the users
to this page so this is kind of a closed
loop so if the user is here this
template is displayed the user is here
this one is displayed and otherwise the
user is redirected to the home page
so let's view it in the browser let's
reload this and we see welcome user
because right here in the ng view it's
on the main page and why not just open
the console for some stylish debugging
well just to
this thing so right now we are at the
home directory
and remember that angular needs hash to
prevent the page from loading let's
change this hash so let's say I am now
at the another page make sure you spell
it right
oh and OD yep i'll mr. edge all right so
now you see that the template image it
changes to welcome user again and right
here in the hash as well this thing
changes let's say if i was it's some
blah blah page which is not registered
in our configuration then you see that
we are automatically redirected to the
forward slash with is our homepage so
that was a quick introduction to routing
in angularjs and my couple of more
tutorials would be on walking so stay
tuned till then and don't forget to
subscribe and we'll be discussing more
on this so thank you for watching and
i'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
