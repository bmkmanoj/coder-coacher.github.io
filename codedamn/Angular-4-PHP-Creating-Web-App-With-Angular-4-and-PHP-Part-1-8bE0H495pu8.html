Mei hole and welcome to your way first
tutorials for this brand new web series
which would be a kind of a mini series
where we'll be creating an application
with angular 4 and PHP which would allow
users to upload images so I have been
asked to actually develop an application
with angular 4 and PHP not really PHP
but some back-end technology but I'm
just going to the PHP right now because
it's kind of easy to get started with
and we'll be creating this simple
application which I have come up with
and will be allowing the end users to
come and upload the images they want and
we'll be showing some edited images to
them like some effects images and
grayscale version maybe or some other
effects using an external library so
yeah that's pretty much it what this
simple application would do and then
we'll be able to understand about things
like the HTTP module and angular 4 and
all other things as well as we go along
with the series so yeah that's all for
the application that's how it will work
and we can just pretty much make use of
bootstrap 3 well though I know that
bootstrap 4 is coming real soon but it's
still in our stuff so I'm just going to
go with bootstrap 3 to add some basic
styling I'm not going to go a lot into
styling because that's not the primary
focus for this series but still we can
just make it a little appealing with
bootstrap ready to use classes so yeah
that's all for this one and I'll see you
then real quick in the next tutorial
will we get our hands dirty with some
angular for PHP and a real application
so see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
