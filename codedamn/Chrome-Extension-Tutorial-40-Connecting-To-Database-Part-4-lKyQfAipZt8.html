Google Chrome extension development
tutorial I'm a whole and the story will
be continuing with our application which
we have been developing from I guess 2d
toriel's and in this tutorial we have to
connect this PHP script to the database
to transfer or basically to store the
information we have okay so let's get
started now to create a connection we
need a variable let's just say that
variable is bridge is MySQL I connect
for arguments the first one being thus
our second one is root third was my
password I'm just kidding it's not and
the fourth one is the database name and
it is oh no
it is IDs okay so now let's just check
first of all if bridge is there or not
died and I'm gonna really die and just
echo walk in here if it's working
reload hey okay so it says working and
what was the addition here okay so that
was my clients evil ID you got that
anyways now since we have that working
connection let's just get rid of that
code and this one as well now let's
write a query and that is insert into
now what I have to insert is into this
information so insert into information
and what I have to insert into is
structure being named because remember
that id is automatically populated and
email and values are if I remember
remember this query correctly then it is
written just like this this is named
this is evil let me check
okay now might better put that in single
quotes I guess yep
I forgot a major thing we needed to do
first and that is first of all secure
these things because right here you
could
the attacker can eventually create an
SQL attack to your application so just
pass the things into HTML entities and
that should probably fix the problem I
guess or we also have function mysqli
real escaping yes no or it was with
MySQL yes it was with MySQL real escape
so you might give that one a try as well
let's try this one and okay alright so
now let's test this out so that's really
what the extension let's write the name
let's ride the email address and
obviously I would oh poor me
I forgot the query to send
now I want a bitch to query this is
query then just echo out view looks good
okay so since we are walking with
back-end no need to reload let's just
fresco and hope for the best
okay so we got a view now let's take a
look at the database alright so we got
our first email address with the name as
mijo an email as me whole MPD let's try
another one working good whew and as you
can see we are pushing the stuff into
database now we need to consider a
couple of more things to take into
account like you can see that email
address is not filtered out like this
good is also accepted but this is no
email address and a couple of more
things I might you know just tell you so
that's all for this tutorial and the
next tutorial will be just looking at a
brief what we did and this one the evil
one so that's all for this tutorial I'll
see you the next time don't forget to
