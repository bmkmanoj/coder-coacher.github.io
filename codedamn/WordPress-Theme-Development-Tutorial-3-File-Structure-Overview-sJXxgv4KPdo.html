third WordPress team development
tutorial my name is May Hole and in this
tutorial we're gonna take a look at how
files are laid down in a wordpress
website so that you can actually
familiarize yourself with how things are
laid down in WordPress so if you look at
the file system as you remember that we
installed WordPress and this WP folder
so this w before who contains these few
files and these three folders so this
htaccess is a file which runs every time
request is made to your server and this
file is pretty much responsible for what
you pretty much call it as pretty URLs
so if you look right here inside your
settings and permalinks you can see that
pretty much what press allows you to
have different sort of URLs for a same
sort of post so for example like you can
have this simple plain URL with a query
parameter or with customize date and
time month and display and all that
stuff so all of this stuff can be
managed by making use of this htaccess
file and what was pretty much I guess
does that as well
so this is that file then indexed of PHP
contains some crucial code for your
index page like it contains code whether
to what to do with the posts loading how
to style them how to place them which
tags should contain the post title and
all that stuff then license stuff txt is
just a license for the GPL license for
WordPress so you might want to read this
out if you wish to well I don't then
there's a readme not HTML there's all of
this stuff I don't think we need this as
well then this is WP activate we don't
need this file actually but let it be so
this is WP blog header
then all of these file name our
self-explanatory the comments post the
configuration this file is important
because it holds the configuration of
your database interaction so anything
you know if you mess up with this file
you would probably end up with something
like this so never ever mess with this
file and even if you are then make sure
you just back up this file before even
starting messing with this so then this
is WP cron cron jobs so that you can
just delay posting or something like
that you know what press offers that
sort of thing then this is some other
file WP links and pretty much so not
that much important then WP load then WP
login is the login page which you see
then this might be the mail file which
would be used to mail people or your
users about their user details like
login information if you have
registrations open then WP sign up would
be a registration page crack back would
be a crack back script for like if
somebody comments with your URL you will
get a track back then this is xml-rpc
I don't know this is all sort of SEO
stuff sort of thing so you might want to
take a look at that well for our
WordPress theme development purposes
mostly these three folders are important
so WP admin as discussed would not be
very much useful for us because it
contains only content for the
administration purposes so you don't
actually need it unless you your theme
is looking for modification in
administrator areas well then WP content
contains currently two folders which is
the plugin one and the themes one so the
plugin one would be used in the tutorial
series in which I'm gonna teach you
about how to program plug-ins for
WordPress but since this one is for
teens so
this is kind of more important for us so
this team's folder you can see that we
have got three folders and this index
dot PHP is nothing but a simple redirect
not even redirect because they're
written silence is golden because if you
don't have this index dot PHP then if
somebody just goes to see
zamp or your website you're in in case
localhost WP wp-content themes then
there would be a directory transversal
which would just reveal how many teams
you have right now and all that stuff so
just adding a simple black index dot PHP
file pretty much does that job that the
directory listing is not revealed so
these three folders pretty much if you
just go to the steams you can see that
these are the team three teams right
here you can see and they are the
exactly same names
so one thing we get from here is that
you have to actually paste in your team
URL or sorry you have to actually paste
whatever team you're creating right here
to make it appear here so in WordPress
you can see this is add new team but it
doesn't allow you to add your own team
you can just upload it so what we can do
is actually just create a new folder in
here and let's just say this or let's
just say my first team and hit enter
reload pretty much nothing appears
because you can see that here
it's the error says broken teams the
falling teams are installed but
incomplete it says that stylesheet is
missing so what you can do is go to your
style dot CSS just create this blank
file reload you can see that we get some
sort of under another error that
template is missing stand-alone themes
need to have an indexed or template PHP
file so
this would be index.php we load again
and you can see that we get a sort of
blank theme in between and this pretty
much means that we don't have any
thumbnail for our team or any sort of
description neither the name a custom
name we do have a name but this is just
taking from the folder one so we need to
walk up on this team and if I activate
this team and go to my website nothing
appears because my index dot PHP file is
actually MD so what press doesn't know
what to do on home page so that's where
programming part comes in and that's
where we program WordPress themes so
whatever we are gonna do for next
tutorials some tutorials would be inside
this folder so this folder would allow
us to code WordPress themes and pretty
much make some awesome teams as well
obviously better than these so if you
like this video tutorial then don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
then in the next one with some real
programming starting off so till then
don't forget to subscribe thank you for
