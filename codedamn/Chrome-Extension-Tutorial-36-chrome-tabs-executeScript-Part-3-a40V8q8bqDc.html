welcome to your 36th Google Chrome
extension development tutorial and in
this tutorial what we'll be learning is
about sending variables to your
executing script know by that what I
mean is let's say you have a useful
variable you grabbed inside your
background script anything you want you
can get only from background script
let's say you want to get a URL of your
local file from here and you want to
pass it inside the script you are gonna
execute so how would you do that well
one way is to use make use of messaging
but if you don't want to make use of
messaging then what you can do is you
can actually make this code run before
your script runs so that that variable
is accessible here let's say you want to
pass the string 1 2 3 4 5 and let's say
you want alert here
the same variable which you're using
here well that won't work because the
script execution environment of script
dodgiest and background on cheese are
completely different but they're a
simple hack you can see to overcome this
and what is that is you could actually
run a script before this so you can do
like good who are information equals
information on a semicolon and once the
school is executed then as a callback
code you want to run this one so if you
see what i'm doing here is first of all
i'm executing this code who are
information which is information which
we just create the same thing right here
which i have and you can better and
close that in codes if you want if you
have a string because of numbers it
would it would work fine but with string
it would create problem so our
information information would give us
this and then what we can do is we can
execute this code right here once this
code execution is complete so here i am
just doing alert information so let's
try it out once so here's my browser
let's reload the page and let's click on
the icon so you see the page are at
HTTPS google.com and c is 1 2 3 4 5 it's
not the background script that's
alerting it's the Google which is being
alerted by this script so that's a
useful way to make use of Chrome the
tabs that execute script and that's it
for this tutorial and don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
