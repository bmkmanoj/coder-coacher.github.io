your 42nd JavaScript tutorial in which
we'll be looking at some special
characters in regular expressions so
let's get started and from the last
tutorial I hope you remember that we
talked about match and how it worked I
will use that in this tutorial as well
so let's get started and create a random
string consisting of some numbers and
some letters and you can bang your head
on the keyboard if you want to do that
so I have done mine and we have got this
random bunch of string which is
completely illogical but we need this
for our examples so let's get started
now let's create some regular
expressions
so let's take a look at the dot regular
expression so this dot right here
technically means everything except a
that should be except actually I just
said except that looks kind of weird so
it should be except exe B D so this dot
would accept right now except everything
except the new line that what is the new
line like your this one
this dot would match a string only till
this let's see how this work and we have
this regular expression now let's get a
result let's say my string dot match
have we got a regular expression inside
the arguments so here we go let's alert
this nice reading at the browser oh okay
oh so we can't have actually multi lines
in JavaScript and we need to use some
other things like the exterior for that
so I'll show you this exception later on
but for now let's reload this and we get
s now why is that why did it give us
only a letter when we had a bunch of
characters in the string now regular
expressions are made to work that when I
will define their first occurrence they
would automatically stop so how do we
fix that we used make use of the
modifier which is G and on the stuff you
have to remember because there's no
actually some technical reason behind
this we are just using a single letter
words single letter how could they be
words but who cares so we are just using
single letters to donate some special
meanings do some special things
now this G would be placed outside the
expression itself so that it doesn't
become the part of expression itself and
what it means is that
continue your search for the whole
string even if you have match the
occurrence once or more times so now
let's move to console and let's reload
this and now we get it has this ugly
form and to make things Tina let's do
something like this console dot lock
type officer first of all let's see what
the heck is result is actually and now
let's just console.log the result
now let's reload this okay so here we
have an array of return elements the
type as object and remember that type of
type of array is also or basically the
shifted so type of array is also an
object so remember that this is
returning an array and this is
considered as an object in JavaScript so
we have the all the basically characters
in this
straying separated by a gamma or not in
a comma but separated as separate
elements in the array so let's look at
some more special characters in this
regular expression so the next thing we
have is the D special character and what
it will do is it will match a digit
basically it will just match a digit so
let's see what it happens now remember
that we are using Chi and if I remove
this then it would match only the first
garea digit and it would quit so it
would give us only nine
so let's reload this and we get nine
this is something different
I'll explain that later because ok so
let me explain it right now so basically
by using result dot index you could
actually get the index property as well
of that so the index of nine is nine one
two three four five six seven eight whoa
zero one two three four five six seven
so the index of nine is nine interesting
so now let's revert it to default let's
reload this we have got input as well
but who cares for this we just want the
occurrence to be returned itself so now
we have D as the regular expression and
now let's race
place the G modifier so now we it will
search for the whole string for the
match of digits now let's reload this
and we have got a sweet bunch of digits
only from this garbage right here so if
you take out digits all the digits then
you'll get them in this area and that
makes your work pretty sweet convenient
and easy to do because using traditional
form methods and checking against every
character for a digit would be a kind of
very you can say
cumbersome tasks so that's how we use
regular expression for matching the
digits let's get to some
other special characters let me see what
I've got in my mind let's see on the
capital digit which is the D and what
does that mean is it would match
everything which is not a digit
basically so let's reload this or making
you understand so this is kind of a
inverse of this D because whatever this
D would match right here this capital D
would simply ignore that and with match
the rest of the stuff
so that should be pretty simple to
remember and yet again we are using this
chi modifier to make it work all the way
down to the end of the string and not
just the first occurrence so the next
thing we have is the W the W quantifier
which were actually okay so I'll explain
it this way that this w would actually
match any letter from A to Z a to Zed
being it a small one or a to Z being at
the capital one and all the numbers as
well so basically this is kind of
checking for a string if it is
alphanumeric or not so let's change our
string a little bit now it's time to
change it so let's say I write a little
JavaScript very much and I would to
estimate remarks at the end and now
let's use W right here let's reload this
and we get I love JavaScript very much
and if you notice that we need a got the
species inside the Aries and North these
two exclamation marks this is because
this match is only characters from A to
Z no matter they are small or
capitalized it was said
zero tonight so it matches alphanumeric
and space and your estimate remarks are
not alphanumeric so if you include some
quotation marks as well then these won't
be included in this array so that's how
you work with the W one let's move on to
the next one and we have the capital W
and by now you have already guessed that
what it does just like the capital D it
is the inverse of this small W and what
it would do is it would match everything
except the alphanumeric characters
so let's reload the browser and now what
you see is we got a space we got a space
we got a space we were space and two
quotation mark oh sorry
do astrometry max so we have got four
space one two three four and to Islamic
remarks so this kind of returns non
alphanumeric characters to us so I hope
you are able to catch up with me let's
move on to the next one
and so we have the D the D quantifier
which would match a tab obviously so
let's see if I give it a tab right here
so we have got a tab right here let's
say this I let's reload this how that
matches a tab so it's up to you how you
work with this and let's look at some
more party first there okay so now let's
take a look at some bad boys now let's
get into some sets or ranges so let's
remove this backslash and let's say I
want to match every character let's
remove this tab every character having
the range of letters from a to Zed and
being small so make sure of the syntax
right here let's reload this and we get
the area of this letter and if you see
then all these letters are small and
belong to the range A to Z now let's
wrap an arrow up down arrange a bit and
let's make it to a to D and let's reload
this I've got a a C and C so it should
be right here
this is a
a C and C so that's how you work with
these ranges this would basically
specify the initial position the ending
position and both are inclusive if you
have ever done like sets in maths then
you know that this little square bracket
means that both of the elements are
inclusive and it pretty much works the
same in the regular expressions of
JavaScript as well because after all it
would it was developed by a
mathematician so let's move on to some
next and let's see what we have got the
next we have got is a kind of negative
character set and what does that mean is
that anything which does not matches
these and to do that what we do is we
make use of I don't know the symbol
above 6 gear key on a keyboard which
creates a kind of this top arrow I don't
know where it is on your keyboard but
for mine it's on the 6 key above 6p so
press shift and your six key and you'll
get the symbol and now it would match
every character except in the range of A
to D so let's reload this haven't got
everything except the a to D so that's
how you create a negative set of
characters and now let's move on to some
other characters other special
characters which I would like to discuss
with you
okay so let's say if I want to search
our accept this input only when this
word the last word are basically this
string ends with the letter of let's say
Zed so what I'll do is I'll type Z and a
dollar sign so what does that mean is
right now that okay so I want said in
this range and I want it at the end this
dollar sign signifies that said should
be the last character of the string
so now let's reload this and as you can
see it returns a stun because there is
not and this Islamic remark is the last
one so let's place a said unless we love
this oh my god said as they return so
now let's take a look at some
interesting example now let's say I want
it to end in an alphanumeric way so what
I'll do is type W and
aw like this the dollar sign so what
does that mean is that it should be
alpha numeric and it should end with the
alpha numeric so now we are basically
combining two regular expression options
operations and let's reload this and we
get edge because edge is an alphanumeric
but if I place this what you say
I always forget its name the Islamic
remarks I reload this then I get null so
that's how I am combining two different
operations together to achieve some
quite amazing results and let's see some
more quick operations and special
characters we could use in the regular
expressions okay so the next thing I
would to discuss with you guys is the or
operator and the are quantifier
basically what it will do is it will
match either of the words you specify so
for example in our above sentence we
have love and JavaScript stewards so
this regular expression would say either
match love in the Sundance or JavaScript
and this would work even if one is not
available but not if the both are not
available so let's reload this have you
get bored as an array so if we move
or basically just type anything which is
not available in here and let's reload
this page so we learn all colligate love
so we kind of create an option for the
regular expression engine to choose
either of the two or if both are present
then go ahead with both of those so this
is our operator in your regular
expressions and I guess I'm pretty much
remember only DS right now for you to
explain but in future in future videos
maybe the next one we would be using a
lot of these regular expressions and
with the time passage I would be able to
recall more of these expressions and how
to use them and I would teach you them
teach you all the stuff as well in my
future tutorials so whoa it's already
sixteen thirty minutes so I'll see you
then in the next tutorial and don't
forget to subscribe and let me know in
the comment section
what's your views on this tutorial so
I'll see you there good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
