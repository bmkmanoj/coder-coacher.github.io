are welcome to your 12-egg my script
tutorial in which I'm gonna show you
what is lexical this so what it does is
basically that in JavaScript what
happens sometimes is that if you have
ever programmed a sort of complex
application then you'll see that every
function brings its own this context
well this creates a lot of confusion and
problem when you have a lot of functions
inside a function inside a function so
you don't know how to reach to the
parent property of a function and you
kind of just end up messed up so what
the fat arrow notation does to this is
that it creates a lexical this so it
passes a lexical scope of this into the
function which we create so let me just
show you that real quick with a simple
example so let's just say you are
creating Mario forever in JavaScript
well to do that let's just say we write
our first function as function start
game and let's just say we have this dot
lives equals zero and this dot add lives
is a function and this is a function and
let's just say this dot what it does
this one up one up is set timeout
function I just want to say this dot
lives plus plus console.log this dot
life's plus plus actually and I want
this after the game has been launched
for a second so what I'm doing trying to
do here is that I would be adding a life
to Mario
once the game is started and this would
be a one up and I could just change this
to set interval as well to add a bunch
of lives so what I'm gonna do
var Mario is new start game and Mario
dot lives so yeah so that's pretty much
it for this one but there's a problem if
I reload this game into the browser you
can see we get console logged as not a
number well obviously something's not
right here
and something is actually goofy going on
here well if you take a look then we
have one function two functions down
here so what the heck is this this
referring to well this this is referring
to its own function so it doesn't find
any lifes property so that is why it is
just a undefined value and we are just
incrementing it so it just throws in an
odd number all right so the traditional
JavaScript fix would be to do something
like that
so what that is this and then change
this to that and if I reload this again
you can see that it works but this core
still looks a bit ugly so to make this
in a fat arrow notation what we can do
simply is that first of all get rid of
this line just change it to this again
get rid of this function keyword write a
fat arrow right there get rid of the
function keyword write a fat arrow right
there and yeah you're pretty much done
so how does it look like in the browser
now let's reload this and yeah you can
see that it works perfectly fine without
even adding that kind of thing in here
so what is happening here well when you
made use of the function which is the
traditional ACMA script five thing you
were creating a different this scope for
each and every function but with the fat
arrow notation what happens is that
Alexa call this this past as a scope so
this now refers
- Alexa kill this which is passed by
dysfunction of the lexical dis which was
passed by dysfunction this the lexical
dis of this function is this so if you
are gana
confused for in this tutorial then I
would recommend you watching this
tutorial one more time because this
would make a lot of sense once you
understand this because this is very
simple and yeah so that's how you pretty
much do it so you can even change this
to set interval now as a hack to add
unlimited lives to Mario
so enjoy your game and if you like this
