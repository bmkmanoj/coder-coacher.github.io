hole and welcome to your eighth ACMA
scripts 6 tutorial in which I'll be
showing you what the structuring is now
this destructuring is a new feature in
my script 6 and it basically just allows
you to assign values in a very fancy way
so but Dad what I mean is that let's
just say you have this arrow right here
you can either use varlet I'll just go
to our for now let's just say we have
best sites in the world and then we have
code down on the number 1 why not then
we have Google Yahoo Facebook Twitter
link there and so on and so forth let's
just say example so we have this list
now let's say I want to get the first 3
values from this array and store it in
the variables first second and third now
a traditional JavaScript approach would
be to do something like this
so I'll write first is best insights
world 0 then we write second best
insights one third so that is kind of
boring tasks to do well it's eventually
over but what it brings an EMC script
six is that it makes this thing
intrusting so I can take out the three
values in a single hit with this so
check this out
war first second third is best insights
in the world that's it so what happened
there well if you see carefully what I
have done is that I've created this
array assignee the first second third
and I've equated this to another re well
what it does is that
it would extract the first one the
second one and the third one and now you
can just alert out the first variable
load the second variable and allured the
third variable this should probably work
like a charm so the first one says go
down second one is Google third one is
Yahoo and that's it
so code on Google Yahoo here you go in
the same order now if you want to
extract like first second fourth then
what you can do is just put a comma here
fourth simple as that and how awesome is
that actually so goddamn Google Facebook
no one defines no errors no nothing to
quote about so what else you can do with
this is that you can actually just throw
in or basically just make use of the I
actually don't want to make use of the
term right now because I have another
tutorial for that but what you can make
use of right now is just these three
dots so what these three dots does is
that they would combine everything else
everything else you have in the array
into a separate array so what the spread
operator would eventually do oh I
actually just told you what this is so
this is a spread operator well you'll be
getting another tutorial for this so I'm
not gonna explain this very well in this
one but what it does is it would just
spit out this re and pretty much just
take a look yourself because I can't
explain that you know the thing you will
understand by seeing I can't explain
that by just explaining well all right
so let's just say rest here and rest and
if I reload this page you can see that I
get first one has code down second one
has Google and then all of those like
that
so this right here what it did is it
just threw in an array of everything
else now remember that you have to make
use of these three dots because it's not
like just you're writing some infinite
number of dogs or if you still work so
this is not an English class actually so
it it has to work with three dots so
make sure you write three dots only and
what else you can do with this
destructuring is that you can kind of
get multiple values back from a function
easily now let's say you have a function
which just does everything possible to
two numbers a and B are the numbers a
let's just say this function returns a
plus B a minus B a times B if divided by
B a modulus B and what else we do we
have a raised to the power B then is
there anything else we have yes we can
have a boolean as well here or a equals
to B sweet what else can we do well that
is pretty much for this one and then
what I can do is I can say for addition
subtraction multiplication division
modulus mod then power equator and all
that equals simple as that now how cool
is that and how efficient is that in
terms of readability and memory so that
is a lot readable and instead of just
like doing what result is this thing
than just digging up the whole area to
search all of things so if I just
console.log add or subtract or whatever
you like yellow as you can see we get
the result and again you can just throw
in like whatever just console or
whatever thing and you'll get this error
right there
so the structuring would also work with
objects so you can have something like
our food is let's just say burgers make
burgers and coffee Starbucks and then
what you can have is that war my food
and basically just this is an object so
you can have my food or basically you
should have burgers as my burger and
then we have coffee as my coffee and
throw it in to this food so now if i
console.log burgers reload this okay
sorry
this should be my burger actually
because burgers is the property which
from which we are extracting the data so
if I reload this you can see that we get
back burgers as output now if you just
omit this then you should probably guess
by now what would happen now the
properties or the variable names would
be the property names themselves so if
you just do it like this now as you can
see it works just like before like that
so that was a bit about destructuring
and es6
yes that's pretty much it for this
tutorial and if you liked it and don't
