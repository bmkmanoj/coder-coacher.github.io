hole and welcome to another episode 6
tutorial in which you're going to
discuss about what a stale call
optimization which is a new thing with
the JavaScript it exists in some
languages not all but with es6 it is
actually coming to JavaScript as well
so what tail call optimization is is
pretty much like if you are calling a
function and then returning another
function from that function and pretty
much that is the only thing that you are
returning then javascript can optimize
that code so that it does not take its
own stack space so it sounds horrible I
know but you would just be able to
visualize it with something like this
stack diagram so let's say this is a
function which is function one and I'm
not really familiar with the drawing
tools here so let's just try to draw
let's just name it
f1 right this is function 1 which calls
another function which is f do right so
traditionally what would happen is that
f1 would have its own stack space and
then f1 calls another function f2 which
would be placed on the top of it
right just like we do in stacks now the
thing is that if you have a function
something like this let's just say we
have a function a and only if I can make
it a little bigger so that it's visible
right so we have this function and let's
just say we do some sort of logic here
and finally what we do is return a
function B right and then there's a
function B which does some other sort of
logic other sort of logic so if you take
a moment
then what happens is that in your stack
if we kind of just place a debugger here
and call a right so what happens is that
when you call this function a it gets
its own stack space like this is f1
right then you do all sort of things and
then you finally get to this line return
B right here then what happens is that
when JavaScript sees that traditionally
what JavaScript would do is keep f1 in
stack and open f2 on stack right f2
probably there we are
okay so what thing called optimization
pretty much does is that it tries to
determine if this b function needs
anything from function a or it can
independently execute so by that what I
mean is that is it really necessary to
keep f1 on the stack while f2 is
executing because if we are just
returning this function B which does
some logic and returns a value let's
just say for the two then there's no
need to keep f1 on the stack for that
particular time because that is pretty
much once we are done with function a
still here
just above this return line then we do
not do not need function a to be kept on
stack right we can just throw it off
from the stack and save some space so
what they'll call optimization again
what it does is that it pretty much
determines that do we really need this
function this function a to actually be
on the stack or not so let's just first
of all take a look at how we can
actually make use of this now one thing
right now is that tail call
optimization isn't fully implemented
right now in almost every browser so if
we go to like es6 support and there's a
link right here this one you would see
that tail call optimization is one of
those things which is not really
implemented in almost any of the browser
except Safari right here Safari then
supported Safari 10.1 supports is and
chrome also supported with I guess with
the experimental flag on yeah with the
flag on but suffice oppose it out of the
box right now as well it this the one I
am running right now is so five ten
point one I guess and it supports that
so we're going to take a look at some
data called optimizations right now so
let's just build a real quick function
in both in Chrome and Safari as well so
we could actually see the difference so
I'm just gonna navigate to about blanks
so that we are not bothered buddy calls
black right there and we are inside
console and if I can zoom this one as
well okay so now let's just write a very
simple function which recursively calls
itself again and again and again again a
so we want to actually crash down this
stack right so I will try to crash down
this stack in both Chrome and Safari so
let's take a look and again one more
thing that the tail call optimization
right now works in you strict mode so
you have to use you strict but since we
are using Chrome it does not matter
because it does not support it right now
out of the box so this is our function
let's just name it
X and let's just say it accepts a number
argument and we're going to say if
number is equal to zero which is which
would be our base case we're going to
just say let's just say console.log
stack is
probably not dead if you are seeing this
I guess we have a problem there seeing
this right otherwise what I want is
return X naught minus 1 now here's the
thing you need to be careful about in
this return statement
you can obviously call this function
again does not matter but you should not
use any kind of local variable within
that function so for example I have like
let I is equal to 5 if I do something
like this then it is not eligible for
tail call optimization and the reason
for that is that now JavaScript cannot
destroy this f1 stack because it holds a
reference to this I which we would
apparently need when the whole stack
when the whole recursive chain returns
right
so for tail call optimization it is
necessary that the function which you
are returning does not contain I mean
does not use any local variable with
within it right so obviously you can use
something like I here doesn't matter
because it gets passed along with the
calling function but do not make use of
anything like this or even if you are
making use of try to form a logic where
you do not need to do that all right so
now this function would the call itself
recursively as many times we pass and
num right here okay so let's just take a
look let's say I write one here so we
get stack is probably not dead if you
are seeing this obviously one call
chrome can support I guess 10 as well
100 calls as well so this is the size of
what happens right here when we call X
of 100 is that there are hundred stacks
made up and then the final one returns
us console.log stack is probably not
dead if you are seeing this and then
every stack then sheds down so obviously
we are actually returning
undefined here if we are just console
logging this so it doesn't matter so
essentially we are just returning
undefined right so if we switch this
down to thousand again it works but what
about ten thousand you can see that we
get maximum calls tax Isaac's kid
exceeded so we now know that Chrome's
stack Handler can support functions
somewhere between thousand and ten
thousand well that's quite a good limit
but if you are kind of building an
application which does a lot of
mathematical work and you are using all
sort of recursive functions and all that
stuff this might be a problem for you
right so okay so this is our traditional
JavaScript with no tail call
optimization which is actually eligible
for tail call optimization right so
let's just try to implement the same
thing the same code in Safari ten point
one which is tail call optimization
ready so we have the same function right
here I hit enter right and now if I
write let's start with ten we get a
correct message with 100 as well
thousand as well with 10,000 as well
because this is they call optimize you
can see that we can write any number of
messages here it would just increase the
delay obviously because it has to do
I don't know once ten hundred thousand
ten thousand hundred thousand million
ten million hundred million billion 1
billion operations so obviously it would
take a little bit of time but it would
not throw a stack size exceeded error
because this is running in a one space
or one space because it does not take a
billion stack sizes as it is eligible
for tail call optimization right because
we are just returning the function and
nothing like local variable use right
here with this and this could be
actually any function right this could
be some other fun
as well it does not need to be recursive
for tail call optimization right and
again a billion calls I guess is too
much for Safari to handle in a few
seconds so we might get a little bit of
delayed here but we would surely get a
stack is probably not bad if you are
seeing this if we stick long enough I'm
not sure how much time it would take but
we should probably get that so yeah that
is pretty much it about the tail call
optimization I guess and you won't
really need to use actively make use of
this thing if you are just a web
developer and they're not really into a
lot of recursive and all that stuff but
it's always great to know about such
things new features which es6 brings to
us and yeah I think it's kind of cool
because now this finally gets us makes
us eligible to write buggy code with
recursive recursion so ad stack still
does not overflows and you can see that
we get stack is probably not dead if
you're seeing this so javascript
evaluated kind of a billion stack walls
in a one space and the return the switch
stack is probably not there so yeah
that's all pretty much for this tutorial
