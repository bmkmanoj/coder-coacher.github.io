Mabel and welcome to your 13th angular
tutorial I guess and in this tutorial
we're going to take a look is add one
radiator binding again but from this
time from the view to the script so in
the last tutorial we took a look at how
we can do when we data binding from the
script to the view and I actually forgot
to tell you one last thing
in that and that is instead of making
use of these square notations what else
you can do is make use of this bind
while you think so this bind and then
this attribute this square attribute
both means the same things right so it
doesn't matter
similarly with for this one we're
binding for view to the script what we
need is some sort of user interactivity
obviously because that's how the view
would send some data to the script like
user interacted with this button or user
entered some text into this input field
and all that stuff so I'm going to do
that what we're going to make use of is
these curly brackets or just not really
curly they're circular brackets right so
inside this we would write our event
name so let's just say this is key down
and for this this curly bracket the the
circular bracket rather actually tells
angular that we want you to handle this
attribute or rather this event and the
right here let's say we just say our my
function anything like that we can just
call it right so we just go back to our
component and we define my function and
we can bear MSA console.log
this was fired right and we can just
take a look in the browser console and
if I write something you can see
even successfully fires every time we
write something so the stars on the key
down and again if you're not comfortable
with these brackets what you can do is
instead of writing these brackets you
can say on target now remember for the
echoing out of value or rather showing
the value we were making is a bind but
for this event handling for the events
or rather one-way data-binding when we
are sending data back to the script we
make you love this on keyword right here
right so if you save this and take a
look again it's one on the same thing
now angular actually gives you an event
here as well so that you can just access
what just happened
so if you take a look at this event and
we can very much just lock this what we
are getting and take a look in the
browser and here I enter some key you
see that we get this keyword key boat
event and accordingly we can just decide
which keys were pressed like it saves me
false for control key so if I press
control and press some other key so you
know you could just pretty much create
some combinations in here with this
function and date accordingly and take
the actions accordingly right so let's
say if you want to maybe like I don't
know if that's not really the best way
to explain this but let's just say if we
have something like my custom spring in
here spring and it's just said to blank
for now and we can just get rid of all
these other things I don't know why do
we have right and what we can say is my
custom strength
I don't know let's say event target dot
value versus area just appending
whatever the users typing we do not care
the user deleted it right and we can say
this thing right and we can just display
it in the browser there and yes so let's
just say if I write something like 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 so you can see that it's
becoming jumble so what we can do is say
something like now we can say all rather
actually is the stick with us so for our
make use of the new line so okay so it's
parsing our HTML so we're going to see
that in source you can see that we get
our new text in every line even if I
remove the text right so you can see
that very much that's how we are able to
send data from our view to the script
file by one-way data-binding and again
you can just go with the bracket
notation 1 if you want it's up to you
again so that is not pretty much one-way
data-binding works in aguilar at least
and that's all for this one and the next
one we're going to take a look at how we
can do two-way data-binding and actually
what that would mean rather so that's
all for this one and if you liked it
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
