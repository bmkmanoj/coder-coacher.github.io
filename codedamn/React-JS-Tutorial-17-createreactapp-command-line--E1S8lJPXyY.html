Mickel and welcome to your 17th react us
tutorial in which we're going to start
off with a new react application and
we're going to create a simple tick-tock
exacto game in reactive and I have
deleted all the previous files because
now what I'm going to do is make use of
this create react app which actually is
extremely comfortable if you want to
just get started and you're not
interested in all the configurations or
and set up on es6 babel transpilers and
all that stuff plus it gives you ability
to write your CSS and sass or less than
you just automatically transpile itself
it comes with Babel it comes with
transpilers all that stuff so you just
need to write one line and get started
so how you do that it's first of all if
you don't have this then do NPM install
DubLi create react app since I already
have done this so I'll just going to
skip this and once you have done that
just go ahead and write create react app
and then space and then your application
link so let's just name it
tic-tac go like that and it'll just take
a minute because it's installing react
react on and this react scripts input
all that stuff like transpilers and CSS
sass to CSS converters and the hot
module reloading and all that stuff so
I'm just going to pause the video and
wait for this to install it might take
some time depending upon your connection
speed alright so once it's done you'll
see something like these messages so
right so if I take a look in sublime
text and see package.json
you can see in our dependencies we have
react and react on and the plaka
dependencies and reacts
is there right under if you take a look
and source you'll see that we have at
the GS now this is the thing which would
load for the first time when you run
your app though technically it's index
Dodgers but index pages is just a
container with add up as the tags right
so the command line if you see it saves
me go to the folder and it can be in
stock if I hit enter you'll see that
localhost or 3,000 is open and if we
take a look behind the scenes in
Pakistan juicer and NPM start
essentially calls this reacts first at
right okay so now we have our
application running with create react
swift and it's it was super easy to
configure we just wrote one line of code
and all of this is set up automatically
right and it's this hot module reloading
so what we can do is I can just go to
add touches and change it to fold down
and save and you can see that it
automatically reloads and changes to
welcome go down right so that is not
very much you start your application
with or rather create your application
with create react scripts and it's super
easy way to get started so that is all
for this tutorial and in the next one
we'll start by creating interface for
our game and then implementing all the
logic and all that good stuff so that's
all for this one and if you liked it
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
