Mei hole and welcome to your 20th
angular 2 tutorial in which we'll be
starting off with a simple login
application for angular 2 well we did
create one for angularjs in the previous
playlist of angularjs and I found it to
be quite successful so here I am to
create another one for angular 2 well if
you are kind of you know perplexed to
see all of those stuff right here and
you don't know how I got this I'm just
saying that for the users who have come
directly from some other page to this
page then you could probably go to my
angular 2 playlist and I have
demonstrated how I have set it this up
in some tutorial I don't know I guess
it's in the first five tutorials or
something you can just search that and I
would probably be will link to my
playlist as well in the description so
that anybody can go and pretty much play
all the videos if they like to so what
we are going to do in this kind of mini
series for a login application I'm just
giving you an overview is that we are
going to create a simple login form
which would authenticate the users or
the administrators depending and would
just redirect them to appropriate pages
and obviously we would secure the pages
by making use of that there's no
unauthenticated access to a particular
page well before even starting this I
want to say that this method is highly
insecure and anyone could probably break
out of this because all of this code
which we are going to write would be
running on our browser itself so that
gives anybody the opportunity to see
what we have written and in the best
case scenario what you can do is just
encrypt your JavaScript but it itself
doesn't allow the user doesn't block the
user to see your code so for example if
you are writing like if username is
admin and password is this and then
redirect them to this create session
like this and all that stuff but what
happens is that user can actually just
view source or do something else
to view this thing right here so user
knows that if he enters the username of
admin and password as one two three four
five he can get access to that
instructor area well we can just
probably fix this by simply moving the
authentication part to the backend and
leaving the rest of the works same so if
you get time we'll probably do that as
well but for now let's just concentrate
on angular 2 and let's get started now
as you can see pretty much I have
cleared everything you can see like I
have only just this main dot d s then
there's nothing in templates nothing in
J s cutoff and nothing in CSS so we are
just going to start from the scratch
bottom ok so now as you know we need to
create a budget the TS file right here
which will just include our first code
so I'm just going to say import
component from angular 2 core then
import route config let's just import it
right now because we are going to need
it anyways router directives from
angular 2 slash routes then we need to
create a component so let's square one
this is gone own and then we have we
want to have a selector and if I go to
my index dot HTML file you can see I
have renamed the selector to root so we
are going to make use of this one only
so I'm going to say in my ab PS that my
selector is root then I want the
template to be router outlet now
obviously you know that what this would
do and what it would do is actually it
would just whatever routes we are going
to set it
through all of those components into
this template tag so this is kind of
apparent of every component we are going
to make use of in our application then
next thing we want to have is directives
obviously so that we can just inject all
of that stuff inside this and yeah
pretty much we are done here and for
route config you're gonna need an array
and inside this array we've got a pass
in our properties so we're going to say
that when the path is homepage then what
I want is that my component should be
let's just say this is login form and
let's just name it US give it a simple
name of let's just say login or login
form simple as that and I'm just gonna
go ahead with a single route config for
now and yeah so the next thing we need
to do is create export class and this
should be what this should be let's just
say login app and login up pretty much
like that let's just leave it blank for
now and right here we also need to
import that in the main dot d s I'm
gonna say you log in app from what this
is app dot d s all right so if I look at
in the browser for now okay it wouldn't
probably work because we don't have we
haven't created this login form
component so far so let's just go ahead
and create this and I'm gonna say login
or clusters name at component dot login
dot TSN I guess I just missed that
tradition of naming so let's just rename
this to component
dot up TS just like we were doing in the
last application so continent dot dot d
s here we go and everything else looks
fine okay the next thing import let's
just say this is login component from
the same file component dot log n dot d
s pretty much and right here I'm going
to create component only but with a lot
of not used code like this and we don't
need a selector here so let's just say
my login we don't need the route config
as well directives we need that so let's
just get rid of this and for login
component we have this thing alright so
if you check out in the browser we have
got a bunch of errors unexpected token
oh okay so this should be logging form
actually on this one as well
okay I guess I haven't actually
connected it it was a previous one so
you or me make sure you just do NPM star
in your local directory looks like we
still have some errors all right
component add DHS all right so this
should be router and this should be
router then we have similar sort of
error app j/s let's just delete this
folder component add the TS dot oh poor
me we don't have to include the TS what
happened
you
all right so now you can see that it's
working so we have just set it up our
simple two components right now the
first one being the index component
which would just take care of all the
stuff we have on the website and then
accordingly we can just break down our
website into simple components for
example I've just created this simple
one my login then we could just
customize it for a login form and pretty
much just go ahead and do some more sort
of routing and yeah so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial and if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching and I guess I
didn't show you this one so oh okay so
this was out of my window view so I just
realized that I haven't shown this so as
you can see this is working and just
like it you're going to end this video
right here and if you liked it again
