another high onic tutorial not really a
tutorial but again in this video as I
have shown in the news reader I'm gonna
show you the working of our application
which we created right now the timer one
so this is go to file manager sdcard
down here you can see this timer dot apk
it's 2.4 mb/s again let's open and yes I
have just skipped over to real where you
sign and do all that stuff
and yes I haven't even edited the name
in the package dot J's when we evaluate
you know how to do that and if you don't
then go back to my news reader apk
tutorial I guess this was a second last
one tutorial in which I taught you how
to just edit the names and stuff so
that's pretty easy to do and this
requires a minute or two well that
rhymed wealth and so let's just install
it and here we go so let's just wait for
it to install
as you can see the app is installed so
let's just open it and again the same
screen so it pretty much shows me the
same thing which was visible on the
browser but right now you can see that
if I can just edit right let's just say
is it 15 seconds and hit on start you
can see it works like a charm just like
it did on the browser so I don't know
what happens to be alert because I have
even never tried that let's just see
what happens when the timer is up okay
so we get a nice little alert
not to worry about so the alert works
good as well and if I just you know
that's not coded for zero seconds so let
me just go with 10 again let's start
eight seven six and stop it right there
so it showed me you kill the damn timer
so it's pretty cool and amazing app well
you can actually publish this on Play
Store if you want to well I'm not gonna
do that because there are a lot of
application like this available and even
better than that but don't worry you're
still learning about this so it might
take a bit of time for you to create a
well known application so yeah that's
pretty much it and that's how this
application works and you might want to
just edit all of that stuff like ionic
blank starter I haven't even edited the
title up there so yeah so that's pretty
much it and if you liked this tutorial
or basically the kind of tutorial so
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
