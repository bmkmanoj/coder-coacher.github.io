your 44th JavaScript regular expression
tutorial and in this tutorial we'll be
writing a simple email validator program
using regular expressions and I hope you
know the objective of all these
tutorials all these writing dummy
programs tutorials is to make your
understanding better in regular
expressions and how they work and to
make you know about maximum of these
special characters and their usage and
escaping and all that stuff in regular
expressions so let's get started
many a times you would like to have your
users enter email address in your forms
on your website so one way to validate
your users email ID is like finding ok
so first of all to create this regular
expression we'll need to find something
unique or things about an email address
so let's say we have an email address
like able see a directional Gong which
is a perfectly valid even address valid
mil and what's unique about this is
first of all we have got a string before
at the rate there's only a string
then we have got and at the rate sign
and I don't know if it should be an or a
but I'll just go with a at the rate sign
and we have got a domain name which is
again a string and then we have got it
dot then we have got a top-level domain
which is again strength but these two
right here are only
alpha-numeric
and this these two would allow us to
narrow down our regular expression to
find out some cheeky email ids which are
trying to spam your inbox so let's get
started and for this let's take an input
from the user input should be prompt
just like a previous program and enter
your email address and
let's say regular expression should be
now I guess I shouldn't have deleted
that so let's copy this down let's
let's undo undo undo one we've got this
and let's do like this so now one thing
we need is to check for a string but
really before the at the rate side
so for checking for a string we have got
this special quantifier as backslash and
a capital S now this capital S would
check if the supplied thing is a string
or not so obviously we would like the
evil ID to start with a string so
therefore this will check oh sorry yeah
so this will check if there's a string
and then we would like this to continue
searching for a string unless it
encounters a after it side now we wrote
plus here because we want to check
regular expression continuously unless
we reach the other it side so I don't
want regular expression to split up
every string into an array and then
return it to me
every character of that string to be
more precise and if you want to learn
more about this then go back to my last
tutorial I'll explain explained about
this plus sign
got a deeper there so now we have at the
right side and we have to check for
another string now now let's go ahead
and check for this string because now we
have to go god the Chimel and now this
chi minh would be matched by this as the
backslash and s so it would match any
string which includes gmail as well and
then a dot but if you remember then dot
is a special character which will match
anything so we need something do regular
expression to tell that we don't need
this dot as a regular expression but as
a string literal to be matched
so we'll escape this and by escaping I
mean that this should not serve as any
special purpose but should be regarded
this dot should be regarded just like
any normal other character like this at
the rate sign and since at the rate is
not any special character in regular
expression so we need not to escape this
so now we have got a dot and again I
would like to have a string which should
be a top-level domain which is gone here
so to summarize this thing up
let's start with this strength which
will match ABC this drink Plus unless it
encounter say after its signed then we
have got she-mail
for this s alia it should be plus so
that it continuously search for the
string unless it encounters a dot right
here which is escaped with this
backslash itself because dot has a
special meaning if I do it like this
then it would have a very different
output as expected so as expected no it
should be against our expectations so
anyways and then we have got a dot for
the separation of the domain name at the
top level domain and then we have got a
string and it should be plus again here
so I hope that regular expression is
clear let's run it in the browser search
our browser and let's reload this whoa I
guess I didn't set any condition for
here to match let's say result should be
input dot match reg X and let's just
cancel log result because we know that
type of result is object obviously
so let's reload this and let's say I
supply
ABC add original comp let's say ok so it
gave me the string because it matches
matched perfectly with this regular
expression now let's try with some
deformed email address now let's say I
just give it me hood so now it gave me
null because regular expression test
failed on this so one thing you could
check that if result equals null or
maybe triple equal then obviously not a
valid email and else
valid email and we have got a
interesting method for this a more
precise which would return a boolean
value instead of the regular expression
the matched value itself or the null and
that is the test method now match
belongs to the string prototype but test
belongs to I guess Rick xB object
prototype so okay so let's take a look
at the test as well in this tutorial so
test would actually result in a boolean
value would return you a boolean value
if the regular expression match was
successful and this is basically true
basically helpful for programs like the
email validator where you need to know
all about whether the email supplied is
true or false and you don't have any
tasks to do with the value returned by
the match function so let's take a look
how we use test
and since I told you this test method is
the prototype of the Reg XP object that
means this would be in the format of reg
X B dot
proto type dot test and this is the test
method
and we have got strength got prototype
dot match as the match method if you
don't know about these string prototype
and you don't know what the prototype is
and how it works then go back we long to
I guess my eleventh or twelfth tutorial
where I started with prototypes and
prototype of chain and all that
inherited model in JavaScript and how
prototypal inheritance works in Aiden's
work and you'll pretty much understand
everything that so now we need to change
our core a little bit to make it a work
with the test method so to work with
test as I told you it would accept as a
regular expression object so now instead
of input we would use rec X so record is
a regular expression object reg X
literal
literal right here and we would make use
of the test method of this object and
inside the parentheses we would supply
this string we want to test against so
this is kind of mirror of match and it
would return a boolean value so this
would be now if result equals true then
this is a valid email a valid email and
else
this ain't a valid evil
so let's reload this and let's say I
have a concern about this yeah
so let's reload this and let's say some
random bunch of text and let's hit OK
and we get false because this is not a
valid email let's reload this again and
let's enter a legit email address let's
hit OK and we got true because it match
a regular expression this expression
right here completely
now obviously this is not a bulletproof
regular expression for validating
against all the email addresses because
this were also accept like
I don't know let's check this out this
input and as you can see it returned us
true so what you want is that obviously
we won't want user to summit like
quotation marks or double quotation
marks and our regular expression should
consider it has the correct email
address so what we can do is that we
could actually convert it into your
alpha numeric value right here which has
said you it will said a to said and zero
to nine and I told you and then similar
for the adder it side and
we have already only got
alphabets for the TLB and to avoid this
fuzz of capitalization what I can do is
I can just put a a flag right here and
this would mean that this regular
expression should be treated as case
insensitive so this would treat ABC
adder a gmail.com same as ABC a deranged
England God so that saves you a bunch of
regular expressions and now let's just
uh start let's reload this and let's
enter let's say ABC and we got false
now let's reload this and let's enter
ABC either hmm calm and we still got
false whoa so let's take a look where we
are
so
and yeah okay so we need not to escape
the the series this range because we are
already putting the square brackets and
we escaped the s quantifier so now we
have got a to z we want the first part
to have anything from A to Z and the
numbers a plus sign to denote that the
regular expressions should continue
unless it encounters a add the red sign
then we want a to z or an 0 to 9 to work
unless it encounters a dot sine which is
escaped because Dodd has got a special
meaning of itself and then finally we
would like the last one to have all the
alphabets because I don't think we have
got alphanumeric characters and the top
level domain do we have let me know so
now let's reload this program and let's
type ABC other HTML calm and hit OK and
it evaluates to true as expected
now this attempt would fail now by
putting any
special character which is also treated
as string and this would eventually
evaluate to false now this regular
expression is indeed powerful or more
powerful than our traditional one which
only just checked for the string input
but yet again I'm not saying that this
is the only bullet proof method and I'm
sure that this could also be bypassed in
one way or another like you could
actually write any length of the
top-level domain but obviously this much
a long top-level domain
wouldn't exist but it would still
evaluate to true so basically this would
be not be a hundred person bullet proof
solution and if you want one then you
can Google your this what you say email
validator regular a regular expression
for JavaScript and you'll get many ugly
regular expressions go ahead and see
those try to understand those and yeah
should explain what I did here so when
you're typing a range so if you want
like a to Z
in the first field and you want it to be
zero to nine as well then you can do
like this and I guess I told you that
already that you could also use this
thing which would literally mean
alphanumeric itself but I'm using this
thing it's up to you I'm using the range
one which is inclusive eh-2-zed and zero
tonight remember no gaps here and I
could also give like a to Z but since
I'm using the I flag right here that
means it should be guess insensitive so
this should also be a valid email
address and as you can see because of
this I so thank you I and that's all for
this tutorial and I hope you enjoyed
creating your email your own very first
email validator program with regular
expressions and I'll see you then and
