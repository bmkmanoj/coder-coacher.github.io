mijo our welcome to another WebSocket
tutorial in which I'm gonna show you how
to implement close function for
WebSocket which would actually just fire
up whenever you lose a client so it's
implementation is something like that on
close what I'm gonna do is say that I
lost a client right so this one run
whenever you lose a client and then what
I can do is say console log client one
more client connected right so this one
would work only run only once for a
particular client connection but this
and this one also would work whenever
there's a disconnection from the client
side right so if I run this now no there
next are oh we could have actually use
made use of known bond but anyways so if
I reload this and say something like 1 1
1 hit Send we got from so 1 1 1 and
right here we can see that one more
client connected and see it works fine
and if I just copy this URL this right
here you can see that we get one more
client connected now these two
connections are independent right so
it's not like if I write ABCD it's send
there then this would update ABCD here
as well known on that because the server
is sending this response to a particular
client which actually sent the message
to the server right it's not written
right here but it's just happening under
the hood right so you can just connect
multiple clients here
send like that then something like that
this one and all of these are separate
clients right you can see that one more
client connected all of these right so
it doesn't matter which client sends
what
messages they are not linked directly
just like there should be right so now
what happens it's if I close this window
you see we get our last client message
but again it doesn't affect the
connectivity of the server client system
right if I close this one we lost
another client this one lost another
client and so on and if I finally close
this one you can see that we lost the
final client as well so that is how
pretty much this close would work and
obviously you might have noticed that we
have no actual way to track which client
did we actually lose so you don't know
at this point of message the client you
lost right but you can actually just
know that by assigning an ID to every
client which might be useful for some
child applications but not for this
simple program so for demonstration
obviously so yeah that is all for this
tutorial
and if you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one real
quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
