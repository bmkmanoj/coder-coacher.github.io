PHP tutorial and I'm a hole from go down
gone and this tutorial will be looking
at arguments in a function now in the
last tutorial we created a bit very
basic function with just a good hello
world as many times as we call that now
let's create a function which actually
accept something from you and then pass
that so let's say back to the first
tutorial of the functions let's say you
want to have this operation result is
some number times number minus some
number times some number divided by all
that by a number so I want to create
that let's do how we can do that so I'll
create a function or some math and
inside these circular brackets what I'll
do is I'll pass on some unknown
arguments see d let's keep it do for
right now and since you know that these
are not used anywhere else now what
these are all about is that we could use
them inside this function but what the
heck do these values are now these
values are whatever you pass on while
calling this so let's say I want to turn
20 30 and 40 here and if I echo echo a
then some space then B or let's just do
this up this way a b c and e so if i
look at the browser you see we got 10 20
30 40 but if i call this function with
some other values let's say 11 25 77 and
then let's reload this then you see that
we got this as the first one and this as
the second one so you see that even the
numbers are different because the
template of this function is same we are
getting different output so we can use
this to perform what we wanted to so
let's say I want result as a plus B
minus C divided by D and here you go now
what I'll do is I'll type here on the
equals 0 so let's just call this and see
what happens so we got 0 Wow okay so
then plus 20 minus 30 / 40 is 0 hmm
seems interesting yep so let's try with
some other numbers let's say 5 11 and
true let's reload this when we got 2.5
because 5 plus 1 is 6 minus 1 is 5 then
x 2 is 2.5 which is correct well we
could actually create a similar function
with gone capped by concatenation of
strings let's say a B C let's say our to
echo a times B times C so if I die like
concat hello world like that and if I
reload this then we got hello world and
! ask concatenate it so that's how you
work with arguments in PHP and there's
blood room with this is that once you
omit any argument that is actually
listed here for example if I do like
this then we have a problem we will get
a warning but we'll get the result and
notice on a warning which surely I would
like to have so we'll know how to fix
that in the
tutorial so don't forget to subscribe
