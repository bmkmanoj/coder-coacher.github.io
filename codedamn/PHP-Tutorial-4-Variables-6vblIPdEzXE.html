fourth PHP tutorial in which will be
discussing about something called
variables in PHP now variables are an
important part of not only bhp but any
programming language you do so I hope if
you have done a programming language
before then you know what variables are
but if you don't then here you go
variables are container holders for
information in your code the data in
your code so variables are actually used
to store and use that information later
on inside your code so for example if
you receive an input from the user on
the webpage and you want to process it
somehow you want to send it as an email
to yourself then how would you do that
then we make use of something called
variables well that was a very sluggish
type of example but anyways let's get
started now to create a variable in PHP
what we use is a dollar sign now a
dollar sign would make your server
realize that yep you are working with a
variable now and write the name of your
variable and make sure that you don't
start your variable obviously you don't
start your variable you do start your
variable after dollar sign but after
dollar sign you don't started with any
special character like + or dash or any
number because that's not allowed
however and the score is allowed but in
most cases you don't need that so create
a variable and type equal to now equal
to is an assignment operator and it
would assign this variable the value
which ever we are with whatever we are
reading writing here so let's say I
right hello Fox
here and the semicolon means that the
statement has ended so your server knows
now that one statement has actually
ended now this variable actually now
holds the value hello Fox so how do I
make use of this variable now from the
previous tutorial we know that we could
make use of something called echo now
echo would output anything we supply as
text but this works with variables as
well so echo and writing your variable
name would actually echo out this
variable so if you write this equal to
this and echo your variable and what
would happen is when you would reload
your page then you'll get hello Fox as
output now what if I wanted this thing
to output to do that I'll just put this
in single goods and why not in double
quotes we'll be learning shortly so
that's it for this tutorial and we would
be working more nor more on variables in
my next tutorials so thanks for watching
and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
