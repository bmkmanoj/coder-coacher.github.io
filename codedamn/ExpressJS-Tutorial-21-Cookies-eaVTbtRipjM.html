and welcome to your 21st
expressjs tutorial in which I'm gonna
show you how to work with cookies now
cookies are fun because they allow you
to create sessions and basically keep a
track of what users are doing on your
website and cookies are basically just a
raw string of information stored on the
browser of the user and the browser
always sends all the cookies back to the
server on every request so you can kind
of rely on them and obviously you don't
need JavaScript enabled for the cookies
to work so now for the cookies as well
since this is a kind of module you'll
need to install it and now we know about
this package dot JSON file so what we
are gonna do is I'm just gonna say and
BM install cookie parser save hit enter
let it wait let's wait for a while
alright so as you can see we got it real
quick go to your package dot JSON and
you'll find it already there so here you
go now for this to work what I need to
do is I need to write some code let's
just write require Express then I want
cookie parser to be included as well
cookie parser then let's just run our
app with Express and then again we need
to use cookie parser so I'm just gonna
say I don't use cookie parser now app
dot get let's just make use of the get
method for now for the home page
function then again we have request
response set
then I'm just gonna say that
response dot cookie my first cookie
looks good and you can have spaces
obviously and the third argument would
be kind of your options
so if you are aware about that like when
you go to Facebook and then you choose
then you enter your login details then
Facebook just gives you a little check
mark of that keep me signed in there
that is actually what you know makes the
difference here so if you just select
that keep me signed in there no matter
how long after how long you run your
browser you always sign in automatically
Facebook unless you clear your history
or cache so that is a permanent cookie
so its maximum age is not set so for
example you can have a time-based
session that means that your session
would expire in two days or in two
minutes as well so for example in
banking you have a guest
ten minutes of wait to enter your
one-time password or something like that
I guess I have in my account so might be
you also have that so anyways you can
enter here a maximum age of in seconds
here so this would be seconds right you
have a bunch of options here as well I
don't remember actually so you can just
google that for this documentation and
you will get that for example for
instance for now I'm just gonna leave it
to these two only alright so let's just
hop into the terminal node script and
why the heck am I always creating new
files in here cut paste there you go
scrape to anyone is all right so I guess
stupid me I haven't even started the
server
one 287 functioned console yeah like
that
and then let's run it alright so it
asked me yeah well dude I've got
something some cookies for you you might
like that let me reload or basically
let's just end it as well Wow
so that at least we have something to
display reload now we get a WoW well
that's Wow much Wow so if I just go to
console and do document dot cookie you
can see now we got my first cookie as
looks good and it's properly URL encoded
by this module so you don't need to you
know think a lot about this and that's
how you basically create some cookies in
the browser and to remove that cookie
what you can do is you can just I can
just create another thing right here
remove cookie and you can just say here
clear cookie here you go
now once you do that and obviously don't
need a value for that so I do like that
and reload you see I had this cookie
right now but once I go out remove
cookie reload this or document dot
cookie you can see we get melted because
the cookie has been removed again I go
back we get nothing because I haven't
fully load the page yet and we get again
that P so that's how you basically work
with cookies and Express and you know if
you just used the node without Express
then this would get a lot of mess messy
card of the
I don't think that in node we actually
have an official method to work with
cookies so that's the plus point for
express and that's why we use Express so
that's all for this one and I'll see you
then in the next one real soon so don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
