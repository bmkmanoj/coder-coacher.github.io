your 17th angularjs tutorial in which
we'll be continuing with our application
from the previous tutorial but would be
changing the main purpose of the
tutorial and which is to wear a nice
simple search box with angularjs now if
you go back to my fundamental tutorials
in angularjs which says about
introduction to filters then we learnt
something about filters in angularjs
so now let's implement that inside our
HTML and let's make our HTML more
dynamic without actual need actually
needing JavaScript to create a search
box so that's the main benefit of
angular and that's why I like angular
because it kind of creates a lot of
dynamic activity in your HTML itself
without involving the JavaScript all
right so let's create a simple search
box with ngmodel as search box
and this ng-model as you know by now
would just bind every data inside we
type inside this input box and inside
this ng-repeat we need somehow to in
checked the ngmodel filter inside the
listings so that is simple you know so
what we can do is just put a pipe in
front of it right filter and just based
your energy model name right here which
is search box in my case and you are
done yes that's as simple as writing
traditional HTML code so now you see
that create a nice little simple search
box we do not even need to work with
JavaScript at all
so let's view it in the browser let's
see it in action let's reload this
and where's the input box all right so I
guess I'm one-sixteenth yeah so we have
got the input box obviously the
positioning is worst but you know you
can do that yourself so let's try it
right try to write something like May
hood and I you say that see that the
only filtered out surge is the main hole
one if I try to write a then I get all
the searches which have a inside them
since my name they don't have a decide
the letter A inside it so my name is
listed out and similarly you could
create this for age factor as well by
using a filter itself so if I do
something like 18 then I get all the two
listed with 18 and if you try to like
split this split this thing inside
different Li so inside different spans
then you can create a more specific and
kind a more restricted kind of search
box which would just search for either
name or age but not both at the same
time so if you have let's say like
thousands of names and ages of people
then this search box really saves your
life by just typing anything and you'll
get the instant result out so we would
be mocking working word on search boxes
on filters and how they work in
angularjs in my future tutorials but
that's all for this tutorial and I'll
see you there next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
