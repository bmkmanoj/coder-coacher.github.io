bootstrap tutorial in which we'll be
learning how you can create models in
bootstrap with the help of our
application which we started in the last
tutorial now in the last tutorial what
we did so far is we just created this
interface with the help of simple
bootstrap our HTML CSS and so on so in
this tutorial let's just go ahead and
create the model which I'm talking about
now a model is a fancy way of saying a
bootstrap alert box now in JavaScript
just like we have alerts like these this
doesn't look very nice and you know it's
just kind of static you can only have
text here no buttons or whatever else
and bootstrap you have models as alert
boxes and you can basically customize
them to a very large extent so let's
take a look at one now first of all to
create a model you will need to toggle
it somehow so that the user can click on
a button or a link or whatever and the
model is displayed so first of all let's
just go ahead and create that button now
the button can be created easily with
button class it should be a button and
I'll just prefer primary button a medium
sized so this would just say upload your
images and we need to add some more info
here and that is this is a data tourism
model and this would this would be the
thing which which the check way would
work on behind the scenes so even though
you won't use any jQuery code while
creating a model this bootstrap
framework would make use of this jQuery
file behind the scenes and would make
your model work
so this is a data toggle of model and
the target
now what this target is I'll be talking
about in just a few moments so now let's
just go out of this container because of
your sleep model will be full screen and
that doesn't make any logic too hard add
in container let's just create a model
and this model should Hodge this should
appear is a fade now this should be I D
my model your model whatever you like
you can name this but make sure whatever
you name this and whatever you have and
data target is same so let's just say
this as upload model why my and why
yours so this data target should be
harsh upload model now what happens is
behind the scenes jQuery would look for
this data target attribute and would
target whatever element is placed here
now for this right now this is this diff
and then it would toggle as you can
imagine now what I want is that this
model should never be you know InFocus
with the help of a tab now if you go
here and if you press tab then you see
that this becomes focus then this this
this this this this this and so on so
what happens is when I focus this with
the help of my tab key and press Enter
nothing happens because this doesn't
take me anywhere but if it were a link
let's say it was pointing to Google and
I pressed enter then this would take me
to Google now I don't want this tab to
accidentally appear on my hidden model
so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
write tab index as negative 1 now what
this would do is tab index basically
defines the how many number of times you
have to press your tab key for the
element to get focused for example if I
have a tab index of 0 then this would be
a first priority
one would be second two and so on
now obviously negative one doesn't make
any sense but that's what it is for here
and that is why I have written negative
one because this table index of negative
one means that this will never be in
focus with the tab key okay now the next
thing is rule which is a dialogue dialog
box
and obviously this should be hidden okay
so now we have some bunch of stuff in
here this is the model dialog and then
we have content and then goes the header
we are close don't worry okay now what I
want is I want somehow the user is able
to cross this model as well for example
let me just reload this page and click
on here now see that this model has
popped up but you know you could just
click outside this model to close it but
what if you want a cross button here
that would kind of look more appealing
so to do that you can't just create a
simple button with button and I guess I
missed this here you know I just usually
make sure to do that no I just like it
so this should have a class of clothes
and data Dismas now this would be what
it does and data dismiss would just tell
the JavaScript that this button is
acting as a model dismissal button
okay so the next thing I need to do is I
just need to add some clothes here here
you go
let me just take a look how this looks
it looks like awkward or something so
I'm just gonna change it to x and this x
is just a heavy multiplication sign you
see here that's it alright looks good so
far okay so what we have got next now
the next thing I need to do I need to
define a title for this model and the
title would appear at the top so let's
just make an h4 and model title let's
just say this as image uploader okay so
let me just take a look if that looks
correct yeah so this is the title and
this is our cross word the next thing is
we have got some content and this is
body I guess or maybe this is content no
no okay obviously we have used a content
above so this should be body okay so the
body in the body everything else goes so
you can have a form here which actions
as a your script file dot PHP or
whatever you want to use this method and
egg type or whatever the stuff you want
all of that would go there so I'm just
keeping it right now as hash method post
why not and egg type this is multi-part
form data and just you just remember
that you need to make use of this egg
type attribute whenever you are you know
just transferring a blog data
just blob is be lob which is binary
large object so you just make sure to
use that whenever you are transferring
some data like that and currently we are
doing images so we need that all right
now actually we are not transferring any
images for this video series but you can
try that so now the next is simple HTML
I'm just going to create some it's just
this is a label for input and this is
image the next is input type file that's
pretty much it I guess you know alright
alright so you need a submit button as
well don't you
so that's just say input type submit yes
oh that's just full of Ali of Summit
simple enough looks good and easy so
that's how you create a model now in the
next tutorial what we'll be doing is
we'll be adding styles to this input
type file so that it looks kinda nice
and you can even populate it a little
bit with some content if you want like
you can see this file uploader would
help you to upload and save your images
online just in case your cat happens to
delete your C Drive or just do a RM RF
of whatever on your Linux OS so you
can't just use that or something like
that
or any image would go as well so that's
how you create a model in bootstrap and
in the next tutorial we'll be looking
more at it and you know I'll just teach
you guys what we'll be doing in next
tutorial in next jewel so that's all for
this one and don't forget to subscribe
