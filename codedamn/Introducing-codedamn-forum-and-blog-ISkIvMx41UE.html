to this video in which I just want to
show you a couple of new subdomains on
go dam which includes the forum and the
blog now immediately I have just
launched these two so they're extremely
new so forum is for journal query and
questions and on the blog I'll just post
any sort of code which is required in
the video tutorial and any sort of
description you want mostly the code
would be on github but any kind of
description or step-by-step tutorial
like anything like that so that would go
on the blog section so with the forum
section you can sign up on this of
course this is discourse and I like the
idea of this course a lot of forms use
that and it's quite clean and amazing to
use so you can sign up here and start
asking questions to the community the
reason I launched this because sometimes
I get a lot of emails regarding some
sort of problem or thing related to the
tutorial or any sort of code so if you
ask here before asking me I think the
community will be able to provide you
with a faster and a better solution than
me because obviously I am not available
all the time so it might take you some
time to get a reply from my side but if
you post it here if the community grows
then you will probably get a faster
reply here so yeah that's pretty much it
and the next thing we have is blog and
again it's right now just launched so it
kind of is just the starter theme you
can see that nothing fancy here so I'll
be working on the blog really soon and
for now the forum is ready for you to
sign up and use so please go ahead and
sign up and let me know if you have any
sort of suggestions even here or in the
comment section and I will be happy to
help so that is all for this one and if
you liked it then please don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
