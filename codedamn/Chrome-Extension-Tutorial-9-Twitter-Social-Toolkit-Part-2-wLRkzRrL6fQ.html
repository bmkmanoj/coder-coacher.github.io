google chrome extinction development
tutorial in this tutorial we'll be
continuing where we left from in the
previous tutorial so we'll be continuing
our extension development of Twitter
social toolkit which allows a user to
share next images content links page or
anything to its Twitter account so I
have made some modification to manifest
the chess world from previous tutorials
as you can see in the description and
given a suitable title and I have also
given icons 64 32 16 and 128 of this
icon the Twitter one icon so that is
easier to recognize our extension and
the next thing we want to do is to
create a background script and I have
already created a background strip down
here in the manifest background scripts
and here you go let's create a
background strip now actually background
ogs here we go
let's give it in a large so let's see if
it's working or not we have the
extension down here we load app it works
good so
now to create a right-click menu down
here we'll need to use a chrome API
Chrome the context menus that create now
this ApS is available in only in
background environment so to use this
API we need to declare some permissions
first and even four missions would be
as you expected on text menus so now we
have the permission to modify the
context menu that is this menu and let's
create a context menu the title should
be let's say
Twitter social toolkit and the title is
thing which appears like this like at
this cookie and go to JavaScript
settings our respective titles of their
context menus the next thing we want is
the context and I'll explain what it
does selection and the next thing we
like to have is on click this is the
JavaScript event listener and my
function so so far so good
let's square this function my function
let's show the simple alert you just
quit me
so this selection down here what it does
is it tells Google Chrome that I want
this this menu item to appear only when
user has selected some text or anything
on the browser
otherwise don't appear so let's reload
this extension let's see it in action so
if I right click there then I don't see
any of our Twitter icon but if I select
some text and then right click on this
text then we see Twitter social toolkit
as our icon like we have the selection
context here because of the selection
context so whenever you use a user
select right clicks on the selected
portion then only the user would be able
to see our icon or our context menu and
when you click this we get an alert you
just click me so using this we
could create new window or new window
basically I'll add the text to Twitter
window so that it's easier for user to
share the content so that's all for this
tutorial and in the next tutorial we'll
be working on the functioning of this
extension so see you there pals thanks
