another akmal script six tutorial my
name is Mei whole and in this tutorial
we'll be talking about how you can
extend your class in ESX to inherit
functions or rather methods and
properties from a different class so let
me just quickly get rid of this area
thing right here and instead of this
what I'm going to do is create a draw
function so the straw function would say
that if validate shape or let's just get
rid of this body that shape as well
because you might want to implement that
in a real web application but right now
since I'm in control I'm not going to
pass any goofy data so I'm going to
directly say if shape this Dutch shape
name equals square i'm going to say
document dot write div class or sale if
style weight as this dot dimensions 0
and similarly height as this
perturbations 0 live and yeah that's
pretty much it then else if this large
shape name equals rectangle then what I
want is the same thing but actually with
this one being one all right elsif the
start shape name equals circle then what
I want to do is I want the width to beat
this one and basically divided by two or
you know probably x 2 because we are
passing in the radius
and the the semi ploughed land should
not be there and do I want border-radius
still be fifty percent all right so wait
a minute yeah so now we're good okay so
now this probably looks like a normal
application but less is viewed in the
browser my shape that area draw reload
okay so now we have this semicolon right
there this style you probably don't want
that width is 20 let me just then then a
px as well do these hit reload now as
you can see we need hide as well so
these sort of little things are not
ending up right now height equals this
dot dimensions 0 x 2 here we go Oh again
we are missing a pixel right there okay
so final you have God a sort of circle
but eventually we cannot look at that
and the reason is that there's no color
and film with that so what we can make
use of is either just implement it in
right here or we can just create another
class let's just say this class is my
color and this has a random method of
let's just say getting a random color so
I'm gonna say
you are colors equals red green blue
yellow pink black some sort of colors so
what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to
see get random color and right here I
could just probably right that right
here i'm going to say return a random
color out of this colors array so first
of all let me just think about the logic
so we're going to say Matt dr. Landon
all right so it returns us a number
between 0 and 1 so I'm gonna flow rate
down somehow but I need to first of all
get it into a particular digit so 123456
123456 yeah so if i just multiply this
by six we get sort of number and every
time 52 so you can see that this range
is probably from zero to five actually
so and the reason is that the number
this mad not random would never be equal
to 1 because that is exclusive of you
know this matter random is never equal
to 1 so it will never hit six actually
so that is why if I just floor this down
dot floor mat not random times six then
this will always always be between 0 and
5 and not actually between but inclusive
of 0 and 5 so let's just make use of
this so I'm gonna say return colors and
something like that so now what we want
to do
is I want to extend this class and i'm
going to say now this means that inherit
all of the properties and methods which
are public and actually available for
sharing to other classes from this class
and now what we can do is actually we
can make a call to this method right
here and to do that we need to make use
of the super so what the super means is
that the super class is a class which
you are basically inheriting from so let
me just go here and say right there that
I want to have a background of let's
just say this is super dot get colored
get random color actually so make sure
you include that word super otherwise
your class would try to look this method
inside its own scope and therefore it
would not found it find it then I can
just copy and paste this thing right
there
probably we are done right so if I just
take a look in the browser okay so we
have got some syntax blog on right here
oh this should be extended actually
reload this this is not defined very
well and the reason is probably we want
called super first because if you don't
call super than your class the class
which you are from extending isn't
properly utilized so now as you can see
we get a nice little circle which is
randomized in its color using these
colors for now actually you can just
create a better random function by using
the RGB or hex value and then randomly
selecting it currently I'm just doing a
re selection so that doesn't really make
sense now I can just change this
dimension to let's say 100 so that it
looks much better so now as you can see
this is a random shape with a random
color every time and sorry for that
sudden zoom in because f5 right now
doesn't act as a refresh when i'm
recording so i can just change this to
square as well and all right hide
there's some sort of problem with height
so this would be pixel and pixel we load
you can see you get a nice little square
as well down there of all the colors
possible then you can change this to
rectangle as well and with 100 200 or
basically 200 and 100 my cloak with
metro green owed and here we go another
rectangle with different sort of colors
so I'm going to end this video when the
next red comes in here we go so here we
go now well that's how you pretty much
make use of extends right here to extend
methods and then you have to call that
in your constructor so that any
constructor which is right here is
actually called but currently we don't
have any sort of constructor for this
class so nothing is happening right here
then you have to make use of this super
dot blah blah blah whatever they are
metal or property is do get that and
yeah that's pretty much it and that's
how you do make use of another class and
expand it into your es6 ones so that's
all for this tutorial and if you liked
