May ho and welcome to your 21st angular
6 tutorial in which we're gonna take a
look at how we can extend our login
application to allow user registrations
as well so let's get started alright so
in this pad what we're gonna do is we're
gonna create something which allows
other users to register on your angular
application as well and obviously for
that you need to have a front-end which
the users can use to register validation
you don't want user name admin to be
destroyed by anyone in the world
then you need back-end as well obviously
which involves through the string user
communicating with the database and
doing all that sensitive stuff and
obviously you want to show user when the
user logs in you want to show him or her
some fields which they can set
accordingly basically it depends upon
what your app is so let's see how we can
create something like that so for the
front-end part if we take a look you can
see that we already have this thing till
now so what we can do is we can modify
this thing a little to make it more
generic and instead of login we can make
this register and we can say just
register and we can also do something
like instead of admin we can create a
dashboard thing right so the admin would
pretty much still be the admin but would
see stuff at dashboard so now we have to
create our distr route so what we can do
is go to our versat let's just close
this a little app dot module file right
and instead of admin what we can do is
name this dashboard
and or rather let's just keep it admin
only just gonna create another and if we
can do is here specify dashboard and
actually we can make use of another
property which is path match but yeah
we'll just make that make you love that
later on so this would be dashboard
component right on if we can just create
this component right away in G generate
component dashboard and this would just
do that for us right and there we are so
now we have the dashboard component and
what we have here is that we have
gestation button as well so what we want
is actually allow users to register so
we're going to create another out here
which would be our register out and the
component would say register component
now we're going to create this component
as well
and there we go so we have resistor
component in place and - what component
as well so inside our resistor component
what we're going to do is from our login
component right here we have pretty much
similar structure so inside my
administration if I could just close all
of these things inside my registration I
can just pretty much paste the same
thing and I can say I'm just your user
the summit of even and right here we can
say username password and you can just
create another field right here which
just says confirm password see password
right and yep that should do for the
component file this would be also
similar to what we have inside our login
stuff so we're just gonna create this
method copy this Ashley this would be
mr. user even not prevent default target
is this we have the username password
and C password is query selector C
password dot value and then what we're
gonna do first of all a basic check if
password is not equal to C password then
we can just create errors as an array
here and can just pretty much say errors
not push passwords do not match and
later on when we do more validation here
like querying if the username is
available or not and all that stuff so
we can just say here that if error start
length is greater than zero then only we
want to proceed to register this user
otherwise obviously that's a fail so
what we have here if error Scotland is
actually greater than zero then for the
user service user service is just for
the people who are logged in right so
you're not gonna access it right here so
we can access the odd service here and
we can say what we have here get user
details we are using get user details to
send this request we're gonna create a
lot of changes here to make it a little
bit understandable also I'm gonna shift
the PHP back into node now for this
application onwards so we're gonna see
node and MongoDB for the database so I'm
just gonna create a register user with
the username and password and confirm
password as well because we're gonna
need to validate the same stuff on the
backend as well front-end can be
bypassed by anyone so what we're gonna
do is say return this dot HTTP dot post
and then this would turn something I'm
gonna post this to let's say API slash
register user or just register and then
the data which I'm gonna pass is
username password confirm password well
if you're actually creating a actual
registration form or something you would
like to have implemented capture system
as well which prevents fraud
registrations and all that stuff but I'm
just going to keep it simple this time
and make it just user name password and
confirm password on it alright so with
that being done what we have is that we
are just doing this user by calling this
thing and remember I'm not appending PHP
because eventually I'm gonna shift the
backend to node only so what we're gonna
do is say first of all in check this
private or or service then I'm gonna say
and by the way this syntax the syntax is
equivalent to write writing auth as a
service and then you do something like
Earth has all service and say they start
all this all right so that's the same
thing it's just a shortcut
you're just wondering so with innere
stadt length is zero
I want this dot dot register user
username password and confirm password
well I believe that it does not make any
sense to send confirm password here
because we are already checking if the
password does not match and if the user
is actually bypassing this check then I
don't think so that user I mean if
somebody is playing around with the
api's then I mean I think it's just
redundant so we can just format this so
yeah so we're gonna just omit this thing
and there we go
username and password simple as that and
that is it so we can just subscribe to
this thing and yeah leave we should talk
about rxjs now it's high time because we
have been just using stuff without
explanation for rx gist so yeah we're
gonna just take a look at that real
quick in a tutorial coming up so this is
our back-end ready a front-end ready we
are sending the script we're sending the
HTTP request subscribing and we're
console logging the data we get from the
backend so they're just two component
right here if we see here go to register
we get an ugly little form because the
CSS is missing and we can just copy this
login component CSS only and by the way
you can just make it global as well
because login and destroys both are
using this so yep username password and
confirm password there we are how can
you make it something like just h2 here
register here something like that so
there we go
how can this
when we click on summit it did send an
HTTP request to the server the server is
not online yet so it won't work but
basically this is the front end of the
application and what we want is that
we're gonna say something like if data
got success is true then this dot route
tur dot navigate to dashboard and once
the data is successful the server has
already sent cookies back to the browser
so the user is authenticated you're sure
about that
right and just like login just like we
did with the login thing we can also do
the same thing with the login our
administrator we can also do the same
thing with logging of a regular user so
it just says yep so we just need to add
this thing here what's it this dot dot
resistor user so I'll create the
interface adjuster response which would
say success as boolean and that's pretty
much what you want right now for this to
return so this would be resistor what we
had just a response as the interface
name and that takes away the error but
the router is not defined so we can just
inject the router here as well private
router as router and we just need that
up to router there we are so this is
basically the code that would look for
the front end part and that is all for
this tutorial in the next one we're
gonna set up the back end and see how to
link front and back end so that's all
for this one and I'll see you then in
the next video and one more thing if you
