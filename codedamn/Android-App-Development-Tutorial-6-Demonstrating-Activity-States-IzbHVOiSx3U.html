is Miho and welcome to your sixth
Android application development tutorial
and in this tutorial I'm gonna show you
what the heck I talked about in the last
tutorial in actually on a real device so
not real actually on an emulated one but
you know you get the idea well what I
was talking about in the last tutorial
was all of these methods right here when
they fired off so I wrote this little
program we just showed me the time
whenever these functions these methods
were firing so this is a toast well I
promise you guys I'm gonna teach you
about those later on trust me right now
the purpose is only to make you see
whenever the message whenever the
function the method is fired so I'm
gonna make use of this toast which is
pretty much a small notification kinda
in the rounded box sort of thing appears
on the bottom of your screen you're just
gonna see it in a minute then all of
these methods include something known as
this toast this then count which would
be the count updater so that we could
just actually see that if the those are
displayed and run the right order or not
then we have assigned this override now
what this override means is that all of
these methods right here you see that on
resume on star etc are actually coded
already in a class from which this main
activity is extending so if you remove
this pretty much you see these super
don't quit become read because obviously
since we are not inheriting from any
class so super doesn't make any sense
because super actually means that you
are referring to not this current class
in which you are working but to a class
from which you are extending so super
dot on create fires the oncreate method
of app come back come activity but in
reality what happens is that this app
come back activity is inheriting from a
class
known as empty weary well this is the
base class and pretty much anything you
see in your activity which extends from
a certain class would probably in you
know you know one extended second extent
would fall to this activity only because
this is the very basic definition of all
the activities so what is happening here
is that with the help of super you are
firing a method oncreate of the parent
class instead of this own method then
for onstar as well and the reason you
need to fire off these parent methods is
that Android takes care of your stuff
like if you are assigning a variable
then when your application is destroyed
then freeing up your resources
well Java take care of that but Android
does provide some support as well
so Android requires you to call these
functions these methods so that Android
could itself know that your activity is
destroyed or it is stormed and all that
other functions so pretty much what
happens is that whenever something
happens then Java would call your method
and then you would inform Android like
discipline developers so let's see this
allocation in action so I'm just gonna
hit play button and hit OK and pay close
attention to whatever happens now on the
screen so our application launches and
it shows me created started and resumed
now pay close attention what happened
here first of all our application was
created now when this was created this
toast was shown with a plus of one
then our application was started it's
just like you were created out of a
dream you just wake up from sleep you
were seeing a dream but you just you are
now a new being created in this world
well that's sounds philosophically but
anyways then you know you take a start
you see what happened
you just wake
and then finally you resume with your
work so that's kind of what is happening
here then what happens is that now when
I press this home button which means to
us that you know I just want this
application to run in background most of
the application do that and pretty much
just not show this application so let's
see what happens if I click on this
button right there
you can see that it fires paused stopped
but not destroyed
now the reason is that your application
is still very active in the background
because you pressed home button not the
back button because the back button
would actually kill your applications
activity which would fire the ondestroy
method of that particular activity so
what has happened here is that on pause
and on stopped method is fired but not
on destroy because your activities still
not destroyed actually the data is still
preserved you see that if you're filling
a form in you know Chrome browser and
you just navigate to some other website
like or if you have a whatsapp message
and then you just you don't throw your
this menu right there and just open your
whatsapp message then your chrome data
doesn't just disappear into error it
stays there because your activity is
pretty much not destroy Java has not
freed its resources
so the next thing like if I open this
application again you would see that it
fires restarted started and resumed so
it didn't fire the create method because
your activity already is created inside
the memory so you do not need to fire
the create method again so you can see
how pretty much amazing Android is
organized then if I just press this back
button you can see that it fires paused
stopped and destroyed so now you can see
that your application is paused then
stopped
and destroyed so you have pretty much a
lot of control over your activities and
the time intervals whenever whatever
things happen so that is the most
awesome thing I love about Android it
gives you a lot of control over what do
you want to do and yeah so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial
and if you liked it then don't forget to

I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
