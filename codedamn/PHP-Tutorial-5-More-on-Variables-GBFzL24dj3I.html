fifth PHP tutorial in which will be
working more on variables so in the last
tutorial we learn how to create a
variable and initialize it with some
value and let's create some more
variables so let's say this is number 1
100 number two and yes you don't need to
put single quotes or double quotes
whenever you are assigning a variable in
a numeric value so you don't need to do
it like this this will just work fine
and this one as well all this one or
whatever so here you go now we have
three variables my first variables let's
just limit message because that looks my
first variable looks odd so message
number one number two we could have more
variables number three or number for us
so you see that we could have a lot of
different types of variables and we
could actually have a bull type as well
which is either true or false I hope you
guys know what true or false means
obviously so similarly we could echo
each of them as well so let's say echo
message then I would do echo be are so
so as to make sure that each of them
appears in a new light and we do have a
quick fix for that as well so we would
be looking at that how we do that
shortly so this is number one number two
number three echo number four echo BR
echo bull-type alright so let's view it
on the web page let's reload whoa okay
so you see that we get hello Fox as
message 100 as number 1 200 as member to
number three number four well where is
the bull type well the bull type is not
a code because it is just a boolean it's
just a flag it's either true or false
what would be echoed here because this
is not something like this this is a
boolean variable we would be learning
more about boolean shortly but I just
wanted to make sure you guys know that
you simply don't echo bull types on
pages you could either convert them into
integers and then I quit for example
false stands for 0 and true stands for
one so anyways so that was more on
variables in this tutorial and the next
tutorial we will be probably looking on
automatic in PHP which is kind of
tradition while learning any language to
look at how its automatic works so
that's it for this tutorial pretty much
and I'll see you then next time don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
