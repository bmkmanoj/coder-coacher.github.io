second tutorial for electron building
cross-platform apps and in this tutorial
what I'm going to do is show you how you
can set up electron to start working
with it so let's get started
so first of all what you need to do is
install noches if you do not have that
because electron will be actually using
node a lot because that's pretty much
that's how javascript is used by
electron with the help of node.js right
so if you do not have know what you can
go to Lucchese org and download the
recommended release or you can just and
with the latest release but I'll just go
with recommended and I already have that
installed so I'm going to go with
neither but if you do not have known
install you can just go here with this
one or whatever the latest one is at
your time okay so once you have done
that what you should get additionally is
NPM which is node package manager and
one status once you have installed node
just go to your command line and your
folder wherever you are starting or
actually it doesn't matter you can just
open come on line anywhere because we're
going to install electron globally so
the out we can you make use of electron
all over on our PC instead of just
limiting to one project one folder so
I'm going to say NPM install electron
and then use a global flag and intro now
this will install electron globally but
I'm gonna just quit this because I
already have electron install on my
computer so I'm not going to reinstall
it so you would just like you would want
this installation to complete it might
take a couple of minutes depending upon
your internet connection but once it's
done what you need to do is the create
an app right so we can pretty much go to
our file
Explorer and create a folder let's say
this is hello world which would be our
app and inside here or we can say or
rather we could just system online as
well you can say hello world and we can
stay in p.m. in it which would just
create a package.json file for us and if
I can just move it a little bit up okay
so now we have this in package.json file
but we need a couple of more files to
write a simple stable HelloWorld program
right so let's just go ahead and create
one now so the first one would be index
tortillas and the second one would be
index dot HTML obviously which is which
will be our view right so these three
files are pretty much what you need to
get started with electron and that is
all you need the number of files you
need to write your very first GUI
HelloWorld program where the web
technologies like JavaScript so that is
all for this one and in the next
tutorial what we are going to take a
look in how you can write a HelloWorld
program with electron really quick
so that's all for this one if you liked
it then don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching I'll see you then
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
