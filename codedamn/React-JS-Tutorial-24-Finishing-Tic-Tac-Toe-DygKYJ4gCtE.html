maple and welcome to your 24th reaction
to toriel's in which i'll be completing
this tic-tac-toe game by fixing the
problem that the game is continuing even
after we have ended the game and by
implementing a very stupid and dumped
computer which just randomly picks any
square and places the tank right so
let's get started and to begin with I'm
going to move the tone and the game
ended to the game state because it kind
of makes more sense to me right there so
we can now make a very sensible
replacement here so this game state got
done and then we can say the start game
state done and this dot rather we just
don't need that this game state left
turn is equal to this thing right and if
we take a look yeah that looks fine and
then finally for game ended we do not
need that here we can pretty much just
say this game state game state game
ended is equal to true and we can just
copy it a couple of more times sir and
finally we can say that if this game
state dot game ended then just return
right so now if we click on cross circle
cross circle and cross match one by X
and we cannot play any more perfect
right so now how do we go about
implementing the CPU logic well what we
can do is that actually if we take a
look then our clicked event is kind of
perfect
once we provided this event object it
doesn't actually care if that even was
fired by a human click or a CPU right so
what we can do is instead of passing
as an event what we can say is that this
is a box to make more sense right we are
passing in a box inside which inside the
click event which box we click so I'm
going to make some replacements here I'm
going to replace even the target with
box and let's just see if we have any
other listen to make here no not really
so right here inside this dot click II I
can pass and this dot click either
target so essentially we are just
passing that reference to that box
inside this click event and now what we
can do is pretty much call the click
event ourselves for computer to fake it
right so what I can do is that since we
begin with a cross I guess right so if
this that game state dot don't is equal
to oh right that means that this time
it's the turn of CPU right now what I'm
going to do is actually generate a
random number and we're going to see if
that jet board is empty or not so we can
just place another check and say that
this game state that game ended
obviously we do not want to play if the
game has already ended so I'm going to
say do while random and this would be
math start floor and actually there's a
formula for this but for any range for
example if you want to have numbers
between 0 and 8 you can just do math the
floor mat at random times that number
plus 1 and you would pretty much get
every time the number between 0 &amp;amp; 8
right so you're going to see that we get
8 as maximum and that's the maximum
we'll get
so I'm going to say do this while this
dot games state and we have the boat
right with us so game States dot board
random is not equal to empty so
essentially what we are doing here is we
are computing a random number as long as
we do not get an empty square right so
if let's say these three squares are
filled
so if computer by chance generates
number 0 so it is already filled right
we do not want that we want to have any
number between this these 3 or you know
anything like that so we are just
looping it over so that we get an empty
box and once we have that what we can do
is say click or rather this that flipped
and I'm going to say document dot query
select through all and now we're going
to query select the square and then
we're going to pass in the random here
or what else you could have done is that
you could have selected this with data
square with the appropriate number which
is the same thing as long as we are not
messing with the Dom right so we are
passing the reference to that particular
element and we are now calling this
clicked even manually we are faking this
event from the computer side right so
now if we take a look if I hit this one
you can see that computer automatically
adds and over here this one this go with
this one
let's just say I go with this one and
this one right so the match is 1 by x
fair enough
and if I reload this one more time let's
just play one more game
Masha's again 1 by X I'm trying to draw
a match well it's hard to draw a match I
guess ok so match is 1 by oh okay so
match is thrown right so all the three
systems are working properly now what
the problem is is that the move of
computer computer stone is almost
instantaneous right so it kind of looks
laggy are not really laggy because it's
instantaneous but it kind of gives you
feel like you are not going to lose
anyhow right you're not going to win
from computer right so what we can do is
we can introduce a delay here by saying
step timeout and right here I'm going to
make use of this pattern notation so
that we do not need to take reference of
the scape this this in some other
variable and it's just that if you do
not know why I'm making use of this
pandeiro and not function it's just that
we would not be able to make use of this
this inside this set timeout without
doing something like or this backup is
equal to this and then doing this backup
right here instead of this but since
we're making use of the spatter notation
so this refers to the parent context
only and not the function one so if they
take a look now what we see is that our
action is delayed but on the other hand
user would itself have the ability to
click on the any of the box
in the time CPU is making a decision
right so we want to stop that so we all
we can do is we can create another one
inside gain state only and we can say
Gameloft based false and what we can do
is right here we can say this dot game
state dot game lock is true and right
here just before this is great we can
say game state dot game log is equal to
false and finally we can say or this dot
game state game log right so if I save
it now and I click here you can see
computer done let's don't go that Stern
or plays it's done after two seconds and
that is a lot of delays so let's just
drop it to one do you see well that's
actually one smart computer right and
you can see that the match is drawn so
and again I cannot click meanwhile the
computers making a decision right so
even if I try to you can see nothing
happens as long as computer hasn't made
a decision okay
so yep that's pretty much it for this
tutorial and this is how the game looks
like I'll leave the source code at the
link in the description so that you can
just play around with it and recommend
any improvement if you want so yeah
that's all for this one and if you liked
it then don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching I'll see you then
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
