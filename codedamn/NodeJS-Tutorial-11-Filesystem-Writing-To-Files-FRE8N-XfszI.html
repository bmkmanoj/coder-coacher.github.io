nodejs tutorial my name is maja and in
this tutorial we'll be covering about
how to write two files with nodejs file
system API so in the last tutorial we
took a look at how to do that by reading
the files and the story let's just see
how to do that by writing the files so
I'm just gonna copy and paste the same
code because we require this module and
do now instead of this what I'm gonna
write us right file now this file need
not to be there even if it is there then
it would be overwritten so if I just
change it to like file 2 and pass and
whatever I tell the text I want to write
let's just say what's up and then with
the encoding of your string go which is
the string right here so it is utf-8 and
then finally a callback function now
this function is asynchronous the right
file one so it would obviously require
you a call back otherwise this code
would be executed
you know simultaneously with this code
so it won't wait for this line won't
wait for this code to execute completely
which we already logged in the last
tutorial so I'm just gonna say the first
argument would be an error and if
there's an error then just simply throw
the error that's it and let's take a
look in the terminal alright I guess we
need to navigate first to
documents nodejs
load script m dot j s alright oh this
was script eleven okay so we got both of
these lines and if I just console.log
here as well file written so that will
make got a sense so as you can see this
code runs after this code because this
is an asynchronous function and if I
look in the files folder you can see
that there's a file to created here if I
just change this to file three and run
the same thing again in node you can see
the file 3 was created here now
similarly I can do this synchronously
which I did in the file reading and if I
just write write file synchronous and
still it would just accept this one
which is the file name and the second
one would be similarly this text which
needs to be there then finally this
encoding but you don't need this
callback function now because this is a
synchronous function so you're 100% sure
that this Court would run first and then
this one so yeah so we'll just say
console log file written as you can see
all of the lines execute in an order and
if I change this to file sync and do
that again you can see that this new
file is created with the text we have
supplied in here and that's how
basically we create basically we do
reading and writing in noches and we'll
need these concepts of nodejs
while we are creating our own
application or our own server which is a
functional server so so you need to just
keep in memory or keep in mind you have
to just keep in mind that how all of
this is working and you know the syntax
the first one is a file name then the
string you want to write on and then
then coding and you'll be good to go so
that's all what this tutorial and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
