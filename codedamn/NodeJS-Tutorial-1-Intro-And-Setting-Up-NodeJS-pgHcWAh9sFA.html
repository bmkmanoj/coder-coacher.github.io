are welcome to a first tutorial of
nodejs development so in this tutorial
I'm just gonna show you what your GS is
and pretty much why the heck would you
need that so you probably know what no
giasses because you know that's why
you're watching this tutorial but if you
don't then don't worry I've got you back
so no js' is simply as the website says
it's a JavaScript runtime built on
Chrome's weird willow blah blah whatever
so what the heck is written here well
all that the site says is that no GS is
just that JavaScript which you are used
to use right here so this javascript
some guys what they did is they took
this engine this engine on which the
JavaScript bronze took it to the server
install it there and installed other
packages and customized the JavaScript
with sweet pretty awesome syntax and
code which not only includes the
primitive JavaScript power which powers
the JavaScript engine but it also
introduces a whole lot of features and
you know it just takes your JavaScript
to another level so as it says that it's
built on a chrome v8 JavaScript engine
so if you are you know good at
javascript then you should probably not
find any major problem with all of these
tutorials in know Jesus because as the
name suggests this is just JavaScript at
the node or at the server side so to do
install that what you need is you know I
would prefer a Mac because no GS would
be a good you know development
Mack would provide a good development
area for snore gist but no just would
work equally good with Windows as well
so far the guys who are on Windows this
one's for you
so go do this no chase argh /e and slash
download and right here in your Windows
installer just download this one so yeah
so pretty much everything else would be
the next next one so that's how you
download that for this windows and for
macintosh or simply the Mac just have to
download this node V for point two point
six dot package manager I guess I
already have that yes I guess but I
guess that was a bit no yeah so it was
not a complete download okay so let me
just pause the video here for this one
to download completely and then I'll see
you so alright we are close and it's
about to finish our once it downloads
just click on that and just click on
continue continue just agree on it just
click on install type your password
alright we'll show you all of that
status and yeah so that's really much it
your nodes up and running so one way to
verify that is to scoot terminal and
right here node J s node so no just was
not the command node was it and once you
write node on arrow appears here cut off
just
let's just test it out with plain
JavaScript hello node and as you can see
it shows me hello node that means no
Geist is successfully installed so
welcome to node.js and we'll be making a
whole lot of code from node JS r would
be just exploring node.js to its limits
and I'll be there to teach you all of
that so that's all for the very first
tutorial and don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
