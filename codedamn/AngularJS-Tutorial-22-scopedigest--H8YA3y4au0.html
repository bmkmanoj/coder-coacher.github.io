angularjs tutorial in which we'll be
looking at something called digest in
angularjs now before watching this
tutorial I would recommend you to watch
my previous one if you haven't that is
the angular watch tutorial because we
will be using some concepts of that in
this one so angular digest just like
angular watch watches over a variable
update angular digest basically creates
the digest cycle which I was talking
about in the last tutorial so when you
would call angular digest what it would
do is it would actually iterate over the
watch all the watch variables so it will
check if any one of them has been
updated or not and here I'm talking
about the watches one which watched over
the way of oh well that's confusing
anyways let's take a look at it with a
simple example let's say we just found a
grand lets say my random number and down
here will give me a beer an input type
'button let's go to value of create new
random number that's it
so in the controller what we do is that
let's say I get scope dot my random
number is equal to Matt dot random and
actually I forgot that it's Matt dot ran
or random yep its random okay so it's
math dot random all right so now what we
are doing is we are just in reading a
random number and we are assigning that
to my random number which would
eventually appear in the span tag now
digest you would not actually need
digest a lot of times but it is usually
required when you start hooking up with
vanilla Geus as
in your angularjs tutorial and for those
folks who don't know what one elegy is
is that is what is vanilla Cheers
actually it is just your plain
JavaScript but you know we developers in
a fancy way called the plain JavaScript
as one elegy is anyways so the scope dot
my random number is now holding a random
value from at random now what I want to
do is I want to register a click even on
this now I could even do that with ng
click and I would just type a function
and I would create that and scope and it
would work like a charm
but for those who don't want to have the
mainstream way we have the JavaScript
available so what I'll do is I'll create
document grace selector input since we
only have one got add e when e we ent
click now let's see okay so I'll just
screw this function here only function
and obviously even bubbling should be
false so here what I'm doing is and we
just string a click eewan whenever this
button right here is click create a new
random button and obviously you know the
purpose of this button it would just
create a new random button and whenever
this is clicked a function is fast with
scoop so that we could actually access
the scope inside here and what we would
do is we would first of all let's just
console.log button click and then we
would make sure that we create a new
random number for the user simple as
that but here's the problem
now let me show you what the problem is
so here's our page let's reload this so
you see that we have got a nice little
random number here let's create on this
button so you see that we got button
click
button clicked button click button click
but hey why is the random number not
updating well the even is actually being
called the click one but the random
number is not updating but why now the
reason is this function which is being
attached as an event listener has is not
part of angular scope so angular's
digest cycle doesn't know when this
scope is updated because it's not a kind
of loop it's kind of a smart loop which
checks for registered updates so
whenever you do something with angular
the digest is automatically called by
angular for events like Ajax requests or
button clicks or anything similar but
when you are into one le jia's then what
happens is that you are working separate
from angular shears and angular G is
sometimes doesn't know that digest was
required at this time so to fix that
what we can do is we can make use of
something called as digest now to do
that inside the click even only what we
will do is this is the function here so
inside the click event I'll write scope
dot digest now dige SDF so scope digest
would actually check for any watch
cycles will actually iterate over the
world cycles and will trigger them so
let's take a look at it one more time
let's reload this okay so we have a
random number let's click on random
number dige sto okay alright so let me
give it check
okay I guess we should not pass the
scope again because it's adding already
available okay so let's reload the speed
again let's see if it works okay so this
time it worked so actually the error was
I was passing the scope again inside
this argument which I shouldn't be so
now what's happening here is that if I
remove this line again what would happen
that even if the button is clicked and
this property of the scope is updated
but remember guys that this property is
not not actually this but in this span
area you're not actually working
directly with the span area under the
hood what happens is whenever you are
updating the scope this runs a digest
cycle and the watt cycle and then only
this area's updated but inside a
JavaScript event handler angular doesn't
know that this is happening so what it
does is it does not run the digest cycle
so don't run that we make use of the
scope dot digest and once we do it we
are going to go so that's it for this
video and I hope you learned something
new from this video lesson and if you
did then don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching and I'll see you
the next time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
