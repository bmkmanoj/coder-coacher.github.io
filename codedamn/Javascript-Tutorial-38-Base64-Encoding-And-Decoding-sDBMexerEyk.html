JavaScript tutorial in which we'll be
learning about base64 encoding in
JavaScript
now base64 encoding is a kind of very
useful and special encoding because it
helps applications to transfer data
among themselves without having any
confusion in the commands and so for
example let's say let's say we have an
application a which wants to transfer
some data to application beef so what
would happen is suppose if a user at a
position says to the B position wants to
transfer the data let's say delete
delete' so for example this person at a
would like to transfer the string at B
then what it would do is it would send
the string in base64 encoded to the
speed and the reason is because for
example if he stands in the raw format
sends the string in the raw format to be
there may be some components in this
path down here these components
may consider this strain as a command to
their own server and may execute it as a
command so by using base64 we can
prevent such happenings and transport
data easily from one application to
another
now BS 64 encoding is mostly used in
applications like emails and other stuff
like encoding images into base64 URLs
schemes host protocols and all like that
so let's learn how to encode some data
in base64 now
earlier in javascript we did not have
any methods to encode and decode base64
strings but now modern browser supports
two functions known as a to b and b to a
which would help you to encode and
decode data into base64 so let's say I
have a strength strength
or maybe my strength because strength is
resolved and I love JavaScript
what a wonderful language it is so I
would like to encode this data in base64
so what I'll do is I'll write bar P 60
for any key were you like very variable
would lie right the to a my string and
let's say my unicode a to be P 64
and now it's console.log what a tease
and
really good so let's see
let's reload this
console and you can see we got a big
frame down here which is the base64
encoded version of this line down here
so if you want to verify we can copy
this and let's say A to B I'll supply
this and we get this line out as a test
so there are certain algorithms going
under the scene to convert a string into
base64 you use these two functions a to
be there yeah a to B and B to a the b2
is used to convert unicode which is our
strength in to page 64 and a to b is
used to convert the base64 back to
unicode so this is about a to B and B to
a and I'll see you then in the next
tutorial and don't forget to subscribe
