my name is Mickel and welcome to your
tenth electron tutorial and it's at time
now so we're going to create an app with
electron framework using javascript HTML
and CSS and that would be called as
crazy images I have no idea why I
haven't named that but that's I'm going
to call it so what this app would be all
about is that you can actually as a user
access a file on your computer and then
it would load up and you can grab a
bunch of editing filters and save it
back to your computer
pretty simple logic but a lot of
exciting to implement so let's get
started now before studying what I want
to do is show you how the final app
would look like so this is how it would
look like this is an actual app right so
we would be able to open a file and
let's just say I open a one which is
this electron file right which is the
thumbnail for the tutorial number one
and now we can make use of these effects
right here on the right
by increasing brightness or maybe
contrast a little saturation or maybe
just greyscale it a little bit inward it
anything like that
and then you can finally save it so that
is how pretty much this application
would work and as you can see on the
right I have already created a folder
curate the images with index dot HTML
index to chase and package the gon file
who says this is the best image editor
better than Instagram why not
because we're going to make use of css3
filters so we do not have to worry about
cross browsers as well because we're
just working for Chrome right so let's
begin so for our index dashes and one
more thing I'm going to make use of
angular for this project so that we can
create a couple of pages and route them
and accordingly apply some controller
logic
and all that good stuff so it would kind
of make our code less noisy and would
get the things done quicker so let's
begin so let's begin by importing
browser window map from electron from
right there again I'm going to say left
go to the function which would be fired
whenever our application is ready and
I'm going to stay app but on ready move
I'm going to register in my main window
here just like it pays me to do and you
can just make use of nullor
or it's up to your wish once a window is
new browser window and let's just give
it a width of 700 height of 500 and as
you can see in the final application we
did not really have the main toolbar of
the windows rights or any other
operating system as a matter of fact so
I'm going to say this is frame false
okay next thing I'm going to do is they
win that load URL which would load our
application and inside template literal
or rather string literals I'm going to
say var name now this is for Windows I'm
not gonna target Mac for now so if
you're working on Mac just make sure to
include that body color or you can just
go ahead with the relative spot only if
you wish to on Mac right now because a
dir name for is for Windows so we're
going to load index dot HTML right here
alright well that's pretty much it and
the next thing we can do is to scale web
content and open dev tools now this
would pretty much make our life easier
because this will just automatically
open developer tools
this window is created right so let's
just take a look I can go to city city
crazy images and we can I guess it's not
visible so we can say electron dot right
here and you can see that our that we
get our window which is frameless and
the developer tools are automatically
opened right cool next we have to design
our index dot HTML file so the title
doesn't really matter right now because
you just give it crazy images if you
want and then embody I'm going to say
that this is content and then finally we
need a header which would be containing
those clothes minimize and maximize
buttons so I'm going to stay just
resorption and the first one would be
maximize or minimize or whatever it is
and what I'm going to do is actually
make use of HTML entities to show that
text so I already pretty much have these
pages opened which are the Unicode
characters for heavy multiplication
which will be making use of as cross so
this would be HTML entity for
multiplication which would be our close
button and for maximized we're gonna
make use of this one and for minimize
we're gonna make you love this one right
so yep and then finally if we take a
look what we have got you can see that
we got these three buttons right in
place but a little bit mess around
because that should be full width and
they should be together right so let's
just fix that I'm gonna create another
file which is style dot CSS and inside
our index dot HTML lists imported
just like that and for standard CSS
let's ask you some margin:0 padding:0
box styling water box I'm resetting and
then we can say that our header is
display flex and I guess before doing a
I guess that will flex direction would
be roll reverse you want that in row and
on the right justify contend the it
doesn't actually require but we can just
give it and I'm going to say this is
WebKit out region drag so that we can
just make it draggable right and for now
we can display a background of black for
the options we can say this this padding
of 10 6 to 25 pixels which would be
padding left top top left bottom or
whatever it is like I'm always confused
in this order it's something like top
right then bottom is again 10 and then
left or I don't know I have to see that
order but anyways so we have got the
option here just to the font size of 40
pixels cursor:pointer and I do know one
these to be intractable so no drag and
then finally just like we created our
toolbar earlier we can take background
with for now so if we take a look you
would see that we get this looks good
but this is say color wise to this will
be all set
so yep we are done with our header not
really because we are missing these
functionalities and this kind of looks
way big then I thought
so let's just draw a 30 ad or maybe 25
would be good yeah okay so that is not
very much we get started with our app
and we have completed not really
completed because the functionality is
still missing from the stool bar but
more or less we are close to completion
of header and that is all for the story
and the next one I'm gonna continue with
the toolbar and developing the main app
so if you like that then don't forget
subscribe and thank you for watching and
see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
