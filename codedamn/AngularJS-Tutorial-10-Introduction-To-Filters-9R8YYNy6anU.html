angularjs tutorial and in this tutorial
we'll be learning something called
filters in angularjs so filters as you
expect are valid deep in concept than
what we'll be learning in this tutorial
but it's always necessary to have a
basic knowledge of what we are working
with so let me reduce you to filters in
angularjs and filters are nothing much
but simply a way of formatting your
output nicely on the screen so for that
to demonstrate that let me create a
simple app in angular let's see it
accepts just your name let's say
ng-model this should be binded to
and down here let's say
welcome
name all right so
here's the browser on the three load
this lets say alright mail here and
we are good to go so now let's say I
want this to be capitalized
automatically wherever I type anything
right here so what I can do is I'll
write this thing my default one I'll
write a pipe and this pipe is on my
keyboard is just above Enter
but located it's a straight line it's
not I it's a pipe symbol and after
typing that I'll type my filter which in
this case is just uppercase the
uppercase is a filter which would turn
this text in uppercase so when I reload
this you see that welcome is already
turned into uppercase and if I want this
into lowercase then I have to move this
outside
R
expression of angularjs and now let's
reload this and let's say this thing now
even though I'm typing everything in
small you notice that it appears
capitalized similarly we have some
filters like lowercase let's reload this
and now you can see even uppercase
alphabets are appearing in lowercase
then we have so got something called
currency 1 so
let's say I change it to price
price here and a right currency
so I'll reload this i'lli'll right den
so see that it's automatically formatted
as a currency and a dollar sign is
appended in front of it but we could
actually modify the currency symbol as
well so let's see if I want instead of
dollar I want to B's so I'll just write
rupees because I don't have it this
symbol right now to copy and paste here
let's reload this and now as you can see
we get the output and rupees now what I
don't want the decimal to be there so we
can do this
I'll just type a column again and places
of decimals I want to show when stance I
want to show zero decimal places or hide
decimals so I'll write zero and you see
that there's no decimal appearing now if
I change it to five save and reload then
you see that there are five decimal
places appearing now by default it
fallbacks to do
so if you don't specify any value with
world and show you just two decimal
places
okay so
the next thing we have is I guess it's
number it's pretty much like currency
but it does not add or remove any signs
or whatever so it would pretty much work
like a regular formatted number with the
same flag you can specify with the
number of decimals by default and it
would just format your number nicely to
show the decimals as well and if I
change it to five you see there oops
then we have got a number like this so
that's um pretty much not the advanced
level of filters and angular but yeah
you have successfully learned the basics
of filters in angularjs so that's it it
wasn't hard was it so that's it for
filters for this tutorial and we'll be
exploring filters more in angularjs in
further tutorials and still till then
stay tuned with me don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
