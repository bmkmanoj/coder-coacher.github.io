May ho and welcome to your I guess first
tutorial for natural language processing
chatbots and if you have fallen along my
last series of creating messenger chat
BOTS what we did and that series was
pretty boring we just created a script
file and noches API endpoint which just
listens for Facebook calling your chat
board and just returns responses based
on some hard-coded strings or maybe our
regular expressions which kind of mimics
a child word brain but not really so to
actually create powerful chat BOTS what
we need is to harness the power of
artificial intelligence and that is in
this expect the natural language
processing or NLP as people say so we're
gonna not start off NLP from the very
basics because it's quite complicated
field its mathematical and you've gotta
learn all those sort of algorithms and
all that stuff so what we're gonna make
use of is something known as you can
call NLP out of service
why not because this is essentially the
same thing so wit dot AI was acquired by
Facebook in 2015 and these guys what
they do is that they sit in the middle
not really in the middle this hit the
back right and you can send whatever you
get from Facebook to these guys and
essentially that's not even the case
because with Facebook you can seamlessly
integrate with your there so let's say
if you're developing a chat bot for some
company X right
not for messenger so what would you do
is that you get the text from the
company X you send that text to wit dot
AI with that AI based on the model you
have trained with your data would return
you the Chaisson of you know
everything's formatted like what these
were asking about what the users talking
about
and all the things separated like phone
number email ID everything based on your
data but processed by wits
engine right so you can use that easily
in your response you can parse the data
send appropriate response to the user
and accordingly when the internet so
yeah so essentially in this quick web
series we're going to take a look at is
how to build smart chat BOTS with a
natural language processing and that is
that pretty much and if you liked it
then don't forget subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the second tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
