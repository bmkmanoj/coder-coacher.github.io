PHP tutorial I'm a whole ad and this
tutorial will be looking at how you can
create your own Global's now in the last
tutorial I told you about that we have
something called super Global's but the
good news is that you can create your
own Global's as well so to do that what
you can do is you can make use of this
Global's associative array and assign
the key as a variable name and then the
value here now this is accessible
everywhere in your script obviously I
would like to keep the variable lemurs
like that so i'll just change it to
let's say my war ok so now let's just
create a function quickly to see that
even if it works or not echoed this
close enough and if i use echo Global's
my war then it should probably work if I
remember it right so if i call this echo
dysfunction down here and here's my page
let's reload this ok so you see that we
got the output as 100 right here so how
did not be in a global variable let's
see if it were just in my war and here
then you obviously know now that what
would be the output you see nice output
so that's how you can create your own
global variables in PHP and we'll be
looking at the ones I'd talked about
acha the super Global's in my coming
tutorials so that's it for this tutorial
and don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
