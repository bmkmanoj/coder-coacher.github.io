May ho and welcome to your fifth
electron tutorial in which we're going
to take a look at a deeper look at this
hello world and how this is actually
working right and a couple of fixes as
well to this program so starting off to
the first line what we have is the
actually this is es6 stuff but I can
just explain it in a minute what's
happening so let's say if you have an
object something like prop 1 is some
value or some function or whatever it is
brought to something else so instead of
doing something like a constant brought
1 is equal to object dot dropped 1 then
doing constant prop 2 is equal to object
dot prod to what we can do if you know
that you want to keep the names similar
to the property name and that property
name actually exists as well inside
object you can simply do constant drop
one prop 2 is equal to object so it's
more or less kind of syntactic sugar
only it's es6 or I guess life I don't
remember actually but it's quite quite
well supported and implemented and
obviously for electron you can obviously
use that so anyways well what we can do
with this is actually since this is no
stuff so this would just pretty much
copy if electron is an object something
like electron and then we have something
like the Abdulla function or whatever it
is goes in here so we just got this app
inside this app variable which we are
using here and browser window inside
that browser window variable which you
have is doing here right so and
obviously the order does not matter
because these are actually the property
names right so what we can do is make
you look them like that the next thing
we have in the URL which we are making
use here but actually we do not need
this as well you can just get rid of
this and you can pretty much simply say
file
and then you can say that this is your
directory name and again this is just a
string literal which is pretty much
similar to let me just complete the fat
first right so this line and this line
is similar right you can just make use
of single quotes and then just append it
like that so you can use either one of
those but this kind of does not break
your code so I kind of like this one
right and we do not need to worry about
cross cross browser platform or anything
like that because it's just running on
Chrome weird okay so now we have loaded
our window now another thing what the
documentation suggests is that make use
of wind as your global variable right
now the reason for that is that the
electrons in the background and node in
the background are constantly running
garbage collectors to collect unused
variables or you know what which
electron or no thing are no longer used
by the program and if you have no global
variables if you have a window which is
not global then electron might just
simply remove it and your window white
unexpectedly closed without you
realizing right and you might spend
hours figuring out that while your
window sometimes closes and sometimes
not right so yeah that's one thing okay
so the other thing is that as I told you
in the next is the last video that we
are inside main process right so what we
can do is I can simply say console or
process type and hit save and let's see
in terminal what that means so I'm going
to type electron dot and we get hello
electron but the specs enable logging
hit enter right
so we have abdominal fear
okay um this is not actually what I was
expecting but just wait about let me try
with get Bosch and see what works right
so I don't know there's some problem
where the windows bmd but right here we
see that we get browser as the
console.log for process type right and
what if I try to do something like
script console.log process type here
right and if I rerun this and if I start
the developer tools which is by a
control shift and I or command shift for
you you see that we get renderer here
instead of browser right so that is how
pretty much you can see that this
process is running in renderer and this
one in browser or what we call as main
process so that is how pretty much a
simple electron up works and yeah that's
all for this one and if you liked it
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
