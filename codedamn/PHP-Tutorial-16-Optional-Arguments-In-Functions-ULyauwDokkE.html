PHP tutorial in which will be learning
about something called optional
arguments in functions and the last
tutorial we looked at how you can pass
arguments instead of function and make
use of it to create dynamic results
every time with different kinds of
arguments but in this tutorial we'll
make use of something called optional
arguments now let's say you want to
create a function which ad most ads 3
number but add hour at most ads phone
number but at minimum are at least two
numbers so let's say if i type a b c and
d and i right echo a plus B plus C plus
D now what happens is or I guess I
forgot to give it a name add this so
what happens is if I'd I've add this one
two three four if I view in the browser
so it will give me 10 which is four plus
three plus two plus one but the problem
arises when we supply less arguments
then there are so it gives us an error
or not an error but a warning so to fix
that what you can do is you could
actually make the arguments optional and
by making arguments optional is that if
the value is not supplied in the calling
of the function you could give it a
default value when this function is
called so how to do that well let's say
if d is not called then assign a the
default value of zero if C is not in the
argument then assign it the default
value of zero if B is not in the
argument assignment a default value of
zero and if a is not in the argument
assign it a default value of zero so
let's see what happens now when I reload
this no more errors because a B and C
are present these values
000 are not used the values which are
being called the calling of the function
are used if a bee are present then we
get 3 and these values are not used so
even if these are used then plus 0 plus
0 doesn't make any difference and if I
call just one then only one will get and
if I don't call anything at all then
we'll get 0 but with nothing with no
default value will surely pop up into
some errors as you can see so you see
that it makes a difference by supplying
some optional some default values to the
arguments and these arguments are called
optional arguments obviously and let's
say I must share this trick with you
let's see you want to have a variable
number of arguments let's say you want
to add numbers as long as there are
arguments so let's say I've on one two
three four five six seven a are all
these numbers to be added together and I
want one two three all these numbers to
be added together again so you can
create a long list of arguments and set
everything to zero so in PHP what we
have is something known as a default
variable argument will make use of
something called variable-length
arguments to you know actually pass
multiple arguments so let's take a look
let's say I want to create a function
which would be something like this only
which accepts variable-length argument
let me just fix these
okay so we are good to go now let's say
I want to have a lot of numbers but I
don't know how many numbers the user
would pass so what I'll do is I'll type
three dots and an argument let's say my
nums now what this is this is something
new in PHP 5.6 this was not available
before but this is now a variable
argument so it would accept as many
arguments as you want it to so let's see
how it works now inside the loop
function body what i can do is i can
make you the for each because my nums is
actually an array of arguments so I'll
what I'll users my numbs as number just
like we used to do in the eris RL do is
sum is equal to sum plus number and here
i would initialize some 20 so now you
can see the things happening so what's
happening here is we are first of all
sending n number of arguments here this
these all arguments are converted into
one single array of any type then we are
initializing a variable to 0 then we are
running a for each loop my nums as
number then we are adding that to some
and then we are echoing the Sun so now
let's reload this okay
alright i guess i don't have a ph beef
5.6 maybe
oh this is like this
oh okay so i have PHP version 5.5 point
15 so if you have downloaded our latest
version of PHP because i have the zamp
from like 100 half year also so if you
have a latest version of PHP which is
5.6 or above then this code would work
like a charm but it's not working in my
case because I have an older version of
zamp so I guess I could show you guys by
uploading this file on server so let's
see ok so i guess my Internet's not
working right now well no worries i'll
show you guys how these flights working
later on you could even try this
yourself but this will surely work these
three dots means variable arguments
because i have worked on a lot of
servers and i've used this thing a lot
but Adam knew that my own local host is
not five point it's five point five
point one five so this should be 5 point
6 or above then this code would work
like a charm so I'll fix this up and
I'll show you how it works soon maybe in
the next tutorial so that's it for this
tutorial and I'll see you then next time
