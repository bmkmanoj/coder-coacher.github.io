11th angularjs tutorial in which we'll
be learning about an interesting thing
in angular which is a directive and it's
called ng-include now what it does is it
would rather help you to split up all of
your coding instead of coding everything
in one file it would help you to
organize the different controller
sections for different parts of a
document in various different files so
let's say you have a document which has
a header you can see advertisement here
gone dent area one on the navigation
content-area a slide bar and all the
stuff and a footer so instead of coding
everything like expressions and your
controllers and JavaScript objects
initializers everything in one single
file we can split it up in ways
different files for example if you have
ever done with PHP or any server-side
language then we have suicide includes
for PHP like PHP include your file dot
PHP or dot v dot HTML or whatever
similarly angular makes it very easy to
include various kinds of different files
on the client-side itself by obviously
initiating an urge ax request to that
file
okay so now let's take a look how we can
do that
so I'll create a simple file here which
just says hello world text nothing much
I'll save it as dummy file dot HTML
right here you see and right here what
I'll do is I'll type div ng-include
dummy file dot HTML and make sure to
include your files inside single quotes
as well or the opposite that you're
using single quotes outside and double
quotes inside because since it's a file
angular needs to know that it's a single
file so here's my browser let's reload
this nothing
much appears so let's check what went
wrong and in the console we have got
that all right so Ajax request is not
permitted on the filed domain so I need
to figure out to move this to my local
host
give me a sick
all right so I moved
my discord right here in an angular Agia
store HTML file under my local host and
this dummy file as well with that and we
got this nice little hello world message
so if I click on new page source then
you see that the code is pretty much
same what we wrote here so this this
ng-include directive what it does is if
you look in the console it initiates in
a Jack's request with a get as a get
request and if you see in the network
area then you'll find that here it is
the Jack's request which is the local
host obviously on board ad and you can
find all that information from here so
ng-include using engine code you can
just separate all of your controllers
say you're writing a big large script
for your header file all that stuff all
that thing's whatever that you want to
use and you could mention all the
controllers in a single script file say
controllers dot j s and mention all the
controllers for your scripts even for
the good that you're going to include
and it would work just like you are
doing a server-side include to a file so
that's it about
Miller's ng-include directive and in the
future we would be replacing this
ng-include with programmatically
including a file from the controller
itself so that's it for this stay tuned
with me don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
