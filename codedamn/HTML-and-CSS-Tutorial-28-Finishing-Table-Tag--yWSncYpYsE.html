28 HTML and CSS tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be creating a fancy table
and would be styling it with CSS so that
the table and all its tags and the
attributes we might be using are
completely valid in html5 document so
let's say we want to create a table on
let's say you want do okay so let's say
we want to gather all the information
about browsers their engines and their
number of users worldwide so let's see
how we create that so before starting
with this tutorial I would like to
introduce you to three another tags
inside the table tag and those are T
head T body and T foot so these three
tags are incredibly useful because when
you are working with large table sets
then these would provide you the
categorization of your header of the
table the last line the footer of the
table and the body of the table you are
writing the content in so let's see how
to do that so first of all we'd write T
head so T head would technically mean
all the staff which would be the header
of the table
so let's say I create a table row which
would be obviously one only and I close
the table crow and inside the data I say
the browser name whoa
I guess I spelled it wrong BR o WS ER
name and the TD would be closed then I
want the table data the next one to be
the users online on that browser and the
next thing I would like to have is the
engine of browser so now if I reload
this right here oh I'm still on 27 you
see I'm Lizzie and if I reload this
right here then I just see ugly long
string of these three words or maybe six
or maybe seven by two cares so now let's
add some more data to this table and
since we are done with that T head we'll
just close it down here and would start
T body now T body would signify that we
are working with the body now and the
head is closed so all the information we
needed in the top
Rowe is in the tea head so now let's
write something in tea body
let's give it TR and let's close the TR
one and first of all let's go with
Google Chrome ok so the browser name is
Google Chrome and keep matching that
then the users online I don't know
that's just enough approximate guess
maybe 500 million plus I really don't
know so the next thing we have is the
engine of the browser and I guess Google
after the recent update its using blink
ancient previously it was on WebKit but
now it's on blink so this information is
about 1 browser and let's copy and paste
that a bit so let's say 4 would go let's
mozilla firefox 500 let's give it 300
and let's say it's working on gecko and
what next I eat
and ie has more users than you think so
let's say a hundred million
it's a rough guess
and ie works on trident dr ID ENT and
this is Microsoft engine but let's say
to ignore this because that would make
it a bit long so the next browser the
next module we have let's say opera and
a para maybe a hundred million as well
and opera works blink or WebKit let me
think
Oh Pyrrha was actually on blink actually
yeah opera is on blink so we have got
five browsers in our data set and now
let's see it on the browser so this kind
of looks like a table bit but it's not a
table
so now let's in the Styles first of all
create something so let's say table dr
and let's give it th actually so that
the headings kind of becomes bold
automatically so here we go
TR th and that's pretty much everything
and TDS don't sorry Alice could have
rather off two pixels solid black let's
reload and we are good to go we have got
our border and that's pretty much stuck
but never mind
okay so now let's customize the
individual elements so let's say we've
got the edge
and I want it to be font style and just
go through the commands I'm typing the
properties because there are many many
properties in CSS and even to lid I can
say to you honestly I don't even know
all the properties of CSS I'm always
learning with you guys and so you are
let's write font-style:italic and this
would technically convert your phone too
italics I italic style give your phone
to italic style and that's pretty much I
want in the header okay so let's make
some changes to this let's say I want
color white to header and in the tea
head now that's why tea hair is useful
because now we are actually customizing
let's give a tea heritage customizing
the header header background and
everything inside the header differently
from the body and let's say I give it a
background of black let's say black
and okay so let's see how it looks and
okay not bad but not good as well so the
next thing I need is to reduce that damn
spacing so border spacing should be zero
pixel I don't want it to add any default
spacing in the border and now we have
got a dark border so let's reduce the
border to a pixel let's reload this and
we have got a nice water now and now
let's just increase the font size a
little bit
it's a font size the font size would
actually increase your font size by the
amount of pixels you specify would set
the font size to that let's reload I
guess that's very specified lower than
the default so let's give it 20 and by
default let's say font family the font
family would accept a font name and
would apply that font to all your
selectors are down in the selectors as
well so font families inheritable
so let's reload this and we have got a
nice Cali berry font and since calabrese
already installed in my computer I can
just use it directly and the round way
to use non installed fonts in your web
would be I I would be teaching them in
the future tutorials so now we have God
these three let's create some kind of
border to separate this and let's say
where we have the th yeah right here
sit border right should be let's say two
pixels solid
now I remember a bunch of colors because
I have been coding from a while so this
would be a little whitish type it's
appearing right here as well so I don't
want it to appear on the last DD so what
I'll do is what I can do actually I
could add a class no butter and I'll
just do not know border border zero to
be more specific let's refresh and we
have got rid of that border and let's
add a little bit of padding as well to
the th padding left now in the last
tutorial I told you about batting now
padding 10 pixel means that apply
padding 10 pixel in every direction so
let's say if you want to give a padding
only in a particular direction so what
you'll do is padding left you have got
padding left to apply padding to the
left
only you have got padding top to apply
on top right and bottom so the order it
works like if I do like 10 pixel zero
then pixel zero so it means apply
padding 10 pixel to top D that means
that then Excel padding should be
applied to top then a space to separate
the value than zero to the left then 10
pixel to the right 10 pixel to the
bottom sorry and then zero to the right
so this is like top value
left value bottom value right value and
you could independently apply this value
with using panning left padding right
palek right actually padding-bottom and
batting what a left top yeah so instead
of using these four lines of code we
just make use of one and if you want to
give all of these a same value then we
use make use of just one value and it
would automatically apply on all of the
rest so let's give it a bearing lift of
10 pixel and let's see what's the result
are so now we have got a 10 pixel
padding left on each of the th and I
would like to have a padding right of 15
pixels and padding bottom of five pixel
padding top of five pixel and that's
pretty much it and I could just reduce
these three lines to five pixels
zero 15 pixels five pixels zero five
pixel and 15 pixel let's just remove
these three unless reload this okay so
barring top is five left
there should be sorry right left top
right bottom left whoa
that's embarrassing top right bottom out
left let's reload and here we need top
right bottom whoa
so that's finally it and here we go and
I guess I should apply a little bit
padding to left as well so that it looks
nice let's say five pixel only let's
reload this and we are good to go so now
our heading is ready let's customize the
TRS now in the body section
let's give it a class of the alternate
classes like all to class let's say now
this is one two then three skip three
then for alt
let's say now to tbody G adult
background should be gray color should
be white let's reload this and alternate
on the alternate basis we have got white
and gray background s colors and by
default I would like to have background
should be I love the old point so that
it doesn't all right light gray and
color should be white let's reload this
and we have got light gray and let's
keep a color black and why the heck I'm
just scroll down to the bottom of the
file every time I click I'll see you do
it let's reload this and looks good so
we can actually apply a little bit
pairing to the tdys as well d body TR TD
Barrington pixel pretty much it and now
we have a nice little table which gives
us some information about the browser
its users online and the engine the
browser is using so that's how we pretty
much create a table in HTML and always
remember that we are just doing tables
in HTML just for organizing the data are
not creating the web pages layouts
themself so that was a small little
tutorial series on tables and from the
next tutorial onwards will be again
starting with some new and awesome HTML
and CSS stuff so till then stay tuned
with me and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
