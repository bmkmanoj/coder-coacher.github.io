Minho and welcome to your 33rd Android
application development tutorial in
which I'm gonna transform this crap into
data in this application by just putting
title here content here image URL here
and this image one would might be a
tricky one because we need to download
this image and for that we need to make
use of HTTP client which we haven't seen
till now and wouldn't be seen for this
video for this application at least so
I'm gonna make use of something known as
this Picasso library and it makes it
super easy to load images into image
view by a URL so yeah so that's all for
this image one and we'll just take a
look at that later on how we would work
with it so let me just get back to our
point and start coding something so I'm
gonna say that I want to chase one
object request and remember that we are
still working in this button so yeah
okay so I guess we can now move outside
this but we don't need that so let me
just take out this bottom as well and
just make this full size just like
before so okay now moving back to my
main activity I'm gonna say that just so
an object my request is new JSON object
request request dot method method dot
get right the second one would be our
URL HTTP localhost for now and it's not
gonna work I know and I'll just tell you
in a moment why then we need a JSON
object or JSON request so we're just
gonna
pass it out now then we need a listener
for listener I'm going to say this is
new response response dot listener right
and this would be off JSON object and
then there's a function and then I'm
also gonna say that I have a new not new
new response dot error listener and this
will just listen for our errors right so
in here I'm gonna write whoa what the
heck is that
I'm gonna write all right method with on
response and right here this would be
override method on error response right
so now we have access to the response as
a JSON object so that makes our life a
lot a hell lot of easy so I'm gonna say
and actually I'm gonna first say that
JSON array then I'm gonna say my array
let's just say this allows new items his
response dot get response not get GA
Suen re and then I'm gonna pass in the
array name which I want to get and the
reason I separated it is that we have
this last ID as well so if we would
develop this application mature enough
to show a lot more once you scroll down
all these news items then we would make
use of this last I need to somehow get I
don't know I don't really remember how
and why did I quote this but it's sort
of required for the next IDs and you
make use of that using something like
this only so what I'm gonna do here is
space news items and now we have access
to new items right so I'm gonna say for
int I equals 0
eyes less than news items darlin
and then I plus plus and then finally
I'm gonna say JSON object temporary is
news items dot get JSON object and I so
it's just gonna give us access to
ordered object in which order they are
so the first one would be the a zero
would give us access to the first object
then I one would second and so on and
it's just asking me to throw in this
thing into a try block so just do that
though why the heck wait right so now
I'm gonna say catch JSON exception II
and pretty much just say e dot print
strap stacktrace
you could also just lock that if you
want to now what I'm gonna do and why
the heck is still read okay so looks
like you need to take that as well cool
now it's pretty easy now I just need to
retrieve data I'm gonna say string title
equals temporary dot get string and then
what we have is titled as the name here
so I'm just gonna copy this one two
three four five six times one two three
four five six then image would be the
first one Oh image then we have time
then we have date then we have content
then we have a link as well so what I'm
gonna do is just pretty much
based these things here only so now we
have access to or actually we have
stored all that raw information from
here to in our actual Android code so
what we need to do is I this little
thing and say right here like that and
say that a news item dummy news 1
instead say title then funny right
actually I have the other news
description right so news description
would be the content then for what we
have is date so date then we have time
then we have what was this URL okay URL
what we have as link and then we need to
edit this thing right so a news item we
are gonna say that this is again a
string image URL string like that and a
couple of more fixes get image URL right
there
this should be straight as well okay so
now what happens is that we are pretty
much just adding stuff into our news
feed and do we have any errors yes we do
because we have no image now so what I'm
gonna do is right now I'm just gonna say
this to our dot map map
I see launcher for now so that for the
sake it just works so if I try it out in
the emulator now and see how everything
is looking its just installing apk and
launching activity so oh okay
so a news feed looks blank so is there
any sort of thing going on let's see oh
okay
stupid me I haven't actually even
created a cue for this no that's really
stupid of me
so this is requests q Q equals wall-e
got new request queue and you can just
give it me activity like this or simply
this for now because we are in oncreate
method and not an on click now so
finally I'm gonna say that this is huge
add then this is my request right there
so now let's just see what's happening
well well well oh yeah obviously I told
you that this won't work and the reason
why this won't work is that I'm gonna
show you right now our application is
running on localhost itself so gain
emotion what it does is that it would it
would kinda restrict access to this
localhost because it's running on itself
so it gives our localhost which is the
webserver localhost a new IP address and
that is I guess if I remember it
correctly it's ten point zero point
three point one and what this would do
actually we could just test it out even
ten point zero point three point one yep
looks like
it's the one so all right
doesn't look like it's 100 K so it's I
guess ten point zero point three point
two yep so now you can see it's loaded
with zamp
because zamp is what as I'm running
right now on my PC so if I even was at
localhost on my browser it would just
show me Sam barley so I can see that
localhost of this is not actually 127
point zero point zero point one off on
my phone it's actually ten point zero
point three point two and don't worry
about this because this thing has been
done by Jenny motion and in real life
application you would be actually just
writing a code here instead of an IP
address so you don't need to worry a lot
about that so what I'm gonna do yeah I'm
just gonna change this to two like there
then hit the Run button and probably
fingers crossed so see what the heck
again so did we get
okay so i just laug it over the filter
my tag my tag then either to string and
then run it
oh do we have a problem here
let's see
response kills me oh this looks like
it's still running our older version of
core and this really gets on my nose why
the heck is it running old code so that
is stupid that is really stupid so let
me just is it first application no it's
actually newsreader right so you need to
do that to a news reader application and
here we go
and this is really insane so looks good
now let's just see what happens let me
just clear this out okay so let's see
all right so looks like it's done but
pretty much it looks messy because of
the description because it's way too
large then it's supposed to be so it
kind of works but we're just gonna clean
up it a little bit and add images as
well in the next tutorial so if you like
