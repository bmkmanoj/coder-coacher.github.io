your 13th HTML and CSS tutorial in which
we'll be learning about fonts in HTML
now forms are pretty much like container
holders to crap useful information in an
organized way from user and pass it on
to some scripts or basically pretty much
you would like to your server side to
handle so whenever you basically log in
into a site like your gmail account or
YouTube account or Facebook Twitter then
you are actually entering your email ID
and password or whatever you enter in a
form supplied by that side so let's take
a look what forms are I'll just open
encounter tab so that you don't see my
Facebook account
let's visit Facebook so here you what
you see is a kind of a simple form
example or basically to be more precise
this one now this signup form is a form
from Facebook which allows you to enter
your first name your last name email
your password all that stuff so in next
couple of tutorials are many more we
would be learning how to create such
forms with these checkboxes and
dropdowns these radio buttons are all
that stuff and all these input boxes how
these text is converted into dots so in
this tutorial I was just giving you an
intro to what forms are and what is
their usage so that's all for this
tutorial
I'll see you there thanks for watching
