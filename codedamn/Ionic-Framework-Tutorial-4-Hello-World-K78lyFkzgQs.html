and welcome to your fourth ionic
tutorial in which I'll be showing you
how to create a simple blank template
for your ionic project now well these
templates like these for instance these
simple templates looks fancy and they
look cool as well but what happens is
that to learn something you need to
start from the scratch down so yes I
could apparently explain each and
everything right here but you know that
doesn't would that wouldn't just make a
connection to ionic so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna start off with a blank
activity or a blank template you can see
in this case and for that I already have
the terminal open and running so what
I'm gonna do is for now just quit out
from here and I'm gonna go a directory
back and just like we created this one
the hello world folder I'm gonna say
ionic start and let's just name our
application this one would be hello
world application and in front of it
right blank because if you don't write
anything then this world
I guess automatically fall back to the
tabs template which we have been using
right now so it would again create that
same template so hit enter and wait for
it
so it saves me that it is downloading
the repository or start the zip file
from github so we are almost done all
right another one okay
all right so we are done now it again
asked me for this account I already have
one so I'm going to say no and if I just
do a dir you can see we have hello world
application so let's just say hello
world application and let me just write
pike serve and hit enter so it started
off with a blank starter as you can see
now this looks much better than the taps
one because it gives us the option to
learn something actually so what I'm
gonna do next is I'm gonna open another
folder right here which is this
application so if I can get the borders
right here we go here's the page inside
here if I just look at the index dot
HTML file we pretty much see almost
nothing except this one so what an ik
does is that it comes with the pre-built
sort of these styles and what we call
them as the directives yeah so these are
the directives in angular so ionic comes
with a lot of those and the custom
styles as well
so it would allow you to basically just
get started with your application
without just getting mist and you know
dissolved into some JavaScript code or
CSS even for writing your application so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go back
to ionic documentation ionic framework
right there let me just scale that up a
little bit and not this one actually and
just go to this Docs and right here what
I'm gonna do is
overview no not really actually we are
done with all real CSS components yeah
so this page right there shows you that
ionic has a lot of CSS components
pre-built for you so that you can just
pick them up into your application and
start using them right away so this is
these are the sort of pre-built CSS
components and sort of JavaScript code
available for you like them and for
example if you just want to create a
list then we have something else some
sort of demos as well I don't know where
they were
but there are some sort of here you can
just try it try them out so what I'm
going to do for now yes we do have the
starting header so we need sort of
content so let's just say I'm gonna
create this simple button let's just say
this
Ezard button so I'm gonna go into ion
content and paste this right there so
this button is gonna say hello world and
you might notice that since we have gulp
reading are ready and running in the
background on the terminal as well so
once I save this code right there you
can see that it automatically updates
without letting me reload this thing
again and again
so that's gull for you and yeah you can
see that the changes are logged as well
so you can again go ahead and try out
some sort of coding here well this is
not a lot of fancy stuff we are doing
right now but it's good for a star so
and see that we got these buns right
there ready and if you face any sort of
problems somehow
and you can just leave a comment so for
example if I just copy this whole code
right here and paste it right here and
go back here you can see that it sort of
gives me a nice little menu option and
just imagine that how nice it would look
if I scale it down to a size of compile
so this looks so user friendly and so
good on a mobile phone so that's the
plus point of ionic you can just make
use of your technologies which you love
and which with which you work to code
your Android applications as well and
yeah so that's ionic for you guys and if
you like this tutorial then don't forget
to subscribe and in the next tutorial
we'll be starting off with some real
serious code with ionic and angular as
well so yeah so thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
