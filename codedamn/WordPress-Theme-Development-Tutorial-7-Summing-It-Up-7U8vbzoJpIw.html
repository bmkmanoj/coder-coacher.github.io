and welcome to your yet another
WordPress theme development tutorial and
in this tutorial what I'm gonna do is
that I'm gonna pretty much wrap up
everything which I actually wanted to
teach you because ya know this is not
the end of the series actually so what
this tutorial is all about is that I
just realized that you know there are a
lot of files in WordPress to discuss
about and a lot a lot of functions and
hooks and all that stuff to discuss
about so it's gonna take us centuries to
do that and eventually we would miss on
the fun part that is to team code code
the teams and actually view them on the
browser so that kind of looks cool well
to do that what I'm gonna do instead is
that I'm gonna start developing a team
from the next tutorial onwards and in
this tutorial I'm gonna wrap it up and
discuss a bunch of stuff which you can
do and pretty much let's get started so
first of all I want to pretty much get
rid off this localhost / WP and write
something interesting like my cool team
dot-com and something like that and this
would pop up now obviously you don't
need to buy a domain for that because if
you are on a computer you can do that
for your computer also and not also
actually but you for your computer only
so to do that first of all open any text
editor I am using notepad plus plus just
go to ok so I'm already there so what
how you have to go there just go to your
C Drive zamp 7 then go to a patch
configuration extra and then there
you'll file this file httpd we host
configuration then what you have to do
is just pick up any one of these and if
you don't find these because probably
you would just find this one because I
have added all of these myself so I
guess so if you don't find any of these
then pause
the video after a few seconds to see
what you have to write here so just
change this virtual host this looks cool
and change this document rule to sees
am7 htdocs and not go down but actually
WB which is the name of the path the
path name which refers to your directory
which you want accessible then so one
name would be the name that you want to
have as a calling name on your browser
which would just load files from this
path behind the scenes so I'm gonna say
this is let's say team.com and here we
go now once you have done with that just
open again and go to C Drive then go to
windows system32 go to drivers wherever
that go to
drivers yes we are in drivers then wait
a minute
was it drivers okay he looks like yeah
so this etcetera folder is hidden inside
here so this is the complete path you
have to go to that is see windows
system32 drivers etc and there you'll
find this file host just open this file
and at the very last just right one
twenty seven point zero point zero point
one and in front of it write the name of
the server which you wrote right there
and see is that the file cannot be saved
as it may have been predicted so just
launch it administrator mode and if
you'd save that happily and make sure
the steam comm matches exactly with what
are you whatever you have written right
here all right so once you're done with
that just restart your server once and
pretty much just go to theme calm now
and you'll be good to go so you can see
that our website is live on theme calm
so we have done that stuff and the next
thing go to you're probably I guess I
have forgotten what my username and
password was I guess username was Mabel
and password was me well as well
username is correct but phosphorus so
I'm gonna show you how you can reset
your password from PHP myadmin
actually so this might be handy as well
if you even actually forget your only
single account password and you are kind
of locked out but actually you aren't so
just go to your WP database in PHP
myadmin
go to users and for your security what
WordPress does is it does not save the
passwords in plain text so even if you
know your database is compromised
or your only your database is
compromised not your code servers so the
attackers would not be able to log into
your users account using this encrypted
passwords so even if the code base is
actually compromised then also they
won't be able to log it into the
accounts because these are sort of
one-way hashing algorithms and Kara it's
a lot difficult to retrieve the original
password back from these algorithms and
Gaurav you know impossible you can say
for now so what we are gonna do instead
is that the scanner doesn't look like
md5 but what press do support still do
support md5 so you just go to google and
type md5 encryption online just type
that you can actually do that in PHP as
well with a simple function but anyways
I'm just gonna make use of a tool right
here so I'm gonna say let's just say my
password would be me hole also so just
encrypt this you can see that I get md5
as this thing just copy this exactly
and inside user pass just replace that
with md5 and then log in with me hole
pretty sweet now you're good to go now
probably WordPress would again change
this encryption the md5 encryption
algorithm to its own one because what
press is using a more secure one so you
no need to worry about that well at
least we have got our count back so now
if you go to themes and pretty much if I
activate like 2015 you'll see that we
get something like widgets menus header
background blah blah with that but if i
activate my team you can see I don't get
pretty much anything why is that well
that's a topic for some another tutorial
but what I wanted to show you in this
tutorial was the files so so far what we
have
look dad is this function stop PHP and
the name of the file you can read and
you know as a caption sort off of the
link so we have kind of understood what
functions dot PHP is but not so
complicated because the core is not
commented as well so the file size and
quizzes so what I'm gonna do is just
pretty much go through every of these
files and let me just zoom in if I can
so this 404 template is pretty much a
template which would be visible to the
user if the user is kind of located on a
404 not found so for example if I just
say script a lot script here and update
the file and go to like team comm slash
404 alright so okay so there's some sort
of problem with you know are the host
configuration so I'm just gonna make a
look at that so for now just use
localhost / WP and as you can see on a
404 not found it saves us and a lot just
like that so this file is off a 404 not
found then right here what we have is
archives now archives are pretty much
another template file which we are not
gonna you know need for any template
development but you can just add that to
add some functionality then author bio
would be the biography you can just show
a description sort off of the author
with image then comments would be the
commands content link content none well
you could actually add your own files
depending upon your theme as well so
that's what these guys have done here
then theme footer is the file which we
are familiar with functions as well
header as well
then image attachment template this is
gonna cool so we're gonna take a look at
that later on in our series then back on
back is there custom file custom header
is there custom file there's just custom
file custom file then index dot PHP you
know that
now single page dot PHP would be the
page file and since we haven't looked at
what pages are so I'm just gonna leave
this here but we're gonna get back to
this topic later on in our template
development series then search results
would be the template file which would
appear right here whenever you search
for something then sidebar is this file
the sidebar right here and then finally
we have the single post which is
responsible for all these posts right
there so pretty much and these styles
are the style sheets so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial and if you
like this then don't subscribe and thank
you for watching
and again I'm just gonna take a look at
just why this was not working and we'll
probably just get it working by the next
tutorial so if you like this tutorial
then don't forget to subscribe thank you
for watching and we're gonna start with
WordPress team development from the next
