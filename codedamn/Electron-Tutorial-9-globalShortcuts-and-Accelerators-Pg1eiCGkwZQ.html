Nicole and welcome to your ninth
electron tutorial in which I'm going to
touch a little about what global
shortcuts are in electron and rather
what accelerators are in electron so
accelerator is just a fancy name for a
string which consists of a set of
keyboard keys right it's super easy and
super simple to do you need to import
global shortcuts first from electron
package and again again as I said it
would be some sort of name and
electronic check or whatever we are
importing so we need to make sure that
you're just doing global shortcut here
then once you have done that what you
need to do is you need to register your
Google shortcut right now by registering
the global shortcut you can enable the
user to work with their keywords only
instead of just always make use of Mouse
to fire some custom evens right and more
likely if you plan to create a game with
the html5 and html5 canvas and all that
good stuff which is actually a great
idea by the way then you can pretty much
provide some sort of cheat system but I
guess you can just do that from
JavaScript as well but anyways you get
the idea so you would pretty much need
it to fire the functions whenever your
window is in focus or maybe even if it
is not in focus and some other app is
not eating your evens right so that is
one advantage of global shortcuts over
the register shortcut with JavaScript
and renderer process so you're going to
say ruber global shortcuts dot register
and then here goes in accelerator which
is the name of the keys you need to
press in order to get to your this
method calling and this would be a
function
and all that go right here would be
automatically called whenever your
accelerator is found by electron and for
the accelerator what we can do is say
command or control plus any of the key
let's say one so what this means command
or control it means that either command
plus one which is for Mac or ctrl plus
one which is for Windows or Linux pcs so
this kind of targets and at once you can
simply do command plus one as well or
control plus one as well but command or
control is just just makes life a bit
easy if you want to target both Windows
and Mac at the same time for the same
code so now whenever we press command or
control + one what I can do is pretty
much move my this thing right here let's
the stake right here and we can change
this window to win so what we are
essentially doing now is the we are
saying that control plus one would be a
shortcut to maximize or unmask summize
our window right so let's see so if we
run this and if I press control one you
can see that our windows maximize not
really you cannot see the toolbar is
actually overflowing for you but I can
see that it is maximized and maximize on
maximized maximize our next man and it's
all with ctrl + 1 right so similarly
there are a lot of other events you can
specify like Alt + 1 which would fire
whenever all key stress you instantly
stay here alone Alt key pressed right
and then you can pretty much do like I
don't know something like Shift + 1 or
super plus 1 as well as far as I
remember super key is that window flag
on your keyboard that Keys super key
right so that kind of could be useful
for you in your application and again
all these strings right here are called
accelerators and you need to register an
accelerator with global shortcut
now you can target a lot of keys with
these actual rhythm like numbers letters
and pretty much everything you have
where you would need on your keyboard
you can target that even function keys I
guess something like that
f11 or f12 or whatever so yeah that is
all pretty much you just root for any
win in electron and that might be
actually a lot helpful if you are
creating enough something like a text
editor where you can just say control
the movies for open file control P for
print and all that good stuff so that is
all for this one and in the next one
we're going to discuss something again
amazing about electron I don't know what
but that would be anything so that is
all for this one and if you liked it
then don't forget subscribe don't forget
to like the video and that's all for
this I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
