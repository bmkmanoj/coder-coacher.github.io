another angular 2 tutorial in which I'm
gonna show you how to add some sessions
to your login application so that we can
just play around with the user and just
kick out those who are directly
accessing our admin straighter area so
first of all let's just see what we have
done so far so in my login component and
just redirecting the user to admin area
if the username is admin and password is
admin as well well that kind of looks
cool but actually everybody can access
this admin area if it loads like this so
we need to somehow create some sort of
sessions so well what I can do at this
level is that I can just simply base64
encode the username and password and
just concatenate them and then again and
code them but actually this is a stupid
logic trust me you would never ever make
use of base64 encoding for creating a
session key out of your username and
password you would kind of make use of
some hash algorithms like you know sha
encryption or something like that might
be md5 as well but base64 I'm just
making use of that because you know just
doing an md5 encryption with JavaScript
would be kind of you know require a
little bit of code so base64 we do have
a built-in function with Chrome I guess
actually so this is it will be ABC know
so the B to a function actually a square
it's a base64 version of that and a to
be just decodes that so I'm going to say
key is equal to a to actually B to a of
data a let's just say you name is this
dot data dot user name and is press dot
data dot password so that it's easy to
use later on so I'm going to say kay
B - a username then I want a question
mark two question marks in between
because base64 doesn't include question
marks so I'm gonna say B - a password
and then I'm gonna finally do a beat way
do this whole thing so now I'm gonna say
console.log the stud at a console log
key and let's just change this to you
name and password Ali why not
so if I just go to my home base now and
hit enter admin admin hit enter
reference arrow you name is not defined
okay let's just keep it to war you name
and war password admin admin hit enter
k4 key here we go go then again final
try hit enter we get this key now if I
just go back to a to B then I get this
then what I can do is X is a to be this
thing dot split double question max zero
and we get this and if I do like a to B
of X we get the admin so that's how
pretty much I am just getting some
information from my session key right
here and pretty much what we can do with
this is that we can just simply
authenticate the users and how well I
can just set this as my cookie in the
browser now yes we can make use of the
local storage but I would like to teach
you how to make use of cookies only
because in a real world application
you'll be making use of cookies to
authenticate
the user pretty much because browser
automatically sends cookies to the
response and that's kind of helpful so
let me just quit the bass job for now
and let's just say npm install ng to
cookies now this is a dependency which
would help us to work with cookies yes
you can work with cookies with normal
JavaScript as well but this kind of
makes it easier and why not just make
use of it when we are making use of
angular 2 so now what I want to do is
right here right input cookie from ng to
cookies I guess this should be the name
of module b c d e f g h i j k and here
we go so yes this is but i need to
restart sublime to view its contents
well I don't want to reach contents I
know that this is ng to cookies only so
we have included that and then what I
can do is I can say cookie dot set
cookie and then I can say that this is
my session ID and the value would be the
key so now we are transferring data from
one page to another and then in my admin
dot TS we need to perform a check in
here with these cookies so I'm just
gonna oh there should be cookie actually
so I'm just gonna set this cookie right
here
in session ID and I'm gonna retrieve
that same cookie right here and I'm
gonna just reverse engineer that and
check whether the user name and password
matches admin or not and if they do then
just continue with this component and if
they don't then just redirect the user
to login page or some other page and
that's pretty much what's left in this
application because if that's if that
thing is done then what just we need to
do is that we need just an LS block here
and then this dot router actually not
navigate to dashboard area we just need
that and again we do have the cookie
seven so we can retrieve the user
information from that and pretty much do
whatever we want to do so that's the
only thing left and that's the end of
this tutorial as well so if you liked it
