another angular 2 tutorial my name is
Miho and in this tutorial we're gonna
probably finish off our application and
I've made a couple of changes if you can
notice I have just named this from
whatever it was to home and then right
here I have removed that cookie one
because I don't know it was kinda
creating some sort of conflict so I'm
just making use of the document cookie
itself you know that's the package the
cookie package was good and g2 cookie
but I don't know it just didn't work for
me so if it does work for you too loud
then that's good but if it doesn't then
you can just go ahead and write this one
instead of that not simple as that
so inside our admin we had this hello
admin so if I add man up in here and hit
enter you can see we get hello admin so
what I can do inside this admin
component constructor I can say that if
or first of all let me just say console
log document dot cookie right so you can
see I've got this cookie as this I
should probably add a semicolon at the
end as well so okay so let me just clear
off my cookies and wizard the login page
once again admin admin hit enter and
document dot cookie okay anyways so I
can say if I sort of add another cookie
let me just write Phi for a second
cookie equal to B all right cookie
alright very much it just takes care of
semicolon itself so I can say 4x is
equal to
document dot cookie not split with a
semicolon
and I can see for I equal to probably I
need equal to 0 is less than X dot
length I plus plus if X of I dot split
equals to 0 is equal to session ID
that's pretty much I'm just checking
that if the cookies session ID which
actually this all of this stuff was done
by that cookie library that package but
I'm not making use of dots but I'm doing
it manually so if that is true then what
I want to do is for cookie value is X I
dot split equal to you could actually
store that above result in another
variable so let me just say console.log
cookie value and right here
okay looks like to restart server
okay looks like there's some sort of
okay cool
it's now through admin admin hit enter
hello admin if I check console you get
undefined so yeah okay so I guess I need
to or cookie value cookie value just
like that no so to prevent dot cookie
and I can say that this is
makes off zero one dot split equals two
okay should be the one so we have God
this cookie right here
and now what I can do is I can say A to
B cookie value no it's split question
mark this is just the reverse
engineering we did and 0 and again I can
just say this is or my result is this
thing if my result 0 is equal to admin
and then my result 1 is equal to admin
then only this is admin otherwise
there's somebody else and we can just
simply do just like we have done here I
can say this is home ok so let's just
check that out
Andrew admin admin hit enter okay it
looks like we don't need to redirect it
too soon let me just check what's
happening ok probably want to console
log my result as well okay so
x0 a to be men okay so this should be a
to be admin actually because we are
using double base64 and pretty much here
we go so I just go to back type admin
admin adentro hello admin and if I just
clear out my cookies and comment this
out and reload this okay okay so I guess
if cookie value is equal to undefined
then obviously this is an authenticated
access then I want the stop router to
navigate to home else I want to run this
block of code cool now if I go to admin
you can see I'm redirected to the home
page and if I just type admin admin here
and in control you can see I'm presented
with the message hello admin so that's
pretty much how you can authenticate
users and let me just quickly create
another function or not a function
actually another file let's just say
component dot add your user IDs and this
would be pretty much similar to this one
but we won't be performing this check so
okay so we'll be saying that
hello and the template would be username
and I'm gonna say that this dot username
is equal to a to be my response zero all
right
so for now we get let me just clear off
my cookies and say hello world and
component login form has no route config
okay yeah so we haven't defined this
dashboard area inside my ab dot TS so
I'm gonna say this is spot and this is
dashboard component is whoa what is that
dashboard area then I won't name it to
be what do you say let's just name it -
one component should be actually input
user component pretty much we need it
right here from component dot user all
right so now we just need to make use of
this one and check out our application
admin admin takes us to hello admin
clear this out delete the cookies ABC
ABC hit enter we get hello ABC ok so now
we are pretty much done with this
application one more thing you can do is
add login dot d s you could actually
inside a constructor check if
this thing exists on again what you can
do is you can actually just split this
thing into another file and then include
it as input this from this and then you
can just create a simple function that
you can just see if is logged in and
then you can just perform some routing
or else something like that for that you
just need to split this code up into
another component and you would be good
to go so that pretty much brings our
application the login application to an
end and again if we just review it for a
while
you can see that this is a username I
enter admin 1 2 3 4 5 hit enter yes it
does says me hello admin because I've
entered I'm not into the admin and admin
but it redirects me to dashboard well
that's cool but if I try to access
administrator area it redirects me back
to the login page so if I just try to
enter admin and admin now hit enter now
this is a true admin so it saves me
hello admin and if I just read this and
go abc123 it n true it saves me hello
ABC so that's pretty much how you can
customize every user now you have their
username and password in base64 so most
of the users wouldn't even know what
base64 is so that means if you are kind
of creating your sort of intranet or
something for your home where all your
family members are using some sort of
authentication then you can use make use
of this but if you are taking your
application alive then probably you
won't make you love this thing
so you would shift this on a server and
let's just see if I can do that tutorial
anytime soon so that's all for this
tutorial and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching and yes I would just leave all
this code right here as a zipped file in
the description link or on
video as an annotation so that's all for
this one and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
