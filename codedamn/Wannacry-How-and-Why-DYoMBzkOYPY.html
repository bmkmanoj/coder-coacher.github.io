about this wanna cry so I'm here to give
my two cents on what this is and pretty
much how this is working and how it is
different from other ransom there's so
Ransome years have been around for a
quite a time so what makes it different
is that what a cry
apart from being a ransomware it also
acts as a warm right so it can replicate
itself from one computer to another if
they are connected in a network now in
other words you can say that if your
computer is infected and you are
connected to a network then one acquire
would replicate itself to all of the
computers in the network and would
infect them as well so in a nutshell
what a cry is actually targeting a
network instead of a computer right so
well how does it do that well recently
there has been a leak of a vulnerability
in Windows which is eternal blue which
was released by shadow brokers group I
guess a couple of months ago and is
found in what a cry source code right so
what this vulnerability is is that it
exploits SMB protocol of Windows the
implementation of that protocol now the
implementation is flawed not the
protocol is not flawed the
implementation how Windows has laid down
the implementation is flawed so it
allows remote code execution if you send
some cryptic data across that protocol
then you know things crash and you gain
administrator privileges across the
network so it allows you to remotely
execute code on a network from one
computer to another even if you do not
have administrative rights on the other
computer in the network right so that
what that's what makes it hard to stop
across the network so one it
uses the eternal glue exploit it
installs a backdoor in the other
computer so that it can run on that and
they copy itself into that computer and
then it again encrypts all the files of
that computer and presents you with a
desktop like this and then it demands
you to pay I guess three hundred four
hundred dollars or something in bitcoins
because again Bitcoin is untraceable
sort of so it obviously doesn't want you
to pay through PayPal right so yeah so
the next thing is that should you
actually pay if you are infected well I
think no because there's no way of
actually for them as well of cracking
which payment came from which computer
right and since I don't think they will
have a common decryption key so because
if it were then they will have sended it
to one person and it would have leaked
on the internet by now so there's
actually no not no real way of finding
out which lies send which payment and
when right so that's what makes the
Bitcoin a little bit of cryptographic
and that's why actually bitcoin is a
cryptographic currency because it hides
a lot of information so if you are ever
infected by such a ransom there first of
all realize that you should have taken
backup of your data now if you have the
the good just reformat your computer and
you'll be good to go and if you don't
then I don't think so that paying them
is a wise option so because there's no
really any case which has came across
where the user has paid them and their
files were recovered right so yeah
that's how pretty much
ransomware water fireworks and the batch
which is released by Microsoft is
actually not be touched for this
ransomware is dispatch of that SMB
protocol right so you are still very
much vulnerable to want to cry and any
other runs from there on the Internet
it does not mean that if you install the
patch and you just go ahead and open an
exe file then you are good to go no it
does not mean that the patch means to
stop want to cry at one computer only
instead of spreading to a whole network
right so if you haven't installed a pass
yet you should do or you know if you're
running pirated window copy or anything
like that so you can just manually
disable SMB v1 protocol because version
2 and version 3 protocols are not
affected by one acquire till now so yeah
that is all for this video and I'll see
you then and some other video with some
other other cool news</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
