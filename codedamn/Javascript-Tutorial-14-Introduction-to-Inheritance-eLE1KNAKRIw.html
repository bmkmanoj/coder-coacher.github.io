fourteenth JavaScript tutorial and in
this lesson we'll be looking at
inheritance in JavaScript in the last
tutorial we discussed about the
prototypal model and how it worked in
JavaScript but in this tutorial we'll be
inheriting the one constructor prop the
one constructor properties methods and
properties into another constructor
function let's modify the score a little
bit we had area of square and area of
rectangle let's make the score just
parameter
perimeter of square and let's apply it
to the side X as well then we do this
dot sides X this dot parameter
and this function would return
or into
okay now we have this object down here
which creates new area of square as I
told you in the last tutorial this
object is right now empty with just a
prototype method linked to it which
links this object to this constructor
function with the prototype chain now
what happens is if we do area of square
dot prototype is equals to new perimeter
of Square and supply it with the side
ten now what's happening here is
here
here we have area of square and here we
have another constructor function
perimeter of square now area of square
has its own properties and methods
like this perimeter or square has its
own properties and methods like this now
as you know
these both are linked to the prototypal
chain gathering way above two objects
the object
and here as well
it is going to object with
prototype
and same with this
but now when we do
area of square dot prototype is equal to
new perimeter of square then this
prototype chain links this object right
here within this within this chain that
means when we do area of square is equal
to new perimeter of square then what it
does it is it inherited all the methods
and properties of this object into this
gene that means if I request if I create
any object down here and supposingly
this object has this object calls a
method which is not located in this
chain this constructor function neither
in this object so what it will do is it
will first jump to this and this
controller constructor function would
say I don't have this method then it
would jump above the prototype chain and
would find this object linked to this
prototype change and it would jump to
this method instead of going above to
the object it would jump to this method
and then it will request if you have any
method what we have requested down here
and it would return that method to us
and again it would come to the area of
square the object and it would use as
required okay so now let's try to run
this practically we have attached this
object to the prototype chain of a
layoffs square now we have created a new
instance of this a new object square is
equal to new area of square now if we do
square that area in console.log let's
see and then we will refresh this and
what happens is we get hundred has
logged and this is usual
because 100 square is 100 let's try to
do square dot perimeter what happens now
is we get the result 40 but how we
didn't have any method called para
perimeter in area of square now what's
happening here is the inheritance we
have inherited this method perimeter
from this constructor function into this
now what happens here is as a draw the
diagram earlier the perimeter
consider the function parameter is
requested by this object
square square down here we requested the
parameter method this parameter method
looked up to this area square it said no
we don't have this method then this jump
to above the prototype chain and found
this late it requested this whether do
you have any perimeter of square the
parameter method and yes it said yes I
do have and it returned the
method and it's what it used to be
returned and this the values are then
used by this object accordingly now what
happens if we had a parameter function
right here in the area of square object
let's say I create a function the stop
parameter and just simply returns one
nothing much to do here
I guess I'm sending condoms right here
okay so I have now created a function
parameter in the area of square as well
now if i refresh this page and see what
happens
then you'll observe that we get one but
why is it so this is because let's clear
this out
okay so this was
this was area of square of square
this was very mature off square
we created a new object of area off
square which is just square
and
it called the method
parameter
I hope that's understandable
okay so
and as usual these two are linked with
each other because of this prototype and
these two are linked the prototype chain
as well with different levels
object then function like that
okay so now
this method right here this constructor
function has now got a property
parameter isn't it you just created it
right now and this method which is whose
methods and properties are inherited by
this constructor function has also got
the property
method parameter now when this when the
square requests the parameter method to
this then it says yes I do have this
method and it returns this method to the
square object and the execution stops
here because there's no need to go to
this method and then request this method
again the execution stops here that
means the program has found the
parameter method and it doesn't look up
on the chain to find it again
that means the chain is something like
the area of the first of all it would
look within itself if the method is
found for instance if we create like
I creates square dot perimeter is equal
to function
returned to and then I call this method
and we refresh this page as you can see
it outputs to now what's happening here
is this square function looks within
itself if it as a parameter method and
if it finds the one then it starts the
execution right here it doesn't go to
above the chain and then this doesn't go
to above itself like that
so once the method is found the
execution stops this is about
inheritance so what happens here is a
quick overview our brief what we have
learned we created we created a new
object of pay meter of square linked all
its methods and properties with the
prototype chain of area of square right
here and then
we initialized or tweeted an instance of
this constructor function or an object
of this constructor function with
prototype already attached by the
JavaScript this method then we created a
squared parameter which overwritten
overrode the method of the area of
square constructor class and the
perimeter of square constructor class
and then we called it so it returned you
to us if you can remove this then this
would look up the chain unless it finds
the parameter method and we move this as
well then it would look further up in
the chain and would return this method
right here and if you remove this as
well will obviously get an error because
there's no inbuilt parameter method in
the object as you can see
so this tutorial was brief about
introduction to inheritance I hope that
you are getting understand you are
actually trying to understand what's
happening in JavaScript and how the
inheritance model is working right here
so if you don't understand anything or
have questions while this happened and
while we did not write this core and we
wrote in this instead of that like that
