second jquery tutorial in the last
tutorial we assemble jquery file and
wrote a simple script which is printed
hello world on the body so in this
tutorial i'll be explaining you what the
script does basically I will explain
jQuery to you now in this script down
here it writes hello world do body and
let's see that first
on the Chrome browser
Chrome browser
so as you can see this program down here
prints hello world to the browser then
why does it print hello world I'll
explain you now now jQuery to use any of
the chicory command we have to include
the keyword jQuery now basically since
jQuery is a library we need to tell
JavaScript that whenever I use this
keyword jQuery do not process that
JavaScript with your traditional methods
but past the control to this library and
let it pass the control after assembling
to you that means for example if I'm
typing jQuery do something
then do not pass the control directly to
the interpreter of JavaScript but
actually use this library jQuery right
here which we have included to do
something and then this lab lady would
tell the native JavaScript app what to
do so now you'll ask me that why are we
using this dollar sign
now jQuery is equal to dollar now by
this I mean that jQuery uses a symbol
dollar as a shorthand for jQuery word so
even if you use the word jQuery down
here just comment out this line
see the browser it would work exactly
same
so basically dollar sign is a shorthand
for jQuery would okay so what's next the
next thing in jQuery is the jQuery
library mainly use to manipulate Dom and
by Dom I mean that selecting elements
putting values together assimilating
elements grabbing values storing data
and all that stuff so we know that to
start a jQuery command we need to use a
dollar sign first to that javascript
compiler know that we are now into the
jQuery file instead of traditional
JavaScript now these two parentheses
contain a selector now selector here
means that
selector means that
the element we want to work with for
example if I open the door tree down
here
make it out of focus yeah so this is my
dorm tree down here and suppose I want
to work with the element body so what
I'll do is in jQuery
I'll use the selector as body so now
jQuery knows okay so I have to work with
body what I have to do the next thing is
the command or method which you want to
follow with the selector for example I
want to say that body dot HTML the HTML
of the body should be let's see 1 2 3 4
5 or anything you want so this command
right here tells jQuery tells JavaScript
first first of all the dollar sign tells
to use jQuery use jQuery then different
SSA to select body because body is
inside these two parenthesis
hTML is a method in jQuery library which
either sets or gets the HTML of any
element and by that I mean that if I
just do HTML and store it in a variable
then X has the HTML of body but if I do
like this so 1 2 3 if I pass it value
down here then I'm actually setting the
HTML of body and in this variable I'm
getting the HTML of body I'll discuss
these methods in the later tutorials but
for now just remember that we are just
setting the HTML of the body to one two
three
now the parentheses of HTML obviously
sets the HTML value
so this is how jQuery works kind of and
in the future tutorials will be going
deep into jQuery learning how to work
with jQuery actually and work with
prototypes and models and how jQuery
worked and basically we'll be learning
how J query actually works with the
prototype al model so this was all about
this tutorial and don't forget to
