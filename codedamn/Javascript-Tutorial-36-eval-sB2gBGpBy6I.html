36th JavaScript tutorial hell I know in
the last tutorial I sounded like an
idiot where I said welcome to your 34
JavaScript tutorials but it was actually
the 35th JavaScript tutorial but hey it
happens so coming back to this tutorial
we have something to discuss and it is
called
eval function in JavaScript the eval is
basically a function which evaluates a
block of string as a chav strip command
itself and before even starting this
tutorial I should say that never use
this function and why I'll tell you in
this tutorial later on but first of all
let's see what eval is and how it works
so I have this function down here and I
say alert two three four five I'm doing
notice
and let's here's the chrome and we get
alert as one two three four five so how
is eval parsing a string as a javascript
and basically this is the function of
eval eval what it does is eval takes an
argument of a JavaScript code in
JavaScript code and runs it in the same
scope that means function eggs if I try
to do work Y is 10 and alert why I again
a lot Y in the in another scope then we
have the scope of this variable down
here in this function but we don't have
the scope of this variable Y in the
global scope in the global so basically
eval executes the code in the local
scope instead of go global scope so
let's refresh this
why is equal to ten oh sorry I didn't
call the expansion and refresh we get
dead nothing because why it's not
defined in the global scope a lot it's
not defined oh sorry
let's see Dan was not defined as I said
you so this is how eval works basically
it is used to execute JavaScript a
string in as a JavaScript so previously
when people didn't know how to
manipulate Dom easily or how to work
with Dom
they used eval to set something like
dynamic values to the names of input
fields the values of input fields the
JSON objects but now we have some more
powerful function like JSON dot parse
some other functions which are more safe
and which do not pose any security
threat
so for example the reason I was telling
you to avoid using eval function is that
because eval poses many security threats
and is all fun considered as an evil
function for example let's say let's say
if you are taking a parameter from
let's say the user made a dynamic
parameter from any user on your site and
suppose you are executing that eval code
as the parameter down here or basically
let's say you are taking Styles as a
parameter or maybe scripts I know I'm
confused but anyways scripts as a
parameter and we are taking just alert
hello hello user we are taking script as
a parameter and we are just directly
availing this inside the parameter URL
straight sorry this is not the correct
syntax but I am just writing supposingly
we are evaluating this the attacker
changes this payload to something
like this window dot location
attacker.com so what happens now is
instead of getting a nice and sweet and
a world alert hello user alert basically
the attacker is able to redirect the
user the victim to his own site and do
whatever he wants to do so this was a
very dumb and stupid explanation of how
eval can be exploited but there are many
more precise and basically
heart-stopping examples of using the
demerits of using eval on your website
you are free to google them and check
them out
this was all about eval and I'll see you
then in the next tutorial so don't
forget to subscribe and thanks for
