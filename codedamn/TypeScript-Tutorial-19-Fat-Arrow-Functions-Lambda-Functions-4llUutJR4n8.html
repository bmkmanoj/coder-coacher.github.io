Nathan and welcome to your nineteen
typescript tutorial in which I'm going
to show you how to implement fat arrow
functions or lambda functions as we say
in other languages would type script
right so now it's you know it's 2017 and
most of the browser's have implemented
lambda functions or you know fat arrow
notations in JavaScript itself so you do
not actually need typescript to work
with them but anyways it's a good idea
to compile your code to es5 so that you
support all the browser's majorly right
so before starting let me just give you
a quick example so let's just create a
class car right and let's just create a
variable let's say gas amount is a
number right and in the constructor
let's just initialize gas amount to zero
right and let's create a method one
which would eventually what we do in two
is set interval function just like we
used to do in JavaScript this dot gas
amount plus plus right and one more
thing let's create our car object as
HTML element you know it's not necessary
to specify it like that web except for
you then we can say car object is
document dot get element by ID and let's
say this is our car or maybe this player
car
so we can write here create div ID flare
car right then we have the scar object
we are incrementing gas amount so I can
say this car object dot in a text equals
distant gas amount now what do you
expect this program to do well if I
create something like let's just say
this is my car is equal to MU car right
and then I can say my car dot one right
so you should or anybody should who
doesn't know the scoping of space should
expect that this program runs like it
would just increment the 0 from 1 2 3 4
5 every half a second right so let's see
what it does so you have got our code
running and we load this now you can see
that we get instead of incrementing the
scoundrel every half a second we are
getting an error cannot set property in
a text of undefined now what is
happening well what happens is that when
you create an anonymous function the
scope of this this variable is not now
it's now not referring to this class it
has lost its scope right from this class
to it now refers to this function or
precisely this window right not earlier
what we used to do is now we just used
to create a variable outside and make it
this and then instead of using this
directly we may may
use of that particular variable but
that's a pretty hawkish way to get
around but a better way would be to use
federal functions right and how they
work is that you just get rid of this
function right and you create something
like this right so let's just see what
we are getting arrest number is not
assignable to type drink okay just do it
not to string not a problem right so
that's where you know typescript
can't say anything because okay it's
just in front of me
okay so now if we take a look here and
reload this you can see it perfectly
work now the reason is that these subtle
functions do not have their own this
scope right so they use the disk of
whatever they are inside right so
currently in our federal notation we are
not making use of a new disk which just
refers to that particular function that
particular anonymous function but we are
just referring to the death of this
class right so it's easy to create a
federal function like examples just like
you created a function like you know
something like you are X is function
then we used to do something like ABC
result
a times P times C so it's equivalent and
federal notation would be one y is equal
to this ABC a star B star C right so
that's pretty huge reduction in code you
can see right here we are missing the
function keyword the return keyword all
that stuff right so it's kind of if you
have this only one liner function but if
you want to do something more you can do
something like this and the type script
you can obviously specify the data type
of return as well you can do other stuff
as well so that's not very much fat
arrow functions work and die script and
that is all for this tutorial and if you

I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
