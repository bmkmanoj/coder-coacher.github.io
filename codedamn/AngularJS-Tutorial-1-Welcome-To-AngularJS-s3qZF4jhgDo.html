first angularjs tutorial in which we'll
be discussing about what is angularjs
and why it is used and what you can do
with angular basically so angularjs is a
very new library or you can say a kind
of framework for JavaScript and it has
been recently very popular and a little
bit of its history well I know nobody
right there is interested in doing
anything history about and all that
boring stuff but you know that's you
should know a little bit so angularjs
was developed somewhere around 29 and
then it was backed by Google who will
basically give it support to the
developers of angularjs and the official
angularjs release was version 1 which
was somewhere around 2011 or 12
all right so angularjs coming to what
this is this is a simple framework could
it be only in JavaScript and it's a
JavaScript file obviously to work with
browsers and using angularjs you
basically make spa applications and
Vespa
I mean single page applications so spa
equals
all page applications and whenever I
make use of the word spa in angle and
angularjs tutorials then I'm referring
to these three words together so with
angularjs it's very convenient and easy
to make single bill applications like
your mini websites or your you can say
your personal website where you can
display your information about what you
do and what you are that portfolio and
everything else and angularjs is set up
in the way large website very large
database sites as well because this is a
very flexible kind of language and saves
a lot of good
alright so angularjs as I told you since
it is a JavaScript only this code this
file here includes only the JavaScript
then it's obviously clear that whatever
you do in angularjs could already be
done and can already be do you can do
that in JavaScript in vanilla J's here
but the thing is that angularjs is very
compact and makes it easy to do stuff so
if you do that in let's say languages
like jQuery or simple JavaScript then
your code is very very error prone to
bugs
so your code could be a lot buggy and it
could be a lot difficult to debug
especially when you're doing like
multiple Ajax requests between servers
asynchronous and synchronous processes
setting time limits changing pages
animation and all that stuff so
angularjs makes it really simple to work
that way and I'll show you why angularjs
is a very much better language to work
with on single bit applications than
jQuery so I guess this that's much for
the first tutorial introduction to
angularjs and I hope that if you're
watching this tutorial then you're
deliberately here to learn angularjs and
you know and this series will be
mastering this language so stay tuned
with me and don't forget to subscribe to
keep and have a update of the upcoming
angularjs tutorials so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
