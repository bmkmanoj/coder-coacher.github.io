May ho and welcome to this video in
which I'm going to show you how to
exactly set up NPM and node on your
system for Windows installers this is
the simplest you just need to install
this MSI file 32-bit or 64-bit and
you're good to go just go ahead and
install this click on next next next and
once you're done with the wizard you
just have to go to your command line
that is a CMD just right node we and NPM
we get your version numbers and that is
it for you guys for Linux it's a bit
interesting you can directly install it
from the source code or what you can do
is on your boot to machine in my case
just go ahead and add get install NPM
right here just hit yes and okay it's
not installing because I have to get
update repo links are not updated and if
we try one more time that is app get
install NPM you can see that we're just
installing NPM for now and I've node and
I'll tell you why
okay so once that's done what I want you
to do carefully is this to sudo NPM
install install G and just in now what
this n is is this is a node version
manager so I want to do n and latest I
hit enter okay so you can see that we
are installing mode version 9.5 point
zero and that is it boy right n BM v we
have NPM versions iPhone 6.0 4 node we
we have was nine points iPhone zero plus
what we have done here with this end
thing is that if you do N and hit enter
you can actually select multiple node
versions if there are they are on your
system for example if I do sudo in
version 8.9 or less the same so will
install version eight point nine point
four for me and now only for Linux guys
and Mac ones as well if you do install
and as your mode version manager if you
do like nor do we right now it shows you
eight 19.4 I can change it to nine point
five if I want and once I do that and
you can see this device node V now we
get version 9.5 and NPM as always is on
the latest 15.6 cool now for Mac OS guys
you can download this packet installer
file directly and install it and will
come with NPM and node shipped into
itself now if you want to get the same
thing as I have with the end package you
can do install NPM first with this
package but PKG file once you have done
that will install this
has a global package and then use n as
your version manager for node so you can
see that in my case I had the following
node versions 8.1 in point nine six and
five point five but I just prefer to use
a point one for now because of some
reasons so yeah that is pretty much how
you setup node and NPM on your Mac Linux
or Windows PC and yeah that's all for
this one and thank you for watching I'll
see you then in some other video and one
