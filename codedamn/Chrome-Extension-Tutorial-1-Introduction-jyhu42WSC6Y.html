first Google Chrome extension
development tutorial now in this series
we'll be learning and I'll be teaching
you how you can be a newb to a pro
extension developer and how you can
monetize your extension and build a
large source of audience with the help
of Google Chrome extension and the store
on which you can launch your extension
in this tutorial we'll be just going
very slow and basic what Google Chrome
extensions are and how you can use them
and like that so first of all the
official definition says that extensions
allow you to:add functionality to grown
without diving deeply into native code
you can create new extensions for Chrome
with those core technologies that you're
already familiar from web development
HTML CSS and JavaScript and this lines
holds true very true if you are not good
in HTML CSS or JavaScript I prefer you
to go to my JavaScript series and learn
JavaScript and then come back to the
chrome building extension tutorial if
you are even like ok ok and moderately
good in JavaScript that would do and
HTML CSS are obviously used for layout
it depends how good you are the more you
are better the better you are in HTML
and CSS the better would be the output
of your extension and the styling and
customization of that but HTML CSS does
not usually play much role in the what
you say the development of the extension
and the functioning and working of that
so first of all let's download the dummy
files provided by Chrome developers for
us to start an extension and build the
hello world program let's see if you've
got there yes so open this page
developer.chrome.com/apps get started
and down here you will find these four
files click on all of them to download
and these four files what they do I'll
explain just in a minute
I'll just
where the heck are those signs Papa Papa
manifest an icon
is the icon
first I've selected Papa here you go
got the separate folder to keep the
tanks clean okay so let's open these
files
okay so
here we have a manifest pop-up pop-up da
GS and pop up to our HTML so let's
quickly write our hello world program in
this tutorial and just like a usual
hello world program just give it the
simple HTML
just like this this is our simple hello
world program for Google Chrome
extension we don't need popular chairs
right now and manifest.json I'll explain
in a in a couple of tutorials what is
this and how this works for now just we
require just these two files
manifest.json is an important file
go to your Google Chrome click on this
menu bar go to settings
click on extensions here and make sure
you check this developer mode on and now
click on load unpacked extension it will
show you a file browser and then just
open your directory where you have
stored this extension
- like in wire tutorials and in chrome
extension and click on OK and it will
load this extension from those paths and
as you can see I've got this icon small
icon here in the toolbar and when I
click on this it simply shows me hello
world and congratulations on creating
your first Google Chrome extension in
the next tutorials and more tutorials in
the future we'll be going deep into
Google Chrome extension development
series and how do how to develop
extension and chrome maybe as a message
message passing and all that instruct
interesting stuff so don't forget to
