another ionic tutorial and in this
tutorial will be finally implementing
some sort of styles to our application
and pretty much making it a little bit
nice and we'll be making use of this
angular SVG around progress bar by a
crisp arrow and it's his github
repository and it's really nice actually
I just checked out the demo and that's
pretty much what we have wanted for our
application you can see that it just
nicely increments and the numbers
actually don't actually jump straight to
the final number they actually just
increment just like you want them to
well we have got a bunch of options here
as well like semi circle and responsive
which we would like to make use of for
devices like mobile phones because you
want to make your application responsive
and then we have these rounded yeah we
might make use of that as well then
clockwise gradient pretty much you can
do everything and these are the
parameters we can just customize them
from angular itself so what I'm gonna
make use of here is you can just either
install this by a package NPM yes you
can do that if we just go into your node
modules right here or you can just
pretty much download this file well I
guess this seems neutral for application
like this because it's kind of not so
large application so I can actually just
copy this thing instead of just saving
it actually let's create a new file out
of it let's just say this is progress
bar ojs and close our application inside
index just include your script SRC GS /
progress bar chair and you'll be good to
go now inside your add GS what I want to
make use of is pretty much let's just
refer to what this guy's saying so it
says that me
use of this dependency in angular module
and that's what we make use of that's
why we make use of such things so I need
iron ik and again something like this
angular SVG round progress bar alright
now we have got these options okay
now instead of this I can just view the
source of this page and right here we
can see the same thing sample progress
bar right here so we need to get sort of
this application and do we need that SVG
I guess yes we do so let's just copy the
SVD as well and for the process ng cloak
let me just take a look that's not
really helpful so let's just copy out
this whole progress wrapper and inside
our index dot HTML let's just replace a
thing or two let's just say this is our
progress now and get style what does
this get style do yet style school don't
get style transform
okay so it's doing some sort of
animation stuff okay sweet all right now
precise current times max so we don't
need this actually what we need is the
number of seconds left and that is
pretty much our my timer right here so
let's just see if we can get rid of this
get style also now for round progress we
have max as max all right actually we
would like to have this as my time early
so the maximum it could go is my timer
and the current would be let's just say
my timer but I want this to be my timer
fixed so let's just say this is my timer
fixed my timer fixed is actually 10 also
because we are just hooking up with my
timers so it's just changing so your
maximum value will also change so you're
kind of your application would kind of
look like a freezed circle only okay so
now we have got a scholar bgcolor radius
I want it to be responsive actually so
responsive is a boolean or is it just
responsive or not responsive it's a
boolean so I guess we need to write in
true here true then duration would be I
guess pretty much let's just set it here
only hundred let me just take a look if
it's in seconds or something
milliseconds looks like so Isis changes
to 500 animation is it the easing
function that would be used while
animating now ease out cubic is the
default value but we could add all of
these so well you need to know the sort
of grass for all of these functions to
understand how the animation works and I
guess I have pretty much used cubic
Breezer curves right here while making
use of WebKit animations and it's pretty
sweet and in one of my extensions also
this one right here so the icons
expanding from top to bottom this is a
sort of cubic briscoe if I can show you
yeah this one this this is the equation
for this cubic Breezer on the shirt so
that's pretty much similar what will
happen to our animation so here are the
docs and let's just leave it out to ease
out cubic ollie so let's just get rid
off what we had here
this one offset what is offset the
margin between the edge of the circle
and the SVG element okay mostly used
when nesting progress bar if you pass it
inherit the offset will be calculated
okay so let's just leave it to zero only
for now animation delay 20 seconds to
wait no not really I don't want to wait
on render just seems interesting
callback function that gets executed not
really what we are looking for because
we already have our functions ready for
that so we can just get rid of that as
well
then we have stroke the specifies the
circles thickness let's just keep it to
20 and obviously I'm not making use of
variables here just like these guys I
made use of because your application
shouldn't probably change things like
your circles with or something like that
unless you are very much into graphics
just want to animate the hell out of it
so the next thing is radius and they're
pretty much I guess with response the
radius won't work very well radius of
the circle but anyways let's just set it
to I don't know certain pixels or what
okay so let's just set it to hundred for
now BG color would be the color of
circles background we'll just see do it
let's just set it to you this one and
color would be the color of the current
value of the circle let's just keep it
look black zero zero zero zero zero zero
here we go alright pretty much looks
good on the localhost if you see then
this looks way bigger than it should
so pretty much we need to scale this
down a little bit and to do that what we
can make use of is actually this
progress let's just wrap it into another
ID divide a big circle this okay stop
we haven't said CSS or was the ID name
big circle weight or let's just say yeah
let's just save it off 60% on margin
zero order I'm just writing in
percentages because on the devices we
don't really know what the screen size
is actually so it would be best on to
relay on percentages so if I just scale
this down application a little bit you
can see the application is pretty
responsive if I start the timer you can
see pretty much it works very well just
like we would like it to work and that's
pretty much cool so you can see that the
timer is completed and you can see that
a bit of things are off aligned as well
like this tense should probably appear
here we should get rid of this 10 right
here and eventually we would just fix
them in the next tutorial and if you
