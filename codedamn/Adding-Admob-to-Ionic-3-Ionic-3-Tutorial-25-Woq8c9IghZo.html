Mei hole and welcome to your 25th ionic
tutorial and this time I have counted it
properly because I have just arranged
all the tutorials nicely and neatly in
the playlist on YouTube and in this
tutorial if you're gonna do is kind of
our app is already done but what if you
want to monetize it well the best way I
could think of right now is advertising
and that pretty much gets you to earn
from your app from day one if you have
if you're getting quite some downloads
so that would be a way to do so to do
that what you can do is make use of
AdMob which is Adsense for mobile
applications right so again this is
powered by Google so AdMob is the best
way to go for advertisements so to
configure AdMob on your ionic app what
you have to do is pretty much make use
of this AdMob free ionic native plugin
now there are a lot of alternatives but
I would highly recommend you to go with
AdMob free because first of all it might
require you a little bit of work than
the other ones but it's better than
sharing your revenue with other apps so
for example if you see here this guy
compares this his own plugin with the
other projects so you can see that other
projects pretty much have ad sharing
default by default enabled so that means
that if you put your ad they might show
their own ads sometimes now this might
lead to your revenue loss if you're
getting a lot of traffic so you want to
go with AdMob ad more free only because
that's the best choice so ionic
out-of-the-box provides a wrapper for
this well technically this is a Cordova
plugin but again ionic native provides a
native wrapper for it for us to use
right so again this is this will just be
a copy-paste thing so we can just copy
this thing and paste it right here
to add it to our project so once it's
done you should see something like this
or close to this and the next thing you
have to do is install the wrapper for
ionic and wait for it to install all
right so once everything is installed we
can get started the next step is to add
this plugin to our apps module which is
how our angular angular code would be
able to inject that particular
dependency across the files so you can
see that we need to go to our source app
and app module and right here what we
need to do is actually get this guy and
paste it right here and actually we do
not need to do add mod free config
because that is just for typescript
validation purpose it's not really for
you know kind of inserting the add so
you need to insert that into providers
so here are our providers so AdMob free
there you go
and once you are done with that just go
back to the page where you want for your
ad to be visible and in our case it's
just a single page so what I want is
kind of a banner ad visible at the
footer so for that what we can do is
what we can do we can first of all
include this thing inside our home dot
ts file right here
and what we can do next is insert the
dependency here add mod is add three and
once we are done with that we need to
configure this plugin to our account
right so let's just copy this thing and
let's just say we paste it right here
inside the constructor only but you can
do this in some sort of life cycle event
as well so that doesn't really matter so
we are making use of this testing right
now but we can't pass in our token here
as well actually I would just recommend
you to move this code right here into
the ion viewdidload life cycle even
Tolley so that we don't just kind of
mess without actually the app getting
loaded properly so we can't switch it
back with this and this okay we are done
and ready but the thing is that how does
it knows which account it's going to
show ads for so obviously we need to
configure our account here so let's just
go to AdMob and create a new application
for our app and oops okay so I have
another account associated with AdMob
I'll just open that all right so we are
in and once you're in your AdMob
dashboard what do you want to do is go
to apps and add an app and for now if
your app is on Play Store or Apple Store
app store rather then you can say yes
but otherwise it doesn't even matter so
you can select Android and let me just
give it a test
demo anything like that and you can see
that we get something like this so you
can actually copy this thing and because
you would need it later and you can
create a new ID a new ad so I'm just
gonna go with the banner one for now
because that's what we are supposed to
do for this tutorial and let's just name
it a test banner ad and it's safe
okay so Google would give you this ID
and this is important one so just copy
this thing alright so once we are here
what you want to do is write ID and ID
as this thing right and that is it make
sure your ID is something like CA app
publisher and then this long number then
separated by a slash and then this thing
because there's another thing available
as the publisher ID which has a tilde
sign in between so you do not have to
make use of that make use of this one so
you can kind of make it false if you
want to and you can make auto show false
as well basically what auto show is that
once the ad is ready that means once the
contents of the ad the graphics and all
that stuff is ready to be displayed it
will be displayed on the on your wrap
right so pretty much it doesn't matter
because this just says that the ad is
displayed that is ready to show right
this would just console.log any errors
for example if a user is not connected
to internet or anything like that so you
can just catch those things here ok
final check you can do is that you can
check if this dot platform okay so we
need to care platform here platform
platform right okay
oh it's actually an ionic angular not in
core so what I'm essentially trying to
do here is check if we are running on a
mobile device because I don't want to
use a plugin on browser it would
eventually not work platform is Cordova
that means we are on a phone we want to
do this thing right and yeah you're
ready so your app would work fine
without ads on a desktop one for testing
purposes and with ads on your mobile
device and it might take some time for
your ad to show up so don't worry
because Google takes around 5 to 10
minutes for or maybe even more like 15
minutes to start serving ads on a
particular newly generated ad right so
let me just configure my phone here so
that I can show you this thing on a real
device okay so my device is ready and
let's just run it on Android okay so
after waiting for a while and doing some
other stuff
what we have is finally our ad ready
with our application so you can see that
now this is a perfectly working
application with AdMob enabled yeah so
we get the response back
so yeah you can see that we have our
stuff with us and yes so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial and if you
liked it then please don't forget to

at the last I would like to give a shout
out to my very first patreon and that is
