Mei hole and welcome to your sixth
WebSockets tutorial in which we're gonna
implement how you can send and receive
messages from the data received on the
server right so what happens right now
is that just the client is sending data
somewhere in the dark the server isn't
getting any of those or actually not
replying at all as well so let's add
some events so that we can just listen
to what user is saying to the server on
the WebSocket so we have already created
our server we just need to implement
some methods to do that so we're gonna
say s dot aren't connection and it will
just fire up if the connection was
successful and you can just pass in a
function here or you know you just you
can just write here something like
handle connection and if we just do good
but I'm just making an anonymous
function call here and what this would
do is it would accept another one let's
just say this is my web socket and then
web socket dot on message now this one
is interesting because this one would
fire up whenever the user from the
client-side sends a message to the
server right so this would be a function
and this would obviously contain a
message and for now what I want to do is
just console.log received message right
and that should be a basic program okay
so now if I run this node yes and if I
reload the browser here hit OK the
network's I can see that the client sent
hey there the server and we have God hey
there on the server as well right so
that was simple now what about if you
want to send user the reply right so
what you can do is right here you can
say the
and message equals hello then what I
want to do is WebSockets and hey there
from the server right and let's just
make a bit of modification to the code
let's just change this to oh let me just
create a button right here we should say
sad hello and what I can do I can say
document dot gray selector button quick
fix on click the function which says
that so godsend
hello right and let me just get rid of
this alert it kind of bugs me so okay
just restart the server we can just use
another client
just like node Mon or something to make
life easy so we can just make you love
that but anyways now the WebSocket is
connected and we received here there
already so if I send hello we get hey
there from server right so this one the
white one is the response from the
server right and it shows me the length
and the time so it's kind of four
milliseconds today right the execution
in this line and this line was four
milliseconds pretty cool right so that
is how pretty much you create a very
basic implementation of a client-server
WebSocket system and in the upcoming
tutorials we're going to do something
more interesting with this fringe
functionality so that is all for this
one and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
