your 39th Google Chrome extension
development tutorial this is me who are
and the story will be starting with our
PHP script which we left in the last one
so let's just go to quit one PHP script
and remember that this one is going to
reside in the samp folder and in HD dogs
and it's time to create a folder this
one would be what would be this one I
guess we named it somewhere in the
script writing debut one ok give you one
give you one
hey go
dv1 and we have the script PHP file
ready okay so now make sure you have
them running yep and here I'm just gonna
do first of all it dumped off post so
that I can just see whatever I'm getting
without viewing the source code okay so
let's just try it off
okay so looks good so we are getting all
that information we need the name is
Miho and email-id is beholden Biddy
perfect and you might want to disable
this autofill if you want to you can do
that with HTML only anyways so now I'm
just going to get name as post name and
email as post evil now you might want to
send some information right here that is
you know some sort of your identity
which would you know look as if you are
this request is a legit request from a
user and you know not from an attacker
so what we can do is is a simple measure
now this is not obviously 100%
protective but it will just would
protect your application from new
backers at least so you can just give
the summit one it name as well and most
of the people if they are trying to like
hack into your application by flooding
your email address then they would
probably miss out the summit and they
will just directly launch an attack with
these two fields only and the trick is
that you showed them a success message
as well so that you know those guys are
convinced to cut off so you can just say
that if post summit
or you can make use of is set here if is
said post summit and if it is or rather
if it is not then you want to echo out
thank you for your submission your link
your download link has been willed to
you and okay I guess I can zoom in for
this one and if it's not then and
obviously after this you want the script
to immediately exit okay now we want to
do is we want the user to we want the
script to send user and email containing
the download link and you could pretty
much do that easily with like saying
download link there is whatever your
file name is blah blah blah and here you
can make use of the mail function ID and
I have forgot the four parameters except
it accepts I guess this is to this is
from this is subject and this is headers
but I might be wrong so you better check
from the documentation but I guess that
that is the syntax actually so you can
make you love mail function and you know
we can make use of that in this tutorial
but unfortunately I have to set up
another thing called mercury here for
this mail to work on localhost but this
would automatically work if you are
deploying the script directly on your
server so you can do that on your server
but I can do it here but I might show
you that life on my site okay so now
we want to send this data email and name
to this database right here and to do
that we are going to create a connection
to this database right here and one will
be doing that in the next tutorial so
that's all for this tutorial and thank
you for watching and don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
again I'll see you then well soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
