video I'm going to show you if you're in
India how you can invest in crypto
currencies like Bitcoin aetherium or
litecoin using a trading platform known
as conics so to get started with
cryptocurrencies first of all let me
just tell you if you do not know about
these then don't take this can't put all
of your money into this because you can
lose all of that if the prices fall
rapidly and you can eventually gain a
lot as well so do a quick market
research first before actually investing
and once you're done I'm gonna show you
how you can invest something into your
cryptocurrency lies so what you have to
do first of all let's go to this website
go an extent and if you follow my link
in the description which is a referral
link for coin X you will get 50 rupees
by default in your account so you can
start buying currencies like this one
which is less than 50 right so you can
buy a full coin so anyway now what I
want to do is once you are done with
that you would probably see that your
conics account would not be verified so
you need to actually go to a profile
where you will not get this symbol first
you would see that this kyc documents is
blank for you you actually need to
submit your kyc documents in order to
start trading on this platform so some
of your pan card a target and photograph
and once you do that it will take them
about 2 3 days to verify your kyc till
then you cannot perform any transaction
because your account is under
verification and once you are done with
this you should be able to see something
like this badge would say Strader which
pretty much means that you can not trade
on this platform ok so once you are
familiar with this what you have to do
is go to
balance is here and right here go down
and use deposit by a payment gateway or
while linked bank account now linked
bank account is a bit slower so if you
are kind of looking for quickly
investing if you see that the price has
dropped significantly
for example bitcoin was as low as 10k
dollars per coin last day so in that
moment you just want to go with a faster
approach that is a payment gateway but
if you see that the things are steady
and still then you can go with this
background sir as well the benefit of
bank transfers that the deposit fee is
zero whereas here it is two percent this
would matter if you are adding a lot of
money like dude relax or something
anyways let's just say I want to add an
amount of 1,000 rupees right and do
percent they charge so I get 980 so you
can pay some it and just have to choose
a way of paying I'm gonna go with net
banking and once you're at your bank you
just need to log in and you can see that
once you confirm your payment actually I
would get a password here to authorize
the transaction and if I enter it
you can see that the payment is
successful and now we would be returned
back to coin X so you can see that the
deposit is done successfully and your
balance should be updated in a minute
you can see that here we had a
notification and effective balance is
updated as well all right now what I
want to do is actually buy
cryptocurrency
so here's where the trade part comment
you go back to coin X you select your
cryptocurrency whichever you want to buy
in our case let's just say I want to buy
aetherium and I want to buy let's say
lowest etherium prices fifty thousand
seven hundred per coin so let's just say
I randomly enter something like 0.08
let's just say and I keep a trade price
of not only and I will show you that you
have low balance if you have so you just
keep doing a trial and error unless you
find a good value and let's just make it
super zero five and it's stillness
okay 0.02 is even less
okay so 0.01 helium cost me 508 well I
guess I have 95 in the bank so they're
friends you're too okay
yeah make sense 0.015 cost me 760 to
0.018 should cost me nine one four and I
have nine eight five so I guess I can
push it a little bit more 0.019 yeah 965
that's the max we can go because it does
not go beyond three digits I believe yep
so let's just see the price has
increased so now if I buy it and confirm
my transaction what happens is that my
transaction is an open order and what
that means is that I specified a
particular price per diem right but the
lowest ass price right now is a bit
higher than that if that happens
nobody's actively selling me his or her
materials so unless the price drops to
this this level which I specified I
would not be able to buy theory and so
it's just waiting for someone to sell it
here I'm at this price okay and once
that happens I'll get my theorems but
you can see that the price is actually
rising so you can either wait a little
bit or if you will just want to
pi-theorem real quick you can kind of
increase your price but that decreases
your aetherium volume or rather
increases your cost theorem which you
spend so I'm just gonna wait a little to
see if the price drops
so apparently you can see that in our
case the price is not coming down so if
you really want to buy it you can cancel
your open order from here and once you
do that you will lose your order so I
can go again and right 0.019
let's just make it this thing and if you
match it then you would immediately get
the coins fifty one thousand two hundred
there we go
and there we go you can see that the
order was placed successfully it does
not appear as open order because we
immediately got our materials you can
see in the notifications as well we
bought 0.019 etherium at fifty one
thousand two hundred per coin so now if
you go to balances you can see that we
have it here IAM and this includes some
of the previous purchase i did the
etherium so yeah that's how pretty much
you would invest in cryptocurrencies and
that would pretty much work in a similar
way with etherium or Bitcoin or litecoin
or ripple or Bitcoin cash whatever we
want to do and that is it for this video
