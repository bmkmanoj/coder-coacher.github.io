methyls and welcome to your eleventh
tutorial for angular and in this
tutorial we're going to learn about what
ng modules is in angular for right so we
have seen some tutorials where we are
making use of angular app but we do not
really draw till now what ng module is
so ng module was actually added to
angular 2 later on it was not when it
was not with the release version of
angular 2 the first version when came in
it came out so ng module was added later
on to angular 2 but it's quite useful
actually and what it does is pretty much
organizers are dependencies and impose
whatever we need for a specific module
now first things first let's see what
module is in angular so angular
introduces module concept as something
like a box which contains a lot of
components right so your web page can
contain things like Hello component then
sidebar component Content area component
then maybe a shopping cart component all
that stuff then you could pretty much
organize all of these components into
one module which could be user module
right which or rather view module or
whatever you want to say that so that
module would be created with this ng
module right and what what this ng
module contains or rather this engine
module decorator is that it is a
metadata object which contains some
useful information about what this
module would do and what this module
requires like the imports and the
services and dependencies it needs so
for example if you are making use of
something like you're doing login and
you want to make use of HTTP requests so
you're going to make you
hdtb or rather it is a module so it
would go inside imports so it would be
HTTP modules right so with this you will
have access to HTTP module in angular
and let's say you want to make some
routing stuff so you would import a
route router module and this would give
you access to the router module inside
your components of this module right so
again modules would contain one or more
components and components could then
make use of all these imported modules
which we have in here ok so that's good
but what about these declarations import
provider well and booster what's these
well to start off with this declarations
would is an array of components which
would be included in this module right
so right now we are just making use of
one component which is a component which
is the default component in default
installation or default setup where the
angular CLI so you can see that this is
pretty much a simple component which
have some of our data right now and
again this component just targets up
route and with a template you are of
asked component HTML and it just simply
display the seller world so nothing
fancy here so this declarations would
contain a list of an array of all the
components which you want to use so it
would typically look like head of
component and then let's say sidebar
component or if you are creating
something like I don't know a quiz app
so you can say like question component
and the option component anything like
that maybe like share links component
something like that so that's very much
what would go here the next thing is
that in both will now impose what this
does is that it would allow you to
import other modules into the app so so
the app can pretty much make use of
other modules like making use of this
browser module to access what we have as
ngf and ng4 so those are the directives
which are not really we have not really
imported it anywhere in our component as
well but still we were able to make use
of Li star nga for ng for now the reason
is that because again this is simply a
directive right it's not different from
a directive so we were able to access
this directive because we imported this
the browser modules from angular
platform browser and this browser module
contains the code or the definition for
the directives of ng F and in G for so
pretty much this makes this this makes
it a lot modular to import other sort of
modules and finally what goes in
providers is pretty much like your
service like if you are creating a login
application with angular and if you want
to create a persistent sort of session
so that the user can go from one page to
another and doesn't lose its the login
state so we can do is pretty much create
a user service and fill it in to
provider inside our modules so let's say
if our if your module is - if your
module is dashboard right and that
module contains components of different
different pages so you want to just hook
in providers with user service and
then this user so risk would contain all
the methods and variables for the user
data like user name or whatever you know
user profile URL and the user image URL
and all that stuff if the user is logged
in how long the user has been logged in
and all that stuff and finally we have
this bootstrap which pretty much just
bootstraps your app with the specified
components now it's very rare to
bootstrap your app with more than one
component I guess I haven't seen it
anyway
but yes very much you can do that
because it's exception array so it
probably would work as well but in most
of the cases or you I don't know if you
would ever need that but you will just
need to bootstrap only one component and
a module right so to sum up what goes in
declaration is your components and
directives and all that stuff if you
remember from that blue directed
tutorial we created I don't know a
couple of tutorials back we saw that
angular CLI automatically plays that
directive dependency inside the
declarations so declaration contains
components and directives the import
contains other modules which pretty much
gives you access to the components and
directives of that particular modules
right so declaration goes like you
import your own modules into
own components and directives into your
module and import actually impose the
full other module right now there's no
kind of relation between this imports
and this input right these two are
different things so don't confuse them
has one of the same thing so and finally
providers contains services which we'll
take a look at later on and
bootstrapping bootstrap would contain
the component you want to bootstrap
where you want to start your application
with right so that is how very much how
this ng module
decorator is laid out and that's how it
works so that's all for this one and if
you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
