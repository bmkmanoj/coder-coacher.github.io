and welcome to your second angular 2
tutorial in which I'm going to show you
how to write a simple hello world
program in angular 2 using javascript
well you can make use of angular you can
make use of typescript in angular 2 as
well and that as well and the vanilla
JavaScript as well well I'm just going
to make use of the simple JavaScript so
as to familiarize you guys with the
angular 2 because you know this language
is a bit new and if you have come from
angular 1 you have only used JavaScript
like you have made use of controllers
and directives and there's nothing as
such like controllers and directives in
angular 2 so everything is kind of
different but it's simple so if we go to
this official website to take a look at
the documentation and if I switches to
angular 2 for JavaScript right there it
saves me 5 minute we start and it shows
me a structure how the files should be
laid down don't worry we don't need all
of those then we have this package JSON
well this package to Jace well if you
know that's good but for those of you
who don't know what this package JSON is
that if this file would just contain all
of the information about your project
for example these are the dependencies
required for angular and this is the
name of your project the version and
developer dependencies and all that
stuff so how this is useful well
consider this let's just say you have
written a project for your company and
you're just giving the code with the
whole source to somebody else or from
your workstation in your office you are
just emailing yourself this project and
do on your computer at your home you
don't have all of these things installed
well one way is that you go to each and
every website and look for a CDN then
link every script download that and that
is got a hectic
the other ways that you create a package
store JSON file and use a node package
manager in PM and just install it right
away with a single command so what you
need to do is the next thing is that you
need to install or basically download
something known as NPM and for this you
just need to go to this node.js org
website and download the latest stable
release you'll see a green button down
there just download that setup it's a
GUI setup you just have to click Next
Next Next and you'll be good to go while
once you are done with this and I guess
we could just trim this file a little
bit we don't need the developer
dependencies for now we don't need these
scripts and for the dependencies I don't
think we need any of those alright so so
here's what we need for this one well
the next thing what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna navigate to my folder and
there are a bunch of open right there
right so here's my folder I'm gonna hold
my shift key on it right and I'm just
gonna click on this open command window
here if you don't see these two that
means you don't have kit installed don't
worry this would work as well so just
hit here and right here what you need to
do is write NPM install and hit L true
alright once you have done that you'll
see this new folder load modules and
once it is completed just wait for it to
complete as you can see it is completed
just minimize this thing and do yeah so
we have got these two folders angular 2
and rxjs and if I just go back to the
documentation and go down we have done
all of that stuff well here's our code
for hello world but first of all I'm
interested in just setting up the index
dot HTML file and that is
include all of the necessary files so as
you can see we have got these files
right there so I'm just kind of based
embraer so it just says ie required
polyfill so we can just get rid of these
because we don't y'all choosing
polyfills for IE then we have this load
our modules comment well you need these
three files for sure for your project
then about this script is let's just
take a look what this should contain if
I go back again this is our component
and we'll be covering all of that stuff
later on in the tutorial series we'll be
covering what this ng dot core is dot
component what the heck is the selector
template classes whatever this is but
I'm not covering it right now because if
you start covering it then this is not a
helloworld tutorial anymore so I just
got a copy and paste this right off and
we need to boot Travis as well and yeah
so here is well bootstrap this is not
the bootstrap which that twitter has
this is this bootstrapping means that
you are initializing your app so this
bootstrap is no real link to that
bootstrap of Twitter well at least for
this tutorial so we are just adding this
as an even listener Dom content loaded
so that the page is loaded you can just
even if I just change this to square J s
you can just move this file right there
under the body tag and you won't even
need to write this line so I can change
this collect selector to code damn and
in the HTML I just try to eat to write
like that and then this is kind of
self-explanatory this template means
that the selector would be replaced by
this template and this is good enough to
go alright so yeah let's just try that
out in the browser so if I just open
this folder right there and right there
so as you can see
we have written our first angular app
with the JavaScript dolly and console
logs some errors says that you're
running in development mode but all
right so it says some sort of things as
well but there's nothing to worry about
because these are in the libraries we
don't have modified so this is your
hello world program and why not just
replace it with hello angular to reload
you're good to go
well if you look in the structure you
see in the tag itself the HTML is
appended so that's how you basically
write a simple hello world program in
angular and you could probably get rid
of this as well if you want to and yeah
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial and I see you real soon in the
next one and yeah before ending this
video I would highly recommend you to go
right now
and watch some of the typescript
tutorials if not all because I'll be
probably making use of typescript for
angular 2 because JavaScript kind of
increases the complexity of the programs
when you're using angular 2 but with
typescript we have things like add the
rate input well this is an atmosphere of
six feature but it is not implemented in
the browser's yet so we can make use of
such things and it's really cool and
really easy to use typescript as well
well I have a playlist you can go back
to my playlist section in YouTube and
check this atmos crypt 6 or the
typescript tutorial and take a look at
some of those and you'll be good to go
so yeah so I'll see you then in the next
tutorial don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
