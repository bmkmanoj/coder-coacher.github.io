Miho
and in this video what I'm essentially
gonna show you is my recent app she did
offer whatsapp which actually allows you
to you know should deal messages for
your whatsapp and I know I have been
just doing these my apps shoot videos
these days but it's just that I'm just
learning some new stuff by developing
new things like I always tell you so you
might be seeing some cool video
tutorials real soon on core damn so yeah
I'm back with some fresh content I will
be actually not really right now so yeah
so what this app does is actually it
deals the messages for your whatsapp and
since we are on code damn and not
regular people so I'm just gonna give
you a little hint on how this app works
well this is this app actually works on
non rooted and unlocked devices as well
so that means that you know all the apps
which are available on Play Store right
now either requires you to root your
phone or needs you to keep your phone in
an unlocked state or you know this swipe
state right so I reviewed all these apps
and what I found was that they actually
physically starred whatsapp understand
the message through it so obviously for
that you need to keep your phone
unlocked because app cannot unlock your
phone right so what this app actually
mine app does is that it opens it opens
web tour whatsapp calm in the background
itself so that is why you need to
actually configure it a bit because it
needs to use your authentication data so
for that I highly highly recommend you
once you install this app just go to
this help just click on this help button
and you would see a dialog box
with two videos just first of all watch
the configure one and then how to use
one so that is really important for the
working of this app right so I just give
you a little hint on how this app is
working and feel free to take out
components out of this app though I am
using ProGuard
so it might be difficult for you to
reverse engineer but anyways just give
it a try and otherwise you always have
my email address to ping me so yeah just
go ahead and install the scheduler for
whatsapp this is the icon I'll just
leave the link in the description as
well if you want me to and please
install it I'll leave your review and
tell me about any glitches you find or
anything I can add and obviously please
don't ask about images support or video
support because that's not possible with
whatsapp web running in background right
because you know even right now I'm
doing a lot of hockey stuff in this
application right so yeah that's all for
this video and obviously don't forget to
rate the app as well if you liked it so
I'll see you then real soon with some
cool video tutorials about some new
things which I have learned in these
past two to three months in which I'm
not creating a lot of videos right so
that's all for this one and if you liked
it then don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
