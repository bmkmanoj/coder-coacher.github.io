neighborhood and welcome to your eighth
reactions tutorial in which I'm going to
discuss about what states are entry act
and actually how they are different from
props so in the last few tutorials we
have discussed only props but what
states essentially do is they are kind
of mutable so props you cannot modify
them their value from the child
component because react in its core
freezes this props object so you cannot
actually modify it or any of its value
inside the child component right but the
state on the other hand sort of as the
name suggests defines the state of that
particular component so in general what
the practice is is that from the parent
component you pass in the state as a
prop right you do not actually just you
know just communicate with parent which
state and back and forth because that's
kind of expensive to do but we'll just
take a look at that later on for now
let's just see what this states is so
for a state to define a state what you
have to do first is just go ahead and
write a constructor Co NS TR you ctor
and it's called the super method so that
you can just kind of initiate the react
component super first constructor first
and this constructor would get your
props right which is same thing like
this you can just store it in some
variable or something if that sort of
seems comfortable to you but it will
anyways be accessible with distal props
as well so what we can do here is first
of all of this console.log drop so that
we can see what we are getting and then
we can say that this dot state
and then this would be an object and
this would be actually your state object
which would kind of define the state of
your component right so you can have
things here which would update which
might update on a UI update like if your
component interacts with user with an
input type or you know any button sort
of thing so you can have those values
like you can have any counter here as
zero and then you can have a button
which updates this counter so that's
sort of the thing and you can display
this again with the help of this that
state dot down true like that and this
would work just fine so what's actually
the difference well the difference is
that first of all you cannot update
props but you can update state and
secondly when you update state react
would automatically rerender this
component so as to update it on the page
if any of its state values changed which
is being used by the component and to do
the hard what we can do is that we can
just create a set interval here or we
can just do it yes this way so this
would be something like this dot state
and actually it's this tested so what
this would do this method would update
your state and you just have to pass in
the values which you want to update so
you can do counter the counter or
actually this let State not counter plus
one right and you can do like it every
half a second or something so
would rerender this component every half
a second because we are changing the
state and we do not need to do anything
all of this stuff happens behind the
scenes so if we take a look here we get
error we'll see obviously we have a type
of here Co MSD are you you are you are
you see to your eye right there okay so
now you can see that our favorite number
is changing every half a second and this
is how pretty much you can do that and
one more thing I will show you is that
you can actually take a look at what
things are updating on the browser with
the help of developer tools so just
change it they get a bit slower like
every 1.5 second and to do that or we
can do is actually press escape and you
will see these two windows or probably
just weren't then you can just click
here and click on rendering and check
this paint flashing so now you can see
that actually nothing else like the
stand or anything like that updates on
the page every 1.5 seconds just be
things which are required to update that
number that particular number that is
only updated so this is how react sort
of works and you know that's why it's
efficient because it just updates the
Dom or actually just updates the part of
that Dom which needs to be updated so
that is all pretty much how states work
and yeah that's all for this tutorial
