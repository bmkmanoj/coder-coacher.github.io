angularjs tutorial and in this tutorial
before starting this one I would like to
discuss a couple of things with you
first thing that you guys are not seeing
one two seventeenth tutorial here
because when I upgraded to Windows 10
which was launched last month I
corrupted some of the files and I guess
I didn't took backup of angularjs folder
but my bad but it doesn't even matter
because I don't know so the next thing I
was about to tell you guys was that
sorry for the long delay which we had
between the 17th and this tutorial of
angularjs because I was just occupied
with some important stuff but from now
onwards I'll be continuing with the
series so thanks guys for supporting me
so far and I hope you'll do in the
future as well so from the last tutorial
with the 17th tutorial ending what we
learned is that we can create a simple
angularjs search box inside a web page
without even touching javascript code so
this was the basic structure of a page
and this was the output of the page now
for the convenience I have right now
hard-coded the JSON record file which we
had already made in the 17th tutorial
and we were loading it with the HTTP
service so you know I'm lazy enough to
start a server right now on the computer
so you know anyways now in this tutorial
what we'll be doing basically is we will
be creating an advanced kind of search
box so in the this one search box what
we can do is we can simply sort the
people on their names only
but with this search box we could sort
them on their other properties as well
so let's say I add some more properties
here
let's say I add favorite color as orange
oh not a semicolon actually I'll just
copy and paste this line and why not
just copy this one so here you go okay
so this one is orange just one is black
who does have a favorite color as black
well red green and white on blue okay
so now we have three properties per
record so to populate that in HTML let's
say I create name as person name then
age as person's age and then favorite
color as person dot and I guess I should
just change this to you know a
underscore because a dash might create
some problems so here you go
now let's loop this in the browser so
you see that okay
okay so I didn't save the controller GS
file so you see that the favorite colors
also pop up in the HTML now and I'll
just give it a little bit of space so
that it's more readable
all right so now now I'm sorry for being
such a freak but you know I really want
that visible to you guys here you go
awesome let's just remove that well you
know I'm out of touch with angular so
okay so we have got name as middle age
18 favorite color orange now let's
create individual search boxes for each
one of them so here I have my search
boxes and we'll keep the ng model of
search box or let's just remove that
right now and we'll keep the name
persons in person and filter search box
will change this one all right so
instead of the search box let's type
search Google search and now what we are
going to do is instead of just typing ng
model as search global search will do
something like this
I'll explain in a minute what I'm doing
all right so what the heck have I done
here so this one is the global search
filter and this would filter out
anything you type so this would become
clear in a moment
so this is just the name search filter
this is just the age search filter and
this one is just a color search we'll do
so here we have the browser let's reload
this page add it and as you can see we
get four search boxes in a straight line
you see so this global search filter
what it would do is it will just filter
and everything which is present inside
the records which are being displayed
here so what I mean by this is let's say
I have two blue colors right here and
when I reload then when I type blue then
you can see that both of these are
filtered out but what would happen in
the name search filter is whenever I
type blue then nothing happens because
nobody has the name blue and the name
blue here refers to the name property of
this record
so this name is exclusively filtering
these five only so whatever you type
here if it is not present in these five
then it will just show you empty result
similarly in the age this would only
filter out four numbers and nothing else
so similarly for the color one this
would only filter out the blue one and
what's the difference between this one
and this one is probably I guess you
must have guessed by now is that global
search filter is not bound to any of the
filters it would filter out anything so
you see that when I typed R it showed me
three result with three different colors
but because all of these contains R in
there
color our and our and whatever I don't
know yeah so his name starts with our
red is our is in red and our is in
orange so these three records are filter
out so that's how you work more in a
more advanced way with filters in
angularjs and while making a search box
so I think that this is a much cleaner
approach to create search boxes when you
have a lot of Records when you don't
want to get messed up with the
JavaScript so I guess that much was
enough for you guys in this tutorial and
we'll be continuing with this only or
maybe something else with angular in the
next tutorial so don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
