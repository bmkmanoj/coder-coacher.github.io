30-second JavaScript tutorial let's
continue the quiz and if you have no
idea what we are doing right now then go
back a couple of tutorials or maybe more
and you'll understand what's happening
down here okay so we were on question
about 11 so in this question we are
supplied with an array myarray and it's
certain elements and we have this my a
dot length is equal to 0 we are changing
the length 20 my added or push pin that
we are just adding this element into
this array and we have the scones are
locking this so what's happening down
here is all the twisted mystery in this
in this line so what this line does is
if you basically let's create an RA like
1 2 3 3 and 4 and if you type a dot
length we get for now basically if we
assign the a dot length to anything less
than this Agilent then JavaScript will
truncate the array and remove the
elements from the last so I'm assigning
the length of this array to one less
then then its original length so let's
see what happens now the length is 3 and
the array is just one two three and the
fourth element is deleted from the array
so here we are just deleting everything
from this area and this area becomes an
empty array like this and then we are
simply pushing this bin to this array
which creates
an array of just one element with bin
and we are just console.log in this and
this should be the answer and it is so
in this question which number 12 as I
told you earlier this string creates the
primitive value or the primitive type of
string but with the new string new
string keyword we are calling the
constructor function and it creates an
object so new string hello is not equal
to hello or basically let's set it to
triple equal to and it would return as
false as you see but string actually
creates a primitive value and thus is
obviously equal to in terms of value and
data type as well to the hello on the
rhs and thus it returns us true so this
is true pretty simple to understand
ok so here we have something twisty so
let's see
we are creating a variable X setting it
to 0 foo incrementing this variable X
down here setting this property to X and
then okay then we are returning this
function itself
oh okay so this is something very
interesting and very conceptual actually
so what's happening down here is when we
create the reason we are using these two
new keywords and it is valid to use
these two new keywords down here is
because this dysfunction the Foo
function in returning itself so what's
happening here is that we when let me
show you we are creating supposingly we
create a variable eggs with new foo I'm
not copping the function down from this
score and then we are creating the
variable bar with new eggs so this is
basically similar this line is similar
to these two lines so we are just
reducing these two line into one line by
using the new keyword two times and
since we are returning the function
itself so this basically the ex down
here should be undefined even in the
only done first new keyword so I'll show
you just this in a moment let's copy the
score down here we have this function
foo now
let's create an instance
or an object of this function
so now what's happening here is now bar
bar is actually this thing the bar is
actually this thing only so now when we
access bar dot X we are not actually
accessing this constructor function X we
are actually accessing itself and since
the owner of this X is bar and X in bar
is undefined then bar not X would return
us undefined so if we create even a
simple instance of just food with this
single new keyword then also bar dot
eggs should be should be undefined okay
so now I'll explain this why again why
this is undefined now this is undefined
because when we create this keyword bar
right here and we assign this new foo so
what's happening here is bar is
technically same too
this thing so
function foo actually so actually
bar is equal to this thing down here and
this as I told you refers to the owner
of the function and the owner of the
function is bar and basically this code
is actually bar dot X is equal to X and
since bad at X is undefined or not
defined it because we are returning the
function instance itself therefore this
thing right here is undefined so
basically when we console.log this bad
eggs we get undefined and similarly with
the second nuke you are as well will get
undefined because we are just simply
overriding or creating this function
again inside the bar but what if we
remove this line from this function and
just run it like a regular function then
what happens is it would work like
normal but we have to remove another new
keyword because this syntax is only
valid when and only when this function
itself returns itself returns itself in
the return statement so now this would
work as usual we are incrementing X the
global x by 1 and assigning it inside
the property and this should console log
1 as it is so we have the answer as
undefined
simple
okay now we have this thing now on the
LHS we have a primitive value of string
but on the rhs we are comparing the
instance of with an object string so
from the prototype learning we know that
primitive value is not equal to the
object value therefore the score is like
X is this is a string and obviously X is
not in stance of streak so this should
return us false as you can see so false
is the answer
and then we have this question right
here push number 15 and we are creating
a variable bar with one and an empty
object foo now we are creating a label
okay so don't confuse this colon
operator with equal or assignment
operator now this foo is actually kind
of just label and we don't actually use
labels very much in JavaScript because
it is a bad practice or it is not
actually required on the basis of
ninety-nine percent times you can we
write your code without using labels and
even the developers do not suggest to
use labels but basically what it is
doing is it's just simply creating a bit
label it has nothing to do with this
object so basically with the help of
food bars we are not accessing this
property because this is event this
event is not an object so we are
actually accessing the property of this
object down here which is still
undefined so food bars undefined plus
food or bar and define plus bar so
undefined plus undefined plus one is not
a number and we get not a number as a
correct answer
okay so now we have completed the next
five questions in this tutorial and in
the next tutorial will be finally ending
this quiz and I hope you enjoyed the
quiz and then I'll see you next time
