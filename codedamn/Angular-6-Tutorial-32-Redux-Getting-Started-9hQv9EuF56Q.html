Miho and welcome to your 32nd angular 6
tutorial in which you're going to take a
look at how to get started with redux in
angular and set up all the dependencies
and the installations real quick so
let's get started alright so from the
last tutorial we know that redux would
be applicable into an application with
something like this where this header
less si needs to be updated dynamically
whenever some action happens in content
or you know just header just wants to
stay connected to a particular store
which stores all the values so for
example let's just say if I log out from
here and just don't mind the handwriting
just log out this should be oh this is a
no ok so let's say if I click this
button I should update in header from
Hello whatever
- hello guest
well that was not so bad right so we can
do that by creating by implementing
Redux in such an application where there
would be a store a kind of a store now
let's just see what it would take to set
up this way that's application so they
said there would be a store there would
be something known as reducers and
actions now let's just learn about a
little about all of them what they are
we're gonna go into details later on as
we proceed
so store think of it as your database
your standard area for storing all the
state so all of your data would be
stored into this particular file right
then your reducer is something which
components will make use of reducers
will be called by the cup components to
actually update your store so reduces is
a way for components to update the data
in store and actions is pretty much what
your components would fire off in order
to fire particular reducer which would
update the data in store so let's see
how we can set up such a system first of
all I make use of the same intro project
which consists of a login application
plus registration application on our end
and if you do not have access to this
repository or rather this code the
repository link is in the description so
what you need to do is just the get
clone of I'm not sure it's link is
something like angular 6 YouTube then
there's a master branch this this is
some other branch right so this should
be some registration app I believe the
name of that branch so the link is in
the description you can throw in that
code and get started
there's also server code so we need just
need to start this server here and we
can just do that by NPM star and our
server is already or node more index
a sower is already okay so we just need
to up the mangu as well here and if
you're confused about this
I have tutorials demonstrating how to
proceed and do everything I'm doing
right here in this playlist which link
you can find in the description as well
so let's just try one more time and you
can see that we get Mongoose up here so
our server is listening at 1 2 3 4 cool
now what we can do is right here we can
say NPM start and this starts our proxy
configured server which is redirects our
API calls to the server all right now
what we can do is just go to let's just
say I go to this app not component dot
HTML consists of this router outlet what
I'm going to do is right here I'm gonna
say this is a header or let's just say
at first of all let me just create a new
component here I'm just gonna say ng
generate component header so we're going
to make this component
right here you can see that header
component is injected and if you take a
look inside its typescript file we would
be able to see that it's selector is app
header so let's just inject this boy
right here
and we can do is right here we can say
something like div ID of header we can
say something like h1 my app is the best
and then I can say div ID links on right
here I can say first of all we can just
show a dashboard link go to your profile
user or let us say yeah that would do so
we would we're gonna fetch this from the
store right so this is log out and log
out so I'm just going to say here log
out
and that's actually reacts way I believe
I'm just confusing stuff here a little
angular has a different approach
what we can do is we can say your ng ng
if log out right and again we're going
to fetch this information through our
store and right here also I can say
something like tweet message right and
what we can do is right here for header
component file you can say tweet message
is hello guest and say logout is true so
far out is true if lord is false then we
want to display the Lord thing right so
that makes sense
okay so logout is true we have a hello
world hello user message now what we
want to do is actually set up your Redux
so what we need to do for that is go to
our intro and write NPM install add the
rate angular react X which ng our X is
for reactive implementation and right
store here and let's just save it so
what it does is that it gives us access
to this redux api's through angular's
interface now redux is a cross language
solution it's not limited to angular you
can find redux on react as well so
basically what you need to do is just
install redux using this command let's
just wait here
you
okay so once that's done what we need to
do just go to let's say app module dot
TS and right here but I need to import
some stuff so what I'm gonna do is
import something from angular store and
what you're gonna import is store module
right here so what the storm Odile does
is that it allows us to create a store
provide a store to your application and
pretty much write the reducers for that
as well here so we're gonna say store
more do not provide provide or actually
what happens is that this provide store
a belief was a method which was I guess
in the previous implementation so I
believe if we take a look here to our
data stores on fire
you can see that are in grx store is
4.5.2 so before there's a little change
in the implementation of this store
model thinks so what we're gonna do is
instead of writing pro-white store we're
going to write the store more do not
fall route and right here we're gonna
pass in our users right so here this
would contain our reducers so we can
just pretty much import them as well
later on when we create some reducers
and then we can provide some options
here as well you can see right here we
get our help here
so inside our configuration we can
provide an option for initial State for
example as to say you want to initialize
your state with some predefined stuff
for example in our case would be that
the user is logged out and the greeting
message of course so we can do all of
that stuff here so here goes our initial
state and we can do something like I'm
doing all that stuff so we can say
let's say greeting message is hello
guest logout is true something like this
so now we just need our reducers
variable here so we can write something
like reducers and what we can do is
pretty much just import these reducers
from whenever we create these reducers
right so what we can do is actually just
create or reducers but J's file here or
we could have created a TS file as well
anyway okay so this should be a PS file
not a camel base to something so what
we're gonna do is inside reducers we're
gonna pretty much write our simple
functions functions which would actually
dispatch actions which would update your
store so these functions would be
similar to what you have seen so far
these would be pretty much the standard
functions we check this just accept an
action and a type so we can create a
demo function here which accepts an
action and type and this is basically
just the overview and what you're gonna
do is switch over that action so this
action is basically sent by your
component to this reducer so this action
tells your reducer that what it needs to
do so we're gonna say case let's just
say add one to state variable a ble X
and what's gonna do is return your state
dot I don't know just you just need to
map over to your state and see that
element is equal to X then state of
element I don't know you just have need
to update it and return keep returning
that element whatever you know you get
the ID
you can just update the state you can
just return the updated state here and
it will reflect in your store so this is
basically a very casual example of
creating a reducer and we're going to
create a reducer in the next video
because that's all for this one and in
the next video as I said we're going to
create reducer and make this thing a
little bit workable so I'll see you then
in the next video and one more thing if
