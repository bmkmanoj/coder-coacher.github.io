welcome to your sixth ionic tutorial I
guess and in this tutorial we'll be
creating tabs application for hot
Dammers file uploader so we'll be adding
some sort of tabs to our application
which would eventually just allow the
user to navigate from one view to
another for example when the user
launches your application you want
simply to greet them with a nice message
for a good morning or something like
that then you want actually a tab the
layout so that user could actually tap
on one tab and then navigate to
different sections for your application
so that's very much doable and very much
easy to do in ionic so again referring
to the documentation you can see that I
don't know if you can see that actually
but if I just scale it down then I get
that tab diversion lost so I'm gonna
just reduce some sort of font size right
there so that you can see that that's
how these tabs look like and there are a
variety of options for them as well
let's just take a look at that one by
one so I'm gonna just scale it up again
and then here we go so first of all it
just saves us that we should have a div
class of tabs well if you take a look if
I can just scale it a little bit more if
you just go to okay so we have got a
blown room here so if you just go to the
JavaScript right here and right here you
will also see tabs so right here you can
see that we have I on tabs instead of
diff class tabs now the reason is that
the JavaScript we actually have the
angular 2 binding so we could actually
create our own custom tabs like these
well in practice actually you would make
use of these only but
you can either way make use of that as
well and this set it work to a real
application with angular as well so
that's pretty much doable in angular as
well so I'm just gonna stick for the
sake of simplicity to the dev only for
now so now let's just reload the zoom
restore the zoo actually and where's the
tab right there here we go
so this is a simple tab layout so I'm
just going to copy this code right here
and I'm gonna get rid of this ion
content who needs it now as you can see
that we have got this tabbed layout
right here at the bottom of the page and
if you just take a look down it says a
staff can be styled to match the style
icons use these classes to change the
color of the tab bar so now right now
I'm making use of the dark one so I'm
going to make use of the dark only only
for the tabs as well so for the tag I'm
gonna add this tabs class right here and
tabs dark as well so the stabs class
would explain that this div is a tab and
this tabs dog just simply assigns it a
team so this is a simple sort of tabbed
interface it pretty much does nothing
for now obviously because we have not
started playing up with JavaScript then
we have all of these schemes you could
just try them out one by one then you
could actually place icons and ionic
comes with a lot of icons and they are
actually great so you could actually
just add them directly because ionic
already have them fished in your code if
I save this you can see that these icons
which is consisted of the home button or
whatever we had previously
convert it into sweet and nice icons and
they are actually text if you see we are
not adding any sort of images so these
are text-based icons so if you just sort
of add text as well here and not here
actually here and like star or whatever
that symbol means and settings then
you'll notice that the text doesn't
appear and the reason is that this tabs
icon only class so to avoid this what we
can do is we can just specify the
position of the text the text we are
here with respect to this icon so if I
write icon top you can see that icon is
on the top and text is on the bottom
well this one looks cool as well it's up
to you what you wish then we have I
guess icons the left as well icons left
so the icon is placed left well there's
a sort of misalignment right here but
you know if that bothers you then you
can just stick with I can't stop I comes
you know only now there should be our
icons right as well but there isn't
apparently so
we have just kind of three options for
this now this is strip style tabs let's
just take a look in the live website
what that means so you can actually
stripped standard apps
so these are strip style tabs so to
achieve them inside our code let's just
copy and paste this thing right there
let me just scale this down again so
again you can just refer to
documentation every time you want to you
know add some tabs or navigation or
check out some menus so these are two
different sort of navigation stuff we
can actually connect them as well with
jQuery or angular or whatever we are
going to use so that when you click on
this one and automatically the bottom
one automatically changes to this one
well you won't need to navigations for a
single purpose only for your application
so this is tab right here then we are
creating a simple a trifling with a tab
item of active so this active just means
that this would be underlined then we
have high class of I on home this is
icon means that this would be an icon
and I on home I guess you can just you
know just google this thing right here I
on you know tick I don't know what ionic
framework I don't remember what they
call that I own it the cons I guess I on
me dick cons I really don't I own
accounts here yep this was ionic ons so
you can just visit this ionic on con
website and they would just present you
with a bunch of icons collection and
then apparently you can just make use of
any of those for example if you just
want to make use of this plus one just
click on this button and you will get
the class you need to add into your I
dag so I've got this and if I change the
star icon to the ion plus circle you can
see that I change it to plus or two
so that's a very cool approach to do
stuff and they have a lot of icons so
you won't run out of them so you can
just give it a try then I guess we have
navigated a bit where were we on the
tabs one right strip style tabs so we
have all ready to copy the code down
there and then we have this tabs
stripped for example for this class as
well we added this tab strip tabs top
so this tab stop actually means that
your tabs are displayed on the top if I
just omit this class and save
well apparently you see nothing because
this menu is kind of overriding the menu
which is right here so if I can just
comment this out like that hit save you
can see we get that our menu back well
I'm just going to get rid of this one
for now just focus on a single menu and
we have this stuff right here then you
can just pretty much link it to your
view of your application for example
this whole one would work absolutely
fine with the hash one so that just
takes us for this page only for now then
this test would uh apparently not appear
on the page because of this item active
icon whole icon only actually we are not
making use of icon only here so my guess
is that it actually fallbacks to icon
all the I guess so you can do like that
and I guess we had this thing right here
or you know pretty much you get the idea
that we are not displaying any sort of
text which you add in here so that's how
pretty much you create a tabbed
application well I know this is not
working right now if you click this it
just highlights for a second
just diminishes but when we would cover
the basics and you know a bit of advance
for JavaScript for ionic then this would
all make sense to you and you gotta love
this so that's all for this tutorial and
