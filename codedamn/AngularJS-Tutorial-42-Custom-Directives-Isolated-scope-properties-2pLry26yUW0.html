your 42nd angularjs tutorial I'm a hole
and in this tutorial we'll be talking
about isolated scope attributes in
angularjs now in the last tutorial we
took a look at this scope right here
which creates a separate isolated scope
for this directive and in this tutorial
I'll be showing you how you can you know
just communicate between directive and
other parts of your program because you
know just cutting off directive from all
of your website is a bit sad so let's
get started now inside this scope we
mainly make use of these three
attributes the add the rate sign it is a
text get roo and this equal to sign is a
two-way bind and it would be better if I
say this is a text by nollie and this
ampersand is a one-way right now what
the heck is all of that do understand
that let's take a look at a simple
example so I'm just going to create a
simple line here first
rebel name is name simple enough I'll
let's just fill that in the scope scope
dot name is go down why not let's just
get rid of this link of function to
avoid conflicts and now I want to get
this value right here inside my
directive so how would I do that
now to do that I need to create an
attribute as name now this name should
match something on your HTML page which
I'm going to show you right now and
another it's ID the first of all let me
just write some more HTML div
and what was the directive my first
script and name equals name okay so now
what's happening out here now when you
will normally run this program this
would populate go down here as well and
here as well and the next thing you are
doing inside this directive is you are
getting the name attribute that this
attribute is same it should be same as
this one right here so these two should
match and the add the rate just says
that just text bind this one with this
one or this one gana so inside the
template let's just say value of name in
directive is name and let's just take a
look as you can see the first variable
name is godamm and the value of name in
directive is also code done so you have
kind of passed data from controller to
directive wire your HTML page and this
has happened because you have created a
new property in your new isolated scope
in directive of directive and yeah so as
told you guys that this is only a text
bind you cannot you know you can just
retrieve and play around with this
variable inside your directive but
whatever you do inside your directive
will stay inside your directive and to
demonstrate that let me just create
simple array because that would gonna
make it messy if I write that in a
single line and put type
texts ng-model
name and i'm just going to say enter new
name
okay so now what is going to happen is
obviously enter your name now what's
happening here is that first of all we
are just creating this name inside the
very new scope of this directive and
then we are prompting the user to modify
this and this kind of looks a bit broken
oh okay yeah so you need to join that
obviously okay so enter new name now
when I enter something else you can see
that the value of name in directive is
changing but it's not in the scope of
your controller and that's what I meant
by saying that this is a text bind so it
won't you know just pay back the
controller change its value as well all
right so the next thing we have is the
two-way bind now this two-way bind let
me just demonstrate that and one I'll
just create a divider directive and
second variable age is age all right the
next thing we need another attribute H
is H now again what would happen is that
when you would or just scope H is 30 or
100 when you would run this program then
100 would be would appear here and here
now you can again retrieve that this
value from your add the rate sign but
let's just try the equal to this time
which is the two way by now let's just
see what it can do so again
say arrr
first of all this is to age is equal to
now let's say value of age and directive
is age seems good but here's the rub
when you enter a new age in input type
text or number whatever model age what
would happen is that because this is a
two-way bind the equal to sign this
would okay but some problem here
syntax invalid key edge so this car some
problem with edge
okay
oh yeah all right so looks like you
don't need these curly braces here why
don't you need them is because this
equal to is a two-way bind so if you
made use of the curly braces here then
it would output the text and obviously
we don't go on the text you want in
reference to that particular variable so
that we can update it on both the places
so we just need to pass down your
variables so again this and this should
match and this and this should match so
these two should be same and these two
should be same so once you're done with
that and I guess we load our and here
you go now when I enter a new age you
can see that the value at both the
places is changed simultaneously and
here it's not so you see that text
binding just kinda retrieves your text
and two-way binding actually binds your
text to the controller as well and if
you look in the elements are in the
directive you can see that right here
the name is code down as you can see but
the age is simply the reference to that
particular variable this one okay now
similarly we have a one bit bind as well
now let me first fall quickly create a
function in the scope which would
demonstrate the one way bind and what
shall I name it let's just say hello it
the name
and right here we just want to say that
a large scope dot name simple enough
simple function and then obviously head
back to your HTML and just create a
button here so input type button ng
click load the name just like that and
the next thing we have to do is
obviously in your directive function is
below the name and again we are trying
to access something which is not present
in the directive scope but it is in the
angular's controller scope so we need to
somehow figure out how we can get this
this thing right here here without
obviously copying and pasting so we
shall make use of the one rebinding
right now go ahead here and write
function and an ampersand here okay now
we have a one-way binding reference to
that particular function now again let's
just create our final code of block
input type 'button ng click function
now this should be interesting alert
from Directive okay
so now hopefully everything would work
out okay so I guess we don't have the
values in these buttons so value from
controller and just add the rid of this
value a lot from directives okay so
let's just see if this works or not
let's click this one and as you can see
we get go down click this one and voila
we get go down as well now what happened
here
well actually what we did is first of
all we created this function ng click
alert the name right here then I just
simply created an event listener here on
this input for a click ad execute this
function then in the directive what we
did is we just created another attribute
function with alert the name now again
this one and this one should match and
this one and this one should match just
like it does after that we have again
created this function this in the scope
of this directive we have created a
reference to this function right here
the alert the name and what happens
basically is that when we click this
button right here this wordham alert
from directive it is you know just in
one way or another it is just calling
this function the function of the
controller because we are just
referencing it remember that this is a
reference so again whatever you do this
it won't you know harm your
original function and what happens if I
do this do name let us try this out okay
we get an error all right so let's just
get rid of this first and let's just try
now okay so now you see something
strange here but nothing is strange here
because if you are ampersand sign for
now for the first example the ampersand
sign was used on a function but if it is
if it isn't an ampersand for a function
that what would happen is that when you
call this function it would just simply
return you the value of your string so
again to make it work just change this
name to a function and as you can see
this works nicely not really because we
are again using ng model here so yeah so
this code would require a bit of
tweaking before it is working so let's
just change this to add the rate only
I'll have a final look at the program
what we did so far so what we have
created here is the first variable name
is go down then the value of name in the
directive is name wait a minute oh okay
all right then
after entering a new name we get a
change in only the directive value of
this name variable because this is a
text bind using an ad the read sign a
text bind but with the age when I change
this you get both the values are changed
simultaneously because this is using a
two-way bind with an equal to sign and
obviously a two-way bind wouldn't
require you to add a curly braces here
for the expression because obviously it
expects a reference to the variable
which is which has to be binded two ways
then finally we have a lot from
directive which just simply execute this
function and the alert from controller
obviously executes its own function so
against this concept was a bit of you
know how to grab grasp for the first
time so if you are facing any
difficulties then I would suggest you to
watch this video again and if you still
don't understand some concept or you
have some doubt then obviously you can
go to my forum which is this URL clan or
code on calm and post a query there or
you can comment down below but I guess
the forum option would be better because
you know there we have got tools for
your code to customize file upload
options and you know just it looks kinda
nice to discuss at a forum then in the
comment section especially if you are a
programmer so that's all for this
tutorial and if you liked it then don't
