and welcome to your eighth typescript
tutorial in which I'm going to show you
some functions writing in typescript so
in typescript what we need to do is that
it makes a bit of coding easier with
functions so in one ilaria's what I
would do to add two numbers is just
return a plus B and I would have passed
a and B here with typescript what you
can do instead is that you can
explicitly check if these numbers are
actually just numbers and you can
actually specify the return type as well
so let's create a simple function so
let's just say this function just add
nums and right here number one I want
this to be a number data type I just
make some room for it and then make a
second one would be num2 and this would
be a number data type as well and what I
want this function as a whole to return
data as the data type of the return is a
number because obviously when you are
two numbers you will get a number and I
want to return now one plus num2 alright
now if i just console.log add nums 1020
and i compile this code as you can see
it's compiled successfully into this
code but if i add something like this
and build it again you can see that it
shows me an error so what i can do is i
can just switch this num1 to any and i
can say that if num or if
type off now one equals string then numb
or if is not a number bars percent
number one to the base ten return zero
else
number one is parse int num1 to the base
then will that some simple javascript
code out there and this should probably
make our code work as well
scallop file there should be inside the
quotes so that is why you know
typescript is useful and yeah so that's
how it works so if I reload this as you
can see we get thirty as the answer
which is right and that's pretty much
how you would get started with functions
in typescript and in the future
tutorials we'll be covering more about
this and yeah so that's all for this one
and don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
