second typescript tutorial in which I'm
going to show all those Mac gigs out
there how to install and get running
typescript on their computers so I would
recommend you to use this Adam text
editor for your development of
typescript but any of these would go so
this is vs code web strong Adam sublime
text or eclipse so choose any one you
like and then what you have to do next
is install the plug-in of that
particular text editor so for example I
will go to Adam and for all those people
right there who have just installed Adam
the etc what you want to do is that you
want to go to your text editor click on
here Adam and click on the here install
shell commands I'll just show you this
commands installed shell commands Adam
an APM are installed now you're good to
go now the next thing you have to do is
go to your terminal write APM install
Adam type script and hit enter now this
would install your Adam typescript to
the this directory and it would be
available in your Adam text editor then
now I'm not going to install this
because I'll not be using this Mac for
the tutorial purposes so I'm just going
to break out of it but you have to make
this installation complete and then once
you're done installing this typescript
what you need to do is this typescript
extension what you need to do is you
need to install the real typescript so
to do that you'll make use of this NPM
node package manager and if you don't
have node which I highly recommend you
should have so go to this node GS dot
org I will show you the most recent
built for node and
downloaded it is just a next-next kind
of setup so this should be easy to work
with and then once you're done with this
hop back to this page or this video
tutorial whatever you like and then
write in your terminal npm install g
typescript and this g just makes your
package available globally so hit enter
and it's just gonna make you wait a
little bit and again i'm not installing
this on here on this Mac because I will
not be using this eventually so what
I'll be using is this typescript for
Visual Studio 2015 but once you have
done these two installations of
typescript and its extension which is
this atom extension for typescript or
whatever text editor you have this atom
type script once you have done with this
you're good to go
and then what you have to do next is
just go to your atom text editor and
start writing so that's all for this
tutorial are in the next tutorial I'll
show all of those windows guys right
there how to do the same thing on
Windows operating system so see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
