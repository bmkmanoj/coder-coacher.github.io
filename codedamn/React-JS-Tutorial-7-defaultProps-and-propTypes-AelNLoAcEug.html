meadow and welcome to your I guess it's
seven three actually s tutorial in which
I'm going to discuss a little about what
the plot type and the default to observe
so in the last tutorial we took a look
at how you can make use of props to pass
and data from parent components to the
child components right and that's
actually useful but in some cases you
will be using a component and some
different sort of parent or different
environment where you might not actually
need to pass in a certain broth so you
would actually like to declare some sort
of default values for the broth right if
they are not passed and these default
values are used and if they are then
obviously they will be over them so what
you can do is you can restore hello
planet which is your class name right
there and say default drops is equal to
and actually let's just simplify this a
little bit so then take your stock drops
platinum and right here we can just pass
a month as let's just say five for now
and what we can do here is that we can
say that phenom is let us say ten so num
is not touched by the parent which is
actually this this is actually the
calling code for this component right so
we can just consider this code as parent
so if num is not passed by the parent
then num will be ten instead of five or
you know instead of undefined which you
will get here so yeah let's just take a
look and see what happens so you can see
that we get right now my favorite number
is five but here if I remove this and
then I get my favorite number is 10
instead of you know just getting random
garbage or you know string of errors
that somebody does not exist so what you
want to do next is that ensure that this
is the if you're creating some sort of
calculator or something
then you want these to you know just
given only numbers not strength okay so
if I don't know is going to five and you
know I do list or table number of five
so I get my number is 55 where I would
have actually expected it to output ten
right so if I can do to prevent this or
you know just throw in an error to
realize make me realize that I have
passed a string right here instead of a
number is that I can make use of this
prop types just type checking with prop
types so essentially again it's the same
thing but instead what we are going to
do is hello planet lot drop types and
this is again an object and it would
give in your prop name and the type of
the object here now there are a lot of
types you can just take a look at the
documentation you will find all sort of
types here which includes like our a
boolean function number object and all
that good stuff right and you can
actually make them required as well by
using dot is required to justice pack my
fist on the hill should be here yeah
right there so you can just make that
required right so we can say that for
our views we can just pick up number we
can say that this should be a number and
this is required and actually it's not
necessary right now because we are just
falling back with default value so let's
just on with that so okay now what
happens if I see my page you see that we
get a warning
fail prop type invalid number of type
string supplied to hello planet expected
our numbers right so that kind of helps
now keep debug the code to see where the
problem is right so what we can do now
is instead of passing them like that we
can just pass it like that which I told
earlier and clearly we get 10 as the
output which is expected so that is how
pretty much you work with drop types and
default props and you can just set up
all the prop types you want with the
number of rock types you're passing and
the default values as well if you like
so that is all for this tutorial and if
you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe thank you for watching I'll
see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
