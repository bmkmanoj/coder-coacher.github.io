May ho and welcome to your free first
Android application development tutorial
in which I'm gonna show you how you can
add some functionality to these buttons
so that actually they work and just not
sit like that so so far what we have
done and actually I have made a couple
of changes I guess if I haven't recorded
them yet so you can see that I've moved
grid layout on the top as the root
element and instead of using linear
layout I'm using this textview directly
inside grid layout where the the calls
panel for I don't know why I haven't I
used that earlier but here we go and one
thing I want to do more here is that I
want to create another text view which
would be a smaller text view just above
this zero right there and it would kind
of help us or the user to know what the
calculation is right now like if you are
adding a lot of numbers together it's
better to keep track of what the result
is actually in the real time so this
would do that job and yeah so let me
just get rid of this margin so that it
just aligns with that right so what I'm
gonna do it's pretty much copy the same
thing right there and they say that it's
about 12 SP and this is small display
instead and change the padding to just
two right so yeah looks good and if I
move to my main activity now now we need
to implement this number pressed method
which we have for these nine buttons
right so first of all let's get a button
but we then what I'm going to do is get
a digit as well and this digit would be
the budget of this particular button I'm
gonna say D not get text da to strength
and then I know that this would be an
integer so integer not ours and and here
we go and thus create and teach it here
then I need the number from the screen
that would be long parse long then this
would be display dot get X dot to
strength oh I guess I pressed control f9
instead of some other combination right
so anyways so we need to now create this
long English it has no this long number
as well okay now we have the number and
the digit now again I just want to add
the digit that particular digit to the
already existing numbers so I'm going to
say number is equal to number times 10
plus digit what's happening here is that
like if I have a number X 23 then what
I'm doing to 23 is that I'm multiplying
it by 10 then adding the digit which is
pressed by user to get the result like
235 well you can also concatenate this
the input as a string but it's better if
you do it when numbers because you're
gonna make use of them anyway so it's up
to you it's your wish how you implement
that then finally I need to say display
dot set text is strength or value of
their number right so started on the
emulator
you can see that press digits like these
you can see it automatically comes into
the display just like we wanted to right
so that is all for this tutorial and in
the next tutorial what we are going to
do is actually implement these buttons
so that they work instead of just
sitting there just like we did with
these nine buttons so yeah so that's all
for this one and I see you there in the
next one real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
