dear 46 JavaScript tutorial in which
we'll be walking with forms and regular
expressions combined for validation
now without regular expression you may
be able to validate forms which are
simple enough like if you want to just
check the length of the string entered
the substring and all that small stuff
you want to check but when things are
like you're checking for an email
address say that you want to add the
rate sign a top-level domain and all
that complex check of an email address
and we have say you want to check for a
person's name or anything like phone
numbers if code address or anything you
want then the traditional JavaScript API
is not that much effective to check
against and validate against those input
so we have regular expressions for forms
as well so let's say basically using
validation on forms themselves would
allow you to save two-way run for your
script for example if you don't have any
validation on the front end with
JavaScript and you're validating all
your data on the back end then what
happens is sometimes user summits and
your
would runs to back end and then receives
all that stuff and then the page reloads
we just kind of time-consuming and
frustrating for the user so what you can
do is you can just validate the data on
front end as well as back end so it will
not cost them a couple or more of trips
to validate the data completely so let's
see how we can build a regular
expression validation for form so first
of all we need some forms up there I'll
just give it an idea of my form let's
say
the squared input type of text and let's
get an idea of name and a placeholder
let's give it name so that it's easier
to catch up what I wrote in the browser
then
the next one should be what you say
email let's go with emo and placeholder
email
okay so we have got name we have got
email
and the next field we could go with a
dress that should be interesting to
validate actually a dress here we go and
if you basically look at regular
expressions then once you grab the
concept then after that regular
expressions are just a cakewalk just you
need to know about the basics of regular
expression and how they all are working
so let's go with phone as our last
folk whoa pho and a last input field
I'll just go ahead and would create a
type submit button
and well you should be obviously go or
some it or whatever and down here let's
just grab it or basically we don't leave
this idea at all I'll just do on summit
while he did this so when this button is
click that means when this form would be
submitted then this function would be
called so let's with this function down
in the script while I did this and let's
first of all return false and I'm doing
return false so that it doesn't take the
default action which the browser is
supposed to do if I pass you say like
action right here so if I do like action
ABC dot PHP and I pass return false in
the validate function then this form
would not actually summit to the site so
anyways let's clear that first of all
let's grab all the data we need to have
so first of all my ID
you say name dot value we need the value
as you know then we need the email I'll
just go get out
who needs to type all that stuff the
next one is address copy that the next
one is phone copy that
that's pretty much it so name
the email should be email address should
be address and phone should be phone
obviously and let's go ahead and create
separate regular expressions for each of
them and I'll just go with literal ones
make sure you will name them different
because for each validation we need a
different regular expression and for
phone reg X and this should be addressed
reject so we just don't read Eclair a
variable and we are good to go so let's
begin with name radix so for the new one
what I need to do is first of all the
name let's say my name may hold Mohan
now this starts with a alphabet
obviously and contains a space and then
my last name which is my surname so we
need to check against only
Paulie alpha myths and a space obviously
no formal name would contain actually
our number or any special character
unless you are doing a username or
something like that so first of all what
I want to do is I would create a range a
to said I want the name to have P to Z
and for a space I would just press my
spacebar and inside this range I have a
to z and a space non the space right
here signified that it could be either a
to Zed or it could be either a space so
to do that first of all let's say a
should begin with this thing and I would
just remove the space because this thing
right here would signify that it should
either begin with any alphabet between A
to Z or a space but we don't want it to
begin with the space so let's remove the
space right here I would write a plus
sign here so that it's at least one or
more
letters in name and now let's create
space range so that at least we have got
as things then again we could create it
who said or something like that
so basically we could actually do it
like question mark so to make this thing
optional right here and finally let's
make all of this thing
case insensitive with this flag of I and
now we have got a nice regular
expression and make sure you end it with
a dollar sign so that at last we have
this range of A to Z in the last so the
user doesn't end it with a space and we
could actually do a plus sign here so we
have got a nice little regular
expression for checking out the names
now email and I guess I guess I had put
on this email right here in the 44th
tutorial and I have explained it well I
guess so I'll just copy it from 44th so
I need not to write it again but if you
want to understand how it is working
then you're free to go to my 44th Street
Oriole and I'll be happy to explain you
and we can just make a couple of
amendments to it I'll just say that it
should begin with this and it should end
with this so that's not required
actually unless you are doing some hard
code validation
let's do the address one so for the
address one what I want to know I want
to upon to half from the user is either
a to said in their address a number for
their house number
and his space they want
a comma they could have in their address
a period
and
they could also have a - so that's
pretty much I remember which is in a
particular address so if I missed on
something you're free to go and write
your own one and this should be at least
one or more and should end with itself
and should start with it as well so
there's a regular expression for the
address 1 and then we have the phone 1
the phone 1 as you know would contain
only digits and I would like it to begin
with a digit I would like it to end with
a digit and I would like to have exactly
ten consecutive digits in the phone in
India we have four numbers in the format
like +91 is the extension for India then
nein nein nein nein nein nein nein nein
nein nein or any other number which are
ten so this is a mobile a typical mobile
number in India so I'll just go with my
format of the Indian motion so now we
have got all these regular expressions
ready to be tested against these strings
we have a let's test each of this so
let's say named reg X dot test
and let's say for the first one I have
name
similarly I'll just console.log the next
lines next couple of lines as well
so email regex goes here address one
goes here and phone one goes here and
similarly evil here address here and for
here so we are good to go
now here's my browser window right here
unless reload this and I've got a nice
farm that's open inspect element so it's
easy to grab what we are doing now first
of all let's click on go so
okay so I guess there's something going
on here let's say with German Wally did
this and now let's check this out okay
so that's fixed so return false was
actually not returned in the main
function so now make sure you type
return while I did this and now once I
reload this and click on go with nothing
inside this so we get all the four as
false that means the input is not
accepted from the user now let's say I
give it a name Meho and go
I just clear the console so you click on
go and I read true in the first one
because may hold is the valid name and
if I give it me home often as well here
the console though it gives me true but
once I include any special characters
like an exclamation mark and then gives
me again false so name one works
perfectly the email one as from the next
tutorial the previous one this would
work good I'll just got to clear this
too so we're good the true one but this
will not
so this would not so here you can see
and for the address one this would work
whoa my address just popped up so the
address one would work as long as you're
supplying some good amount of Patras
chew but if you do like something like
that while invalid address then it would
pop up false again again for the phone
one as well if I do like this one and
click on go it would pop up true but not
for some invalid phone number pop up
false so that's how pretty much you
wanted an address
had a phone number and the email and the
name in regular expressions and that's
how you use your form regular
expressions so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial and I'll see you the next
time don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
