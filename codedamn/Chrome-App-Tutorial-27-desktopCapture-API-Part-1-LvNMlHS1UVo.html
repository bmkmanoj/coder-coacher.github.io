your 27th Google Chrome extension
development tutorial Adam this tutorial
I'll be discussing a very special kind
of API which Google Chrome provides you
the developers and which is desktop
capture a beer
now using desktop capture API we can do
stuff like capturing the screen of the
user now most of you would already have
seen many of these extensions on the
chrome web stores so why am I talking
about this
now basically I'll tell you one thing
that I recently bought a Chromebook
which was not a chrome pixel but just a
Chromebook which obviously comes with a
chrome OS now Chrome OS is kinda just
made for you know just made for powerful
web searchers and people who are just
interested in just having up short break
on websites and social networking sites
and Chromebook just comes with a Chrome
browser and you could actually add
pretty much just the applications and
extensions which are available on the
web store and nothing else so Chromebook
is not like you can install heavy
softwares on it unless you obviously
switch to developer mode and install a
parallel running Linux operating system
which I have already done but I was just
telling you so now yeah so I was telling
you that I recently bought a Chromebook
and as I told you it only comes with a
Chrome Google Chrome browser and one
problem I found on that is that I cannot
record my video tutorials on
phone book because either I have to do a
screen share on my desktop itself or I
need to somehow figure a camera a
different type of camera which I could
place at a certain distance from the
screen to record but that all was very
uncomfortable so I googled some screen
recorders and as you can see my this
account is synchronized with the
Chromebook so install the screencastify
recorder on my Chromebook and it
automatically got installed on this
computer as well so the problem was that
this screencastify is a trial version as
you can see you are using a
screencastify light recording length is
limited to 10 minutes which is very much
restrictions on the youtubers who are
kinda looking for doing more things but
right now I'm not using this
screencastify because I have a different
software on my Windows PC so I was
telling you guys is that this light
version embeds the local as well on the
top of the recording and it's kinda
restrictive so I had decided to create
my own screen recorder extension for
Google Chrome and hence I decided to
teach you guys about this API as well so
this API is pretty much straightforward
and simple and is very convenient and
easy to use so let's get started and
I'll show you how to setup your manifest
in this tutorial because I've already
spent a lot of time while explaining
what we'll be doing so this is my
manifest from the previous extension we
developed so I'll just remove
which is not necessary or I guess we
could just replace instead of removing
so let's say the name of extension is my
screen recorder which obviously would be
the best screen recorder in the world
and the description should be allows you
to record your screen that's pretty much
it
now browser action let's leave the
browser action for now and the
background page I guess we need some
background scripts running so
I guess I'll just go with
it's grips here
and inside this
I'll say script ah yes but after you
shake right uh Cheers
okay so we have got our background
scripts ready and version as well and in
the permissions what we need is dick
stop captures so in the permissions
section just type dick stop capture
obviously we will need storage and other
permissions as well when we are
processing the video or the screenshots
but we'll add them later with our needs
so that's pretty much it the basic of
the manifested chaser and you would
require from this for this development
of this extension and in the further
tutorials I'll be showing you how to
code such an extension and probably I
would be completing my this extension as
well within this tutorial series and
would be launching it on the store for
you guys to test it out
so that's it for this tutorial and I'll
see you then next time stay tuned and
