second part of CSS properties the your
22nd HTML and CSS tutorial so let's
continue with our properties of CSS we
have been learning from the previous
tutorial and let's close this so in the
last tutorial we looked at some
important CSS properties are in this
story let let's look at some more so now
let's create a div with let's say text
wall and in a CSS let's give it a width
and by width okay so now mind
let's give it a background right now
I'll teach you about width in a minute
let's get a background read let's reload
this now you see that Dave by default
would span the whole site and would take
the height of the font of text so if I
make like font size 30 pixels then I'm
giving it a 30 pixel height so what if
you want a limited width and height of
the day without increasing the font size
so to achieve that we have the
properties named width and height
so now let's work with width and height
let's get in with 100 pixels and height
hundred pixels as well now what happens
is instead of spanning whole side this
will now span only hundred pixel area
and 100 pixel height and let's remove
the font which we have already done
let's reload this
what the heck
okay so I wrote the background as well
so it's not visible let's give the
background that's red let's redo this
and so we have got a nice little square
on the screen now let's say I want to
place this text in the word center so it
kind of looks like awkward in the top
right top left corner actually and to do
that we can make use of the text align
property which we learned about in the
next previous tutorial unless we load
this have you got a problem right here
that though it is aligned Center
horizontally but it is not aligned
Center vertically so to do that we have
the rescuer as line height the line
height property would create
basically okay so this is a kind of
advanced thing I'm gonna tell you so by
default this text would occupy the
height the text I'm talking about the
text not the div remember that so this
text would occupy the height of its
fault so what you do is with the line
height we actually change the height of
the line or height of the stakes without
actually modifying the size of the text
let's make it to work and you realize
what I'm telling you let's give the line
height exactly equal to your height
so now let's reload this and what
happens is this text right here gets
perfectly centered across the square and
why does that happen because width and
height are similar and we are giving
line height as hundred pixels then what
happens is this take starts from here
and the height of all the sticks is all
the way down to this height and by
default texts are automatically
vertically aligned as Center so this
would align your text in the very center
and the next thing you have got is a
font weight property and font weight
would technically specify that your font
should be bold or your phone should be
normal
our your phone should or your phone
should be bolder or although we don't
need the spoiler very much but still
it's good to know
so font-weight:bold would actually work
like the B tag in your HTML so now you
know how to replace B tag with CSS so we
use make use of font-weight:bold unless
we know this and we have got
text as bolded now the next thing we
have is the font family the font family
would actually allow you to specify any
font on your webpage which is either
located inside your computer or on
somewhere on the web so in this tutorial
we'll be looking at only the fonts
inside my computer because it would take
I guess a tutorial more for
understanding how to make fonts on the
web
so now let's specify a font and I guess
I should go with caliber II now caliber
II is a pre-installed font in ms word so
it should be available in my computer so
click will close attention to pay close
attention to this font and once I reload
the font family or the font should
change to caliber II let's reload this
and as you can see we have got a change
in our font so now instead of the normal
I don't know it's like maybe it's times
new roman' or Arial by default in Chrome
I don't know you can check that so now
from point X which was an chrome by
default we have changed the font to
calibrate wrong shape stick color as
well
so we have got a nice little square
inside of white background with text as
war in between it okay so next property
I would like to discuss with you art
comes to my mind is text shadow now text
shadow
would pretty much give your text a
shadow a drop-down shadow which you used
to do in Photoshop so no need to create
your logos anymore in Photoshop you have
your CSS in your hand so let's go ahead
and write the basic text shadow I'll
explain what I'm doing here so now for
now let's reload this and as you can see
we have got a nice little black glow in
the background and now let's return to
core and what's happening here I'll tell
you now this zero right here signifies
the x-axis of the displacement of the
shadow this next zero right here is
signifying the y-axis to display
displacement of the shadow and this
valley right here five pixel is the blur
amount of the shadow and this is
obviously the color everything separated
by a one-sample of space so now let's
give it a value like 10 pixel zero five
pixel black let's reload this and as you
can see our shadow moved a bit less
zero actually so you can actually view
what's going on so now we get whoa if
you look carefully in the background if
you have also got info in the background
not this is a shadow the black one is a
shadow and since we are using no blur
effect on this it appears just like our
white text so let's give it a wide
displacement as well which would be ten
pixels let's reload this now the zero
zero coordinate for this shadow down
here is the top more top left corner of
this word W the letter W so ten pixels
means move 10 pixels says to the shadow
that moves 10 pixels to the right of
this word which is right here and 10
pixel to the bottom of this word which
is right here and since the blur effect
is 0 then there's no blur effect and it
just appears like the text itself
let's give it a blur effect of 1 pixel
and let's see what happens let's reload
this and as you can see the shadow is
kind of blur right now let's make it
some more like 5 pixels let's reload and
they've got a blurred shadow now and
let's change it to 0 and 0 again Alice
turned it to white
now let's reload this
and we have got a white glow but lack is
pretty much more visible so let's use
black and we've got a black crow
okay so now what should I do
yes so now we have got a square let's
learn about border-radius in the last
tutorial we learned about border which
is like water to pixels solid black
we lured regard to picks in blackboard
around it and model radius is kind of
special so bottle radius would actually
curve your corners and would make these
corners curved now let's see see that in
action so I guess I would resize this a
little bit so it's kind of visible Alice
we send the font size as well to
something like
sixty pixels or so let me see if it's
even visible yes so you have got this
big box and let's make use of the bottle
radius now let's see if I give it 10
pixels though it's a small value but
let's start with 10 pixel public who pay
close attention to the butters right now
they are as sharp as a knife but now
once we reload this they get good and
the curve is the radius of 10 pixels so
mathematically when you complete the
circle then the radius of the circle
would come to be 10 pixels so that's
what border radius is let's see if I
give it a higher one you like hundred
pixels let's reload this and we have got
this kind of appearance like here now
let's say if you go really crazy and
give it a lot of large value let's
reload this now finally it would stop
after becoming a circle because you
cannot actually turn a circle more to
become a circle so the main aim was of
what radius was to go
dika understand when you technically
curve the corners hundred-person
to form a circle then you cannot apply
anymore by the radius to it so basically
if you do like anything like that then
this basically doesn't mean anything to
your browser so it will actually stop
once it reached receives the 50% radius
and you could also specify both radius
with the help of CSS so let's say if I
specify one person while the radius
let's reload this and as you can see we
got the radius as one person of this
length as the circle one is given 10%
let's reload and we have got a 10%
radius
let's give it 50% now now 50% will
actually form a circle as you see on
even on 49% we have not got a fully
formed circle but though it looks like a
circle but it's still straight as some
edges but on 50% this technically means
a complete circle if you go any larger
than 50% then this means no value to
this so it will just act like it was
stopped at 50% so let me gather my
thoughts again what do go with next
okay so the last thing we would be
looking at this lesson would be cursor
now you see that I take over my cursor
to sublime it becomes a I shaped cursor
I take over my cursor to the browser it
becomes this arrow I take over my cursor
to this whoa text it becomes a I shaped
again so let's say I want to get a hand
when my mouse is over this so what I'll
do is I'll type cursor as a property
panel right pointer now cursor:pointer
stands for when the cursor is over this
div then this cursor should not be like
a default cursor but should act like a
pointer so when I reload this and when I
hover over this div which is a circle
then I get a pointer now notice that
even on the clothes attempt of this tape
I'm not getting pointer but once I am on
this div I get the pointer so that's
about person and we have got a couple of
more values for this cursor:pointer and
if you want to let's see what they are
and just like we have pointer for the
cursor we have a value called move now
this move let's see what it does let's
reload the document and when we reload
now move would actually change a cursor
to something like something you can
track but it won't move obviously
because we don't have the functionality
ready for it
so basically with CSS you can change the
cursor to move then we have I guess
cross here yeah so we have cross here
which would kind of create a plus on
your div as you can see which kind of
acts like if you're cropping an image to
select a portion of image or anything so
cross here would create a plus sign the
help the help cursor would create a
cursor with a question mark I guess yeah
so help would be
basically your choice for abbreviations
when you're doing every Russians on site
on every visions and then we have
not allowed so not allowed would give
you a restricted cursor and we would get
this cursor if you see this red with a
not allowed sign which says that do not
click over here or do not do anything to
this area this is not allowed and we
have got progress as the value so these
are some of the values I remember and
there are many other you can use so we
have got a baroque rest right here
aerials god yeah so we also got a weight
one so we just like progress running
circle would appear but only the circle
world so this kind of happens when your
computer gets hacked so
that's all for this and oh yes so
actually you could you also use none for
your cursor so your cursor becomes kinda
invisible when you're hovering over the
element now my cursor is invisible when
I hover over this element because I have
specified cursor to be none
so my cursor is right here between a and
H so when I am out of this my cursor
appears again and you could actually
give your cursor your own in your own
image if you wish to example let's use
this as the cursor image and it looks
like a dumb idea but never mind and just
like the background one you specify
cursor URL in H dot PNG the same I let's
reload and
okay so let me see car sir URL
I guess and now my guess is that this
image is too big to be a cursor
now let's Google for some small image
and I'll find one and would good get
back to you
let's see images let's get a small one
for us and why not recess this a little
bit
icon
and guess what this would be fine
I guess yeah so let's download this one
let's save this as HTML and CSS cursor
dot PNG and here we go now let's use
cursor dot
PNG as cursor whoa
URL cursor dot PNG
and we've got the corset RPG so why the
heck isn't it working
I can do auto let's reload this okay so
basically you have to give it a fallback
if the URL is not available so there are
some kinds of restrictions
so to summarize the scarcer thing up so
to give a cursor your own custom URL
first of all you have to follow some
dimensions you could not have a big a
jumbo jet like cursor for your website
then secondly you have to specify a
fallback but this means that when the
cursor is not available this URL is not
available then use the auto cursor which
is the default cursor automatically and
you could also use like cross here here
cross here and let's reload this and
this works because we have this URL
which available but if I rename it to
something which is not let's reload and
we get the default course our fallback
as cross here so that's pretty much how
you give cursor a URL an image would go
make sure they are of perfect dimensions
not basically perfect but smaller
dimension not very large and that's all
about this part of CSS properties and
we'll be learning a lot more CSS
properties as we progress towards the
end of this series
so that's all for this tutorial stay
