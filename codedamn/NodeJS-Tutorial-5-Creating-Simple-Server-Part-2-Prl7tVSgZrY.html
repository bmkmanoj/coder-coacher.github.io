hole and welcome to your fifth node.js
tutorial in which I'm gonna show you
some more things which you can do with
the server which we programmed in the
last tutorial so in this tutorial let's
see what we can do so I'm just gonna do
some housekeeping now so I'm just going
to clean some things here so let's just
say I just switch this to HTTP ad then I
quit server HTTP dot create server
engine and then I want server not listen
one two three seven this is the same
code as it this is but what I'm gonna do
is I'm just going to add another
function to this now what happens is
that or I guess I should just close the
node first so that doesn't just eat the
memory so what happens here is that this
function is called every time the server
sends or basically server receives a
request from another computer on this
board so node is watching over the sport
or localhost and every time node
receives a request this function fires
up so if I just do console log server
was hit by a request and that's got a
way of saying that you have a request
from a user or anything like that so
yeah so we what we can do else is that
I'm just gonna say console log console
log response because response looks
great so I don't know what this response
contains and remember that this console
log is not the console of your browser
so this console is not this one so you
probably might have
thought that this would console.log this
thing into here no and we'll just
console.log in the terminal so all of
the score is executed on the server and
then accordingly things are sent to the
front end so let's just compile this
again not compile cutoff so as you can
see it gives me server was hit by the
quest and if I reload this you can see
that this uh fires up the engine because
that's why this was there and again are
just our website is struck in a boot
loop you can say and this is my response
or yeah response so it just says domain
events all that stuff which I don't need
and alright just let's just get rid of
that I'm just gonna show you some
interesting properties so I just gotta
quit the server for now clear this thing
up while I just reset so as you can see
as soon as I close the node server the
request or the connection gets refused
so what I better to do is I'm just gonna
say bring back both of these lines and
just gonna save requests from page and
right here request dot URL so let's just
see what happens next
so I'm just gonna say no script v dot J
s so was hit by request this just fires
I don't know why
so maybe just notice just take a good
test so as you can see now that it says
me here they're from server request from
page slash so what happens if I do like
path one two three as you can see the
it says we request from path one two
three well this is obviously kind of
vulnerable to show your path like that
because obviously I can do something
like I won't approve this and
fortunately no one is converting that
into escape HTML but you know I would
still want recommend you to do something
like this
to show your path or basically to leave
any thing which is you know just
submitted by user and just explicitly
displaying it on your web page so that
is kind of all available so you get the
idea you know just that this request dot
where it is yeah it's a request dot URL
just returns the URL which is being
requested by the client so obviously you
might be thinking that using this you
can just place a billion off if they'll
statements and then just show the pages
to call organically well no we have got
a better approach we have got better
frameworks actually so to deal with so
so yeah so that's all for this tutorial
and you can just console.log the request
and response and check them out and
there's a lot more to server than this
you could actually create your own
responses in there and yes you have the
file responses or image responses which
you can send to the browser which we
might be looking when we are done with
basics of node so I just don't want to
get in that topic real soon because you
know let's just take it slow and easy so
that's all for this tutorial
