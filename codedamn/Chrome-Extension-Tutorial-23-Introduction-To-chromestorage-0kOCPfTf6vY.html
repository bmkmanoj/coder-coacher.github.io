Google Chrome tutorial number I don't
know maybe it's 22nd or 23rd but that
doesn't matter so welcome to this
tutorial in which we'll be looking at
something called chrome storage and
we'll be doing that with our Google
Chrome extension which we'll be
developing in a bunch of tutorials away
so what exactly is Google Chrome
extension storage API now let's say you
want to create a extension or a plugin
in google chrome which kind of accepts
something from the user and stores it
inside the extension and then after a
day or two it pops the information out
to the user so how would you do that
with JavaScript we have access to
anything that user enters only unless
the Chrome browser is not shut down or
this session is not destroyed because
since JavaScript is running inside the
Chrome
therefore once the browser is closed all
that JavaScript information and memory
is lost so to fix that Chrome provides
us with an API called Chrome dot storage
for Google Chrome extensions and what
does it help it helps the developers by
providing a local storage inside the
Google Chrome browser itself where you
can store and retrieve data so recently
I had been developing a plugin for
myself which allows basically to you
know just regulate the tasks tasks
evenly because often in the habit of
forgetting what I was supposed to do
when I stood on my PC so I've been
lately developing this extension and
would be launching it if I got some time
to you know just dress it up a little
bit so
Chrome that storage is the key you want
so what this would do is this would
locate your extension a space in the
hard drive where you can store your
whatever you need like the bunch of text
user supplies you anything the codes the
URLs which you just say sends you in and
yeah from the last extension we
developed if you remember the Twitter
tweet not far we would also merge my
this mini series of from the storage
with that extension and make it even
more powerful to remember that whether
it was the account of the user did
receive any notifications from yesterday
or day after yesterday or whatever it
was so that was a basic introduction to
Chrome but storage API and its benefits
and how it can be helpful to you and
from the next tutorial onwards we'll be
working with
Chrome that storage API with the help of
the almighty documentation of Google
Chrome and that's it for this tutorial
very much and I'll see you then don't
