and welcome to 26th angularjs tutorial
in which will be continuing without
providers which we started in the last
tutorial now the last tutorial I told
you about what providers are and how to
create a simple provider using this code
pretty much right here now let's take a
look how you can create a simple
application which creates user on you
can see the time of the day so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna return something
as let's say set greeting here and I'm
going to create this other function and
I remember I told you that this get
function is executed by the injector and
I don't want the set creating function
to be executed by the injector I want
this to be private so you can't access
it right here
you can't so where I'm going to access
it well I'm going to access this inside
application config which I told you
earlier now what I'm going to do is
inside this set grading function I've
got a set
let me first create a create variable
and I'm going to set in crete equal to
value and this value will get from here
now what i'm gonna do is i'm going to
create an application config here and
right here i'm going to create a
function and i'm going to pass not that
date but something as date provider now
remember that we learn about route add
route provider now this route provider
comes from route early so can access
route here you can only access providers
in config function you can access
directives you can access controllers or
anything else factories or your services
but you can only access
Leiter's so when you create a provider
you can access it as the provider name
name here and adding a provider suffix
to it now my name of the provider is
date the providers of X and then just
carry on with your configuration now
first of all let me just show you my
console logging what date provider
actually is let's just take a look here
you see that day provider is an object
now this returns is an object and inside
the subject if you see then we have two
functions you can say a get one which is
for the injector you can even see here
something is done by that on a set
greeting which is our you know which I
want to work with so let's just take a
look what we can do so to get to set
greeting function and to get there what
I have to do is they provider dot set
greeting no no they provider dot set
creating function here and since we have
to set something to this I'm not gonna
console.log this but I'm going to go to
lock the show lead function so what I'm
going to do is state provided kit as
console so let's just reload you see we
get a function as the response and then
I can just do like this to execute this
and then we again get an object which
gets us to the show late now if I do
like shown date
it will give me dready which is what I
want so I'm gonna say that this is time
equals this one and if time is let's say
greater than zero but time is less than
nine I'm gonna say or not pain let's
just say twelve I'm gonna say did
provider dot said greeting to good
morning else if dime is greater than 13
but time is less than let's say 18 or 17
and remember we are working with 24 hour
clocks here said query good day else
time greater than 18 and time less than
I guess I'm missing a few ourselves I
guess there should be 12 to 17 and this
should be 17 to would you say let's just
give it to 19
I'm going to say a provider dot said
creating good evening and otherwise I
want said greeting good night all right
now what it has done is it has actually
set this function the creat one a value
now how we can use that well I'm gonna
use it inside here because obviously
this get good access this one so or not
well I guess can it well yes it could
because we have created this wall read
as variable above return so everything
inside this can access and modify the
screed so let's just return something
like hello it's not to sell over let's
just return the quit and it's
are right here alright I guess this
should be fine so let's just do the show
date function or I guess this would
create a little bit of problem because
the show date right here which we are
returning would not return that the date
dot ours
added side decreed we have undefined so
I guess I can create just showed it
function showed it for Def developer
showed it and it'll just wait on us the
simple one or even you could use the get
date here only that wouldn't make any
difference they've showed it sounds cool
and then we can used it not shown it
here now let's just take a look at hit
here let's reload okay so we have some
errors here so we have unexpected
identifier here okay I guess I forgot a
comma here let's reload this again
oh okay so we have some sort of error on
here
oh I guess this would be elusive
all right so as you can see what I got
is goodnight it's ready because it's 20
and it doesn't fit in any of these
categories I got that message but if I
do like if it is less than 21 that I'll
get good evening
now this very dynamic kind of
application because you are just scope
that greet messages data showed it and
nothing else
everything else is managed by the
provider and the configuration of
application now date provider as you can
see is accessible inside confirm config
applications or config and you can't
just pass here did it won't work because
inside application dot config function
you can only pass providers now that is
why we made use of route provider
instead of just route so that's it for
the providers tutorial and I hope you
liked it and if you did then don't
