google chrome extension development
tutorial are in this tutorial we'll be
learning how to download any extension
without actually installing it so
basically an extension of chrome is a
CRX file dot C our X file which is
nothing but a zip file with a changed
extension name so I found this awesome
website chrome Chrome extension download

URL and it would give you a CRX file so
let's do it let's do let's say dead
lockers this is my plugin extension kind
of Google Chrome which I have recently
updated this is the word and it allows
you to bypass any URL shortener like ADF
ly and add fork and all those nasty URL
so this is my extension on chrome store
and suppose I want to download this
extension but do not want to install
this extension this is already added to
chrome because I have already installed
it so let's see how can we do this go to
this URL Chrome extension downloader
there you go paste this URL download
extension and keep this file and you're
good to go so here's your extension if
you want to view this then rename the
file to CRX from CRX to zip and click on
yes open this file it would contain a
folder metadata just delete it it's not
required ok let's an extract this first
here you go delete this folder and you
have the extension in the raw format so
this is how you download an extension
without installing it at you its files
and how the developer made the extension
so this for the short tutorial about
downloading an extension without
installing it and I'll see you then
