Mei hello and welcome to your 33rd
angular 6 tutorial in which we're going
to take a look at how to create a
reducer using the ngrick store module so
let's get started okay so we have
already covered a little bit about what
reducers are and what they do
melissa's quickly or go what reducer
actually does so a reducer is nothing
but just a simple function which would
respond in certain actions dispatched by
your components and with those actions
what it can do is that it can update the
state the main storage area of the
application so what we can do to create
a reducer is that reducers nothing but
just a simple function so before that
let's just create a folder here and we
just say is this as store so that we can
just keep the redux Tings separate from
our applications components and all that
stuff so this would be store and
reducers so this would consist of let's
just say this is my a producer but des
file so what happens here is that first
of all what we need to do is export a
function which is our reducer so I'm
just gonna export this function as a
reducer and what happens is that this
reducer would have an initial state
obviously when any component calls this
particular reducer for updating the
state of the application it would
already have predefined state before
right so what we would do this is to a
state of initial state if the state is
not defined if the initial state and the
second argument would be of the type
action now what this action is that
these are the actions which would be
dispatched by the component
so for example if I click on click on
logout button somewhere in my content
area then there would be an action which
would say log out so I dispatched that
logout action to this particular reducer
and it would update the state and anyone
who's subscribing and listening to that
particular value inside the state would
get immediately notified for example in
the header so once we have this action
with us what we need to do is actually
just pretty much switch switch on
something known as action dot diaper now
what this does is that every action has
a type which defines what the action is
doing and you can add some data as well
that's that's the standard convention
obviously you can do it any way you like
but that's the standard convention right
so what happens is that you can add
something like action or data or action
lot information or whatever you like
here but just stick to one because after
that you can create some static type
checking as well if you stick to one
then what we can do is that once you
have the action or type with us we can
add some cases so in our case what I'm
gonna say let's just say case is our
actions logout and I'm just gonna update
the state by returning the new state
like this and I'm just gonna say login
status is false or just logon false
right now this is just the destructuring
operator so we are just restructuring
this initial state 1 and what we can do
is right here we can define our actual
initial state so we can say that our
must say initial initial state is
something like which consists of login
as false and pretty much we can add some
more details here as well and obviously
we can
to perform a lot of type checking with
typescript by just defining some
interfaces like let's just say a
producer state and I can just say that
this is login state as boolean and then
I can just pretty much add it a producer
state here and once I do that what we
can do is basically if I'll try to add
something else here as true it'll just
show me an error that it's not
assignable to this interface we just
need to update there as well
it's for your convenience okay so once
we have that state we can start defining
the actions we are going to use so what
I'm gonna do is create another folder
here we're gonna cover actions in a
different tutorial probably in the next
one but let's just get started with it
for now so I'm just gonna say input this
is the action log out from my action
actions directory let's just create some
actions list this name this is AB
actions right so you're just gonna
create this file real quick right now
app action store TS and what it would do
let's just keep it simple right now
export let's just say this is log out
right so now we are switching over to
action log out yeah we would have you
could have made use of simply log out
here as well will it matter but when we
do this what happens is that I can
access the same variable inside my
component as well so if I want to change
this if I get to know that there was a
typo here and I want to change this I do
not have to change this in two files two
separate files we can just change it
right here inside our actions and
basically this helps us to keep options
in a separate file as well so let's just
revert it to that and once we have that
we are returning
login as false and I can create another
action another case here which is action
login and I can see that this returns us
the state and login as true and I can
basically import this as well and I can
say just like that
and obviously we can just return our
state just in case nothing matches here
and we have to just make some changes to
add module as well so once we do that we
can make use of a service or something
to inject that service into components
and then subscribe those components to
any changes and basically we can just
start messing around with the relax so
that's all for this tutorial and I'll
see you then in the next one and one
