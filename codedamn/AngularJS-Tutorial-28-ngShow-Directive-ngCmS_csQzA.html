cheer 28 angularjs tutorial this is my
whole heart and this tutorial we'll be
looking at ng-show directive in
angularjs now ng-show directive
basically creates a kind of if-else kind
of thing in your HTML ollie which allows
you to set conditions when to show
something and when not to and obviously
that would be governed by javascript and
basically by the scope of your program
so let's create a simple application to
demonstrate what I'm trying to say so
let's say you have some messages and you
want to toggle those messages to one
message to another would help of a
button so we can do this in a weekend in
a jar in our JavaScript said area of
message and then we can toggle it with
the help of array or we can even set
those messages inside the HTML only and
then toggle those now this this thing
can be useful to those guys who are
looking for like I don't know in search
engine optimization what Google does is
it crawls your whole site and it looks
for content so if you're using
javascript and probably it will miss out
what you have on your website so let's
say you have like your h1 tag here are a
big heading here which is used for
optimizing your website for better CEO
SEO sorry and with the help of angularjs
you can even use JavaScript to do that
job by hooking up the content in the
scope but you would like to do that in
HTML only so that in Googlebot can't
fetch it easily anyways let's get
started so let's really simple up and
let's first of all just create a button
which will say toggle message so down
here what I'll do is I'll create a demo
of message and what I'll do is ng show
now ng show will accept a condition as
the value of this attribute and what you
have to write here is your variable name
which will be the string inside your
JavaScript so for example let's say
message 1 is true or just a show then
what I want to do is I want to write
this is my message world and otherwise I
should probably change this to class
because I guess I need to use it twice
in my code so I'll change this to
initial message to is equal to is equal
to show okay or I guess maybe we could
change it to like show is message 1 and
show its message true so oops ok so this
kind of looks more meaningful now so yep
okay so now let's just go to our script
that's a spirit
something module it is main app so app
dot control let's just say this is a
pecs
dot controller ad okay now what I want
to do is right here I am gonna set a
variable show inside the scope so don't
forget to pass on the scope and what
I'll do is I'll say scope dot show
equals message one which is right here
and I'll just give this button it click
event
so scope dot toggle what it's gonna do
is it's gonna change the scope not show
I'm just gonna explain what I'm doing
here
okay so I really expect that you guys
know what this is but if you don't then
I guess you should watch my JavaScript
tutorials I have explained that and a
lot of other stuff in JavaScript well
there well this is a shorthand for
if-else statements and this is called I
don't I don't know it's like something
called shorthand for that I just forward
this official name but yeah there's a
shorthand for if-else when you have just
like a single assignment or whatever
person you want to do so what happens is
scope dot show is basically getting a
value based on this condition now if you
look carefully then this condition right
here and this condition right here looks
got a similar but obviously this is a
condition which governs whether to
display the step or not
so scope dot show gets the value govern
on this condition so if scope that show
is message one right now then assign
this value message to otherwise assign
this value message one so that's how
this application actually works and let
me see if everything looks good yeah
okay so let's just test it out in the
browser
so it is let's reload that okay okay so
we get both of these message and we have
some universe in the code oh yeah of
course
and now I guess this should be good to
go
let's just reload yet so why don't click
the star will mess and you see this
message toggles continuously so what
happens behind the scenes is angular is
basically checking
strain that a little bit so angular is
basically checking here if show which is
the variable available to this
controller this scope of this controller
is message one then show this message
one otherwise if it is message to then
show this and you could similarly set
other conditions as well and obviously
then you could make it more advanced by
making use of classes and styling things
but in this tutorial I just showed you
basics how you can use ng-show directive
do you know just toggle from one content
to another or even display some
customized content based on the
conditions set in the HTML itself so
that's all for the story all and if you

thank you for watching I'll see you next
