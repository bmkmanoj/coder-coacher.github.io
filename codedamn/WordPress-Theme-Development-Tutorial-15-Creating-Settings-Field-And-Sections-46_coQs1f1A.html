tutorial my name is Mei hole and on the
story L what I'm gonna do is create some
options on the settings page so that we
could actually interact with the
database and the browser and with the
user obviously so before creating
options what you need to do is actually
create a section so like if you go to
journal then you'll see that it shows
you like journal settings in one place
and it kinda just have one sort of
section right now so it's the journal
section which contains all these
settings but let's assume that you are
working on a team which group contains a
lot of you know settings you need to
work on so you need to create sections
out of it so that you can manage it
properly so to do that what you need to
do is actually inside Armistice create
another function let's just say this
lets the team team settings right there
and right here and this function what
I'm gonna say is first of all add
Settings section hit tap and it shows me
the ID title callback and page let's
give it an ID of let's just say this is
the index options a title would be like
home page settings then a callback would
be fired whenever this section is added
so let's just say this is team homepage
options and for the page I'm gonna say
that this would be official team
settings
so that it works right here on the
homepage so okay so when we are done
with the sections stuff you need to add
a field and before that actually
register a setting so what this register
setting means is pretty much that you
are kind of creating input sort of field
but actually registering it and
WordPress so that WordPress knows that
there's our input field in a code so the
option group would be anything but you
could you have to just make sure that
you make use of that optional group if
you have fields in a particular group
and this would become clear in a moment
so let's just give option group a value
of let's just say homepage option let's
just make it optional and then next was
the callback I guess so for the next was
option group option name so okay this
would be homepage option group then the
option name would be let's just say this
is my black box and remember that this
name right here would be the name which
we are gonna make used in the input type
text fields and then for salad I scroll
back I guess I could just leave it for
now so we have this register setting and
then what you need to do is add a field
so I'm gonna say add a settings field
and what its gonna do is actually create
a field for you based on this callback
so ID would be again something like
black box text then this title would be
text
you know slider the callback would be
blackbox callback let's just say the
page is actually right here the official
theme settings the section has been C
within this section now this would be
right this one
let's leave the arguments for now we
don't need them okay
so now we have added six settings field
as well let's add this black box
callback so I'm gonna say this box
scroll back I'm gonna say that echo out
input type text' name and make sure your
name matches now this black box right
there placeholder would be some text
sort of for now and I guess for the
settings section we have this as the
function name right so we could just
create this one as well
let's just say this is simply customized
home page settings and what this is okay
so this is some sort of mystery function
so let's just get rid of this now what's
that really
yeah looks like it is so anyways now
once we are done with this if I go ahead
and reload this you could see that
pretty much nothing happens because we
need to make some changes in our admin
dot PHP file as well let's just quickly
do that so I'm gonna say this is for
action and let's just leave it blank for
now method post' then inside here I'm
gonna say that PHP settings fields now
this is option group now this would
allow you to echo out reasonable things
like your in text fields and all that
stuff without actually just writing all
that stuff right here so it's easy to
enter the optional group so this would
be not this one this one will be the
option group this would just echo out
all the associated options settings
associated with that and then you could
do like PHP do settings sections so to
as to echo out at section so it asked me
for the page then I'm gonna say that
this is official theme settings they're
actually just get rid of these then we
need to our summit button as well so
this is summit button sort of so I guess
all of the arguments for summit buttons
are optional but you can just like say
like save to this and pretty much it
would be good now reload
and pretty much we get only the summit
button so now let me just see I got it
so so you're not getting the input field
which we probably should
so my register setting is homepage
option group that black box then add
Settings section we have the team index
options right there then we have the
home page settings yeah aren't even
getting that much steam home page
options right official team settings
nothing wrong in that then I add
settings field team settings
Oh worry we aren't even sort of doing
anything to this so what we need to do
in here is add our action admin in it
and don't forget that because admin and
it would be fired whenever administrator
area is done so right here here we go
and if I reload this now you can see
that pretty much I get some sort of
information which just sees home page
settings which comes right here which is
the section so you can think of this as
a section then customize home page
settings is to call back which I Rafi
received after this home page settings
section was loaded then text below
slider comes from right here in the name
of the field and then we have this input
field and as you can see it's sort of
CSS customized a little bit by WordPress
itself that is pretty much how you can
create this as you can see if I save
this it isn't actually saving right now
properly because we are missing like ooh
value and some sort of attribute right
there well we can add that but I'm gonna
leave that for the next tutorial and if
you like this then don't really
