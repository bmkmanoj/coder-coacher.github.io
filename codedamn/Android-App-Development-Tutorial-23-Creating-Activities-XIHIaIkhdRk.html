your 20 card android application
development tutorial my name is mehul
and in this tutorial I'm going to show
you how to add new activities to your
project well actually let us first
understand what the heck is this
activity so if you remember from the
starting tutorials I told you guys about
the life cycle of an activity right so
an activity is pretty much just a page
of your application you can see like if
you have a appt l'occasion like your
website like if you are coding that your
website is having a section like home
page about contact you know a couple of
more pages so if you're calling your web
application native instead of browser so
what you could do is that you would
create four separate activities and
you're gonna then say that the first one
is your homepage the second one is your
about or whatever the heck you name that
so what happens is that with activities
you could do cool stuff like you just
layer on with activities you can just
throw on the user from one activity to
another and pretty much exchange the
data as well activities would allow your
code to be organized and pretty much you
don't have to redraw on the same screen
again and again unless you want to
create again well that's a different
story so to create another activity what
you have to do is go to your first
application app and make sure you have
this change to project some people have
this like Android so this is kinda
stupid so just changes to project and
you'll be good to go let's go to first
application app SRC or whatever your
name here is so then you have to go to
main Java and right click on this one
and create new
java class right so I'm just going to
say this is secondary activity right and
this creates a new Java class and if you
take a look at mainactivity.java and
secondary activity java the only
difference is these to import lines and
this override function right so just go
ahead and do that as well and just
import these two and just copy this
override function as well just get with
us this one right so need to have this
one as well and you will actually just
do activity instead of this app compact
activity you know you don't need because
this app compact activity is just a
subclass of this activity ollie because
activity is the boss right so acti we
take ok so there's time for right so can
we fix that can we fix that can we fix
that inside Android studio tell me
rename a CT i v-i TTYL refactor boy and
here we go so pretty cool right are we
done yeah probably so the next thing you
need to do to register your activities
you need to inform Android manifest just
like I told you that this is the
information hub of your application so
you need to inform that now to register
another activity just go ahead and write
activity Android name it will
automatically suggest you a name for
your activity depending upon your Java
file right and right here you are pretty
much done right you could just make use
of this android screen orientation or
whatever you want to do and do not make
use of this because again this is a
launcher activity so want your launcher
activity to be male
to be only and not to confuse Android
manifest what the heck to launch when
the user taps on your activity right the
next thing is that this setcontentview
would accept an XML file or rather not
well right now we are making use of this
as an XML file but actually you could
just overwrite the ondraw function of
the view to create like if you are
creating a game so you need to override
that on draw and just draw a canvas and
application on that but we'll just take
a look at that later on so right now I'm
just going to make use of XML files only
so just go to your wrist resources
folder and inside this layout you would
see this activity mean you could pretty
much name it whatever the heck you like
just make sure it follows the Java
conventions no dash or not only soul
numbers so say it like my friggin or
actually you just don't need to write
that capital right my freakin activity
layout cool I'll root element just make
sure it's linear or relative or whatever
the heck you want it to be so I'm just
gonna say this is text view and by text
I am rather bad activity why not and
make sure to start that so that you are
safe on Android travel center right so
that it really looks better right so now
you need to set it to r dot layout dot
my friggin activity layout really cool
name isn't it so now what would happen
is that too when you run this
application you would see main activity
but how the heck would you access this
second reactivity
well if you are really desperate right
now to access this what you can do is
you can just go to Android manifest and
pick up this intent filter and paste it
right here right so knife you start your
application you will see that a badass
activity is there actually instead of
just a regular activity right so here
what we have done is that I have created
this activity as a launch for activity
right so that is kind of a stupid way
but how do we really go from one
activity to another well we have to make
you something known as intense well
intense is a story for another tutorial
so that is all for this one and that's
how you pretty much quit an activity for
your project and if you like that then
