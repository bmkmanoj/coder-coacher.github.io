May hole and welcome to your I guess
14th at my script six tutorial in which
i'm going to show you a real interesting
thing in JavaScript our es6 proposal lab
should rather say and that is that they
have brought in classes for es6 now what
these classes would allow us is that
pretty much what we used to do in simple
javascript like object prototype proto
type dot dot dot methods and functions
similarly we could do all those stuff
using oop style programming syntax so
that's pretty much same the syntax is
pretty much same with other languages
but it's a bit different but the core of
the javascript is still upload a dipole
inheritance model so what i'm going to
do is screw the simple class with the
help of class you would then my class
name and right here just like we have to
instructor functions for all other
languages we have a constructor function
for javascript as well and right here if
i do like console.log yeah and right
down here a shame say my shape is new
shape and looking in the browser you can
see that we get here because this is the
constructor so what I'm gonna do is just
get in the name shape name and I'm going
to assign this to my shape name and this
obviously refers to this class right
here all right now just reload this and
we'll get nothing out of it because we
haven't making haven't made use of this
right there so what I want to do is
possibly passing out something like a
square or something like that so what we
can do instead is that actually you can
just write in and your are a name like
allowed ships and yeah one more thing I
want to tell you that right now for
right now es6 what we have is that you
cannot you know work with variables like
if I just do my array is 123 and just
visit the browser you'll see that will
get a error in the console this is
because the current es6 implementation
does not allow you to declare the
variables or the properties in this case
like this so you need to declare them in
a sort of a function so if you just
check this out right now you'll see that
it would work perfectly fine all right
now I'm gonna take this like allowed
shapes shapes and inside there i'm going
to say square rectangle circle for now
all right now next thing I'm going to
say valley date shape i'm going to call
this function and don't forget to append
this to that and down here i'm gonna say
validate shape is a function which would
just check if this dot allowed shapes
dot index off shape name is greater than
minus 1 then i want to return or
basically since this itself is returning
a boolean value we can simply do return
this dot allowed shape start index off
and that thing right there so what we
can do is actually just get rid of that
right now and inside an area function
what i can do is i can say if a valid
shape is there then if this dot shape
name is square then return now we need
to somehow get the dimensions
that shape so what we can do is actually
just get it as a constructor so I can
just pass in a dimensions area here and
I can say this dog dimensions equal
dimensions so I'm going to see right
here that this dot dimensions 0 times
this dimensions 0 and the reason i have
created this as an RA is because for
rectangle will require two sides so you
know just creating a lot of arguments
you can do that as well by getting
multiple arguments but that would mean
one on the same thing at the end of the
day you'll be creating an area out of it
so I'm just doing it straight away ok
the next thing else if this dot-shaped
name is and you should probably want to
see code a little bit better is
rectangle then I want return this dot
dimensions 0 x 0 this dot dimensions one
else if this dot shape name equals a
circle then I want to return this dot
dimensions 0 times this dot dimensions
oh no not really because for a circle we
have 2 times math dot x times then we
have only the radius so pretty much we
are done here otherwise if there's
nothing such like that what I want to do
is return false + 4 here as well I want
to return false all right ok so now
looks like we are pretty much done so
right here I'm going to pass in an array
of square and a site then i'm going to
say console.log my shape not area and if
i check out the console
validate shape is ok so just miss that
reload shape name is not defined oh this
one should be this as well make sure you
put this all around so as you can see
you get hundred and that's perfectly
valid for square because 10 x 10 would
be hundred and for a rectangle let's
just say I have five and 44 let's reload
we get 25 that's pretty much strange
thing five and forty four gives us 25
console.log this dot dimensions reload
reload reload reload rectangle do we
even oh ok so I'm going to pass in
rectangle here as well so that should
probably do the job reload we get to 20
perfectly valid and for a circle I need
to just pass inner radius of let's just
say 22 all let's just say what should I
do let's just go with tenali reload we
get a sort of decimal number because pi
is irrational so JavaScript just tries
to write as many decimals as it cool for
the pie so that's a simple JavaScript or
es6 program for class and pretty much i
have shown a lot of stuff in this in the
next tutorials will be discussing some
of the more stuff related to class and
do all about that so thank you for
