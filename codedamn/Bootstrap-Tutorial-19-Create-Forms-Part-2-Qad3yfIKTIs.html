19th bootstrap tutorial in which I'm
gonna show you how to add some more
things to your form so let's get started
now in the last tutorial we just created
a simple form with just two input boxes
now let's just spice it up a little bit
and before doing that let me just make
it a bit nice I adding a heading let's
see your information if you look at that
in the browser that should look better
and as you can see this looks better
than before because it looks like more
customized now okay so let's get back to
work now let's just add another form
group and let's just see select your
skill and right here what I'm gonna do
is I'm just not
queered a simple select menu now if I do
like option programmer and programmer or
rather what should I write here is who
are you that kind of looks challenging
so front-end programmer back-end
programmer and full stack
developer and why not just replace that
developer because that kind of looks
more awesome so as you can see this
style is sorry this select is ugly right
now so what we can make use of is we can
add the same class which we added to the
input and that is the form control and
take a look here you see it becomes nice
and buffed up kind of so let's just
quickly add another font group and let's
see here
your monthly pay and obviously I don't
want the user to mess with this because
the company would decide it and I just
don't want the user to come and write a
billion dollars per month and bankrupt
the company so let's just copy this boy
and paste it here so what I want to do
is I just want to write value us a
thousand dollars your monthly pay for
six months that kind of looks more legit
so I don't want to mess around I don't
want the user to mess run this number so
I can just add a disabled attribute from
html5 if I reload this you see we get
both an icon which says don't try to
attempt to disable and to edit it and
the scanner becomes grey out as well so
that's how you create a disabled input
and similarly you can create a disabled
select as well by just adding the same
disabled attribute if you reload this
you see that you can't select this
either so I'm just gonna get rid of that
for now and would leave this to the
input only okay
the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
show you how you can add an input box
with an icon besides it so you know in
some sites you see that there's a kind
of a user a user icon appears on the
sign up input just before where you have
to enter the text so that kind of looks
nice so let's just learn how to do that
and to do that obviously we wouldn't it
need the same things again and again a
form group with this thing and let's
just say do or let's say enter your full
name as a signature right the
placeholder us may who as the ghost text
and what I want to do is I want to
create a glyph icon now this cliff icon
as we have seen before it is the same
icon which we make use of here in the
caret I guess no no the card is not
using any icon it is using pure CSS but
yeah you can you know just get some
cliff icons by googling them and just
write G ly th icon bootstrap I will take
you to the components page and here are
all of your cliff icons so let's search
for the appropriate graph icon and
probably let me know if you find a good
one
how about flag maybe so we can just make
use of this whole class right here to
copy this class
go ahead into your same Dave which is
containing the input or a span tag span
class your copied class and yeah so
let's check this out in the browser
let's see if it works or not you see
that it cannot overflows obviously we
don't want that so to fix that what we
make use of as we add another form
control feedback class so this class
what it does is it would just align this
cliff icon to work somehow with this
input I'm just gonna show you the core
as well so you see that it kind of looks
better now but you know it is still
missing a bit of your you can say this
piece it should have so
this is it this should not probably
overflow
I guess adding position:relative to it
should work no all right as a quick fix
but you can make use of is you can just
add some right to this so it should work
probably without that as well but this
will work as well so if you write your
name like that and that would probably
show up there so yeah so that's how you
add some elements to your form and
obviously you know how to create a
bottom I'm just gonna copy and paste
this one so yeah you can just make use
of the form group again if you want to
just copy this come down replace this
and obviously we don't want all of that
again no data toggles no carats and just
submit the form if you take a look here
and then you gotta see there you go so
that's how you create a basic form with
the help of bootstrap and that's all for
the story and the next tutorial I'm
gonna show you how you can do something
else with bootstrap so that's it and
