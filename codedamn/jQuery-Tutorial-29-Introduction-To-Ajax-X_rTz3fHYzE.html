J great tutorial in which will be
discussing something called Ajax in
jQuery now not technically jquery ajax
is the feature of javascript but i'm
explaining that in jquery because jquery
makes it a hell lot easier to use ajax
and transfer data with the jacks which
will be learning in a minute so a JAX
what is Ajax actually so a checks is
kind of a way to load data under the
hood so the best example would be like
if you ever browsed facebook then when
you scroll down your timeline your
newsfeed you can say then you see that
the new posts appear magically now how
does that happen without even loading
the reloading the page or without even
you submitting any data how does
Facebook load the new items in your
newsfeed automatically whenever you are
about to reach at the end of the page
now they do that using Ajax which you
are going to learn in the next three
tutorials now one more example I've got
in my mind right now is that whenever
you use your gmail account or
whatever mail service you are using
probably yahoo or gmail or outlook or
whatever then most of these have a JAX
implemented in their inboxes so whenever
you are for example i use gmail so
whenever I am in my in my bar in box
area then I don't need to reload every
minute or two the check for new emails
they automatically come and my title of
the tab is automatically updated with
the number of new emails I have received
now they they do that with Ajax now
we're going to learn what this Ajax is
and how is this going to work so let's
get started okay so first thing we need
to work with a Jax is you have to have
this library obviously vamp talking song
name so anyways now let's start it so go
to your script JS file I got mine and
just type your normal waiting document
already function and i'll just create a
new file right here which just says
load me dot txt this will just say this
is a dynamic curly stored next okay now
what we can do is we can create a dev
right here now this would be the
simplest example I've ever done with the
jacks but that would be the best one to
explain to you guys divide in my life
simple as that I'll scrub the Spidey
just say my Dave dot load load me txt
now if I open my browser and let me tell
you guys first of all that your code
won't work if you try to do that because
because there has been a security
implementation a security breach I am
performing right now which is I am
loading the file from
the file protocol so you see right here
if I inspect element in this page
and I go to networks and I just reload
this again you'll see that this load
mean that txt is requested on file
protocol and javascript is traditionally
not allowed not allowed for security
reasons to load anything from the file
protocol because file refers to the
system of the user and javascript is not
allowed to tamper with the system of the
user obviously because that would go
security reasons then why the heck this
is working on my computer so the answer
to that is that I have disabled the
chrome inbuilt security feature by
launching chrome in disabled flags mode
something called flags mode and you can
just google load documents from file
protocol and chrome just google that and
the steps would be easy if you don't get
that then leave that to me Alex bring it
out in the comments section but anyways
the more valid way of doing this thing
is to launch your site on a server and
then perform a JAX request but for the
sake of simplicity of this tutorial I'm
not using local host well
truly I just screwed up my HTTP dot
configuration file and that's really
embarrassing but you know I can run my
stamp right now on my Windows PC so
sorry about that guys so anyways you're
free to try that on your local hoods but
not on file protocol unless you launch
your browser in a 1 Rayburn mode which I
don't recommend for browsing but yeah if
you're the then you know that matter so
anyways now what we're doing here is we
are just simply saying inside this
jquery that my dave right here should be
loaded with a text file load v dot txt
and since this is available in same area
so i don't need to add life I'll hold
that path to do that so it will just
work like this only soloed me a txt
works just like this and we'll be
working on more of a JAX method and
trust me guys this is not just limited
not load method there are many more
methods in the tracks and we would be
working on all of them and i'll be
explaining you that eventually so stay
tuned with me don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
