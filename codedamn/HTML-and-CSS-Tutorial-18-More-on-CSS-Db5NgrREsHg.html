18th HTML and CSS tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be looking at some
important CSS syntax properties and how
you write CSS basically so that we don't
encounter any problem while writing it
on some production site or life site so
I would explain you like this in your
HTML document technically every element
would accept a style attribute like your
B has an HTML for it had aligned
attribute which accepts left right or
Center and it's completely deprecated in
html5 so say no to align and not never
ever use that so to right align this
what we make use of is called a style
attribute now the style attribute is
mostly available with every element in
HTML and you could kind of apply a style
to any individual element
using the style attribute with the
element name and just like an attribute
it would its value would be written in
quotes and for example for now let's say
text-align a colon and right and we
would be learning about this these
properties in next tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm just teaching you about
syntax to write basically to start
writing your CSS programs so now when we
reload this we get it as right-aligned
so to write CSS for videos you write the
element name with the style attribute
and the style attribute is special
attribute for CSS commands CSS
properties and this would accept CSS and
how do we write CSS we'll discuss in a
couple of tutorials and for now let's
say if you don't want to write it
directly in the element itself but you
would like to have some separate space
for CSS and the elements so what we do
is write this style tag just like we
have this style attribute at the same
time we have the style tag and the style
could go
technically anywhere in your document
but I just chose it inside head because
you know that's just kind of tradition
to write it inside head keeping all your
scripts and style and CSS files inside
head so anyways so though it is
cascading style sheet but we write the
tag name as style so style inside all
this would be passed as a CSS and
everything you write inside this would
not be actually visible on the document
as you can see we only have hello world
on the document and not add this crap
even if it's invalid so how we write CSS
how to make use of CSS we'll be learning
in the next tutorial I'll see you then
and don't forget to subscribe and thank
