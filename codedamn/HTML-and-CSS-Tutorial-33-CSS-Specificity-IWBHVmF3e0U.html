33rd HTML and CSS tutorial in which we
will be discussing about a very
important concept in CSS which most of
the people on this planet don't know is
CSS specific
now C is a specifically not to threaten
you as one of the most important and
difficult concept to understand in CSS
though it is not much of that used in a
while you are doing practically some
things but when you're debugging your
CSS code for example when you try to do
that why your properties won't well were
not applied then the CSS passivity would
help you to understand so say I have a
div right here
with ID as my dev and class as well as
my div so let's say I have a long
sentence right here hello world how are
you
I'm just playing
CSS so I have the sentence right here in
San Mateo which follows a ID attribute
as well and a class 1 as well which is
perfectly valid so let's move to our
style sheet and if you notice I've
already linked it with the external
style sheet and let's say I create div
color green
and mind if color blue so dave is right
here targeting the stiff and dot my div
which is the class it's also targeting
my div so what's your best guess is
which style would be applied with the
sentence be the sentence would be blue
or what this sentence would be Queen so
let's see what this would be let's
reload this page and as you can see the
sentence right here in front of you is
blue now why is the soap what did the
browser did not follow this div and this
is all about CSS specifically the choice
of browser to follow a certain style
rule or neglect is third instar rule and
this is not a random thing so this is a
systematic thing which you we can
understand by understanding CSS
specifically so let me create a nice
table right here and if I haven't
explained you the comments in CSS they
are pretty much like a forward slash
with a star for the opening line and the
star with a forward slash again for the
closing comment so right here everything
you write would be ignored by the CSS
file so
okay so we have got the honor as style
and ID
and glass
and then element so these are the
priorities of the browser so style by
style what I mean is the internal style
for example I give style right here as
color pink so when I reload this then
the color is pink instead of blue
so the browser first of all would look
at any style which is applied with the
style attribute on the element itself
once it finds it then it would ignore
all these and if not then it would move
in the table so the next time the next
thing this
bow trouser would follow is the ID one
so ID we don't have any ID selector
though we have a idea sign but I'm not
using any ID selector right now so this
is blank then it would go to class right
now we have a class with color blue so
this has to follow class first and then
to the element which is the element
named selector so this kind of happens
that if you have a class first and then
the element then this would apply this
would follow the class one so okay you
would ask me that man if we have
something like div dot my div color blue
let's just remove that and we have let's
say my div now notice that in this line
I am targeting every dev on the document
which has the class as my dev which
obviously refers to this day only and in
this line are targeting everything which
has the ID my div but in this table
right here if you notice that ID is
preferred over classes and elements so
what would this make any difference that
if I use tip dot mind if instead of
basically against this ID one and my
answer is yes it would make a very much
difference when you use something two
things or more things together
two or more selectors together basically
and that's how pretty much like your CSS
specifically works so all these are
assigned a special quantity for example
for style we have
a thousand points for this style
now this okay try to understand it like
this way let's say when we apply
something with the style then browser
says okay so award this the stag right
here with a thousand points when the
style is applied so when the style is
applied then thousand points are awarded
to this element and if not then nine
points then on the ID one the ID is
assigned a hundred points so whenever a
ID is present in the this your CSS file
then a hundred points would be assigned
to the ID the class the classes aside
ten points so whenever a class is
assigned then it would get ten points
and with the element obviously with one
element you have got a single point so
in the last browser would sum total
everything so for example
let's say you're right here
my Dave okay so my Dave how many points
are assigned to my Dave and you'd say
that you see that an ID we have got
hundred points so the total is hundred
all right and in this Dave thought my
day you see that we have got an element
and they've got a class so the total
point is ten plus one and which is 11 so
since 100 is obviously greater than 11
therefore the browser would follow this
style right here instead of this tile so
this style would be ignored by the
browser and this style would be followed
by the browser and similarly we have got
a lot of and other things that well
actually you could use like HTML body
then like body dot class 1 then HTML at
class 0 so let's say if I apply HTML
class 0
body class 1 class 1 it should be class
1 sorry class 0 because we can't
actually start the classes with a
numeric value same with the IDS so the
total of this would be now 1 for HTML 10
for class 0 1 for body 10 / 10 for class
1 1 for death and 10 for class Madoff so
the total is 10 plus 1 xi + 10 21 plus 1
which is 22 32 and 33 which is still
less than the ID 1 so now you understand
the power of IDs and CSS now one thing
before I stop this tutorial is that let
me tell you about a special keyword in
CSS which is important and it's
important kind of and it's important as
it is spelled so this is important and
if you notice this exclamation mark
right here then
this is basically what it differs from
property and thus keyword so let's say
you have this not my Dave let's say with
the div which has the least value of one
so now you know one is obviously less
than 100 so this style would be never
ever used by the browser but let's say
the style is somewhere hard-coded in
some other library file which you don't
have access to so you want to apply some
styles forcefully on the browser so what
you'll do is you'll take your property
any property would go and let's say
color should be red and with the space
or with not without a space it's up to
you both of them are correct press a
exclamatory mark by shift and pressing
your key 1 and type the keyword
important and this important keyword
would mean that this tile right here
should be forcefully applied to your CSS
of the browser and this important is
this important keyword is appeared to
everything and stands for a value of
10,000 so you see how difficult it is to
override this important keyword because
its value is 10,000 whereas the value of
style is a thousand heidi is a hundred
classes is ten element is 1 so this
important let's see it in the browser
let's reload this and now you can see
with the least value of one we are
applying this important and right here
the value becomes 1 plus a 10,000
which is if I wrote it correctly it's
10,000 won yep so 10,000 one is of
obviously greater than 100 so it
overrides everything in its way so
that's how pretty much CSS selectors
work with CSS specify and I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial and if you have
craft this concept then congratulations
you understood one of the most difficult
concepts in CSS so I'll see you then
