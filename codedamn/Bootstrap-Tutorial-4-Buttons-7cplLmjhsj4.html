fourth bootstrap tutorial I'm a hole and
in this tutorial we'll be taking a look
at buttons in bootstrap the buttons in
bootstrap is a fancy way of creating a
big button saying let's start or let's
continue to your website or whatever you
want to do with these buttons bootstrap
got a lot of styles and kind of
variations of colors add buttons for you
to directly change and pick them from
HTML only without touching the CSS files
so to create a button let's see how you
can do that so first of all go ahead and
type a button tag and apply a class of
and what this class would do is it will
just grab those styles or those
information required for that styles
from these to any of these to wherever
it files this finds this class and would
apply on this button so I'm just got to
say that this is a button obviously and
how this button would look like is the
second is my second class so I would
like it to look like a default button
within bootstrap so I'm just gonna say
here this is or let's just begin it with
our hello world thing which we already
did and I guess first tutorial itself
but no problem ok so let's just take a
look at the browser let's reload this so
you see that we got this nice little
button here so you see that this is not
a regular button because if I just
create a regular butter again but
without any classes then see what comes
on the screen so you see this is our
regular button but this is something
special
now let's just create some more buttons
with this
I'm just got a copy-paste this again and
I get because we are gonna need this
alright let's get back to work so let's
just say this is success this is primary
and there are a lot of classes you may
or may not feel the need to memorize all
of these because all of these are
available on internet or on my website
as well I'll leave a link if you want to
so all of these classes are there and
some more to add our link info what's
next de jure mrs. Shriver Bo
Warnock let's just test this out
okay so let's just reload this so you
see that we got a lot of variety of
buttons better add a br to all of these
for the sake of clarity alright so you
see now that we have got hello world
hello world hello so what's the
difference so you see this is the
default button if you see right here
yeah this one then we have the screed
button which is the success one this is
the primary button the blue one the link
is not a butter actually it would behave
like butter but it would kind of look
like a link so you see that this other
lines where I hover over it it returns
to its original state where I just leave
that and then we have got the info
button which is the blue one the light
one then we have the warning button
which is which is an orange button and
then we have in danger button which is a
red one and then we have our default old
home HD button now we have a lot of
buttons as well and you can obviously
create some new buttons with CSS but
these were some of the buttons and
bootstrap and as I said these are not
the all buttons available we'll be
technical look at more if we need and if
we don't that we won't simple as that so
that's all for this tutorial and in the
next tutorial we'll be looking at some
more features of bootstrap and very soon
we'll be starting off with creating a
page in bootstrap as well so stay tuned
