express tutorial in which I'll be
showing you how to create a very simple
HTTP server with HTML files and making
use of Express so when we created our
server with node we just made you use a
simple hard-coded text right there and
nothing else so let's just make use of
some HTML files to send data to the
browser so similarly just like we did in
our hello world in Express I'm just
going to say functional request response
in here what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to say a response not send file
and the send file what it would do is it
would just send a file to the browser so
I'm just going to say this is files or
I'm just going to say this is index dot
HTML and what I'm going to do is inside
files I'm going to create a new file
index dot HTML and I'm just going to say
oh so you know I was just use two of our
sublime so in sublime we have a plug-in
I don't remember the name we just
automatically populates that HTML file
there you go hello there this one as
well so send file and now how would node
or express kind of know where this file
is so I'm just going to say that the
root of this file is path dot join now
for this path is another
our module from node and that is kind of
very useful to you know just process
parts and just work with them so but the
gern would simply join two parts which
I'm going to supply now and will join me
apart again so I'm just gonna say direct
name and and we are in files so we don't
need to just go back so you can do this
thing write that as like as well and
yeah so that's pretty much it and yeah
so let's just try that out first on the
browser and if I just run the terminal
it saves me that it's listening but I
just want to revamp that okay so we have
not initiated the server yet poor me so
I'm just going to say app dot listen and
do I just type all that code again let's
just copy and paste just like that and
as always and as you can see it serves
me an HTML file and I can also show you
that by just showing an h1 right there
and by a link tab of assets and no it
won't be assets because it is going to
be where it is alright so I haven't made
that folder accessible yet so I'm just
gonna say this thing right here CSS
files CSS files
and I'm just going to say my styles.css
odd let's just get rid of all that and
this is so slow
alright let's reload this this is not
loaded okay so we need a server reset
there and if I reload this again as you
can see the styles are applied and the
style sheet is being loaded so that's
how you serve your HTML files with
express like that and that's how you
kind of make use of that so in the next
tutorial I don't know maybe we'll be
just enhancing this program a little bit
or would be taking a look at something
else I'll just let you guys know so
that's all for this one and don't forget
