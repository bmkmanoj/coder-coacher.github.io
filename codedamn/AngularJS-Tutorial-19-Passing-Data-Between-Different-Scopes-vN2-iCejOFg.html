your 19th angularjs tutorial in which
we'll be discussing about how you can
pass data between different scopes now
one of the biggest problem we face while
programming angularjs applications
online is that when you have a lot of
scopes then it looks very difficult to
pass data from one scope to another
though we can use something called
services and angularjs to do the tasks
but there's a much cleaner approach if
we are doing short programs so I'll show
you what the problem is and how to fix
that so let's create a simple app right
now so let's say I have input type text
ng-model
message now since we need two different
scopes then what we can do is since this
is a scope itself then I guess I didn't
tell you guys that ng-repeat creates its
own sub scope so whenever you use like
span and G repeat this do this or
whatever all like we have used in yep
right here so what it does is inside
this Li a local scope is created in
which portion dot name is accessible so
if you try to do like person dot name
here then you would obviously face an
error so not an error it will just print
out or I don't know just write so yep so
here what we can do is we can create our
own scope and this would be a local
scope so since I don't want actually to
repeat anything so what I'll do is I'll
type ng-repeat in-1 now what this would
do is it would just repeat I I mean the
contents inside this span tag one time
if I wrote I is some other number let's
say
say 1 &amp;amp; 2 then what would happen is if I
do like I here if I tested in the
browser then you see that I guess I get
1 &amp;amp; 2 as output so these are arranged
based loop and I guess we have done that
I'll check if you don't then I'll just
fix it up in coming tutorials
so anyway since I wanted just to run one
time and I don't want to work with I at
all because I'm not interested with I so
what I'll do is if I do like I write
here and I reload then you see if
console pops up any error no but anyways
this one appears inside this span tag if
you see and not outside the spandex so
you see that it says ng-repeat iron 1
and in gob-dan 1 so we have no scope of
this I right here so okay so coming back
to main purpose of the tutorial I wanted
to show you a real use of this so let's
say we have an input type text and
ng-model
of message again so what's happening is
let's say I write here
you wrote message and I'll write outer
you wrote
message let's just give that inside of
be tagged so that it appears in a new
line because B is a block element so
let's reload this and right here yeah
okay so right here if I type something
inside the first box what it is doing is
it is updating the message variable and
it's populating with something and this
container is passed down in all the
subtitle scoops as well but what happens
when I write inside this textbox now
when I write one two three or something
in this textbox what happens is that
this area this good block is creating
its own own sub scope and inside that
scope sub scope the message is not
accessible to the outer block so this is
how this problem arises when we try to
link a lot of things together which are
in different scopes so one way to fix
this problem is to remove the concept of
these scopes are the different variables
in different scopes at all so what we
can do is we can type something called
message dot property or whatever you
want and property here as well
okay so now what's happening is let's
reload this and if I type something here
oh okay
and I type something more here and it
guess
yep so now it should be fixed something
something more so now how this is
working
previously what we had is something like
this now what it did is whenever I wrote
something in this text box it created it
own its own scope of message and then it
displayed it to me because I was kind of
echoing it here but with message dot
property
it created a property of the global
message which is passed down to the sub
scope as well now what's happening here
is instead of creating its own message
it's just overriding the property which
was already present in the scope and
since this is already present in the
scope this is automatically updated here
as well
so to summarize it once more I can say
that whenever I enter some text in the
second field the connection between the
message the scooped message this one and
the outer message breaks because the
inner scope which is inside the speed
tag create its old its own property
message and updates it inside its own
good block area only so that's one way
of passing messages or data between the
scopes
so I hope you learn something from this
tutorial and in the next tutorial we'll
be learning some more awesome stuff
about angularjs so that's it for this
tutorial and I'll see you then next time
