May ho and welcome to your seventh
WebSockets tutorial in which I'm gonna
show you how to create that simple
application like that of WebSockets dark
which we took a look and I guess second
or third tutorial maybe somewhere and
yeah let's just do that but before that
what I want to do is do an NPM install
of Nordmann so that we can just monitor
our Noches changes and we don't have to
just kill the server and restart it
again and again whenever there's a
change right so it just you should just
take a couple of seconds or more maybe
so this by the way this G flag just
installs it globally if you were
wondering so that you just don't need to
install it if you are working on some
other project some other time
okay so it's done and what I'm gonna do
now is say node Mon and next is and
we're on right so okay now let's just
implement that so what I'm gonna do is
say right here inside my index dot HTML
let's just create send button and a
simple input type text place holder your
message here right and I can just give
it an ID of text and right here I can
just get rid of this I can say what text
is document dot get element by ID text
dot value and then what I can say is
sock dot send what I want to send this
text right and as an on message we are
console logging the event so let's just
leave that to that only for now and
inside index dot yes what I'm gonna do
say send message right just reload this
make sure your node man is working
perfectly right something
go to network or maybe console it's sent
get element I guess we have pair of
problem there
reload send okay so that is get element
by ID right there
reload send okay you can see that we got
a message from the server and it says
data as a not a problem so what I'm
gonna do is create Dave here log and say
document dot get element by ID log right
I'm gonna say log dot in our HTML even
dot data right so what we are
essentially doing here is that if I
write one two three hit Send you see we
get one two three then if I write four
five six and it's send we go one two
three four five six and what we can do
even more
it's do something like that we load one
two three four five six seven eight nine
so what is essentially happening here is
that when I write something here and
click on this button we get to this
function right here it gets the text
which I have written it sends the text
to the server on server know Jesus is
receiving the message it console the
message here for me and it sends me the
message back to the client on the client
we have implemented the socket on
message and we a console.log that event
and then we are just changing the HTML
of this log div to show if you have got
from the server so you can even do
something like from server and there
now if you do something like send you
can see we are good to go
right so that is how you pretty much
reflect from the server what you are
doing so yeah that's all for this one
and in the next tutorials what you're
gonna do is maybe create a simple chart
application for two users and probably
then we can extend it to a group or
something so that is all for this one
and if you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
