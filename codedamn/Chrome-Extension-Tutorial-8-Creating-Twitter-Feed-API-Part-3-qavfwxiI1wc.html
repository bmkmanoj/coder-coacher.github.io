Mei hole and welcome to your eighth
Chrome extension development tutorial in
which we're going to proceed a little
bit and bar some data from the raw HTML
we are getting back and see how we can
actually send out chrome modifications
to the user right so if we go back to
Twitter and get some tweet information
from our chrome developer tools we would
be able to see something like this so
every tweet has this div class of tweet
right so what we can do is right here
first of all we can say our let's treat
is something like data dot find Dave
discreet and since we're interested in
only the recent one we're going to go
with the first to it right so we can say
now that we have got the street and
variable so we actually want to uniquely
identify the street as well as I want to
set an option that when I click on that
notification we pretty much kind of span
the user to that tweet so in that case
we can make use of this data permalink
link pad because it would be unique to
every tweet right so we can say that
this is first of all we can get this
link from tweak dot fine or rather treat
a tribute this one right next we want to
get the person who actually tweeted so
in this case it's world emoji day so
let's just take a look how we can get
that so we can see that it is a strong
element where the full name class so we
can make use of that right and we could
just later on see if there's any some
sort of different class as well used by
some other tweet guy so we can say a
name for now a street dog find strong
dot what we have full name dot text and
then finally we can just find the tweet
us or rather the description let's say
we dot find
what we have right there for this thing
ah this is tweet text with a P and we
can take this as text alright so we have
got all our things in place so we can
just control log like link name and
description to take a look at the recent
tweet hit reload go to background you
can see that we get the link the name
and the description of the tweet right
so so far looks good and in the next
tutorial what we're going to do is just
take all of this and create a
notification out of it right so yeah
that's all for this one and if you liked
it then please don't forget subscribe

this then please check out the patreon

really help and again thank you for
