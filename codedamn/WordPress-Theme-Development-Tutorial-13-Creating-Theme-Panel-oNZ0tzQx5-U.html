and welcome to your 13th WordPress team
develop material in which we're gonna
learn something new about WordPress and
that would actually depend on what we
are trying to do so in the last tutorial
we developed this slide right there I'm
pretty much added the option for the
user to customize the slider as well
with the help of a plugin obviously so
let's see what we have to do in this
tutorial so here's my PSD and as you can
see we are pretty much done with these
two might be some major minor
adjustments that could be done later on
but for now we have to somehow create
this sort of thing so instead of this
what I could do actually is I could just
create this black pant sort of and it
could give users the ability to add
their own HTML or text code right here
and for that pretty much obviously we
don't want the users to go to the code
actually the file where this code is
located so we can do instead is that we
can actually pretty much create a theme
options right here which would allow the
user to insert that thing and then we
could pretty much get that thing from
WordPress database or storage and then
acquire off on our page so that pretty
much sounds cool so let's do it now
first of all let me just now we get to
WordPress okay so looks like and do we
start the sublime
oh okay so I was a languages folder this
should be teams on our team and why not
just open on a team folder only because
I don't think we're gonna need so here
we are with header index header and
pretty much we could do that inside in
home only so I'm gonna say that actually
we should probably do something like
this echo so that even the HTML tag is
only created when you no not this one
actually
so here we go a bit of indentation
problem but anyways so what we can see
in here is that right there I can say
that if is home then what I want to say
is echo divided e the black banner would
be here so I could probably see it like
gray header banner or something like
that and this would keep take care of
our styles for this but inside this we
want to echo something and this this
content right here which is right there
should be dynamic and that is the user
should be able to edit that content from
the administrator area and with the help
of theme options you're gonna create so
for now I'm just gonna leave it blank as
it is and or pretty much you would say
just test strength sort of you just want
to do that and yeah so pretty much we
had done here so now let's take a look
at how to create menu a separate menu
for the user so go to your functions.php
and what you have to do here or let me
think that I should probably just pull
you the functions or PHP so let me just
create another folder here let's just
say this as templates and inside here
I'm gonna create a template admin dot
PHP so this would be our admin dot PHP
template which we would include in our
functions so I'm gonna say require once
and this would be get template
direct free actually dot templates then
function it's actually not function stop
HP so here we go one you good and close
that in parentheses if you want to
otherwise that is fine as well so once
you have included the file you obviously
want to work with it so what we have to
do in here is pretty obvious and just
like we did in like adding team support
menus or registering navigation menus
similar sort of thing is done here as
well so first of all let me just open
the PHP tag and I'm gonna create a
function named let's just say I named
this function as the admin page and I'm
gonna say inside here we have something
known as add menu page and as you can
see the autocomplete plug-in listed all
the required arguments we need to supply
so the first one is the page title so
let's just say this is options then the
menu title the menu title would be the
one which probably appears right here
just like settings is the menu title for
now so let's just change this to theme
options actually and change this one to
options or basically settings that kind
of looks for then capability is actually
what kind of role what kind of position
of users can pretty much access this so
I want it to restrict to Admirals so I'm
gonna say this is manage options and
then we have the menu slug and the menu
slug is actually what it is I'm gonna
show you so when you go to like you know
sometimes what happens is that
right now it's not there I cannot see
that yes no really yeah you can see that
right here it shows you team comm slash
wp-admin admin dot PHP and then this
page and then some sort of thing so this
is a slug for this plugin and for this
page so you can see that actually admin
dot PHP is some sort of different file
which is actually not loading right now
but this is the slug which is used here
so your menu page might be on similar
sort of thing so for your slug let's
just say this is team option team
settings let's just say this is official
game settings sort of you can just make
it unique somehow then for function we
need to specify a function which you
want to associate with this function and
that would be Kara you know how your
page looks like because this function
would be fired off whenever this
function team admin page is just done so
let's just name it for now team in it
and make sure you thrown that in it the
quotes as well then icon URL now icon
URL you could just probably insert an
icon there but what I'm gonna do instead
probably you could do as well is that
just go to google and type - icons and
these - icons are actually provided by
WordPress itself and they are pretty
sweet and they are kind of text-based
icons the ones like font awesome so they
are available from WordPress dashboard
only so that kind of makes a lot of
sense to use so you can see that there
are a lot of icons and you could pretty
pretty much pick up any one of the icons
you like so let's say I'm gonna go
this one looks good so this would with
the icon for our settings and just copy
this - icons admin settings and right
here inside icon URL yes you can
actually add an image as well here but
I'm just gonna add - icon right now so
the last argument leaves us with
position so what this position is
actually is that there your menu would
be placed so I don't remember exactly
the position numbers but there's some
sort of number associated so the
dashboard is probable you want so you
see that there's a sort of gap between
dashboard and post and that is because
dashboard is one and this is I guess
three or four then five six all the way
down so for example the person who
wanted to insert sliders this sort of
thing before commands would actually
just calculated the position of this
commands and then would added that
position right here in his or her own
plugin to be the next number after this
command so if I write like 100 which
would be the next number to the I guess
the settings is the last 99 or something
so 100 leaves me to the very bottom so
if I add that and I'm not gonna reload
right now because we haven't done a lot
of stuff so we need to create a first of
all another function which is the theme
in it and do pretty much let's just
leave it blank for now and make sure you
add an action then admin menu would be
argument and then you have to supply in
the name of your function that is theme
admin page for me
and now pretty much you could reload
this and as you can see actually we have
a sort of conflict so this sort of looks
a lot similar so change this to this one
maybe
let me see it's for tools actually so
let's just make use of this one is it
for something
no so - icons menu and right here here
we go make sure you change that from
settings to let's just say I don't know
what should we name that customize maybe
so that might look better let's reload
and as you can see we have changed this
to customize and the icon has changed as
well but if you can see that once I
clicked on this icon it takes me to WP
admin admin dot PHP and page efficient
theme settings so that is your slug
right there so that's how you pretty
much create a team and well it's inside
what this would be like hello if you
reload tada you can see that Hello is
echoed out just like you wrote here you
could pretty much do like h1 settings
page closed h1 because what press
automatically takes care of stuff
because what press has some Styles
already defined for you you can see that
it has on that phone paid and all that
stuff ready for you to work on so you
could pretty much do a lot of stuff here
and then I could actually say like input
a text placeholder middle text value and
then pretty much you know you get the
idea what I'm gonna do
right now so middle text value then
whatever the user would enter and save
it would automatically get displayed in
here and I reload actually we didn't do
that stuff right there so team slider
saves me 1500 by 86 but the image just
doesn't look like they are so we can do
for this so what we can do instead here
is that we can say that this is text
line central background off gray you
could actually just change the
background from the color picker right
here you have so here we go easy enough
hash and that then color white I'm
pretty sure that the color is not also
white it's a sort of different color
no it's finally so what we have done in
here is that padding 30 pixels 0 so you
would actually just margin top is minus
10 pixels well that indexes now that is
a sort of hack but actually you should
probably take a look why there was some
sort of spacing right there and I would
actually take a look once I get some
time but for tutorial purposes I'm just
gonna make use of the simple hack we
have for style of CSS we get another
style added and pretty much what was my
main aim for this tutorial was to create
a theme panel sort of and show you guys
how to do that so that's pretty much
done
the next tutorial will be customizing
the steam panel a bit so that you know
it makes more sense to you so if you
