24th jQuery tutorial in which we'll be
continuing with our new sticker which we
built in the pad tool and I've just done
a little bit of amendments to the span
ID previous and next just switched their
positions and change something to
symbols like these looks much fancier
than the just keywords new and previous
so now let's do some CSS and some jQuery
on this and let's make it a bit shiny
and inspect element is the - we are
we'll be using and I hope you know
inspect element because in my HTML
series as well add in my CSS in my
JavaScript series as well I have
explained this inspect element tool a
couple of times so if you don't know are
you are jumping directly to jQuery one
then go back to any of my HTML or CSS
series and I'm explaining this dude
right here the inspect element tool very
nicely in both of these so let's get
started and let's apply some CSS to it
and let's say to make new sticker a
little bit of body 10 pixel background
background
color
Green should not look good
but let's select a good color from here
let's make font-weight:bold fun family
should be Calabrese
let's give it a parting of left 20
pixels but if five maybe
we're good to go I guess and how about
making it airline block so that make it
tell pixel and 25 pixel that should be
so here we go let's go up this paste
this thing right here let's remove the
comments and I don't give a damn about
indentation
on why the heck it didn't work
I have no idea
so what went wrong okay so we are on
tutorial 23 or me so now this is a
little bit styled so let's start these
things a little bit and I'll just select
one of these because I need some stands
similar on both of these one true
pairing and pixels background red color
white font size what do you say 30
pixels maybe wait 20 pixels no a little
bit more
okay so it does not explain flying them
let's make them inline-block
30 pixels would be good to go and maybe
35 text-align:center height should also
be 35 pixels water radius 50% and line
height should also be 35 pixels so we
have got a nice little circle what if I
make it a little bit lower so that is in
perfectly centered and let's make
pairing a little bit low and I'll just
use
what you say box I sizing mother box the
height is right now 35 by 35 so
I will just go with
line-height as 20 pixels maybe let's
cover this
and paste it right here so we have got
two buttons on clicking which would turn
these sentence to other new sticker
let's make this thing a bit more fancy
with jQuery and right now it kinda
immediately appears let's give it a kind
of shading and smooth transition to
happen so right here let's work with
next and we would get the same code for
this one as well so right here I'm just
removing the class active which seems
great and I'm adding the class active to
this automatically but let's say
yourself said the o-p-s active our
capacity to zero
now what happens is though the class is
added but the opacity is still zero that
means the element is still not visible
so now let's animate all I know that I
haven't explained this metal yet but I
would I promise you that even
immediately in my next tutorial but just
learn about that this animate is kind of
your gem house if you want to make your
transitions very smooth and very
realistic
so right here we are doing that for this
let's make it the same for next one next
let's reload this one too okay so we
have got all of these and while we've
got all of these
because we have to use active live
instead of this
take
so let's reload
and I guess I messed up with a cord a
little bit because this has to be active
I guess no this has to be new sticker
yeah I remember now let's reload
what's happening here baby let's we undo
this all and I've got new sticker eq0
animate opacity of one and similarly I
would like to have CSS attached like
this let's reload this now and we have
got nice effect with our jQuery one now
you see we get kind of smooth transition
between this and we can just copy and
paste this this line
with our why not the whole bunch of code
just replace it with brief and here as
well
just replace it the EQ with negative one
and everything is same let's reload this
and we have got our nice new sticker
styled in the ugliest way possible in
the world but yeah who cares
so you could make a lot of new styles
out of this you could try your own CSS
make colors gradient and you could use
some more of jQuery if you wish to and
that's how you create a simple new
sticker with jQuery so thank you for
watching this video tutorial I'll see
you there next time wait probably this
animate animate baby right here so see
you then and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
