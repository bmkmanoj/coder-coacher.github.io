Mayo and welcome to your fourth part i
guess for the ioniq social login
application and in this tutorial what
we're going to take a look is how to
implement let's say Google for the login
so you can enable this thing and you can
see that we get something like whitelist
client IDs from external project which
is optional and web apps SDK
configuration as well which is again
optional so I'm just gonna save it
anyhow anyway right and we're going to
say right here log in with Google and
I'm going to see this dot v dot fire
rather for dot dot sign-in with pop-up
new firebase dot dot Google auth
provider right then what I want is just
again console lock this bad boy first of
all console log from Google and again
we're gonna need a log out with from off
anything this dot fire dot dot dot SCI
not or why not just we create one
function add simple as that so we can do
again log out here so what I want to do
is again copy this space this log in
with Google ng Facebook dot dot really
Facebook this time but Google log in
with Google again you can just customize
these buttons a little as well add some
icons from the official things so we can
again create an object
here with the similar properties right
and right here we can again say
something like our rather let's just
leave it for now I'm going to say we
will not logged in I on card all right
it looks good for now let's just reload
this and see what errors we have right
now so if I log in with Google you could
see that we are getting a note sign-in
so let's just go with this one and you
probably got that what's happening here
so you can see that we got our
credentials and the user object again
with the display name email and the
photo URL right so this is pretty much
the same thing so instead of doing
facebook login let's just keep this
thing separate like that and what we can
do instead is get rid of this completely
this dot logged in is true and this dot
logged in is false right here and
finally we can get rid of this property
from these objects as well and just
create a logged in as false right here
and well what else you got here so what
I want to do next is again this dot user
similar things right history repeats so
I want to do exactly almost the same
thing this dot Google Google dot name or
why not we got the crap at all let's say
both or let us say provider why the heck
not provided or name provided email
and there we go so this dot provided
name provided email provided a profile
picture is this thing completely get rid
of this thing we got a provider boy here
and provider provider provider or rather
we can just hook this inside provider as
well to keep the things a little nicer
right and again again sorry for a lot of
changes really quickly but that would
keep our code base a little cleaner
provider dot provider dot and provided
dot fair enough
so now we are ready for multiple logins
and now if we reload this we are getting
an error a Dallas somewhere inside home
dot d s and we are good to go
so now if we log in with Google this
time you can see that we got two of
these stuff and not really anything is
entrusting so okay let's try to reload
this one more time maybe some changes
not reflected log in with Google logs in
perfectly we get from Google and then to
console logs okay we are doing it twice
nevermind
but we do not see our God yet so what's
happening hmm just so provided logged in
is true here and for home we are saying
oh fish so this should be provided
logged in
anyways one more time we got the
response and the pop-up has been closed
by the user before finalizing holy crap
log in with Google and come on so we got
this thing now and you can see that we
get it anyways
so you can see that we still have this
log out of Facebook you can make it
simply log out because this is a general
button not for any specific code
provider so you can see that that's
pretty much how we would implement
Google login with the ionic 3 and
firebase and it's pretty straightforward
to do so and that's all for this one
again and if you liked it then please
