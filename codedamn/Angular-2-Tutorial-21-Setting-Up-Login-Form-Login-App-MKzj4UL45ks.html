guess 21st angular2 tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be continuing with our
application or login and before starting
I would like to download bootstrap the
Twitter bootstrap CSS files so that you
know the job of the styling of better
elements is done by bootstrap and we can
just focus on angular 2 so let me just
get rid of this and clear and then I'm
gonna say npm install bootstrap and save
and hit enter
let's just wait for it to complete and
once it is done just go ahead look in
your known modules bootstrap and this
one the bootstrap minified dot CSS and
as you can see this is a whole lot of
bootstrap code right here so alright now
just open your index dot HTML and right
here at this bootstrap file which would
be node modules then we have bootstrap
then distribution CSS bootstrap min dot
CSS and here we go and make sure you
start your server again so
there we go pretty much looks like
bootstraps loaded and the next thing we
need to do is to set up our login form
so I'm going to change this to template
URL let's just say this is app templates
login form dot HTML and if I just go up
a little bit close this down and squirt
a simple little login form dot HTML and
we don't need to start writing off with
the HTML tag because this is a component
so I'm going to say form then I'm going
to say div class of form group then
label for let's just say this is my user
name and your user name would go here
then input type text' ID or a few name
for the label 1 and then class or form
control and all these classes are coming
off from the bootstrap framework the
Twitter bootstrap one so I'm just going
to copy and paste this thing again down
here and I'm going to say this right
password and change this ID to PWD let's
just say and this one is a form control
as well
finally we need a summit button so I'm
going to say button type of summit and
then class off button default and yes it
is a button so let's just say this is
the login and form so here's our simple
form loaded and pretty much right now
nothing happens so what I want is that I
want to somehow get this data which user
is entering right here into my console
so let me just change this to errors
only so that it looks clean so inside my
login form what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna say this is a data and this is an
object and I'm gonna say that on some
or basically let's just change this to
from Summit and this is a function which
would say it's pretty much console.log
this dot data okay so now what's
happening is that I'm going to make use
of ng model to two-way bind the data to
this data object and what I'm going to
do is inside these square brackets which
just pretty much means that I'm just
looking for an update and this
parentheses which means that I'm looking
for an event I'm going to write ng model
equals data dot user name now what this
does is what basically two-way binding
does is is that it just keeps the view
that is your HTML page and your
component that is your this login dot d
s synchronized with each other for
example let's just say you made a change
to data dot username here somewhere in
your code then it would immediately
reflect in your view and if you are kind
of able to change the data dot user name
in the view itself then you can just
make use of the updated data in your
component so that's sort of a plus point
of two-way data-binding and similarly
I'm just gonna say this one right here
for password and finally what I want is
that an event on ng summit actually and
this would be form summit let's just
call this cool now if I just view it in
the browser let's say this admin admin
login oh pretty much wait a minute ng
model since two password well that's not
actually a problem
so ng summit as form summit the stud
data
oh don't do this that's a very silly
mistake
so you need to just surround this event
in parentheses because in angular 2 we
just do something like that so now if I
reload admin admin and let's just
disable this similar HTTP request for
now and just reload it again admin admin
and login you can see that we got the
username and password as admin and admin
for our own use so now we can pretty
much do like a bit of routing stuff so
if data dot username is equal to admin
and and data dot password is equal to
admin console log hello admin else
console log who the F are you and I just
try any other combination okay so our
data is not defined okay so this stop
data test our data and desktop data very
much so any other combination yields us
who the f are you
but admin admin gives us hello admin so
that's pretty much how you differentiate
between administrator and other users
and what I wanted to say in the first
tutorial of this one
this log in application is that you need
to move this logic from your JavaScript
file to your back-end
so pretty much what you'll do instead
here is perform an HTTP request and
would send a data username and this is
just a sort of dummy code it's not
actual code and data dot password then
on a callback function you'll check that
if response is true or if responses
admin
then you want to just throw it or you
know pretty much just response could be
a cookie as well which you just simply
set in the browser and then the backend
itself decides what the user is so yeah
so that's pretty much it for this video
and in the next video we'll be right
arousing off the user two different
pages depending upon what the user is so
