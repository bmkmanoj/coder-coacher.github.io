hole and welcome to your fourteenth
tutorial I guess for angular 2 and in
this tutorial using the click event will
create a simple application for this
movie sharp kind of application so so
far in the last tutorial we have just
applied the ng for directive to display
a bunch of movies right here as you can
see and again we can extend this
application a little bit by attaching a
click event to each of these allies and
we should probably just change this to
Li Olli because that kind of provides a
bit of styles by the browser itself so
now we could probably get rid of this
index as well and you will here we go
so what I can do is I can just actually
add a click event and remember to add a
click even we have to write this inside
a parenthesis and this simply means that
we are just expecting a input from the
user so right here I'm just going to
write my event or the function name
which should fire off and in this case
that would be let's just say selected
movie and down here if I just quit a
function selected movie let's just
simply alert a movie was selected so if
I just take a look in the browser and
just click on any of these movies you
can see that we get a movie was selected
as an alert but that's not very much
useful so what we can do is we can just
actually get the name of the movie as
well
so to do that again as you can see that
we already have this temporary variable
right here for us setting so as to get
some information out of it
so I can just simply pass this movie
variable inside the selected movie so
now we have another access to it and the
parameter
here in this function what I can do is I
can just simply say that alert movie was
added to God or something like that so I
can just reload click here so it says
Batman vs Superman was added to God
Civil War was added to God so
technically you won't do that on a live
application to your movie needs but
instead what you will do is that you
will have a simple plus button here
which just says Add to Cart this movie
and then that right this thing might be
useful so again once we are done with
this you can actually just display a
movie list here so we can just say
selected or we can just say recently
added movie and that is my recent movie
and I can just initialize this variable
a recent movie re CEng movie as none and
inside this what I can do is I can write
this recent movie as movie and again you
can just sort of display a cut here so
all movies and again or cut here and
again you can make use of this you will
right here and I can just say that item
of cut just get rid of this click and I
can just display an item right here and
I hope that you're getting what I'm
doing cause in a moment we'll just see
what this output is and what I can do is
I can again add a public cut as this one
and I can probably say right here as god
dot push movie like that so if i just
take a look at the browser again so we
have a reach
gently added movie as none and cut as
blanks with a click here
all right we get recent movie is not
defined alright so I guess we can get
rid of this error by making use of this
and this now we need to make use of this
because inside this function we don't
know what this recent movie is so we
just want this function to make use of
this recent movie of this same class so
we make use of this right here so yeah
so seems cool right now so just take a
look in the browser we still get recent
added movie as none and card as blank so
if I just click on Civil War we get
Civil War was added to card alright so
we get a Civil War item right here then
if I click on Batman versus Superman it
was added to card again and if I click
on Deadpool it was added to card again
so a homework for you could be like if I
just click on Deadpool again you can see
that it was automatically added to cut
so what you can do is instead of just
adding this two times you can just check
for whether Deadpool has been added or
not and just increment it right here I
just right across to here or cross three
or simple one you can just you know
disallow adding of a movie twice or more
than two times so that's how you pretty
much create a simple application using
the click combined and this selected
movie function basically and just you
know you get the idea so that's how you
pretty much create a simple application
which has a card and some items to add
and that's all for this tutorial we
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
