jQuery tutorial in which will requiring
a sliding effect with jQuery now in the
last tutorial I discussed you about how
would we take a look at some examples
and would be learning from them and in
this tutorial I have a basically aim to
teach you guys about something called
slide up slide down and slide toggle
methods on the jQuery constructor
function so let's get started and first
of all to demonstrate this I'll just
create something called div ID toggle
this and I'll just say click here and
here
content is there and I would just say
this to anything gone that you like this
is some sweet bread of NSA you shouldn't
be here
pretty much any would do all
right so now inside our CSS let's style
this a little bit up and what we can do
is I'll just type dog this
and would give it a parting off then
pixel with one person though it is
already on the person background maybe
Tripoli border one pixel solid black
maybe and the content should be
batting 15 pixel with 100%
though it is already text-align:center
sure fontsize 20 pixels and finally
display:none let the fun begin now what
we are trying to do is here first of all
let's take a look at how the HTML of
this is working so here's my browser
let's reload this so we get justice
click here nice button right here the
toggle button add there should be
excellent central actually so it looks
nice so I'm just scaling down the window
a little bit
all right so this click here button
right here and I guess that's just given
up margin:0 padding:0 box-sizing and
other box pretty much this should fix a
problem all right so well lasting
excellence Center let's reload this and
now what we see is just this big banner
like here on the top and below this is
the content which is set to display:none
now let me toggle this for you so what
we will do is in the jQuery section
first of all I'll just wait for the Dom
to get ready then we want whenever our
toggle this is click
for a function and what that function do
is it would select our content and it
would just do slide down all right so
now let's reload this and click here so
you see that once I click here this
content right here slides down and
actually I could give it a background to
make it more kind of voidable let's say
black or white and not actually black a
little bit like red shade or something
should be well
and the content here should be replaced
but this here you go
all right
so here we go let's reload this click
this and you see that it slides down
nicely but it won't when you click it
back so let's say you want to create a
slide up feature which only slides up
the content so what we can do is we can
just set it to display block here and
change this from slide down to slide up
let's reload this and let's click here
and you see that it slides up nicely now
I want to show you guys a bunch of
things we can do with this
now slide up and slide down obviously
both of these accepts an argument which
is the kind of animation time so when
you supply it slow I don't know it's
like kind of you know 750 to 800
milliseconds of animation so when I
click here then you see that it nicely
and slowly slides down and when I pass
in the argument fast not fat
and reload this and click here then it
Scrolls slides down in a very fast
manner similarly you could supply our
own time here in milliseconds let's say
for 300 for instance with reload this
and click here you see that this
animation this block of animation
completes in exactly 300 milliseconds
now what if you wanted bored the toggle
and basically you wanted something like
toggle which slides up and slides down
as well surely we can do that with the
click function then assigning it a class
and then checking if it has a class then
slide down or slide up and but that
would be too much to do we have a simple
function in jQuery which do the job for
us and which is slight duggle duggle dog
go here you go now the slide toggle
would work just like you are this slide
toggle would work like your slide down
when your content is hidden and slide up
when your content is visible so let's
see it life in the action and when I
click it it comes down goes back comes
down comes down goes back comes down
goes back and you can do that yourself
so slide toggle would accept a animation
parameter with the number of
milliseconds and this has a second
optional parameter as well the both of
these are optional but it has got a
second parameter as well which you can
pass
now this is let's say I pass the
argument callback the callback is
something which function is fired
whenever the slide toggle is completed
so let's say I have a function should
call back here let's make this useful a
little bit so I'll just say window dot I
equals 0
I'll just say console dot log callback
art will just say that slide toggled
times
pretty sweet now let's reload this eye
let's switch to console let's click here
you see that this function right here is
called whenever the animation is
completed it's not calling between it
not call under starting it is called
whenever the animation gets completed so
when I click here whenever this block
would fully move to top then only here
it would appear slight doggles two times
you see then it updates itself because
this callback is called every time this
toggle function is fired and the second
argument just fires off whenever the
slide toggle is completed so I guess
that's all for this tutorial and I hope
you have learned something about slide
toggle in jQuery and if you have got
some problems then don't forget to leave
a comment or any suggestions you like
and I'll see you then next time good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
