JavaScript tutorial in this tutorial
we'll be discussing a very important
concept and a very very confusing
concept in JavaScript which is hosting
now technically hosting means to move
the declarations of variables and
functions to the top before starting
this tutorial I would like to remind you
of the scoping now I guess I've taught
the scoping in somewhere in the playlist
you can check it out in JavaScript the
variables are basically functional level
scope that means VAR a is 100 and if I
call this function my function and I say
Y is 200 here and I call down the
function right here and console.log a
then this is 100 I hope you know this if
you don't know then go back to my
playlist of these scopes in variable and
first of all on this thing because this
is gonna be useful in very much useful
in this tutorial ok so coming to
tutorial now what is hosting as I told
you the ability or the feature of
JavaScript to move the variable
declaration to the top is known as
hosting
to explain this better out create an
example okay so let's create a variable
here with value one and I'll create a
function down here change
I'll do if
I'll just to bar a is equal to two
a lot down here and what's what you
think is happening and telling what you
think is happening right here is are
okay for your simplicity let's rename
this or reinitialize this variable to
true what's happening here is this if
statement checks that I am explaining
that what actually looks to a regular
user but this is not actually happening
but I'm just telling what you think is
happening so what do you think is
happening is that if a is false then run
this statement and then alert a pretty
simple as the variables are function
scope this is actually accessible by
this function right here right yes it's
right but what do you think would be
alerted it would be true or would it be
- any guesses if you say true then you
are completely wrong because this is
where hosting comes in play now if we
run this code in the browser let me show
you
the notepad and let me call this
function sorry and here's the browser
and we get to but I mean what the heck
is happening here this statement even
isn't true
this statement even doesn't run this
slide so why does JavaScript prints or
alerts to write here why the heck is
this happening I'll explain this now
this function right here is technically
just same as this function I'm writing
down here this function is like this one
now what's happening down here is what's
the difference between these two the
difference between these two is in this
function we are declaring declaring this
variable a again in this function before
this if statement and then sorry we
don't need the work evil here and then
we are assigning this value and then we
are alerting a so now what happens is we
have this a true right here
but as I told you variables are at a
function scope so this air right here
belongs to this function and since we
have just initialized this a and not set
any value to this this is right now
undefined
okay so what JavaScript did it it moved
the Declaration of this variable a to
the top of this function and then remove
the keyword var from here and left the
the value assignment operator right here
so one thing you have to remember is
that in variable who is think the only
that declaration is moved to the top of
the order not the assignment operator
assignment operator is obviously is
equal to sign no need to mention that so
what's happening here is JavaScript
changed this code into this code and now
JavaScript says okay so I have got a
true here but the developer initialized
a right here as well so I will use this
a in this function all over
so JavaScript says okay so the developer
has initialized this to undefined
and the value of undefined boolean
undefined value or boolean is false so
this statements technically executes and
sets a to do and then alerts a so I know
this is confusing but you just don't
know how off something you just learned
in this tutorial and if you don't
understand this tutorial I would suggest
you to watch this two to three times and
I'm pretty much sure that if you grab
this concept then in the next tutorial
what we'll be discussing about hosting
would become a cakewalk for you so I'm
telling again that if you don't
understood this tutorial or any part of
this watch this tutorial again because
hoisting is a very important concept in
JavaScript and it is the most vulnerable
concept where the developers do fatal
mistakes and bugs in web applications so
thanks for watching this tutorial and as
usual I'll end by the video by saying
