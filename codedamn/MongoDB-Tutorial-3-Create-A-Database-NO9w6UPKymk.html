May ho and welcome to your third MongoDB
tutorial in which I'm gonna show you how
to create a database in MongoDB and
kick-started so let's get started well
you just need to create a folder and
just place a script dot JS file there
well we don't need to do anything with
this file for this tutorial but we might
need it as our code gets complex and
bigger for MongoDB so right now you can
see that I already have the server
running so right here just go ahead and
press shift right click open command
window here and you'd be good to go now
just write Mongo and you'd be in the
shell right so now you can see that it's
connecting to test well this test would
be there by default so what you have to
do is like show DB's right so it will
just show you your DBS the first one is
local and the second one is random
frequently be well so that's
embarrassing I should have until it did
that but anyway so well how do you
create your database well to create a
database use write actually you use then
your database name right so in this case
if I write m DB I'll hit entry that says
switch to DB m DB well now you might
think like show DB should probably show
what hey it doesn't well the reason is
that you need to insert at least one
document in your MongoDB and don't worry
about these documents we'll just learn a
lot about them later on for now
what you have to do is write DB DB
actually dot m DB not insert and right
here would be your object Kara so your
job object could be pretty much anything
just like we have in JavaScript so I'm
just gonna say my awesome and set its
value to true right so it's a typical
JavaScript object and hit enter you can
see the right result is one well
now you have something in your database
so now if you do show DB's you'll see
that your MDB is just about above your
random frickin DB and that's pretty cool
and it's size is almost zero compared to
units when you take GBS as the unit so
that is pretty much how you create a
database and actually write something to
it as well so yeah so that is all for
this tutorial and in the next tutorial
I'm gonna show you how to properly write
some data and retrieve it as well so
that is all for this to one and if you
liked it then don't forget subscribe and
thank you for watching
I'll see you there in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
