and welcome to your 17th angular 2
tutorial in which we'll be going off
with the routing stuff of the cart page
of our web application so so far what we
have is that if you click on any one of
the items and just add it's adds it to
the card but eventually I want to have a
different page a separate page for card
so we have route config to our rescue
so what I'm gonna do is first of all
let's just add a simple route config we
just say spot is got right then I want
that when part is card I want the
controller or the component actually for
angular 2 to be got component which will
create in a minute and the third one is
named as let's just say my and you could
actually just amend those codes are on
the card name and yeah so for now what
we need inside index dot HTML is to just
get rid of this card right here and we
have a bunch of stuff to do so let's
just create a new file here let's just
call it component got card TS then I'm
just gonna copy and paste some sort of
code I'm going a little bit quick so you
can just pause the video if you just go
out of the frequency so inside the card
dot d s I don't want any selector no
template URL and no style so I just want
a template which is a multi-line comment
string actually and I just want to
export class card component that's it so
the next thing I need to do is I need to
add you know even if the user visits
this card what happens is that the very
first page which should be executed is
this component dot index dot d s only so
we need to somehow tell that whenever
this car is found you have to load this
card component but where to tell that
we'll make use of the route or router
outlet and would close this as well and
right here
the final thing we need to do is add a
direct test because obviously we don't
know what this directive is so this
directive is router direct riffs and
this comes from this file all right now
looks like there's some sort of god
component alright so I guess I've
included the file so I'm gonna say
import card component from and this is
component dot card right the card with
the name my first car does not begin
with uppercase letter okay so all right
here we go alright so now we have this
page but we have actually nothing to go
to that cockpit so I'm gonna eventually
type out God and down here you can see
that we got card but this is kinda
awkward because obviously you don't want
this thing right here to be displayed
and in a minute I'm gonna show you how
to get rid of that and first of all
before even doing that what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna say somehow I want to have
a link on this page to redirect
automatically the user on this page on
clicking the
but this is not as simple as typing eh
drifted God because if I do like my god
now since this is not an actual redirect
but we are just kind of fooling the
client-side because obviously the card
if you do our actual redirect this will
actually request a card page from the
server but we don't have any card page
from the server because we are doing all
of the routing on the front page so we
may need to make use of some sort of
angular stuff here and that is the route
roll link and I guess I spelled it right
and inside here what I want is Inari
again with the first element being the
name of the route config inside which
you have placed now we need this array I
don't know why but there's a reason
because you can have a multiple
component list here for some sort of
back of wall or something I'll just
check out the documentation and let you
know but I know there's some sort of
things here so now we have if I go to
the home page again we have this my card
and if I click on this you can see down
here this automatically appears now this
looks awkward and this looks you know
wait because obviously this kind of
looks like if I am having a drop down or
something like for example now I don't
have a card for now I don't have a card
you can see and if I click it it
magically appears like you will say that
I can actually do that with a simple
JavaScript or jQuery code as well but
actually this is also not working
because we have not actually added this
thing right here into the component
place so what's the fix for this is that
actually what happens is that this page
right here the index dot T is is the
first file to be executed and this is
the master file of your application so
again what we can do instead of just
this
laying this stuff right here in the
master file we can just split this thing
into a separate module as well a
separate component you can see and then
we can load that particular component
inside the route out router outlet which
will place in the template here so this
tutorial was just to show you how to do
a simple URL routing and you can
actually inside this component card what
you can do is you can just say hello a
big hello
so that is just you just can't see that
this is some sort of routing going on
here so I guess not hello was a big one
so I guess I have right now that's why
it's yeah okay so we have a hello right
there no hello right there so you see
that the routing is working so the aim
for this tutorial was to prepare you
guys for the next tutorial which would
allow us to split our this component
which we have kind of hard-coded into
the main application into a separate
file and then from then onwards we'll
have will not have to worry about the
main file at all so we'll just manage
our components well that would make a
life a whole lot easier and if you're
not understanding what I'm trying to say
then don't worry because in the next
tutorial all of that would make sense so
make sure you watch the next tutorial if
you have made it to this point because
the next one would be an important one
so if you liked it then don't forget to
