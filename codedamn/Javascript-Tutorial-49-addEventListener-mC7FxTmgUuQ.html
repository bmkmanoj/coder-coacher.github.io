49th JavaScript tutorial in which we'll
be learning about something called add
even listener in JavaScript
now add event listener in JavaScript is
a way important kind of method you can
say which works on the objects and it
kind of binds events to your objects
which are like HTML tags and things like
when you want an event or a function to
be fired
whenever somebody who works over this
deck box so I just create this dam right
here as a box the weight of 500 pixels
and height of 500 pixels as well I'll
just lower this down to 400 by 400 a
background of red okay so
let's reload this okay so I guess this
is just overflowing the screen so let's
just reduce it to do by two looks good
all right so now
the traditional way of doing thing is
like document or get elements by tag
name or whatever you like query selector
is like on click equals function but
though it looks clean but but it is not
the standard way of doing things because
yep this would work but I don't
recommend this because using add event
listeners you are basically registering
your events as well inside JavaScript
but with this you are just simply
declaring an event so with add event
listener you get more control over your
events and revoking them and I'll just
explain that in a minute to you so let's
say you want to add an event listener to
this div so the traditional way is this
now leave this way and try this one
so I'll just go with odd-even listener
and since this is a method could accept
I'll just separate both of these so
let's just say 1 div because this thing
right here and Dave dot addeventlistener
the first one would be the listener you
want to add now it won't be like on
click but simply the name of the even so
this is click in my case the function
you want to fire this would be
let's say Mike click it won't accept
like any parameters you want so yeah one
thing you need to know is that whenever
you are passing in a function you just
need to pass the name of that function
not with the square I these curly braces
as well so whenever you are passing it
as a function this add eventlistener
would automatically pass the current
events you can say reference so this my
click is something like function event
which is my clique even so both of those
were similar exact copies what I wrote
like right here is similar to this thing
right here if you see so an event
argument is passed inside this function
which would obviously give you access to
this dam right here and all of its
properties the third argument is the
boolean argument which is either true or
false now this thing right here is
something related with something called
as event bubbling
now even bubbling is something which I
would like to teach you guys in a
separate tutorial not in this one
because it would take a lot of time not
a lot of time but it would suddenly take
at least five minutes for me to explain
you what's even bubbling and how it
would practically work so for this
tutorial and just said that even public
do Falls and I'll just make sure that I
teach you guys and all this even
bubbling so don't
just confuse herself for now so let's
pass in the even object let's see what
this has got for us
sit console dot log even dot target now
even the target would eventually take us
to this div now even is does not has the
direct reflection of this div but you
have to use the target property to get
back to this div okay so now let's
reload this open the console the zoom
out a little bit and let's just click on
the staff so you see that we are getting
the reference of that div that
particular div inside the console so if
I do like even the target dot last name
just assign it a class of wow
and let's reload this now whenever I
click this you see that wow it's console
logged right here so pretty much you
could access everything which you used
to do with the on click by using the
event dot target and whatever your
property you want to access for that
diff or any other HTML object you have
so that's it for this tutorial for add
event listener and yeah I need to tell
you guys that are even listener is you
know as usual not supported by Internet
Explorer eight or below I guess so
that's why sometimes on click is a
better approach instead of
addeventlistener because it is kind of
supported in majority of the browser's
instead of addeventlistener but still
how you add listener is a good choice to
make and you could actually just test if
it is enabled in the browser it is if it
is available in the browser or not so
we'll be doing that couple of checks in
my next tutorials and I will be teaching
you what is even bubbling which has
skipped over in this tutorial so that's
it for this and I'll see you there next
