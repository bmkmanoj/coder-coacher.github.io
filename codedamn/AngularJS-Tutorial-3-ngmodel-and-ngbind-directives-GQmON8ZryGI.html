angularjs tutorial and in this tutorial
we'll be discussing about what we did in
the last tutorial with ngmodel and a new
directive or basically a new keyword for
you and G bind so these two attributes
are kind of special which would help you
to bind your data in HTML and to use
them dynamically in your HTML file so
angularjs kind of extends your HTML code
extends its functionality with something
called directives now these directives
we'll be discussing more in detail about
in the later tutorials but for now just
remember that directives are attributes
there for HTML HTML elements starting
from ng - and all these are directives
all these attributes and what these
directives - is depend on their tasks so
for example ng model works on every
input type let it be input tag let it be
text area or maybe of optional notes
option may be select and all that and we
have got ng bind so instead of doing
like this what we can do is we can make
Yousaf no matter they would do ng bind
now we could give div and Japan and the
value same as we entered here so what
happens here is instead of using like
this we are giving ng bind attribute to
div and this would automatically update
the text this would automatically bind
this event this text box to this div so
whatever we write inside this will
automatically get updated inside this
div so let's view it in the browser
let's reload the code and we have got a
text box here so let's write hello world
I can type anything here and if you are
more kind of security geek and you
should know that this text is
automatically escaped before writing
into the devil
all right so that's about ng bind and ng
model and one thing you have to remember
is that ng model looks like to a work
with every input input kind of thing but
does not so if you give like give ng
model name and make it content editable
to true then this would not work so div
I hope you guys know what is content
editable because I recommended you to
check out my HTML tutorials but if you
don't know what is this and are confused
what's happening here so let me tell you
that content editable is the attribute
which would convert your drift to accept
text so it's nothing but it's kind of
create a text holder for your div so
once we reload this you see that we have
got this div as now editable so we could
actually place our own text inside the
step so now you see whenever I write
this
nothing gets updated in this tip so this
bind events this ng model bind event
only works with your specific input
types like
your input and put your text area
this text area
and let's just remove this
and you see it works with text area it
would work with select no need to show
it would work with utter by default HTML
elements which takes input from the user
so that was a quick introduction to
directives in ng not ng basically
angular so that's how basically
directives work as a trolli directives
are attributes of angular in HTML which
would extend your functionality of HTML
and would make your document dynamic
within itself without writing any
specific script
all right so that's all for this
tutorial I guess and will be talking
about more interesting stuff in the
future tutorials so till then stay tuned
with me and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
