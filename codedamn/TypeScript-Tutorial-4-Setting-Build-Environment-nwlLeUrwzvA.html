and welcome to your fourth typescript
tutorial in which I'll be showing you
how to set up your build environment
with typescript now the good thing about
this plug-in about this typescript
sublime text plugin is that you don't
need to leave your sublime text anymore
for any sort of development so you don't
need to go to command-line to compile
and build you can do all of that from
your sublime text only so what I want to
do is let's just say I want to
console.log this file let's say hello
there and what I want to do is that I
want to you know just compile this file
so what I'll do is I'll hit ctrl + B so
as you can see it down here it shows me
build parameters just hit enter because
I don't want any parameters and it
creates a new file for Jas so as you can
see for the GS is technically the same
file because there's not anything to
compile which there's nothing that I've
written in typescript which is not
available in JavaScript so it shows me
finished in one second as well and what
I want to do is that it is kind of when
you have a lot of code down here it is
kind of tedious to go to individual file
and see it so what we can do is we can
actually split screens in sublime text
and to do that hit shift alt and two now
what it does is that it creates another
screen right here so I can open this the
GS file in this window and I can still
work with my dot ts file in this window
now shift alt 3 will give you three
windows 4 will we give you four windows
5 will give you five windows and so on
and so forth so you can do something
like that now I'll just give it to two
windows for now and yeah so if I type
like some wrong JavaScript console legs
not log then as you can see if I hit
control B hit enter it shows me an error
as well so it saves me error cannot fire
name console eggs but it still compiles
into JavaScript so one thing you have to
remember is that even if your JavaScript
or technically your typescript is
invalid it will still always compile
into a JavaScript which might or might
not work so if you are just you know
just loosely coding in JavaScript then
typescript will get you tight so that's
all how you can set up your development
environment with time strip and you can
see that I only need to edit this file
not this one because once I build this
file this file automatically gets edited
so yeah so that's pretty much it and
from the next tutorial onwards
we'll be making use of typescript and
would be actually writing a HelloWorld
program with typescript so that's all
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
