js' tutorial in which I'm gonna show you
what is a state of a module now it was
kind of hard to decide the title of this
video tutorial because what I'm doing is
essentially I'm just introducing a
concept which we have already done in
the tutorial number five or six or seven
maybe I don't remember but I'll be
presenting you that concept in the no
jst no js' form so inside the scripted
folder I have these four files let's
just populate them so inside our main
module that's right let's write some
code so what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna say what you lot exports is an
object and I'm just gonna say this has
let's say Quran you are koat.com alright
now let's just go to module 1 unless you
say war mod you we can't use that
because that kinda looks reserved
so when I say module eggs require main
module and trigger say console.log
crunch URL is module eggs dot Quran URL
easy enough it's not too - as well I'm
gonna just paste the same code but the
twist is that in module 1 I'm gonna
modify this property so parents should
so we just gotta say module a X dot
parent URL is actually Google so inside
our main file now finally let's just
call both of these
I'm just gonna say require module one
and require module two
all right now let's just jump to the
terminal and I'm just gonna show you
what's happening so I'm just gonna say
Nord or basically you first open the
folder node main file dot J yes okay so
what's happening here
first of all it says my current URL
Google calm and then run to our
google.com again so what is happening is
that basically what I call this file
module one here it runs this code it
picks up this main module this module
one picks up this main module and it
modifies the Quran to URL property in
the next line all right it works as
expected
in this place google.com okay so in the
next slide what happens this it says
console.log current URL and that is what
appears in the terminal but in module 2
what happens we are actually not modify
any value here so why does it display
google.com instead of cord and calm with
which it should display so the reason is
that these two modules are sharing this
property and why they are sharing this
property is the simple reason is that
because of the JavaScript objects so in
JavaScript I guess we have done that
before I showed you that as well in this
terminal only so in JavaScript for
instance I open the console and if I
write let's just say a equals to B
equals to a property sign at a value of
1 change the value of a then B
automatically gets changed but this is
not the case if you are like doing
strings or something like that
I change a to something else B doesn't
change so that thing is just associated
with these objects similar in similar
manner what happens here is that when
you include module one it refers to this
module or exports in the main module and
then it modifies that property then
module to what happens in module two is
that it is still referring to the same
object so it just gets that state from
this module one now what happens if I
just cut and paste the slide in module
do well everything would work as
expected so if I just do again this now
you can see that module 1 shows me
koat.com and module 2 shows me
google.com but this problem would arise
again if I create another module module
3 which would again make use of the same
code without this so how do we solve
this now this thing can be useful to you
so this would be useful in the cases
when you are developing applications
which need to share the same data which
is returned by module so you can think
of this like this so you can say that in
your main module you can just create
this object and pass all the Mugu you
know you can say that you can pass all
the static things which would not be
changed whenever your module is used
across various files so that might be
useful in many applications like you are
just creating some sort of a messaging
application like whatsapp or hike or
whatever it is so there's a group and
you want to just keep the messages or
you can you can just say that you want
just keep the messages updated in every
persons
are basically you know this thing can be
used to just let's just say I just send
this file to somebody else and I send
this file to somebody else and send this
file to somebody or just keep this file
with me so what happens is that whenever
they make changes to one file the
changes in another file automatically
gets reflected because of the shared
state of modules so that was kind of
example you can think of how this is
working so how to fix that well to fix
that we'll make use of something called
as the neo keyword add this new keyword
I'll be explaining in the next tutorial
so that's all for this one if you liked
it then don't forget to subscribe and
