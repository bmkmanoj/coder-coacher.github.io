PHP tutorial in which we'll be writing
our first hello world program in PHP now
from the last tutorial I made you guys
download the software called samp and
click start in front of the sabasha
module and from now onwards what you
have to do is open any browser any
browser would do chrome or edge now in
the search box what you have to do is to
type local host l or c al h or SD make
sure you spell that right and hit enter
now once you hit enter you should get a
screen something like this now if you
see that this is the same logo for the
software so you know that your software
will actually running select your
language I'll go with English and this
will show you a success page for some
installations so if you see this
congratulations you have successfully
installed samp then you're good to go
now the next thing you can do is click
on this PHP info version so mine is
currently five point five point one five
there could be a difference between your
PHP version and mind but I am usually
used the latest one but I don't have the
latest one right now because this setup
was a little bit older and I you know
just didn't download the new one
so anyways most of the commands you can
say our same for newer and older but
I'll keep you guys updated on what is
working in new PHP versions and what has
been added in new PHP version so now the
next thing you need to do is open any
text editor and then type something like
PHP
now what this means is type a greater
than sign which we used to type in HTML
than a question mark and then write PHP
and then give some lines and then a
question mark again and then type less
than sign or whatever I'm always
confused between these two so if you can
see these then these are the ones you
have to type now I guess I have selected
the wrong folder so give me a sec now
this would be your saving procedure so
when you are on your computer then once
you're done with this go to file I'm
going to open folder but you have to go
to save us because selecting a different
folder save as go to your computer
select local the C zamp htdocs now right
here I'll just create a folder for you
guys PHP I'll just go with two dot PHP
now be careful with this you have to
save this as the file name dot PHP
extension oh I guess sorry
I need to select the folder first
because I wasn't saving the file
actually here you go buddy you know
right here type PHP and save it
assistant like this and one out the
folder itself and again go to see
zamp htdocs PHP or whatever your folder
name is and save it here as do dot PHP
or whatever you like okay so now once
you're done type echo hello world simple
as that what we have done is opening tag
for HTML a question mark PHP close a
question mark again closing tag for HTML
now in the browser type localhost again
give it a slash type your folder name
give it a slash and type your file name
so this is something like you saved it
and Sam htdocs alright so localhost
actually means you are working in this
directory htdocs now PHP means navigate
to this PHP folder and to dot PHP means
open this file now hit enter from
relations on writing your first hello
world program so that's it for this
tutorial and I'll be explaining much
more about PHP to you guys in my next
tutorial so don't miss that tutorial and
don't forget to subscribe thank you for
watching and I'll see you there next
