recursion tutorial at the default
javascript tutorial and in this tutorial
we'll be continuing where we left in the
last tutorial that is the explanation of
how it works so we have this function
factorial which calculates the factorial
of a number in a recursive way and how
it works i'll show you now so let's
create some drinks here and supposingly
i have this main function down here fact
fact and i'm calling this phone
and I'm calling this function with the
value of five so I give it a value of
five down here now this function first
of all checks for these two values are
obviously they are false because Fife is
not less than 0 and 5 is not 0 and this
function arrives at this statement down
here so it says return number into fact
of number minus 1 so foxes okay so what
I have to return is number which is five
into
fact of number minus one so fact of
number minus one is 45 minus 1 is 4 so
here at this point the execution pauses
that means javascript is ok I won't
evaluate this program unless we have the
value for fact of full so again this
goes down the factor for just like this
one and again the JavaScript compiler
arises at this statement and which says
return number into fact of number minus
one number right now we have is for into
fat of that means factorial off number
minus one which is three again the
javascript says okay I don't have the
value for factor three so i'll pause the
execution for a while and the execution
boss is here javascript tries to solve
this function first so now javaScript
says
javascript arrives dad this command
again this line again and again this
line says return number which is three
now into fact fact of number minus one
which is to now let me increase the size
of this
the resize
say thousand pixels should be good okay
so
so the first
so okay so now
javascript says this is to actually to
so the execution again stops here now
javaScript says let me solve this
function first and this happens in the
fractions of seconds you can't even
notice this these all these processes so
now javaScript says to solve this
function now factor of 2 is 2 into fat
of 2-1 that is one and at this point we
have arrived at our base condition
because we say if number is equal to 0
sorry not the base one yet and fact is
equal to one then again it goes down
execution pauses here it goes down and
finally we have one into fact of 1 minus
one that is you so finally we are at
base condition because factorial of 0 we
have said return 1 now from here the
JavaScript compiler takes it backward
now at this point faq zero turns us 1
the value 1 so this value becomes 1 into
1 that is one
that is one so this values passed to
this function now fact one as return is
1 so this evaluates to two into one that
is 2 then this value is returned to this
function down here this execution which
has paused for a while then we get 3
into 2 because 2 into 1 is 2 right here
then we get 3 into 2 which is six now
this value 6 is passed to the factorial
3 function down here and then we have
four into six which is 24 and then we
have this 24 value down here pass to the
factorial 4 and then this evaluates like
five into 24 which is 120 so factorial
of 5 is equal to
120 and don't consider it as five is not
equal to 120 obviously but that's how
recursion actually works and that's how
in recursive tree everything goes down
and down and down unless this base
condition is met now this condition is
nothing but just a verification but this
condition down here is very important
because if we remove this condition then
this would stop working and obviously
this would evaluate to not a number down
here but if we remove this base
condition then it would the recursion
would be a kind of infinite loop so
that's how a request should works and
not in JavaScript but actually in almost
every language which supports the
calling of function within itself so
this is how you can create program with
recursion and yeah one thing i want to
tell you is that recursion is not always
good and for example
in this program it's hardly to notice
the difference between recursion the
iterative methods but when we talk about
series like the Fibonacci series now in
fact not series what we do is we take 01
as the base numbers the two base numbers
I'm telling you the mathematical concept
01 and then we add the last two numbers
every time so we get 1 then 1 plus 1 is
2 and 2 plus 13 then 3 + 25 + 5 + 38
then 8 + 5 13 I like all that so in
Funaki when we are coding and recursive
now the problem that arises is we
calculate the value of the position of
every number many many many times in the
recursive manner without even knowing it
so it increases the time of the
execution in program in exponential in
exponential way that means if your time
in the iterative methods take two
seconds then it would take two to the
power of two seconds in recursion
doesn't sound much if your
execution time takes like 100 seconds
then your recursion time would take 2 to
the power of 100 now yeah it is a very
large number 2 to the power of 100 but I
am just taking you an estimated guess I
don't say that this is accurate but
that's how recursion good cause problems
in the situations where a value is
calculated many many many more times
then it is required and there's a
workaround for this as well and you can
see that and you could want to find that
on the google and you can find that
easily and try to build your own
Fibonacci series in recursion as well as
it in creative methods and this was all
about recursion and how it works so
that's all for this tutorial and I'll
see you then in the next tutorial thanks
