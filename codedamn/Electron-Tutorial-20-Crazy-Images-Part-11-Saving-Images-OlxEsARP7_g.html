electrons yes tutorial it's been a long
day so we're finally gonna finish off
with this crazy images application where
they're finally implementing how we can
screenshot this and pretty much say to
users that your file has been saved
right so let's see we're going to make
use of this package which is this small
NPM script electron screenshot and if
you take a look at this source it's
quite simple actually just a couple of
our rather just sixteen lines right of
node.js code and it's making use of file
system so we got probably not get into
the save dialog box but that's something
I want you to do right so we're going to
come to that later on so for now what
I'm going to do is npm install electron
what we have the name as electron
screenshot save it and just let it
install for a while what we could so now
finally since we need to screen shut off
this thing's must stay i'll let me slip
in here are we going to say our screen
shot is require electrons screenshot i'm
going to stay screen shot and the file
name would be i'm just going to go
randomly where the user file dot PNG and
it's going to have that in PNG so let's
give a delay of let's say a second maybe
and yeah that's it so it is going to
generate a user file at PNG for us after
a delay of one second with the name of
user file or PNG fair enough so yeah
let's just take a look
we're going to do electron dot and make
sure you understand directory and then
we can open a file let's say e 1 or
rather this is changes to image dot jpg
why not so we're going to make this a
little brighter how about this we're
going to change the contrast and I guess
we have some problems with the layout
here so we can just fix that that's not
a very big issue we can take a look even
right now what is happening the layout
kind of is on 34 feet take a look okay
so I think flex one review are what's
happening here Lix pro one is that what
we need yep looks like so we're gonna
not write filed if what we have image
editor flex CRO one is what we need
okay so again image that jpg this is the
guy so we can just increase the
brightness to 130 and we can set the
contrast um I guess this should be good
what about this I don't know and for
saturation I guess this one's looking
better so yeah let's just go ahead and
save this and we get this but we do not
actually really want this pop-up for the
user to pop up and you can see that I'm
use a file we have got our updated file
which is actually cool but just before
stopping this we just want to
set the first false and we're going to
try it one more time
I'm going to get rid of this thing as
well so finally our app should look
something like this we go ahead and
select an image we set the brightness
with some more effects we saturate the
image a little less we increase the
contrast and we go ahead and hit save
so we have saved the image we do not get
any notifications because we are not
implemented that but if we take a look
and use a file you can see that both of
these images are saved and edited so and
you can see that the resolution is
preserved as well right here they made
it a bit small similarly I can just show
you one more real quick example of let's
just say e 1 we just invert it let's
taste done and if I save this we get the
user file updated but you can see that
the dimensions are original not the
dimensions which we have in here right
so yeah that's pretty much it so that is
all for this app and then I'll be going
to leave I'm going to upload this whole
app on github so that you can just clone
it or whatever you want to do with it
and what I want you to do is actually in
save option I want you to show the
dialog box of saving the image and let
the user select a part and actually make
the image name anything random instead
of user file dot PNG and show dialog
show a dialog to user that your file was
saved successfully so yeah that's pretty
much it if you can just do that leave
the command in comment below with your
code or you can just go to the form form
go down calm and post your code there
I'll be happy to see that so yeah that's
all for this video
and
you liked it then please don't forget to
subscribe like the video and thank you
for watching I'll see you then in
another electron app real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
