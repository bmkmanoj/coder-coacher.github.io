your 29th HTML and CSS tutorial in which
I'll be teaching you about a very
special tool in most of the modern
browsers which makes your life a whole
lot easier if you are a web designer not
only this this is also helpful when you
are doing stuff like debugging your code
or seeing how the Dom tree is made in
the browser or just you want to include
some elements edit some data live on the
site which even you don't own and all
that stuff so let's see how it works so
in my browser right here in Google
Chrome I hope you're using Google Chrome
if not that I hope you're using Firefox
and if not then I do not hope you're
using IE because you know why
so now we have this browser right here
and in Google Chrome when you
right-click then you'll see a very
special a context menu right here which
says inspect element and just go ahead
and click on this what you'll get a
whole lot of new type of bunch tools
right here and this is not a part of the
web page so if you are thinking that
this is something you can create with
HTML you can't so this is a part of
Chrome browser and
chrome tool and using this you get a lot
of features like your timeline the time
took by your HTML page to load the
JavaScript suite which you can see in my
JavaScript playlist resources used right
here like the images you are using
audits your console for JavaScript and
this one is hooked by my plugin right
here the Edit this cookie this one so
you might not see this one if you don't
have that edit this cookie installed but
I need that for some other purposes so
here we see I own HTML document we read
we write here so let's say if I do hello
world and with the inspect element
opened I reload this page so now inside
body and seeing hello world written here
so let's say I want to check that
weather
how would the document look if I changed
it change it to hello world and instead
of just going back to this bra code menu
good file what I'll do is I'll just
double click here on the sticks and I
would write a s and I would just hit my
Enter key and you can see on the life
side it gets changed through to
something new and not only this you can
change pretty much everything like the
CSS and all that stuff and I'm gonna
tell you my secret today and it would
allow you to select any color or
anything you want a very beautiful or
any precise color so let's say I give a
body a background of black so till now
we have been just hard coding the colors
with some words or some most common
properties like your hash EEE
which is the hex one for a little
whitish type of background but let's say
if you want to see a whole lot of bunch
of backgrounds for your
document so what you'll do is you'll
just put any property right here and
let's reload this and we have got a dull
and ugly background black page so now
inside this now in Google Chrome
at least the console the elements tab is
separated into two parts the HTML one
and the CSS one now CSS 1 will show you
every style you are every else styles of
the element you are designing so if I go
to head then this head display:none
displays something I would tell you in
the next tutorial and head display:none
would basically mean that do not display
this on the document so if I do like
head and I can directly add some CSS
down here by clicking on this plus
button so this plus button would
automatically create a new style rule
for me and inside the body let's see
what we are we what we were supposed to
do now when I click on this color this
black color whoa I get a color badly and
using this I could select pretty much
every color we have in our computer so
let's say I want to give it a blue color
and here's my cursor drag this little
friend to blue
you can see live on the side that the
color changes to wherever this blue
cursor is you can see that yourself and
you could pretty much give it any color
and instead of just coding hard coding
green now we have a wide range of
variety of colors we could use so let's
say I want to use a kind of shade of
golden and this one looks great and I
would like to give it a color of white
so now we have not only this freedom to
choose any color we want but it's also
very useful to edit CSS styles by
viewing them live on the document on the
go so now let's see it say if I want I
like these colors so what I'll do is
I'll just copy this and don't set my
sublime text I'll just paste it down
here the indentation is a little bit
disturbed but we can fix that and I'll
reload this and we go out our Styles
pre-applied because of a document so
inspect element using inspect element we
could technically view any style of any
element and we can change it live on the
document so let's say if I say Dave
and the sake color should be great a
let's say I am a shade of gray
and now just remove this hello world
and just remove this color white as well
because you're already supplying great
in this so now this looks pretty much
ugly right now and I want it to be a
timeline inside black but I would like
it to be a little bit visible so I'll
just drag my little friend right here to
a little bit top I don't want it
extremely white I don't want it
extremely black I just wanted some where
middle which is visible so I guess
that's pretty much it and the friend you
see right here would help you do grab a
color from some some other elements so
it is a kind of magnifier you see and
this will only appear when you have
clicked on here and you're hovering over
the document so let's say I want to
select the same color we have in the
background so when I click on this this
color applies to the same color we have
in the background and so it's not
visible and let's change it to white and
let's drag it down a little bit and the
strips could just copy it paste it and
life's good so that's how inspect
element makes your life a whole lot
easier to work when you're creating live
documents and web pages so that's pretty
much it with inspect element and go
ahead and style and do some styling
stuff with Excel this inspect element
and in Firefox also we have got a one
inspect element but that's kind of not
friendly or maybe I'm not friendly with
that inspect element as compared to
Chrome's one because I have been using
this Chrome's inspector
meant for all like you say a couple of
years are more so I pretty much know
everything what's happening inside this
inspect element so I hope to share that
knowledge with you in my future
tutorials and that's it for this
tutorial of inspect element of Chrome
and we would be discussing more on
inspect element in our future tutorials
but that's all for the day so thanks for
watching and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
