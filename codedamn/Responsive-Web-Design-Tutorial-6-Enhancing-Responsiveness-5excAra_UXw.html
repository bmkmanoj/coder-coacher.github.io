May hood and welcome to your sixth
responsive web design tutorial in which
I'm going to do a little bit of
announcements to the responsive the
design we have created right now and as
you can see right now I've just changed
the location of this bar to the menu and
I have just simply hacked it a little
instead of after now I'm using before
and left as - ready pixels and I have
just text indented 40 pixels to the
right so that looks good
so a test in my side on this response in
intercom which is simply just iPhone and
all that stuff with an iframe so it's
essentially just fooling you into a
creating a different size of iframe
every time and if your website is like
if it's blocks iframe this won't even
work with that so anyhow it still is
useful to check in some common layouts
and you can see that it kind of doesn't
look very appealing right now in a lot
of scenes so that is sort of helpful you
can see right now these icons are will
overflow if viewed in a landscape view
right so we'll also take a look how you
can add some specific styles to
particular orientation right there's
also a way for that to detect
orientation in CSS right so right now as
I can see font is a problem on 736 and
we just have a break point on 720 so
yeah that's going to be a close call
right and this this little guy is a lot
of out of aligned so which is going to
see what makes it out of aligned so if
you take a look on a normal it's hard to
say if it is out of a line out of
alignment rather we should say but as we
decrease size yeah it looks a bit out of
alignment so let's just do something
about it so we can actually position
bottom is this pixel that looks good
let's just not do this and let's just a
transform translate X minus 50% and that
is a more calculated way of transforming
that and we can we don't even need to
mess around with the media queries for
this right and this would be centered
now probably okay
so looks good now there's a problem for
320 pixel devices this is sort of
looking bad so let's see if we can do
something about this 320 320 write 320
now it looks okay for me because I'm not
messing around with my height and I
guess I have something in place to
detect some JavaScript we detect browser
height and accordingly just position
background till the height I believe I
have done that earlier I don't really
remember not here I don't know but
there's some sort of jobs for going on
in the back end for this specular I
don't remember but I had coded something
to maybe or maybe not yeah I guess I'm
just going clean with C absolutely right
that's okay
anyhow anyways so yeah what if I get
this
logo right here drink a little bit more
and probably we should get rid of this
menu text at all that kind of this
creates problem position:absolute top:0
right zero can we do that where's it
right 10 pixels something like that yeah
I guess that is a more cleaner approach
than what we are doing right now yeah so
we should do something like that only
so what we can do is umm what am I even
doing here menu Dobler and yeah okay
so let's just drink it down to our let's
give it to 200 only but make it a float
left right so on 720 720 pixel I'm going
to say this is dot logo file but our
menu toddler is going to float right and
we are clearing the floats yep and I'm
going to say this is top 20
yeah that's completely random
of all this and there we are okay so we
again have a little bit of problem here
I guess we should pretty much clear not
here but rather our yeah obviously what
am I doing here here both yep so there
we go
and it looks much better get rid of that
menu as well from the HTML files and
this is index menu there we go under
rosette
then you table right 10 pixels and the
left - 20 just remove that all right so
what did we just do
right the ten pixels right ten pixels
there we go
so where the head Godard oh we should
not be there yeah and looks much better
now yeah okay so okay so we have this
inflated button somehow so let's just
fix this one again if this gets inflated
around what it does 320 right standard
size for an iPhone whoo
so we can just bring down the front side
a little bit not a very hard job to do
font size ah
26 so I think we should be making use of
friends but I think we can bring down
the batting and step one pixel I think
there's enough of space for the text as
well so what's blocking the text this
right there gotcha bro let's just break
it down there we go
download the culprit fair enough and
looks good it looks awesome right okay
so this looks bad again
this view looks okay this looks bad
we'll just come back to that later the
orientation the landscape orientation is
kind of messed up this also looks good
yeah there's some sort of problem with
landscape orientation yeah landscape
yeah this is also fine landscape is
messed up this is fine this fine yeah so
we have to essentially pretty much
design our website finally one last time
for the landscape view so we're going to
do that in the next tutorials so that's
all for this one and if you liked it
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
