Mei hole and welcome to your second
tutorial for ionic framework log an
application with firebase which would be
a social application where user can log
in with their social accounts so if you
are new to firebase and probably ionic
as well
then you might want to check out
previous some previous tutorials
in the playlist to get an idea but if
you're good enough stick with me and
we'll just sort out the things so what
we want to do now is a pretty much
implement an interface where the user
can actually click on some buttons like
login with Facebook and then the
Facebook modal open ups opens up and the
user types their credential and it's
login and they're good to go you get the
access token and blah blah blah and all
that stuff so we would be doing that but
the problem is that on devices there's
nothing such thing as a pop-up or yeah
there it is
but not in the way like we implement it
in the authentication flow control for
example on the web what we do is that we
implement us login with Facebook button
you click on that button you get a
pop-up you enter your credentials you
hit enter and you are good to go on the
website but on an android app it's kind
of inconvenient to do because people
usually when they have let's say
facebook application already installed
on their phone why the heck would they
want to enter the credentials again in
some sort of pop-up window right so for
actual production code for ionic what we
will be doing is that we would be
switching our application to make use of
some plugins but for the time being for
testing what we want to do is actually
make use of the pop-up things which I
was telling so because if we do it from
the very start then either we have to
use an emulator every time which is kind
of a slow process if you don't have a
lot of power and plus moreover you know
actually rebus a lot faster to run right
to reflect changes so what we would be
doing is we would be creating our own
whole application and one go on the web
and then we would be adding some code
inside our existing code which would
check if the platform running is Cordova
which is essentially on that device then
we would be making these other Cordova
plugins for the same alright so let's
get started so let's just say I say
ionic start social login hit enter let's
just go with the black one yep and let
it just download I'm gonna pause here a
little because I'm suffering a lot from
my internet connection these days a new
place and a lot of problems a lot of
restrictions in this college and yes so
I'm just going to wait actually right
now as well I'm running a VPN so it
kills a little bit of speed as well so
yeah let's just wait okay so I was away
and looks like it's done so we can just
open this social log in and say ionic
serve and it will just start a local
development server
and just let it start so meanwhile what
I want to do is actually go to console
dot firebase.com
to take a look and we would precisely
need these do things only for now and
here what we can do is either you can
create a new project or use any existing
project if you have and precisely what I
have right now is this API project
because I have exceeded my free projects
limit here at Google so what you want to
do is go to this authentication and hit
this silent method and go with the
Facebook one here first and what we want
is an app ID and an app secret now for
that what we want to do is go to
developer casebook comm slash apps and
you would need to create a new
application here so what I want to do is
add a new application and let's just
call it something like ionic social
login and we would probably need a human
verification here and we should be good
to go I'm real soon so here we are
now what I want to do is I want to add a
facebook login so I'm going to set it up
for the web right now right and what I
want is we can actually just skip it or
you can just write localhost here and we
can probably continue and next and next
again next and yeah so we can just go to
the settings one here and what I want to
do is inside our valid
valid or three direct URLs I want to
copy this thing and paste it right here
right I hit save because this thing
right here sees us to complete the setup
add this oath redirect URL to your
Facebook app configuration which we have
done right so again I want to go to the
dashboard to take a look at what my app
ID and app secret is so my app ID is
this one and for the app secret I guess
I need to enter my password again
so my password is that's not what I'm
gonna tell you guys so now we are with
the app secret as well it's safe and we
are good to go for the Facebook with
firebase now what we want is actually
implementing this thing on the ionic app
right so we can do open this first of
all and sublime text something like this
inside our source pages home home the TS
right we need to actually set up the
login system for this thing so we would
want to install the angularfire 2 and
the firebase first in our project so
let's just install that and wait again a
little bit and yeah by the way I just
forgot to tell you that I would just
leave a link in the description for all
the schools so you can check out that if
you are not a fan of installing packages
manually and writing some code but I
guess you should do that yourself so
that you get a little bit familiar how
to set things up now the next thing is
again we need to add our firebase to our
application we can just go to the wedge
setup here copy our configuration files
or the configuration right go to our app
modules
and right here just space this bad boy
and the next thing is just importing
this thing inside our declaration or in
both I guess inputs it is there we go
this is just a config and then finally
what we want is the angularfire module
imported and our angularfire odd module
as well and we want to in check the odd
module so that we can make use of the
authentication stuff we have right so
that's pretty much it for this part and
we're going to head over to home dot TS
now and what we're going to do is
actually set up our firebase so I'm
going to first of all input file
firebase from or rather let me just get
a like firebase from firebase like that
and right here let us create a
functional login with Facebook and log
out of Facebook right and then for the
home dot HTML we're gonna say something
like button I on button login with
Facebook and we're going to again say
button I on button log out of Facebook
right and again let's say click is log
in with Facebook and the click one for
this one is log out of Facebook and all
that stuff is done so let's just get to
the meat and actually we are just
missing one final import and that would
be in both from angular fire
- and this should be angular fire what
you light don't think so that it was
angular fire until it was rather angular
fire pot this should be hot yeah so we
are now ready to rock and roll so what I
want to do is finally just in check this
as a dependency as well here by doing
something like private fire angular fire
up and now we can say this dot v dot dot
dot sign in with pop up and what I want
is new firebase dot d let's see
firebase dot dot auth provider and dot
for somewhere here yeah
Facebook or provider right so this is
our oath provider for the firebase and
what I want to do is once the stunt
let's just also log what this bad boy
contains all right and then finally
right here we can say this dot v dot dot
dot sign out as simple as that we should
be good to go fire up but console on the
right and just hit login with Facebook
and it's full screen right now so you
can see that it takes
Granoff it does not look like a pop-up
when it actually is one so again here
net is a bit slow here so you might want
to stick with me be with me rather and
let's just continue with our app and
let's just wait for a second and see
what we have got here all right
you can see that we got something
console.log and you can see that we have
got all of for my access token and all
of that stuff which Razer provides by
default the email address the display
name the profile URL the photo URL and I
also have the access token to query
other information from the graph API if
the user approved all of the permissions
again I can just log it out off of there
and since we are not console logging
into anything so we don't get anything
so yeah that was a very bare minimum
implementation of Facebook log in with
ionic and firebase and in the next
tutorial we're going to improve upon
that a little bit by actually showing
users some content some relevant content
related to their information like their
name or email address and profile URL
profile picture why not so yeah that's
all for this one and if you liked it

and thank you for watching I'll see you
then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
