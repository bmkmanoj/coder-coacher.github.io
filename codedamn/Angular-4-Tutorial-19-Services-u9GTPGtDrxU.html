my name is May hood and welcome to your
19th annular tutorial in which you're
going to discuss about what services are
in angular and how pretty much we made
use of one service in the last login
tutorial we did so services you can
think of essentially are required
whenever you want to share the data
among a lot of components and basically
directives and all that parts of month
of your particular module right so let's
say if you're creating any e-commerce
website so what you would want is that
the gut of the user is always the same
on all the pages and it's always updated
right so for that what we can do is we
can actually create a cart service now
what the service would be is that it
would be available to all of your
declarations which is your modules and
components plus it would always be a
single instance at least that's what you
prefer so that whenever you make change
to a service in one component or make
change to a variable or any method or
any property in service that change is
immediately reflected globally to that
service and any other component
accessing that thing would reflect the
same change right so to create a service
what we need in is the go to your
angular command line and this wait a
second I guess I have that right here
we have our second terminal running now
and if we take a look then what you can
do to create a service is pretty much
say Angie can rate service and then your
service name right would which in our
case was the user right so you just have
to write user here and create a user
service now what we did in the user
service is that we pretty much generated
created these two methods which is which
are just set user logged in and get user
logged in and this is a very basic
service example with pretty much just
one variable in working because we are
not making use of this private user name
right so what we are doing is just
setting a brilliant value to a service
which is accessible in all the
components right so that we can know
that if the user is logged in or not so
now let's say if I want to find out if
the user is logged in right so what I'm
going to do is go to my header component
and right here I want to make use of
this service now first thing you want to
do to make your service usable in
component is you want to go to the main
module which hosts the component which
in our case is just add module and you
have to add the service inside providers
right just like we have user service
right here once you do ngg and grade
your service and your service name here
and hit enter it create a new service
but it would not add it to the providers
so you have to do that manually and this
user service is the same name which is
this class name right so we go to our
add modules and once you have done that
this tells angular that the service is
now accessible to all the components in
this module so once you have done that
you can just go to your module file and
again you will need to import this
service so you want to stay import user
service from user dot service right so
now you have access to this particular
service
and should be actually just a directory
back not this one
there we go so now you have access to
this user service but in order to make
use of that in your methods or wherever
you want what you have to do is actually
include this using dependency injection
now what that is is pretty much that
insane constructor
what we do is we say private anything
like my service or my awesome service
and we declare this as a user service
and what happens with this this is
typescript stuff going on so what this
does is that it tells angular that we
are expecting a user service inside
constructor with the name my awesome
service so you do not need to do a lot
of things in here you can even leave the
constructor blank so what this will
essentially tell angular is that put
this user service inside my awesome
service when calling the constructor of
this class so now you have access to my
awesome service right here with this dot
my awesome service and then right here
you can pretty much get any method or
any property associated with the class
as long as it is public right so yeah we
can bulimics a console doors lock this
dot get user logged in and we will just
stay is user logged in and just like
that so if we take a look now and just
hit the console you see that we get its
recompiling under I don't know let's
just try it one more time ok so now you
can see that we get is the user logged
in as false so if I log in I guess it's
the admin admin and hit login
and I reload this page again because we
are logged in and the we get is the
usual okay so obviously we are not
storing the state of the user right now
as of with the routing so we would very
much just go to our home page only and
would go like admin admin and pretty
much we could just say that this thing
right here inside our dashboard
component as well right so again we need
to make use of the same name which we
have used in the dependency injection so
now if you see the user login this gets
we get false and we write admin admin
and has login we see that we get the
user logged in as true right so yeah
that is pretty much how services work
and that's how you can create a very
basic service which is just a simple
login state and you could actually just
share some data as well I'm going to be
services apart from just a boolean value
so we can say set user logged in user
named as the admin this study user name
and we can make this public so that we
do not need to have a setter for this
method so we can say something like this
note the name is the username and then
we can create a name in here right is
let's just say anonymous as default so
again we need to make use of my custom
service and I guess we are in the wrong
file because we would like to do that
inside our dashboard file right so we
can say name as Canali
and then we can set this startling to
this dot user dot username right so now
what we can do is inside our dashboard
files hello and the work we have name
right so yep and now if we go like admin
admin has its login you would see that
we get hello admin so we have
successfully shared some data from the
service to our component right and again
this name would be accessible inside our
header component or any other component
for any other page or part of web page
right so yeah that is pretty much how so
this is work in angular and that's all
you pretty much need to know right now
and yes so that is all for this one and
if you liked it then please don't forget

and thank you for watching I'll see you
then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
