May ho and welcome to your dwelt angular
and sorry rather ionic tutorial in this
tutorial we're going to take a look at
how we can implement the login
functionality with our firebase
application what we already did the
registration part which is kind of the
50% of the application but let's just
implement the login functionality here
as well now again for the login part
we're going to send the username and
password of the user back to firebase so
that firebase can authenticate that
we're going to do that by injecting the
angularfire dependency inside our
project so I'm going to see private fire
angular fire art and now we have access
to the fire objects or I'll say this
stuff I ought not sign-in with email and
password now what this would do is that
the suit again we've done is a promise
and this dot password value which would
consist of the data sent by firebase for
the authentication part now for the most
part we do not need this data anyways so
you can just completely ignore that
because behind the scenes when you find
this function sign it would email and
password of firebase will automatically
log you in with the username and
password this email ID and password if
it is valid now what happens is that
you're in your application firebase is
also running that right now in the
background right as a WebSocket so all
that authentication part is actually
managed by firebase itself and not your
application so you do not need to worry
about that so once you hit that what you
want to get is some range of random
bunch of data so got some got some data
and data goes here and this time user is
logged in otherwise you're going to get
an error and we're going to get a lot of
errors because might be some nasty user
which just enters wrong even address
well technically you should be
validating email address before sending
to firebase because that would kind of
create a delay we
you could have actually just shown user
alert in real time so what we can do is
actually just right here console dot log
got an error an error right here it's
safe we should be good to go
so just let it build and we're going to
see how that works and for the
authentication part right now we have
got our username or rather email
addresses mail MPD Android gmail.com and
the password would be mail MPD only so
I'm going to say mail MPD either a
gmail.com and the password is metal MPD
let's just or rather we are in the wrong
any right so we want to log it either a
Gmail calm and may whole MPD let's just
hit sign it you can see that we go would
sign with this thing how we get got some
data and that looks promising because
that is a lot of data again just like I
said so now what we do well you are
actually logged in right now
so if you do something like this dot v
dot dot dot current user so you would
actually get the actual user which is
now logged in right now and you could
access property like get email address
right something like that and you could
access the display name as well if they
provide something or if you want to
provide make them provide that field
while registering you can do that so now
we have got this but this is not really
user friendly way right so what we're
going to do is we're going to create
another function right here saying a lot
unless you say this is just a message
we're going to say something like we can
do this as a string or we can do
something like this dot alert control
dot rather this is first border so now
we get some help so we got up again just
report the alert controller alert
controller right then we're going to
inject that as well private a load
controller is alert controller
we're going to make use of dot create
right here which accepts the options
okay so we are out of luck so what we do
now we go to component and we go to
alerts now this is one of the benefits
of ionic lab as well you can just search
from right there so we can just create
an alert with all these information just
copy this paste it right here we're
going to see info and the right here we
can this instead of subtitle we can say
message and buttons okay dot % just like
that so now we can simply say if we take
a look inside our application we can say
right here if we are logged in this
study alert success you are logged in
and then finally we can just say this
dot now have control dot set route as
some login page right and then finally
for the catch bar we can say this dot
alert and we can just say error dot
message now this error dot message
contains that message value or whatever
error that it came across so let's just
save this and take a look now how this
looks like and actually we have some
error because we have not created login
page so let's just both logged into page
or rather let's just keep it logged in
instead because when I get some trouble
then from log n slash logged in logged
and just like that and we can just hit
our terminals to say I like generate
page logged in and we should have the
page logged in right now so we can just
by the time go to add module and input
that page as well so let's say
logged in and same thing right here
logged and finally we're gonna need that
right here ads well there we are and now
for the logged in pad we can say
something like right here we can say hey
hey user and for this bar we can say
email of the user so that we are just
sure that we are showing this page to
the right person so we can now create
this dot email as a rather just email
out of strength and right here we can
again inject private fire as angular
fire hot we would finally implement well
that's kind of a boring task to do
manually
so anyways angularfire odd and there we
go so we're going to finally say finally
finally say this dot email is equal to
this dot rather we can distort fire dot
dot current user dot email just like
that okay let's just finally save this
and take a look what we have got here
so now clean this a little bit and there
we are so I'm going to sign in May whole
MPD other HTML calm may hold MBT only
let's just sign in you can see that we
get a success you're logged in and we
got the email addresses make lmpd either
HTML or calm sweet now we can do the
same thing again
if you reload this up because I have not
implemented the back button there
you can register another email or rather
let's just keep it easy
admin calm something like this now I'm
in one two three Oh admin one two three
right there we're just sure
okay we have got the data again we can
just make use of that in the
registration as well so we were going to
just copy this where we have login dot
DF this glut function inside our
register dot es we're going to paste it
right here we're going to finally oh man
this is crazy I'm going to get the alert
controller okay okay flood controller
from ionic angular and there we are
finally this dot alert register this dot
alert error dot message just like that
ooh okay so let's just finally now take
a look at this application so there we
are let's just clear this for the moment
let's just register some user which is a
bad email address again
let's hit register you can see that we
get the email address badly formatted
and this is standby firebase to us so
you might want to do it yourself but I'm
just going to keep it like that and
having one two three adjuster you can
see that we got in for register click
ooh I'll go back sign in or we had the
some user yeah a forward some user other
HTML calm and admin 1k3 hits sign in you
can see that we get success you are
logged in with some user either a single
command at the backend if you take the
look we do have some user direct email
comm registered with us so that is how
pretty much you would create a very
basic login application with ionic
angular and firebase so I would have
this code ready for you in the
repository linked below so you can just
download it and Messer
with it if you want to and yeah that's
pretty much it for this tutorial and if
