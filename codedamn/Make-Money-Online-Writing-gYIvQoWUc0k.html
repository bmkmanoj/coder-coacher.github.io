third part in making money online video
series and in this tutorial I'll be
showing you guys how you can make money
if you are a very good writer or if you
want to do freelance writing now in the
last part I discussed about how you can
do freelancing online and I forgot to
mention one more side which is pretty
awesome
to check out and which is co clerks now
co clerks is a site which you can use to
sell your social services like you can
do you can sell your Facebook Likes or
Twitter followers or you can do like
backlinks or optimize Co for other
people and it's pretty much like fever
but it is rich and you can see the kind
of services where most of the webmasters
are looking for so this is one of the
most sites I'll like to recommend to
beginners so you can join the site as
well because the site is also quick and
fast to start with and about this
tutorial I would like to suggest you one
more site called I writer
now I writer is a site exclusively made
for writing freelance writing and with
the help of this side you can write
articles and get paid in return so if
you don't have any blog and or if you do
have any blog and you are not earning
with that what you can do is you can
write your articles here instead of your
blog and you would be paid in return so
first of all register here which is
quite simple to do just fill in your
details then log in I'll show you the
interface so - Meho MGP
and password is dot dot dot dot dot dot
well so here you go and then click on
for writer section right here on the
first image because you would like to
get the projects first instead of
setting up your payment details so here
are all available articles you can write
so you would like to filter out whatever
you want to write so let's say if you
want to write about computers and
Technology so just select that and it
will refresh for you so for example
right now I have three articles in front
of me so I could select any one of those
and start writing on that so that's how
you would earn with a writer and it I
guess pays around a maximum of a maximum
of yeah a maximum of 1.25 no this one is
for the minimum price for an article a
maximum I guess this is around five to
ten dollars per article which is not bad
enough so join the side if you're
interested in freelance writing and do
tell me how it goes so that's it for
this video tutorial and the next one
will be looking at some more methods to
make money online so till then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
