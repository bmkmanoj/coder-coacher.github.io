Mei hole and welcome to your very first
tutorial or ACMA script thick which is
just a fancy word for the new JavaScript
implementation in the browsers so I have
actually done playlist before on ACMA
script tutorials but I guess I used a
transpiler in that and it wasn't it
isn't actually a complete playlist as
well and it's kind of a messed up one so
I just want to do a fresh start so here
we are with the atmosphere of six right
so if you're watching this tutorial I
guess you probably are somebody who
knows JavaScript who has worked with
JavaScript before or knows that
javascript is kind of you know fun to
work with you can create some alert you
can use make use of libraries like
jQuery or maybe even frameworks like
angular JS and you are pretty much
familiar with all the JavaScript stuff
like you know calling methods and fruit
dipole model and all that stuff but even
if you are just done with the basics I
guess es6 would be easy for you to
understand because es6 is mostly what I
have seen is kind of syntactic sugar but
it brings in a lot of useful features as
well so as of now what we see is that
es6 is mostly implemented in almost all
the browsers you can see that my current
browser states that it's demented ninety
seven percent so we are missing this
proper tail calls which is still called
optimization which we would take a look
later on but for now what the main point
is that es6 is properly implemented in
almost all the browsers and we can
pretty much make use of this at least
for the tutorial purposes but later on
if you want to like make your ad live on
the web then you can very much just
transpile it with babel to es 5 and that
would pretty much just work for you as
well so what I want to do in this
tutorial or rather in this introduction
video
is that I want to tell you about what
we're going to do in this whole web
series and that is really much take a
look at what es6 brings to us and get a
taste of it right so I hope I am
assuming that you know what JavaScript
is before starting this series because
if you do not know then probably the
series this playlist wouldn't be a lot
beneficial for you because I won't be
covering the JavaScript aspects of my
JavaScript I mean the old es5 aspects
like you know all that default stuff
like loops and objects and other stuff
well I'm gonna go into that we just got
to take a look at what es6 brings to us
so yeah that's all for this one and
again if you like that then please don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you on the other side
real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
