Mei hole and welcome to your fourth
responsive web design tutorial in which
we'll be moving down a little and would
convert some more things into responsive
design so in the last tutorial we
converted the header into a responsive
header but I guess we can make a little
modification what we can do is that
first of all the header just simply pops
up at a very high resolution right one
two eight zero is not something that
your site should switch to mobile view
that's not the right size right so what
we can do is that we can get rid of some
of these elements right here by saying
um like most of all this just brings
down to 720 maybe right and then we can
say that this is left and I'll say every
second list item should be gone right
something like that but we do have a
problem we are now missing the plasma
button right so we can just quickly
bring it back by saying that the last
child should be display:block right so
we do get that jumping effect with the
plus more button so that it doesn't look
bad so we can just copy this and if I
shrink it down to I guess we need to get
rid of one more
button right so we can just get rid of
the farm as well
you will dot right was it right yeah so
we can just give it some precedence like
that and there we are so we can just
copy this and go ahead and write another
media query media only screen and right
now I'm just making it responsive on the
web that means it will just scale
properly if I scale my browser it
wouldn't work right now on devices we'll
just take a look how to finalize that
later on so I'm going to say 1280 pixels
and there we go
and again this looks good and I guess we
missed that the last child one last cell
display:block right and there we go so
once we hit 720 it goes to a regular
sized menu all right cool now what we
need to do is to convert just hang this
jumbled mess into a responsive layout
right so first things first you see that
font itself is a big problem this font
is way too big for mobile devices right
and if you see then I have desponding
pixels right so we can touch another
topic here what that is the difference
between the pixel size and the e/m and
REM right so what essentially pixels to
is that one pixel is one pixel on the
screen right but what eeehm does the e/m
right here if I write is to e/m what iam
means essentially is that it is nothing
but the browser
things are let me just rather explain it
this way if your size if your element
size is let's say you would just have
only one element on the screen and you
size it one size to 2m it essentially
means that it is two times the default
size of text on your browser right so
what does that mean actually well that
means that by default Google Chrome
comes with HTML size as 16 pixels right
so if you do something like this and I
don't know this hello world and take a
look inside the HTML uncomputable
is 16 pixels right so this is the
default font size the Chrome browser
comes with right so if you're writing
this as something like be tiles or let's
just make it be only we can we style it
in the inspector window if I make it one
size to e/m what this is essentially
doing is that it is taking 16 pixels
from the settings of the browser or
rather not the settings but I should use
the parent tag and multiplying it with
whatever size you have right here so 1
am essentially means we are writing 16
pixels 1 a.m. or 16 pixels is same size
right to e m is 32 pixels right and you
can see in the computed here as well we
just hide all you can see that computed
the study 2 pixels fair enough okay so
what the heck then our EMS well how I
remember these things is that REM is
more like route
I am root and root tag is HTML in every
document
so what REM does is that it takes the
font size of your root element that is
HTML right here and then multiplies it
by two whereas the e/m takes the font
size of the parent element and then
multiplies it by whatever number you
have supplied so I can just create a
real quick sample to show you what I'm
talking about a hello world one and
level two let's just make it here right
and if I change the font size of body to
let's say two here now you can clearly
see what happened here in the second P
tag we have two e m and it inherited the
actually it inherited the font from the
body which itself had to him which
actually inherited the font size from
the HTML which was 16 pixel right so
what essentially happened here is that
we started with HTML HTML which had a
font size of 16 pixels right and then we
got down to body I know there's a text
tool but it looks kind of cool
to write it with a pencil and it has got
two ear so essentially it is now 2 times
16 and then we finally get down to the P
tag right which again
has to e/m which essentially means that
it is 2 times 16 which it inherited from
the body times 2 which is this two year
right but what essentially to REM means
is that you are always always always
inheriting from the root tag that is
HTML tag this tag is to REM which is 2
into 16 right so it would always
interact with HTML it doesn't care who
the parent is or whatever relation it is
in with other elements it will just
multiply the font size of the HTML
attribute with the number supplied here
so that means that if I change the font
size of HTML itself to do REM you can
see that both of them both scalar I say
remove this or rather just delete this
element and try to total this you can
see that even REM toggles because it is
inheriting from the HTML tag but on the
other hand if I bring it back and remove
this you can see only the second piece
kills because it is inheriting from its
parent as well so that was some quick
information on what pixels e/m and REM
do and by the way as you see that eeehm
can get out of hand real quick
so essentially you should be sticking
with REM only if you want to use that
because you know if you change your
structure a little bit or mess around
with styles you can end up with
extremely large or extremely small size
falls depending upon what you did so
anyhow let's just set some breaking
points for these texts and I guess we do
have a problem
with this menu as well right now is that
it comes with open structure sort of
right so or we can do is pretty much
stay it here the matter is display:none
right so yeah so let's just take a look
if you need any break point out there
720
I guess 720 might be a good place to
shrink the font size a little bit and I
can just move to am I can just make it
in 2 p.m. as well so if I go with like
16 pixels right for my browser so it's
around around 4 a.m. 4 point something
so I guess four would be fine and this
one right there is 31 pixels so this
goes along to ears to ear and again make
use of Aria and I guess I made use of en
in this one right so let's just s to
Arielle there we go now or we can do
next is just now we can change this or
shrink this down to let's just a 3.5 and
this 1 to 1.5
and by the way you do not need to copy
all the cells just the style you have
changed right yeah looks good and I
guess we could also increase its line
height because it's kind of sticking
right now I don't know what original
line height it is or even if I specified
it no not really
so yeah to them two point five looks
good enough two point five it is and
essentially these all are pixel values
only there's no difference right because
nonetheless they are just computed two
pixels only these are just number
multiplied by 16 on my computer and this
some other value depending upon their
settings if they have tampered it on
some other computer right
so essentially you are still doing in
pixels so we have this and then finally
I think around 480 would be a good break
point so we can add media only screen
and maximum width for ready and again we
can just copy these things same stuff
shrink and outdo 2.5 and get down to one
line hi 1.5 maybe and if you take a look
you can see that we haven't had 480 yet
and there you go it kind of looks a
little bit small so let's just make it
aa
1.3 or something I don't know or maybe
1.5 would be good enough for it or now
let's just make it 2 it's this all
hidden trial game and you have to
inspect on various devices
especially the most popular ones for
your websites to actually take a look
how they are looking and I guess that
should be good for this set of things
and about these icons what we can do is
that we bring it down and they start to
create a problem around 9:50 so we can
set a 1080 breakpoint for the icons or
maybe a little bit less I guess 1080
would be a safe bet so media only screen
and maximum width 1080 pixels let's just
keep that in order so that it looks nice
and what we can do is again we can just
get rid of some divs here so we can stay
another child - well right here
something like that or you know 2n plus
1 or maybe even 3 and if you want to
have some more
so that should do right and do if you
bring it down a little bit more I guess
720 would be a good point for this one
as well so we can say that there we go
and we can say do it here now now this
could be a little bit of problem because
um what this media query is doing is
that it's hiding every third element and
what this would do is that it would hide
every second element as well now this is
some sort of case where you know minimum
weight could come handy if you're just
doing this style so what I can write is
and minimum width
720 pixels so these Styles I do not want
to hide every third and every second
because apparently what would happen if
I had these 9 blocks then every third
would hide this or rather I should not
remove that would hide this this and
this and every second will hide this
this 6 1 &amp;amp; 8 so essentially I do not
want this at 720 I want only 2 4 6 8 to
be hidden but it's actually having 3 &amp;amp; 9
as well because of this right so we can
just make use of this so that these
styles go away as soon as we hit 720
right so if you hit save and hard reload
you can see we have 3 and hidden I'd as
soon as we hit 720 yeah we get 2 2 n
elements and they're all good so let's
just say if I had not quit on this thing
what would have happened you can see
that we get only 3 of those right now
but we should probably get 4 right it's
not a lot of difference because I have
quite less images right here but it
would make a significant difference if
you have a lot of things in a row right
so again I guess the 500 would be a good
point or 520 if you want to place this
so media only screen and maximum width
is 20 pixels and again we can just
simply resize these images as well
that's not a problem instead of just
hiding every time um we can say which is
the I don't know
hundred pixels or maybe it's large 70
looks good but our images are straight
we'll just take a look at that in a
moment
and to fix this what we can do is I
remember we had added maximum right here
and we can set height a daughter so if I
reload this I'm not really okay so we
have hard-coded this we get need to
remove this height:auto like that and
there we go right so it looks good until
390 hits and then again there's a little
bit of problem
so I guess beyond 390 would probably
just hide it completely right so I can
say media only screen and maximum width
3 or 400 let's escape it we can finally
say because it's better to have less
elements in a mobile view so that you do
not just simply clutter the user with
useless things right so this kind of
looks good but we would need to Center
this on 390 so that or anyways it
doesn't actually makes a lot of sense
because I haven't seen any phone which
is that much small and that much tall
right so these these sort of phones do
they even exist I don't know so you can
just Center this or you can just leave
that it's up to you but essentially what
we have covered right now is that our
screen properly Scrolls and we can do a
couple of more improvements if you want
and one of them would be what to do with
this background I mean it looks cool on
the next of view but
it's sort of sucks when you just keep
scrolling I mean for somebody running a
tablet of this size it looks good but
the background is slightly out of place
right this one is also good I mean yes
the background is kind of okay for this
page but essentially if you want to move
it then how would you do that
we'll just take the look on all of the
stuff in the next tutorial because that
is all for this one and if you like this
