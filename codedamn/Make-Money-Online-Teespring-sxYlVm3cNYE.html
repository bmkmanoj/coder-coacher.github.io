fifth part in making money online
tutorial series and in this video what
I'll be showing you is an interesting
site called D spring now there are many
other sites similar to this on internet
but I like this one because it's
trustworthy are paid a lot of users and
a lot of friends of mine so you know i
can say that you can rely on the side
because this is authentic are legit so
what this site is all about is that if
you have got good graphic skills and if
you can design t-shirts then what you
can do is you can design one t-shirt
then you would distribute that t-shirt
to various people then what would happen
is that some of the people who like your
t-shirt would place an order and you
would set a minimum threshold order
limit which when reached then the
teespring this site would start printing
your t-shirt and sending the orders to
the clients and return you would get
commission so on a lot of sales you can
make a lot of money out of this site
without actually doing much of the
things so let me show you how this works
so first of all go to teespring calm
click on login and once the page loads
you can use your facebook google or
yahoo account well i'll just go with
facebook for now you could even create
your new account on the site itself with
your email address and when you're
logged in it will take you back to the
homepage and then what you have to do
next is click on this get started now
button once you click on this button you
would be presented to a URL like designs
this and edit and here is what the magic
happens now here this is your t-shirt
and you are free to design your t-shirt
for example if I am creating a t-shirt
for code am so i can write go down here
and then i could arrange this change the
fonts and do some other editing as well
well obviously you would like yours to
make the t-shirt yourself in photoshop
or something so for that we have this
option call at so you could either
browse artwork to get all of this or you
could actually upload your own so if you
have your own images we should think
would be good for the t-shirt and would
be a lot of attractive and presentable
to the users then you could upload your
own now here you can select the color of
your t-shirt and let's say I go with
white only for now and this is the
printable area so you see that
everything would be printed in this area
so you could actually design the back as
well and the front as well or the
t-shirt and the more the graphics you
add the more would be the base cost so
if you have like just a text then the
base cost would be less if you have some
more graphics then it would be
increasing with those
fix so you see the base cost is right
now six point two five dollars and if i
add a text then it increases to eight
point seven dollars and if i add an
amazed as well well then it increases
even further a few cents it will be
updated shortly and if you select a
color as well then it would go up to
nine point two five now when you are
done with your t-shirt styling then
click on next now here you have to set
the sales goal limit now sales goal
limit means that how many t-shirts
should be ordered before they are
printed so this is kind of like back our
drink of t-shirts where the people would
order your t-shirts first and then when
you meet a minimum goal limit then only
d spring would print your t-shirts and
would send you the commission in one go
so the more you set your sales goal the
more would be your profit so let's say
if you're confident enough and set it to
thousand t-shirts then estimated prophet
is 16,000 our MSA $15,000 so how does
that work is that whenever you launch
this t-shirt and let's say in a given
time limit a thousand people ordered
this t-shirt with the price of $22 then
when a thousand people completely orders
your t-shirt then teespring would start
printing this t-shirt and would send to
these users and would send you sixteen
thousand dollars so that's not bad I
think and you can have optimize your
campaign by adding an additional style
you can style this tee shirt even more
and you can edit this again if you want
to then if you're ready then click on
next and then you could give your camp
in a title Maiko damp tea
and description and the camp in length
now camp in length also affects your
earnings so let's see if you select 26
days and you complete your target then
you would be pier otherwise if you don't
complete a target that you won't be paid
and the t-shirts won't be printed at all
so that's one of the thing you have to
take care about that you meet here
google limit before your time limit so
if you don't then you would lose all of
your money so you can check all of these
if you want to ship the t-shirt yourself
and show the back side by default would
be the back side would be shown whenever
the product is shown to the client and
once you are done with all of this click
on the launch button and I won't do that
because this is not the official t of
goddamn i would be creating one and
probably would be posting the link in
the description but if we don't find the
link in the description and don't worry
because you know i would be creating a
tee an official tea for go down
subscribers which they can purchase but
it's not going to be soon enough so you
have to wait a few weeks i guess for
this so that's it for this video and
that's how you can make money out of
t-shirts and out of your graphic skills
so you could even browse the site to see
how people are designing beautiful DS
and selling all of them so i guess
that's it for this tutorial and here you
can see all of these tees and you could
actually select the category you like or
i'll just show you this one
so you see I'll just show one example so
when you will click the launch button
you will also get a customized paid
something like this and this would be
the T shown on the left side and your
campaign name and the description on the
right and you could select some colors
as a user and it says campaign has ended
but your cabin won't be ended this much
soon so this tea made 92 out of 10 so
the maker of this t-shirt said 90 set a
goal of 10 sales but actually made 92 so
his profit would be about I don't know
one hundred or two hundred dollars
something like that which is not a bad
deal at all so that's it for this
tutorial and happy money making</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
