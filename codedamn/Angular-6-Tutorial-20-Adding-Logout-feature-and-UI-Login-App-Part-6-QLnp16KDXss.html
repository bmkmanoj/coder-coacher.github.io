may-who and welcome to your 20th angular
6 tutorial in which you're gonna take a
final look at our login application and
finish it off and make it ready so let's
get started so what's left
well the UI and the logout part mostly
as the final things which we need to
have at least so let's start with the UI
I'm just gonna speed this up really
quick because now it's not really a part
of angular I hope you know about HTML
and CSS so that's essentially what we're
gonna do here so let's get into it
alright so with the UI being done what
we want to do now is pretty much just
create the blog old functionality right
so what I want to do is pretty much go
to my administrator area right here and
just in front of it and it's gonna say a
router link slash logout and I'm just
gonna say logout and give it a class of
button and we just gotta copy this
button from our login component not
login but the home there we are inside
our admin so now if you just go to admin
we would be able to see this log out
button so let's just make it work what
we want to do is go to our app module
and right here just kind of say one more
thing that the path should be logout
component should be logout component
let's just create this component ng
generate or ng GC logout
and this would do our work so logout
component there we are right and yep
let's just close this file don't see if
go to app modules again let's just add
another thing which would be part logout
component is logout component there we
are and inside our logout component
logout component we can just say logging
you out and right here inside our
typescript file
we're just gonna say here this dot user
dot logout not subscribe data and then
we're just gonna say if data dot success
is true then just log navigate the sky
to this dot router dot navigate to home
right so let's just inject these two
guys really quick private user user
service and five eight router is router
and we can just get rid of this thing so
let's just create this on user service
really quick get some data is logged in
log out and we're going to just return
this dot HTTP dot get let's just keep it
like that
slash API slash logout dot PHP and and
this should return us logout status just
create this interface log of status as
success is boolean right and once that
is done what I
want is else just alert some problem we
don't know about so I'm just gonna
really quickly create my logo dot PHP
file here logout dot PHP and I'm just
gonna say session start I'm gonna just
say I believe it was session destroy'
here
but before that we can just unset the
session variable as well session
I actually forgot about how to work with
sessions in PHP a good way but I think
that should do our job so yep one more
thing inside here where we are where is
it oh eh nope logout dot PHP I'm just
gonna finally just say what I'm gonna
say is success
it's true and yep that's pretty much it
so we can just get rid of this debugger
call where is it in which file the guard
file there we are now let's just get rid
of this so now if we just go to slash
admin we have a secret message for a
message wrongly I log out
I go to admin we get who the F are you
okay so when we log out actually we just
want to update the service as well so
I'm just gonna say this dot user dot set
or this dot auth dot we just need to
inject that as well I wait earth or
service this dot all the set login
status to false so now you can see that
if I reload this thing if I just login
right admin admin here its summit we get
a secret message for administrator only
I click on logout we logout we go to
admin we cannot because we need to talk
in first I enter wrong credentials hit
summit we get invalid credentials
everything's working just like that we
get a secret message for anis traitor we
can logout and obviously in the session
also persist so I can just reload the
page and it would still work just like a
charm so that is how pretty much you
would create a very basic login
application with angular front-end and
PHP back-end the backend part is simple
you just need to create some sessions
there depending upon the lang
you're using it back-end but this is
essentially the core of creating a log
an application with angular so yeah
that's all for this one and I'll see you
then in the next video and one more
thing if you like this video then don't
