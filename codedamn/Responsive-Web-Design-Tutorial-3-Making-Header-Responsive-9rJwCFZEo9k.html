Rachel and welcome to your third
responsive web design tutorial in which
I'm going to show you how to pad
actually now it's not rocket science you
can just start off straight away but you
just need to know a little bit of things
in order to keep going right so usually
what I used to do in the past as a
freelancer I've done were 300 to 400
projects on responsive web design alone
itself right so what I used to do is I
used to start from the top right and the
Adhan here I didn't really did not care
about what the bottom look like till I
reached that portion right so I'm gonna
start off with the header do the head of
first I would make sure the header is
responsive I won't give a damn about
what the other things are looking like
once the header is complete I move down
to the next component or whatever it is
right so that should essentially be the
strategy as well so I used to I usually
fire of my inspect element here and the
developer tools actually inspect element
looks sort of Kadesh to say so the
developer tools I use I resize the
screen size with it and you can see it
looks awfully done right now on the
phones our fonts are not resizing
everything is overflowing and I have
just I get ya hit in the overflow X and
you can see it looks awfully bad it's
not responsive at all and you're gonna
hit me if you with it my my website
right now okay so let's just do
something about it so let's just start
with the header and if I see then the
header is cool
let's to say until one two eight zero
pixels right which i think is a standard
sign of some sort of device one two is
there is a resolution right so
yeah it looks cool till one two eight
zero so we can set a breakpoint on that
now what do I mean actually by a
breakpoint is that at one two eight zero
some different sort of PSS would come
into play right it doesn't matter if
you're running 1600 pixel display or
16000 takes of display as long as your
displays does not fit 1 2 is your mark
your CSS would or your layout would look
thin but the moment you cross that your
layout would be governed by some
different styles and how do we do that
will actually let us see so this will
page and this is a style so let's just
go ahead and I'm just gonna go ahead and
just paste all my responses I'll here
only responsive web design in a head and
there we go right so yeah okay so first
of all let's see media stay media only
three and maximal with one two eight
zero pixels now there are a whole lot of
ways to do responsive media queries and
people use a minimum width not all that
stuff but in most cases you would not
require that trust me I have done a lot
of projects and I haven't ever ever used
minimum width for any sort of such thing
because it just kind of adds confusion
because you can you can do that it will
just I'll even tell you what it does it
just kind of removes your query from if
you write like 600 pixels
it'll just you know remove these styles
but it's useless you can just do that
without even removing these and just
show you in a while
me as a matter of testing I'm going to
say something like this down okay guys I
guess we do not have our Styles yes we
have yeah okay needed a cash refresh you
can see that our website have gone and
the moment I hit the mark you can see
it's visible again it's gone with you're
gone with able and we are doing all that
stuff
directly from our CSS right so that's
not a very helpful media query so let's
just get rid of this so right now what
you're seeing is that we actually need
to do something about this header right
so the best thing I can think is
converting this header into a menu sort
of thing now this would go a little bit
into adaptive web designing
instead of responsive but it would be
worth it right because on the mobile
phones or tablets I think that adding a
menu sort of a three-line or whatever we
call that and clicking that to show the
menu would be a lot helpful and easy to
use instead of just aligning these items
in a role in a grid or whatever that
would look ugly right so move let's go
ahead and create one so I guess I have
to go into an extra PHP right here and
if we take a look where the menu is it
alright alright alright there it is
right this is the top down looks cool
and what we can do here is we can
and if we take a look in the browser for
the top now we have got two you will
left and right and obviously just need
to stylist for now okay
so we have the logo as the UL element
holy yeah right okay so yeah we can just
create another one top nav and let's
just give it dot Nam desktop lets us
take and then we can just simply go
ahead and do top nav mark and there is
we'll just just drop now to top now
desktop replace all there we go
and what we are going to do here is the
rest a top nav desktop the planar and
dot now must display block which would
essentially be or actually let's put
this above because I'm not sure about
the residence I guess it would be just
best to move these above our other CSS
styles
actually I just forgot the order in
which the styles are respected so maybe
let's just keep it at the bottom we'll
just move it in the top if there's any
sort of problem so what we are going to
do is just add the top nav small
display:none here and yeah so now what
happens is that we are just displaying
the same menu again but we want to make
some changes right so I'm going to say
this is 5th class
logo mobile and just gonna copy and
paste this case and I'm going to say you
will class the mobile menu let's just
get rid of this these items are
perfectly fine we can get rid of this
and we are good to go now finally what
we need is the div ID many toddler to
open menu something like this and yeah
that's pretty much it on the end of HTML
the rest of the task would be done by
CSS right so our menu is no longer
visible and the city code look here
topmast smaller I guess if we miss
something here yeah okay so the styles
are overriding but we don't see anything
because it's
somewhere down here right so again first
assault let us copy the styles we have
in here so we can say that rather
justice to this their only position
fixed top:0 left:0 all that usual
nonsense which we do on rather less
popular solid right and let's paste it
here let's just get rid of height
because we do not have me to hard-code
that now and if I reload you can see
that we are getting an ugly sort of
thing we need to resize Loganville as
the width 300 pixel and one more thing
you can do is that I usually do this I
select every element and I say maximum
where this 100 person now what this does
is that it helps us to just set the
width of the parent container of an
image and the image automatically
resizes because if you see that without
this your parent container is 300 pixels
but the image does not give a damn right
so yeah so this is it just comes handy
sometimes so it'll be just better if you
do that as well right so and yeah you
I'm just keeping these tiles outside
because they are not specified right now
because the menu would not be actually
visible unless you hit the right screen
size so it doesn't matter you can just
keep them here at all as well it's up to
you so we have this and takes the light
shadow won't work margin:0 auto would be
good for a mobile sort of device and
we'll just copy that later so we have
the menu now and if you take a look at
this menu what we can do you can say
font size
a slightly bigger padding is 10 pixels
color hopefully and yeah yeah that looks
to it let's just copy this paste it here
actually I could just have sort of
configured with a module reloader and
the red bag and all the stuff but I'm
just too lazy give me that anyhow I just
god I need to copy the code all along
the way right so yeah I was just missing
the slogan vile as well so there we go
add the finally what we can do is that
we can after the page content display
block and content should be rather
triple bar and I remember it from you a
day 0 1 or rather just 8 8
probably not as Unicode is two two six
nine okay after enough of googling I
figured out its Unicode is actually two
six three zero right so yeah looks good
and we can say that display:block
position:absolute on with this model
wishing relative to this then we're
gonna say write zero top zero or what we
have ten pixels and write ten pixels as
well right so this is how pretty much it
would look and we can here say that it
is cursor:pointer the whole menu and
we'll just copy all of this code
straight away and you can just place it
here as well wherever it looks good
right so there we go
and finally what we need to do is we
need to hide these and before hiding we
need to actually style these a little
bit we on stage color or Ally a color
white text except decoration none I'm
starting five pixels display block that
lands Center or should be
now let's disable left eye and let's say
starting left twenty pixels what's this
make a fatty four by sixes our model
five six tools we can just use shorthand
as well I'm just about lab rating things
here so yeah and if you take a look our
whole a line looks good and you can do
something like our background is
something like this but it looks awful
so just wanna give it up lighter shade
than the current one so this looks nice
right and again we just kind of based
off this code whoops there we go right
and you're almost there we just need to
add some functionality to trigger this
menu now I remember there are some CSS
ways as well to do this but I think the
JavaScript one would be the most
intuitive and obvious thing to do so
what we're going to do and we'll simply
go to any of the JavaScript file which
the page is using and you can actually
just separate the logic as well and I
have no idea what this means right now
yeah anyway so I'm just going to stay
some time using jQuery so I can just go
ahead with this only and let's just go
traditional
so what I'm going to is the say that so
if I remember it correctly can't read
that's just a hundred millisecond delay
or let's just one on the struggle this I
guess we do have jQuery so if I reload
this yep looks cool
and yeah that's all pretty much the
header you can see when if you are
really desperate you can add a little
water walking one two solid and again
you can just match it with the frequency
a little bit so that it looks like or
you can have the two water top instead
of water bottom right so that will
pretty much give it a look and there we
are then
so that's all pretty much you create a
very basic whoa menu but I guess our
displays and getting hidden so what the
problem is is that we just close to
display:none here so there we go and
there is top nap desktop now cool but
we're stuck now model okay so yeah we
are just missing we can just get rid of
this div here so then we just bring down
the president to look and there we go
so that is all pretty much you create a
responsive header and yeah I guess it is
okay for now so yeah that's all for this
tutorial and the next one will be moving
on to the next component and see how
what we can do about that and that's all
for this one and if you liked it then
