may hold and welcome to your 16th
tutorial or electron and let's just
continue with our crazy images up right
and we have this image effect function
but we do not have the function which we
created here which is set effect which
would be called now this energy change
would be called every time we slide the
slider so this is where we need to
actually update our CSS as well and we
get a props dot well so we're going to
call this first scented percentage
because that is or rather whatever you
want to call this I'm just going to go
with percentage and what we can do in
here is pretty much first of all let's
say how our scope dot do effects look
like and see what happens to it I click
on brightness I go to console I increase
the brightness we see that for rightness
its value becomes 139 which is exactly
what we want and the other parameters
has changed perfect
right so we do not need to do anything
right here to the brightness so
effectively we can just get rid of this
person page last well if you want in the
Edit image so we can just say this as
that effect right so what we're going to
do is we're going to recompute the style
every time this function is called so
I'm going to create a generated Styles
variable somewhere here
generated styles and I'm going to again
set them generated styles to blank so
that we can just begin every time with a
clean slate
and I'm going to finally say for I let
pie in scope dot effects now this
essentially gives the eyes equal to
let's say for the first run rightness
and scope dot effects I and then well
would give us all the access to that
properties right so I'm going to say
generative styles is I would like to
have something like brightness as ten
percent something like that and since
CSS is case insensitive so we do not
need to worry about these being capital
right so that's an advantage um if you
might not notice that these are all
valid ESS WebKit filters so we can just
do something like filter and we can just
pick up anything like that or we can
just pick to 4% or anything like that we
can just go ahead and do that so what
I'm going to do is stay pretty much like
oh let's just go ahead with template
shrink why not I and then inside the
braces
I want to scope dot if X dot X I dot
value and then scope dot effects i dot
delimiter and in the space at the last
right so yep and we just want this to
offend not just set it equal to right
and then finally we can just console
launch and graded styles to see what we
are getting and if you run this e1
rightness and if you increase the
brightness let's say we are getting this
thing so if I just go ahead and set my
element to the image if we set the
filter to this thing
although we are getting some problem
here
right the problem is we have space and
degree right so let's just get rid of
that so we're going to remove that okay
so now that should work fine now finally
what we need to do is very much actually
let's just get a reference image
stressed friends and how we can do that
is the by staying ID main image we can
stay document dot get element by IP main
image and then finally we can save or
actually we do not need to put that in
scope so we can say imager from stock
style dot filter is generated style and
yep so if we take a look now II won
brightness increase the brightness you
can see that our filter works perfectly
fine right let me just increase the
width of this slider it's way too small
right now so here we have our content
this is our effect and whether it's so
small dot effect we can say this is flex
one and align I align then stretch
display flex justify content Center
align I'd done Center and the Flex
Direction column for this one and
finally we can just paste it in
our styles and II won rightness we can't
go ahead and crease and decrease the
brightness okay so that is all for this
tutorial and we learn how you actually
apply the effect we are performing here
right here and this would actually work
with every other effect as well if you
want to try because we have made a
generalized solution for this so if we
go like saturated we can go to two
hundred or zero percent and I don't
really know what that means actually it
kind of looks like just grayscale to me
but there might be a difference with
some other images so yeah that's all for
this one and in the next video we are
gonna cover some more information and
actually let the user return to the
effects page as well so that's all for
this one and if you liked it then please
don't forget to subscribe and like the
video and thank you for watching I see
you them in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
