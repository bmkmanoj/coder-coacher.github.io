fifth C++ tutorial in which I want to
tell you guys about cascading of C out
operator now cascading means that you
are outputting multiple things on the
screen at one go now how that works
I'll show you let's say I have a
variable a is 10 and I have a variable B
is 20 and you could actually do this in
a single line so I'll just put 10 and
put a comma right here equal B Stella
so the comma would just separate the
Declaration of a and B so now this line
is equivalent to int a equals 10
semicolon and B equals to 10 semicolon
so now what I'll do is I'll write end
add up is a plus B and subtract is a
minus B and divide is a by B and
multiply is a star B now to output all
of these what we were using so far were
four lines of C out like that but that
is kind of tedious so we have got
something called cascading in C++ with
the C out operator which would actually
allow you to output or output all of
that in a single line so just as we use
2 greater than signs with C out right
here let's say I write string adding a
plus B now let's say I want to give the
output in the single line so I'll add
more of two cascading operators this is
called cascading operator now I won't
refer them with double greater-than sign
anymore so this is called cascading
operator and I write add up
again cascading operator then I'll write
a space give some space and I'll write
subtracting a and B we don't need I
guess these words so I'll just leave
that alright so a minus B gives us
subtract cascading again a by B gives us
divide and a star B gives us multi so
that's pretty much it
let's run this code and I guess we had a
typo here all right so let's run the
code so you see that a plus B gives us
20 a minus B gives us zero correct a by
B gives us one yep and a star B gives us
hundred seems good okay so now when to
use cascading now the reason I'm using
cascading here is first of all I am
outputting a string then I'm outputting
a variable which are both of god
different from each other because I can
do just like simply like this so the C++
compiler won't know what I'm trying to
do so what it would do is it would just
concatenate all of these in a single
line and would output them so a plus B
would concatenate with this would
concatenate with this with this with
this with this with this and so on now
you could actually make them on
individual lines by using something
called and L now and L is not a variable
and you can't have one because it's a
reserved keyword so and L would mean
that there should be an end-of-line so
there should be a new line and therefore
you need a cascading again because this
is kind of different from a variable as
well so I'll just cascade and they'll a
couple of more times and you see that
it's kind of uniform after everything we
have got a cascading and I'm gonna
execute this program so you see that
everything now appears on a new line
which seems neater so that's what
cascading is all about in C++ and we'll
be looking at some of the more
interesting features in C++ soon so
that's it for this tutorial
and I'll see you then next time don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
