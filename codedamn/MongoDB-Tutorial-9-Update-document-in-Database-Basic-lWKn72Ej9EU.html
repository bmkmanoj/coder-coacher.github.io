Nicole and welcome to your ninth mongodb
tutorial in which I'm gonna show you how
to add actually not add but how to
update your record or your document in
your database for MongoDB and let me
just make some space here and right now
then I'm gonna say if I get this again
right right so now if I say like DB dot
name start fine pretty you see that we
get only one record da da da
but let's say I want to update this
record right so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna say DV dot names dot update then
again it's been except an object and
right here I'm gonna say that the field
should be named which should be you know
you have to match this thing then only
the object would be updated so your name
should be da da da right and what it
should be done is say that it should be
set to then the name should be set to
let's say me whole again
right so the set would just kinda pretty
much change whatever Matt is matched
right here so it would then change the
name to me whole if I specify any other
property then it could add it as well so
right now if I hit enter well it looks
like you haven't closed something ok so
it looks like what are we missing right
there
DV dot names set name equal to me hole
this one close this one host and this
one Oh probably or terminate it's rope
okay so bad day today well anyways now
we have got this record has updated so
I'm gonna right
DB dot names dot find not pretty
well it doesn't need pretty right now I
can see that pretty much I got named to
me all right now if I write like DB dot
name start insert and say like name -
Meho and like web website - now right
and if I run the same command here with
me hole to it and true same command me
on three like that and I just have four
records and what I want to do now is I
want to say update and actually let me
just clear this out because it kind of
sucks on writing command terminal but
you know I'm helpless I've just started
started the series so let's just edit
this or actually let's just make it to
this thing and DB dot name start update
update and then actually I'm gonna say
this should be the website in this case
and this should be null and if it is
null then what I want to do is set the
name the name to not activated account
or inactive account or whatever you want
to say that hit enter you can see that
it matched one but if you have looked
closely enough in our fine you would see
that our object like those who are
actually there were three objects right
but it just worked with one right so
what that means pretty much is that it's
not working on all objects at the same
time so what you need to do is right
here with this set you want to add a
multi to be true which kind of makes
sure that all of the records are updated
true and hit enter and oh wait a minute
looks like again has some sort of syntax
problem so this should be
Multi to be true and make sure you get
rid of that as well now you can see that
in and match to and modified three so
now if i well that is a such pain to get
this thing right because it's following
my cursor but anyway so now if i say DB
dot name start find and you can see that
the name all the names are changed to
not activate it and the reason the first
one is changed to not activate it as
well is because the website null matched
that one as well because the field
doesn't exist at all so now you can what
you can say is that now we just add
another record right there and say like
website is google and now you can say
that whatever website is now say you you
are fired
and hit enter now see the records not
pretty enter I can see that Google is
retained other all three are kind of
changed to you are fired right so that
is how you pretty much do a very basic
updation in MongoDB and again as I said
in the last one there are more
complicated and complex way to update
data but right now we don't need them
because we are kind of learning that so
that is all for this tutorial and if you
