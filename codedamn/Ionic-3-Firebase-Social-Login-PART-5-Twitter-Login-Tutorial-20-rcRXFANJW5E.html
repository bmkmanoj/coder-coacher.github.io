rather the next tutorial for the series
of social login with the ionic framework
and firebase and let's just take a look
at how we can set up Twitter login this
time with firebase and angular 4 and
actually rather vibe ionic right so
let's just enable this and we again need
two things that is the first one being
the API key and the second one is ABS
secret and it's a lot familiar with the
lot similar with the Facebook one so
what you need to do is go to this app
store intercom and if you haven't
actually created any app then you should
probably see a bigger button than this
one so just create a new app enter your
name or not your name but the name of
your application versus name it like
social login apt description blah blah
blah blah blah website right so let's
just go with localhost right and for the
callback we're going to paste this URL
again this one right and yep I agree
with whatever you say Twitter because
without that you wouldn't allow me to
create that the client application phase
verification a lot of valid URL social
login app blah blah and localhost com
why the heck not so let's just create a
Twitter application now you can see that
I'm getting some messages but anyways so
your application has been created very
nice very nice and where are my keys
Twitter keys and access token then we
have our consumer key probably our app
API key right consumer secret yep looks
like API secret safe and tada you
are ready to log in with Facebook and
holy crap
my editor was open all this time so
anyways so what I'm going to do is again
create the same thing and actually
you're smart enough then you could
actually reduce this thing log in with
Facebook log in with Google log in with
Twitter just a single function itself
because I am seeing that the pattern is
quite predictable this firebase author
provider returns you're very nicely laid
out like the name is always display name
property in the user object the email if
present would always be in the response
that user that email the photo URL would
always be in response to the user dot
for the URL one thing I didn't like
earlier about these auto writers is that
they are all messed up and it's not
their fault obviously they do not know
what others are doing
but the firebase does that for you so it
organizes all for example Google might
send you the name as user name as the
property name Facebook might send it
like display name - they might send it
like the main name or whatever so you
know you need to write some reddit
repetitive code just because of the
change of the name of these properties
but anyway so you can reduce that to one
function as well I'm not doing it right
now
so we're going to do this at Twitter and
I am pretty much your rest of the code
should remain the same we can safely get
rid of one console log here and what we
need right here now is just another
button which just says login with
Twitter login with Twitter and we should
be good to go
right and login with Twitter
let's see did Ross for authorization of
this app sure Peter let it access me
so we are back we got our row I guess I
removed that right yep might not have
reflected changes yet well fair enough
we got our image we got the name but we
didn't get the email Eddie well that's
because Twitter does not provide email
ID by default to the users to the
developers you have to get your
application some sort of reviewed or
something to get users email address so
that is why Twitter does not send the
email address of the user by default so
yeah it's the wish your website right
you can even see that we got email as
now so anyways you know you get the idea
that you can how you can make use of
Twitter as well to actually authenticate
stuff and show it to the user itself and
again I'm pretty much sure there must be
some sort of way to improve improve this
quality because anyways even if it isn't
present here you do have the access
token well that's what really matters
right so you can do anything with the
access token so yeah that's all for this
one and if you liked it then again
please don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching I'll see you then
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
