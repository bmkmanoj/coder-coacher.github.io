Chrome extension development tutorial
and this tutorial will be looking at
something called rich notifications in
Google Chrome now this is a very cool
feature by Google developers for the
Google Chrome extension developers which
actually allows you to have some sort of
access to the user outside the browser
that means you could actually display a
beautiful notification to the user with
your extension even if the user is not
surfing the web with chrome and the
chrome is running in the background so
this is kinda takes your control level
from outside from inside the browser to
the outside the browser so let's see
first of all what these rich
notifications are so if you see right
here on this page google has shown some
examples to us that a typical rich
notification looks like this kind of
pop-up which consists of 20% width of
image and the rest is the text part and
this is a basic notification as you can
see as you can read here and Google
Chrome provides us certain types of
notification pop-ups which includes
basic list images progress so
these are not all but some of the most
used ones and these are pretty much you
would need in your extension so let's
get started and see what do we need to
have to develop these so let's get
inside our sublime text in the extension
and I've got a background OGS which is
not required for this tutorial but
anyways a manifest obviously required a
indexed or HTML file as a pop of one and
the s-1 which is linked into index dot
HTML and if you look into the manifest
then I have done some sort of edits and
I have basically removed the Twitter
extension from the manifest and created
a test extension name because our
extension of Twitter was completed so if
you would like to check out that then
you're free to go to my previous
tutorials in this series
and you have noticed that I have added
permissions notifications so
this would give us access to
notifications in Google Chrome
so let's get started in our s1 OGS file
first of all what you need to do is
chrome type chrome dot Nadi vacations
make sure you spell it right Chrome not
notifications yeah that create and it
accepts a bunch of parameters so the
first one would be options and second
one I guess is callback and there's one
more but we don't need that so the
callback is pretty much like what would
happen once the notification is shown to
the user so basically you can't write
your code here like something like alert
1 and expect that this code would run
after this code is executed because this
is asynchronous code and maybe this code
is executed before this code so we need
a type of callback function to be fired
when this is synchronous good is
executed by the browser so this thing
right here just won't work so we have
got a callback function ready and we
have got this an unnamed and strange
variable options and this option is a
pretty much object of certain details
which chrome requires from you
- pretty much that what your pop-up
would actually do so let's see what this
option is and how do you write the
option the option one for your the your
extension pop-up so for option we have
got type title message and icon
so this for our must to use in your
options and let's see what each of these
do
so let's write them out in the correct
syntax let's do a type let's say just
basic for now and this is something we
have got multiple values then we have
got a title which is the title to be
displayed in the pop-up which would be
shown down here let's get the title to
let's say my first pop-up with Chrome
the message which is under the title and
non bolded should be this is pretty cool
and the icon the icon is mandatory
because it has to be on the left of this
title and message and for now I'll just
give this Twitter icon which I had from
the previous extension and the URL is
local so this should be icon dot PNG and
we've got our options ready so now we
have a options object which has the type
as basic title distinct message this
this should gamma right here and I con
this one so this chrome notification
create API would automatically fix this
up and would take out all the necessary
information at once so let's say again I
go ahead and I console.log
pop-up done and now we have ready we are
ready with our first and will pop up in
chrome so let's reload this extension
and since the script is loaded inside
this index page which is the pop-up
default so now you could expect that
when I click on this icon right here the
test extension 1 then this page would be
fired and this page would call the
script and the script would call this
goal all this code
so now let's click on this chord
and I guess we had some errors maybe
let's check the console log property
icon unexpected property no worries
okay so this should be icon URL I guess
yeah so let's reload this now again and
yo Allah when we click this we got this
nice little pop-up down here if you see
this pop up is still visible if I
minimize minimize my screens and even if
I reload it again then even if I open
start Oh No
with the start it's not but when I show
my desktop to you then this screen and
this pop-up little pop-up is was visible
because this is managed by Chrome APs
and just don't pay attention on this
I've got a lot of crap on my next job
and all that anyways so yeah so we also
had a callback function and when I click
on this and we check the console for
this then we have got the pop-up done as
the callback so let's say if I do
console.log pop-up John with a question
mark and now
let's see
let's reload this let's check the
inspect element
with a console and now one thing you're
saying is that Papa done is logged
before this thing so this code executed
before this call back that simply means
that the code below this is executing
before the code this line which
symbolizes that this line or this API is
asynchronous and I would actually not
like to spell that in front of you
because I don't know it's spelling we
will so anyways so this is pretty much
how we create a nice little pop-up in
Google Chrome and we have got pretty
much like image list and basic and
progress I guess as the types and in the
next tutorial we'll be looking at all of
those and maybe in the future we would
be implementing this functionality in
one of our extensions we make so till
then stay tuned with me and don't forget
