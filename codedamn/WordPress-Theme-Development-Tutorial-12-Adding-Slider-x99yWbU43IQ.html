twelfth WordPress team development
tutorial my name is Mae hole and in this
tutorial I'm gonna add a slider to my
WordPress team and there are about three
ways to do that the first one being is
that you call your own slider
well that sounds awful because that
would take you a lot of time to do and
plus it would be just one durable too a
lot of bugs and all that stuff when you
start adding features like
responsiveness or transitions or
something like that so this brings us to
the second option and that is you just
go ahead on internet and download a
jQuery or any other slider and then set
it up where the RT well that kind of
looks cool as well but for that you
would need to do some coding from your
side also like you need to create a
custom post type which we would
eventually learn how to but not for now
because that's kind of advanced so this
brings us to our last option and that is
include a plugin so so far sounds good
that we could just include a plug-in
into our our WordPress theme and pretty
much makes things make things happen but
what about if you are kind of just
selling this team or just you know
releasing this team for free how would
your users know that you are making use
of this easing slider plug-in or any
other plugin in the world for your
slider well for that what we can do is
actually display a sort of and pop-up
for or an alert for a user which would
just simply show that you need to
require how you need to add this
particular plug-in to your website to
make proper make things work properly so
for now what we have is a couple of
things that is first of all we would
like to install and set up this plug-in
and then what we have to do is inform
the user about it that you need to
Stahl's plugin and this plugin kinda
looks old bad not really because it
requires you wordpress 4 or higher so
let's try this out ok so now just go to
your text editor and before even that
first of all let's just go to plugins
and write easing slider and install this
activate the plugin and here we go
so for easing slider has itself added
this option of sliders and all that
stuff so the next thing we need to do is
actually just go to this plugins editor
go to easing slider and just look at
this file carefully here because we're
gonna do something with this file so
what I'm gonna do is that good functions
and make some space for this and I'm
gonna save function show messages to
admin and what's gonna do is first of
all we're gonna say in you'd ones that
would be absolute path and this will
just give me absolute path in the
working directory and then WP admin and
feud's plug-in dot PHP so this is the
file which is right here you can see
right there
so change dudes so if you just go to
like include login dot PHP you want
pretty much get access from the
front-end might be from the back and
actually in PHP
so you can see that it is the plug-in
administration API and it is very huge
file about two thousand lines so we are
including this and while you're
including in this is to check whether or
not our slider is installed so how would
we check that well we need to check if
this plugin is activated or not and that
would pretty much give us the idea that
if this plug-in is installed or not
actually so I'm gonna say if is plug-in
active and right here I'm gonna say it
would be easing slider and this is the
file name I'm typing right here so this
would be easing slider and easing slider
dot PHP and if returns true that means
the plugin is activated otherwise it's
not so I'm gonna say that echo div ID
alert and class of errors so make sure
you give this class of errors so that
you know this highlights in your
dashboard and then I'm gonna echo again
I'm gonna say P and this team requires
you to install easing slider and then we
could actually just link this easing
slider to its own page so that pretty
much user doesn't have to just Google
this up so yeah so that looks like
you're pretty much done with this
okay so the next thing we need to hook
this up to the administration page so
I'm gonna say our action again admin
notices so this would be the next one
will be shown messages messages to admin
and make sure you spell that right yep
so now just go to your page and it sees
me echo 922 might have missed a
semicolon at the end yep
again reload okay so right now it
doesn't show us anything let's
deactivate the plugin and as you can see
that once we deactivated or kind of
deleted the plugin it shows us this team
requires you to install easing slider
and it would stay every time unless you
actually install this plug-in and
activate it as well so this might sound
buggy but if your team really requires
user to add a plug-in then this could be
one of the ways so let's just activate
this and then we're gonna create a
slider let's just say this is a primary
slider and add slide so it requires me
to add some images so let me just
download some images for the slider then
resume the video okay so now you can see
I have downloaded a bunch of files and
I'm just gonna upload them and I guess
one file was nothing exceeds the maximum
load so okay so this is two MBS it might
be a little larger than that so let's
just leave that so you have got two
files and yeah I have taken these files
in the order of what was recommended in
the PSD which is 1920 by 719 well that's
way too big for my screen
resolution is a 1600 by 900 but for some
desktops that was you know that is the
resolution so you might need to add that
up only and as you can see it says make
the slider responsive and Advanced
Options and a 100% full width slider and
crop resize images to the slider no on
now I don't want that a transition we
have effects as default then okay
everything else looks cool so let's just
update this and for all sliders if you
see that I have this primary slider and
what template function I need to just go
ahead and write in my appearance no
right here so what I can do is that
right here I could probably say out of
header I could say dividing slider team
or the other way around
theme slider div and right here I can
paste this code do a little bit of
cleaning out there so that it looks nice
so this is an idea of 34 and actually
what I want is that currently the slider
would display on every single page we
create because this is included in
header so that's not actually what we
want what I want is that this should
probably display only on homepage and
not on every friggin page so to do that
what we can do is I can say if function
exists easing slider and and is phone so
what this would do is that it would
whether the slider is at home or not and
we could actually just verify that by
just going to this post a random post
which we don't have a template yet and
if you see if I get rid of this and save
the file and reload this pose as well
you could see that the slider is loading
on a post page ad actually and that's
not what we want so I added this is home
and it looks good so this is a slider we
have added for our website and actually
you could just customize its hide as
well if you want to it's a is 400 pixels
so you could just go ahead wp-admin
sliders customize no this will be
settings actually no not really
inside this edit so we had this 640 by
400 it will just say it 500 or 600 or
whatever you want so you could even just
say the crop one which we had right here
so just update the slider and pretty
much was at your side and it looks awful
so no you're gonna just leave this crop
one
safe date reload and looks cool so
that's how you pretty much create a
slider in WordPress and actually just
not only create a slider but enforce it
by just you know saying to user that
this theme actually requires you to
install using slider and if you like
