May ho and welcome to your another
typescript tutorial in which I'm going
to show you what setters are in
typescript and how you can make use of
them so in the last tutorial what we did
is that we created a getter of this get
area right and what you can do is
actually just write number here as well
so that you are pretty much sure that
you are returning a number only right
and as you might have expected the
setters actually set the particular
property right so right now what we are
doing is that in the constructor we are
accepting two arguments and setting the
length instead we can create some
setters as well right so what we can do
is how we can say set parameter and
number and what we can do is just pass
in an argument like length and obviously
that would be number as well so and we
can say set one side and then side is a
number as well let's see it shouldn't
return anything actually we can just get
rid of this and your constructor as well
or we can just say
hello here right and what I'm going to
do next is that I'm going to get a
perimeter of the rectangle from the user
and one side and then we are going to
calculate the other side and then we can
make use of this get area right so I'm
going to say this is a new rectangle and
then I'm going to say my awesome of
tangles dot oops
very meter equals let's just say this is
10 and yeah you don't need to have the
same property name here I mean the
setter name should match this name
should match here but the value which
you are setting should not you know
might not be same as the name of your
setter method so what I can do is I can
create here this is very meter as number
and side one as number and side to as
number and this should almost be a
semicolon right here as well right so in
this get area would be returning side
one times side to write in parameter
what I'm going to do is this dot
parameter equals length and in one side
I'm going to do this dot side one equal
side and for the calculation on the
other side what I'm going to do is this
start site two is actually what this is
is parameter minus two times
side ones right and then divided by two
so this is the cause this is because
it's in your rectangle I have got this
side right here right and all the sum of
all these four sides so sum of all these
four sides - these two sides divided by
two gives me a single side right this
one or this one the length of either one
of those okay so now we have got one
side and a set the other side as well so
okay now if you see then my parameter is
10 let's just say one of my side is 2.5
so that ideally gives me a square right
and we can just say print or info and
then we can say also log perimeter is to
start parameter on side one this dot
side one side two is side - right
that's all we have got here okay all
right so down here we can just call dot
print on info right and yeah so let's
just go ahead and yeah by the way to fix
that error which was you know appearing
that I don't really remember what it was
I'll just show you
yeah that accesses are only available
when targeting Agnes crypt size and
higher you can fix that I mean you can
just make sure that these do not come by
passing the slags TS see where DSC
should be your file name which is my
cases script and then target then eh
sighs now you can see that it pretty
much does not appear and again if we run
it in the browser you should probably
see something like hello and the
parameter is ten side one is 2.5 and
side two is also 2.5 right so that is uh
pretty much you use setters in tight
script and that's all for this tutorial
and in the next tutorial we'll be
discussing something interesting about
typescript and some more information so
that's all for this one and if you liked
it then don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching and see you then
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
