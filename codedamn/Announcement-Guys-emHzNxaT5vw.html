Mei hole and this is my first time
actually screen recording like this it's
4:00 in the morning and I just need to
get this out real quick to you guys
because I have been working on this from
past couple of days so what essentially
I have been thinking for so long is
actually making learning go down into a
community-based website which I have
finally now decided to do but what I
want to do is to make this website I
would like to have your support so that
we can finally say that the site is
built for the community and by the
community so this is just a call to
everyone who is willing to work with go
down with me on the go down and make it
a community-based website for
programmers now essentially what code
dam aims to solve now is the problem
which is faced by the new developers and
someone who actually just wants to get
introduced to the programming as a whole
so go down would be helping a broad
range of people which is as of what I
think right now my vision but I just
want if you want if you want to be a
part of it if you want to contribute to
the code dam this is the right time
because I just aim to wrap this all up
in a month or two maximum and then there
would be a face of adding new features
to the website and by the time you might
actually get lost in all the code which
is already being done right now if you
want to contribute to the website this
is the best time because the code base
is simple I just quoted a couple of
pages the back and front and linking so
if you're someone who is maybe
interested in finding some good open
source project this is the one you might
want to look for and
yeah basically that's it and I'll see
you then in some good video tutorial bye
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
