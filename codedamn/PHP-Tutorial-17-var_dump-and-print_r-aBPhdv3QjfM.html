your 17th PHP tutorial and which we'll
be learning about var dump and print are
in PHP now basically these two functions
you can say are pretty useful in
debugging of your code so let's say you
have an API you have an API from another
website which returns you some data in
JSON format but obviously you don't know
what key is or what the index is of the
information you want from that so what
you can do is you can display the whole
JSON at once and then you can see how
the data is organized doing that with
for loops is buggy and tricky as well so
what PHP does is it provides you with
two functions namely wadham and print R
which organizes and displace any kind of
data you pass in as an argument so this
point will become clear in a moment
so let's create an array let's say this
is an array with five elements and let's
say I want to display this on screen
obviously not for the user but for
debugging purposes I just want to know
what is what is in its array this array
contains so let's say I want to see that
so I have two options either I can wha
dump array or I can make use of print
our array so these two statements do
pretty much the same task but wadham is
a bit more informative it would give you
a bit more information than printer but
printer would organize the data cleanly
then Wadhams so let's make use of water
first and if in the browser I take a
look then you see that here
or let's just make view source so here
you see that Adam gives us the
information that this is an array of
five remember that this array is not the
name of this variable this is the data
type of this container so even if I
change it to era - this won't change
because this is array this this name is
not dependent on the name of the
variable so this is the name of the data
type and it says it contains 5 elements
add a 0 to index this is the integer 1
integer to integer 3 integer for integer
5 so let's say if I change it to a
string then you see that the first one
changes to string 1 and what this one
signifies is the length of this string
so let's say if I write like this much
and if I reload this you see this
changes to 9 so this 9 signifies that
the length of the first element of this
array is 9 characters
similarly rest of the integers are also
listed now let's check out what happens
with print are now with print are ok
now with printer you can see that this
is much cleaner than the previous one
but this is less informative so you see
if I print them sideways so here if I
reload this you can see here whoa okay
so you can see here that with hwadam we
have got a lot of information that about
the area its length and every individual
element its data type its length and all
that stuff but with printer we have not
got much of the information but it looks
cleaner so it it's up to you that
whichever you want to use hwadam or
printer but in some cases we are dump is
extremely useful because I usually use
what amp because it returns it tells me
the data type of the elements inside the
variables for example this usually
happens a lot whenever there's a failed
query to any website or any you can say
the see URL which we'll be learning
soon the see URL is a method in PHP to
retrieve data from remote websites so
when the see URL fails then what happens
is it returns false with print our it
would print nothing so it leaves the
developer clueless but the dois dump it
would return either null a big null
would be written here or false or
whatever is being returned by Cu RL so
hwadam and print are pretty much handy
functions to use soon from now onwards
we can make use of atom or print R
instead of writing big for loops to
display data obviously only for this
these tutorial purposes but for n
production websites which you will be
doing we have to make use of the for
loops because you cannot customize this
as it is so this is just for debugging
purposes so that you don't have to spend
a lot of time to see what's working and
what's not so that's it for this
tutorial and I hope you liked it and if
