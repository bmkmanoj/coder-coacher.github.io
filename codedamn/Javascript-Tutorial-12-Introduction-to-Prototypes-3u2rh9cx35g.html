twelfth JavaScript tutorial and this
lesson we'll be looking at something
very advanced in JavaScript and very
useful which is the prototypes and
prototypal inheritance this tutorial
will be discussing introduction to
prototypes what they are and how they
work in the next tutorials in the next
few tutorials who will be going deep
into this topic okay to begin with now
what are actually prototypes to
understand that if you have ever worked
with languages like C++ and PHP and Java
like that then you should know that we
could create classes like in PHP like
this my new class
and then we do just declaration of
methods and properties here and we
create an object with new keyword my new
class and then just access all the
objects and methods like method like
this but in inheritance we do like
extends another class now we have all
the methods and properties of this class
as well in this but in Java Street we
don't have any classes javascript uses a
complete different structure or kind of
model for its working this type of model
the object-oriented way the perfect
object-oriented way and inheritance is
known as classical inheritance model
which languages like PHP and C C++ uses
but Java Script uses prototypal
inheritance model which is quite fun to
learn and understand but you have to be
very focused and serious to learn that
okay to start with let's create a new
object with our constructor function
let's write a constructor function with
function name as just number sum and
let's provide it our meters let's do
this dot X is X as I told you earlier
this refers to the object through which
this function is called are not the
window superglobal right now
let's do this God Why ask why let's do
this dot sum is equal to function and
let's return the sum of these two
good now let's create an object down
here with our constructor function
let's say I mean who are my plans to new
numbers some let's provide the
parameters three and five and let's go
so a lot
my name's
now what you'll see here is it
this down
and what we'll see here is it as you see
we are calling this function right here
but javascript has certain and other
functions and methods basically front
stance if we do my numbers dot to
straight let's try to console.log this
and we hit object object but what's
happening here we don't have any method
called to string in this constructor
function so how it is getting not
throwing any error or kind of anything
but returning a cool function object
object but we don't have any method to
string here in this our constructor
function so what's happening here is now
this is called the prototypal
inheritance model when they call this
function first of all this this number
some miners would request number sum to
send or retrieve anything related to
this function or the method name but
number some says that I don't have this
method in my constructor
let me look upon in the prototype of
chain and would inform you if I if I
encounter with one so this number some
would look up in the object chain and
would ask the object which is the object
right here if you see this object 1 and
would ask this thing that whether you
have this two string method or not then
object through which all the
values like all the data types like
arrays numbers and strings are derived
says yes I do have this two string
method and then objects sends it to
three string method to number some and
number some senses to mine arms
let me show you this diagrammatically
and I guess it would help you a little
bit I've got the software smoothdraw but
my drawing is not smooth at all trust me
I'll just do black Phil here
black looks good
okay so
let's say I have this function right
here the constructor function
my writing is way bad than you think so
I'll just try to make it a little nicer
for you
okay so construct a function basically
it's the blueprint of your class or
methods you want to inherit now we have
created this constructor function here
and we create a new object with this and
what don't check this the object is my
Nance my
lamps I'm riding slow and steady to keep
my writing good
okay now we have nylons and this minam
object has all the properties of this
function like property one method one
property to
method two like that now in mine arms we
request the function
to string
method to string
you know what happens is
this two-string method is not available
for my noms
so my name's calls this constructor
function and says that please provide me
this method I don't have this method
function looks in its properties right
here and says neither do I I have to
look upwards
to know what this method is all about
now function looks above its above its
methods and finds that this function is
derived from an object which is its self
called object
let's get it right yes obj yes okay so
this object is kind of super global
through which all the functions the RS
and the objects themselves derive their
properties with the prototypal chain now
this this function the constructor
function calls this object and looks for
this method and the object says yes I do
have this method and object sends it
down to function and then function again
sends it down to miner and my name
displays this to string method
okay so this chain right here this
what's happening here is this chain
right here
this shield is the prototypal chain
type
or basically prototype to make things
easier this chain is prototype chain I
do have a reason to mess with things
okay so
what's happening here is a quick
revision this meinem object requests to
string method from this constructor
function the function says I don't have
this function or kind of method so the
function looks above its object and
finds the super object object an object
says yes I do have this function and
then object returns this function in
stands to this function constructor
function and then function again it
turns this method madam's
and we get console.log object object
okay so this was a brief introduction to
what prototypes are and how they work
and how JavaScript works actually so I
hope that you would have understand not
all but at least something to begin with
I know that this is confusing right now
and people who have done C and C++ and
Java and PHP would find it difficult to
understand because it's kind of
confusing because it looks up and up in
the chain unless an to find the method
or the property instead of classical
inheritance of grabbing all the methods
and properties at once in an object so
in the next tutorial we'll be discussing
more on this and I hope I'll clear you
on the stop egg and if you don't
understand what's happening in this
tutorial and why I have written any kind
of code then you're free to leave any
comment or any suggestion you want and
