second C++ tutorial in which we'll be
discussing about how to write a
HelloWorld program in C++ now in C++ we
don't just write hello world like we do
in HTML or JavaScript because in C++ we
are actually directly communicating with
the CPU so unlike any other language
where we are communicating with another
software in C++ we are directly talking
to CPU with the help of just one
software in between which is the
compiler so even the compiler can be
considered as a part of CPU so we need
to be very precise and accurate syntax
wise so as to avoid any errors so in C++
the first thing you do is include some
files to work on now in C++ without
including any file what you can do is
just create some functions and that's
pretty much it to do something useful
you need to include some files so I'll
just zoom in a little bit if that helps
so you see that to include a file we
make use of the hash include' and inside
a greater than and less than sign with
type the name of the file you want to
include
so I'll just include iostream now I of
stream stands for input output stream
and this will help you to display and
get information from the user in the
console so for now for the hello world
we just need I off stream and the next
thing we need to do is to type something
as int main now I'll explain what I'm
doing everything right here so once we
are done with int main just write this
curly braces you can say
and right STD to Collins
see out I'm going to dad signs and in a
world I know it is looking a kind of
mess right now
do you guys but trust me it's really
simple to understand now I will be
discussing what each of these components
is doing so first of all we are
including this iostream file just for
this slide otherwise we don't need this
file because without this line the C++
compiler doesn't know what C out is and
so do you right now so you don't know
what's the out is I'll tell you now C
out is a stream object in C++ and we'll
be talking more about that in my future
tutorials but for now just remember that
stream objects are something which are
used to handle data and C out is a
stream object which outputs your data on
the console screen so this would simply
output HelloWorld on the console screen
whenever I would run this program and
what about this STD keyword now this STD
is the namespace in which C out is
defined and I know you won't be carrying
what is name space right now and trust
me you don't need that to get at this
moment either so we would be talking
more about namespaces in future tutorial
because it would be too early to talk
about that for now just remember that
every of the file has a custom namespace
and you need to use that before using
anything from that file and if you want
to avoid this namespace what you can do
is at the type at the top right using
namespace STD now pretty much simple to
understand it just says that we are
using the namespace STD so if you don't
encounter or if you encounter any
strange function
considered it is probably belief from
the STD namespace Holly now we can
safely remove the STD namespace now to
run this program first of all let's save
it let's say file on the desktop yep
right here let's say hello world dot cpp
and here you go
so right now I've got a hello world
program right here and let's excute it
now click on this build and run button
to build the program and the building
means simply that your program is
compiled and converted from a dot CPP
file from a dot CPP file do a dot exe
file which the computer can actually run
so just click on this button and you see
that we got this hello world right here
and some information from the compiler
as well so you see that is pretty much
simple to write your hello world program
in C++ so congratulations to start and
that you have started your C++ tutorials
on code damn
so I hope you best of luck and stay
tuned with goddamn to learn more about
C++ and that's pretty much it for this
tutorial and I'll see you then next time
