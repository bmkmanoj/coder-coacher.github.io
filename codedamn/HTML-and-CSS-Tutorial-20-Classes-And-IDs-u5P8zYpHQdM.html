20th HTML and CSS tutorial in this
tutorial let's learn about classes and
ID's in HTML so I guess it's the right
time to introduce you guys to classes
and ID's and what they are in HTML are
how to make them work with CSS
so till now we have only be creating
some elements like div like your div
span
be
uhh
you're heading elements h1 h2 h3 and all
that stuff so what we are doing is we
are just creating a bunch of common
elements so with that let's see if I
have what's a couple of sentences down
here so what we are doing is we are
selecting when we do an CSS that div so
we are applying these styles to both of
these divs that kinda makes it a rough
choice because we don't have much
control in our hands what to customize
and what to leave so we have classes and
ID's in HTML and I can say to you that
every attribute oh sorry
every element or tag in HTML has an
attribute called class and has an
attribute called ID and obviously these
are not mandatory but if you are doing
with CSS and JavaScript then these are
display very important role for
distinguishing between similar elements
for example let's say I want to give
something to only some customizations to
only this div so what I'll do is I'll
add an attribute called class diff glass
inside quotation marks I would write the
name of this class this could be pretty
much anything but remember
it should always start with the alphabet
no matter its capital or small and
should never start with a number so it
should be only start with alphabets from
A to Z and nothing from like a special
symbol or I guess underscores are
allowed but I would just recommend you
to go with alphabets and then include
some numbers because that's the best
practice to do but it's up to you what
you want to do so let's name it
difficult as as my DIF simple enough
let's copy this and now right here let's
say dot my death
and now okay so when you want to select
an element and CSS what you do is you
write the name of that element as it is
but when we applied a class to this
element then to make CSS understand that
this is not a element but a class of any
element we make use of this period right
here which is a dot so this dot tells
CSS that you're this might've is not a
kind of like this element but it's a
class applied to any of these elements
and to be more precise if you have say
span class my div so now what's
happening here is with this mighty we
are selecting all the classes all the
elements which have the class as my dev
so now let's see let's give it a color
orange why not now let's reload this and
as you can see one two the first one and
to get a color of orange and the third
one remains black which is the default
browser color and this is because these
two have a glass my div let's see if I
want to apply this color orange CSS only
to those elements whose tag name is div
and glass is my difference so what I'll
do is before this period I would write
the name of this element so now what
happens is CSS is still in HTML okay so
I've got this instruction from the
developer that use the tag name as stiff
and this is a class since this is a
class so tag name the class are
separated by a period or a dot and then
use this class name which is Madoff so
now this literally means that apply the
CSS only which has the class as Madoff
and the element name which is the tag
name as stiff so now what would happen
is since this has also my dev class but
the name of the element is span instead
of div so your CR your HTML your Dom API
would ignore this element at
only apply CSS to this one so now let's
reload this let's see what happens
so here you have only one Escobar with
orange now okay so that's about being
classes and using classes we can save a
bunch of code like you want to apply the
same style to some span as well let's
remove this and let's say you want to
apply the same styles to P as well and
let's say you want to apply the same
styles to h1 as well
h2 as well h3 as well are all the way
down to a long list of social doers you
just apply a class my death to each of
these elements you can pretty much copy
and paste it like this and you could
customize this only one time by using
dot my div which would apply to all the
elements across your page
to apply these styles so this saves us a
bunch of code because instead of writing
like B div h1 h2 h3 and all that stuff
first of all we are narrowing our search
results and we are applying the styles
to only selective elements we want to
have those styles so any element which
do not have this class my life would not
be styled by the styles down here so
that's about classes and now let's come
to IDs so now you have seen that classes
can be used with multiple elements or
with same elements multiple times so for
example this code right here is
completely valid but IDs basically make
it kind of restrictive to only one
element about that what I mean is that
dances can be used across various
elements or in the same element which is
repairing multiple times but ID is kind
of unique to a particular element so it
is like a kind of identity of an element
which cannot be changed
basically it cannot be
used with some other element as well as
per the standard now what does that mean
by that is I'll show you let's say if I
have an ID my property this is only mine
and let's say I have span ID with the
same my property this is my DS fan
version so when you sign this like okay
so okay so let's remove it first I'll
explain you how to use IDs so just like
we used a period to denote a class
instead of a normal element we make use
of the hash symbol above your three key
in your keyboard to denote an ID so an
ID is hash followed by the ID name
which in this case is my property then
curly braces and the usual code begins
so that's how you apply styles to an ID
remember hash my property which is the
ID name of your element and your
coincided so I was talking about
creating a similar idea for two elements
which is absolutely against the API and
the documentation but let's see what
happens actually mine let's give it a
spand so that we can understand this is
banned and we have my property has color
green
so now let's reload this and as you can
see these two appear green but what's
that I told you that you could use an ID
with only one element so though it
applies CSS to these two elements as
well still this syntax is completely
incorrect so never ever apply one ID to
two elements so the reason I showed you
this is because HTML is a markup
language HTML and CSS our markup
language which are used to display and
basically present your site to your
users so just like some other language
like C++ or C HTML and CSS would never
ever
through any error on your document no
matter how bad your document structure
is or how bad your syntax is so whatever
you do in this HTML document that would
kind of browser would try to understand
it itself and in the worst case it would
display the wrong output but would never
display any error message for example in
this case HTML the chrome API being
lenient it applied the style color green
to elements having same ID but when you
are working with JavaScript then this
thing this baby right here would surely
threw a big bomb error that how the heck
are you using one I did on two elements
so always remember that IDs are really
special and unique to only one element
and the main use of IDs is like for
example if you are creating a kind of
website and you want to have a header so
you'll do the very header and since your
website would have only one head over to
that table so you can use kind of ID to
make it easier to remember and since
it's only one header so we can you
make use of ID so in future when we are
working with dynamic languages like
JavaScript and your PHP Dom parser so
when we grab this so it's easier for us
to I guess grab the details and
information about this header so instead
of just using class which would kind of
promote it as a singer multiple element
copies we would make use of ID so right
here my property or basically it should
be hidden now header div header will
literally mean the same one and the same
thing so whatever we do to this like if
I copy this to here then this will also
apply to header so when we are applying
styles dynamically to dynamically
generated elements and we have only
access to the ID attribute and we don't
know what the element name is so we
usually ignore this option and just use
the header just like the starting hash
and header so that's basically how you
work with IDs and classes in JavaScript
and sorry I guess said JavaScript right
now the reason being a kind of creating
JavaScript tutorial as well these days
nevermind so yeah so I was telling you
that always remember the usage of
classes and ID's in your HTML and CSS
code because this will help you a lot in
the JavaScript tutorial playlist and
will also help you to keep your document
clean and kind of optimized for browsers
as well so that's all for CSS classes
and ID's and I'll see you then in the
next tutorial with some awesome CSS
tutorial stuff we will be discussing
about I guess properties are the values
in CSS so I'll see you then don't forget
