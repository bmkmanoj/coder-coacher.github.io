JavaScript tutorial in this tutorial
we'll be looking at loops in JavaScript
I'm pretty sure all of you or maybe most
of you are familiar with loops in
JavaScript are basically simply loops
loops are actually used to repeat a set
of code again and again unless a
condition called base condition is
satisfied when stands you say to
JavaScript run this condition ten times
then this is a kind of loop in
JavaScript we have mainly three kinds of
loop that is for loop while loop and
dowhile loop in for loop we have the
condition like for temporary variable is
equal to a value
temporary variable is greater than or
less than or whatever the condition
p-value increment away
and the court goes here
this is a kind of syntax for a for-loop
Constance let's write
the multiples of three
on the screen
but that will do for I equals you as
less than then on let's use for I equal
1 because 3 1 2 3 I plus plus
what we'll do here is we'll do a
document of right
three star 1 equals I
Plus
let's go space
I start three
what's happening here is we are doing
that's right I hear we are doing a
document dot write 3 star RF which is
implemented at every loop is I start 3
which would write this code this code
would run 10 times and it will write a
table of three on the sweet
let's see
as you can see 3 1 2 3 3 to the 6 which
is a 9 and so on
if you want this loop to run to ten then
you have to specify the condition either
I is less than 11 or either I is less
than or equal to 10
let's see what happened
okay so make sure the position is equal
to is correct less than or equal to not
or equal to or less than remember that
equal double equal to sign doesn't work
here if you try to do this for I equal 1
I is equal is equal to 10 address class
this code would not work you have to
specify less than or equal to and it
would work like a charm okay
coming to the next loop is the while
loop now while loop the basic syntax is
why condition is true
blew the stuff
now what happens is
if I do while true
document right
this is an infinite loop which would
crash my browser if i refresh it right
now but I won't and won't give you
advice to do so as well if you want to
do this then make sure to keep your
taskbar and your task lags already to
kill the browser process immediately
after you press the refresh button
because the browser will try to eat all
of your computer memory because this is
an infinite loop since we don't have any
base condition to get out of this loop
to get out of this loop we use a keyword
break when stance if I equal
then break break out of this to finish
it let's initialize the
variable I here to zero
don't forget to increment the variable I
as well
within the loop as you can see hello
world is printed out ten times the next
loop is two while loop for example if I
have like while I is greater than then
or maybe less than ten
let's remove this condition because we
already have based Edition now here and
we are doing document or tried I plus
plus
let's say if I was actually said to them
then this loop would not run because is
not actually less than 10 it is itself
then therefore to solve this problem we
have a loop on do-while loop the purpose
of do-while loop is so only to run the
loop at least one time this loop would
run at least one time at least one time
no matter what is the condition the base
condition or the loop condition let's
say while I is greater than
or less than then
you know this loops should not run
actually because the best conditions
already fulfilled is a quite large
number but this loop would run at least
one by
as you can see
the dubai loop at least runs one time no
matter what is the best condition the
next kind of loop we have in JavaScript
which is quite new is the foreign loop
you know what if our in loop does is to
explain a foreign loop let's create an
array first
let's create a number string area
good now let's write a foreign now the
foreign loosened taxes something like
4/10 variable in array do the stuff
much cleaner than the traditional
foreign loop isn't it let's use it let's
use 4i
ari
make sure to initialize i-20
somewhere in there code and now we are
free to use the AI as the index value
for a loop
not if you're underscored we get output
as one two and three because I here is
automatically incremented in foreign
loop you don't have to make a fuss
around incrementing array or breaking
the loop because it's the kind of smart
loop which automatically increments the
temporary or the garbage variable and
automatically assigns value to it so
these were the three plus one kind of
loops in JavaScript we'll be using these
loops in the future tutorials for sure
