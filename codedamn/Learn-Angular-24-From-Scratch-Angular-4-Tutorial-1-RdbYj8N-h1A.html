to your very first tutorial for angular
framework and in this tutorial what
we're gonna do is discuss a little about
what angular framework is and what we
are going to do in this whole web series
so I do have some tutorials on angular 2
but the angular has been pushing a lot
of updates recently so there might be a
bit old and some things might work and
some things might not I'm just gonna
cover them as well real quick as we go
further and what actually angular is is
that it's a framework which targets the
phones and big stop as it is written on
the screen itself
so angular framework includes angular 2
and the recently launched a little bit
of change to version of angular 2 which
is angular 4 and yeah that's pretty much
it so using angular you can develop
dynamic applications and heavy
applications as well and we're going to
take a look at some projects and good
some applications as well with the
angular framework and it is different
from angularjs because angularjs is
actually angular 1 point X which is just
a simple library for JavaScript right so
yeah that's all for this one and from
the next tutorial onwards we're going to
see how we can set up our environment
for angular development and get started
so yeah that's all for this one and if
you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
