Mickel and welcome to your second react
tutorial in which I'm going to show you
how you can set up reactive environment
to start working with it and just as we
have seen in angular 2 we need to
install some sort of stuff and
dependencies to make use of es6 and kind
of installing a light server as well so
that we can just make use of the HTTP
protocol instead of files so that things
like a Jack's request and all that good
stuff works right so let's begin so
first of all just go to your folder the
reactor is one and just open command
window and one more thing if you haven't
installed node for NPM then that's a
problem because we're going to make use
of that so what I'm going to do is
create a video on that to how to set up
node NPM with command line and we'll
post a link in the description so if
things like NPM do not work for you if
you do not see something like that then
probably you are not configured and
being properly to work with your command
line and I'll just post a link in the
description with the video so that you
can just configure it with your computer
right so once you have done that let's
begin so just do an NPM init first to
create a package dot JSON file so we'll
just call it reactors description
nothing let's just leave that all blank
for now go down there yep okay so now
our package dot JSON file is created and
then we need to install some
dependencies and what these are our NPM
install web pack now web pack is
essentially you can just think of this
as you know it just combines all of your
dynamic sort of stuff and discrete
static assets from it like if you have
some Java scripts which are importing
from one another or you know es6 sort of
course so it will just help you're all
over the javascript pass from es6 codes
to
Babel which would just transpile it to
bs5 and then it will just recombine that
all that javascript and will disproven
present you with one file for now so
let's just install it back and one more
thing wetback would allow us to you know
host the lights over which is when went
back with back dev server right now we
need to install actually this as a
developer one so that we do not you know
actually need that on production then
when it's done we'll need to install
react I'm just going to go ahead and
install on the packages first and would
set up the code later in the video so
let's let us just install okay it looks
like it's going to complete now anytime
right so now the next thing we need to
do is to install react now we can just
do that by NPM install react and then
react rom and again we're just going to
save it right and I shall have actually
install babel with webpack only because
that's going to go and develop a
dependencies as well
but anyways okay so we are done here as
well so let's just finally installed a
book npm install labeled core babel
loader they will preset es2015 which is
essentially es6 and then finally Babel
Chris said react right so just go in
save there as well
okay fair enough so we have got all our
modules ready now it's time to configure
our web pack and we can do that with the
file web pack config dot JSON let's just
go ahead and create that so this is web
pack dot config dot JSON and not chase
one actually it's just years
this is chase right and here we'll just
tell web pack what to do with what sort
of data so I'm going to say more do lot
more to not expose is an object specify
entry point and why do we have that in
pink okay so the entry point would be
our main file ants not I'll check it's
just a file so it would be sort of like
I don't know let's just say this is for
Dutchess right and then we have the
output output and this will be the
directory and the file name of the
transpired version of this script let's
just say this is farthest current folder
only and then the file name is let's
just say France trial that's yes or
anything you want then I'm going to go
with module which will just include some
loaders loaders which would essentially
pass our squared J's files to Babel
which would then create a new transpiled
JS file right so I'm going to test for a
dot JS file and just escape the dot
there and the loader would obviously be
table and we want to excuse
the North modules right and even just
pass in a query object here as well
otherwise you just need to create a
babel RC file that's same thing if you
want to do so let's just clean this up a
little maybe and wait a minute we have
some brackets issues there yeah okay so
let's just clean this up a little bit as
well okay so we can now set presets to
es2015 on this this is just retelling be
able to what it has to react to okay
cool we are done here now let's create
our index dot HTML file and you're gonna
include here what we have is one style
dot yes and I'm just going to create a
div ID of for step as well here just to
show you a hello world right and then
finally what we need to do is create
actually our spring Duchess and remember
that this file would automatically be
created from this file only so we do not
need to create that again and again so
in our script what we're going to do is
first of all input all the necessary
things so I'm going to input react from
react and I'm going to include reaction
Tom from react Dom as well so once we
have those two modules we can simply say
for a very simple hello world program
react on dot o and Earth to render and
I'm just not gonna get into syntax right
now I'm just going to take a look at
that later but just follow up with me
for this crazy program so we're just
going to say h1 and
world h1 there and we want to render it
to document dot get element by ID
I guess the D is one the first step
right and just stick with me I'm just
going to explain this real soon but this
is just a hello world program for react
so yeah via looks like you're almost
done we can then finally in our package
to do so and in the script in the it
section we can say web pack dev server
and we can start up the hot lights with
this week this is all of our changes
life this one is it and we can just do
something like p.m. run it allow access
okay so it expects an absolute path so
we can do is side our web pack on say we
can this you are artists acquire path or
we can say that this is Pat touch
resolve dir name and then I don't know
it's just let's just limit output only
and then again we just need to create an
output folder here and put our
index.html right there
and then we'll just transfer the chairs
yeah okay so
all right so it saves me that a project
is running out that's hard to read
actually so this is go ahead and try
that you can see we get our first hello
world program
quite simply okay why the heck do we
have index touch is there then wait a
minute okay so we're going to leave this
out cut out good its reload and you can
see that it still works so if I just saw
restart our npm run it you can see that
we are serving on localhost 8080 so that
is not very much you do a hello world
from react and yeah that's all for this
one and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
