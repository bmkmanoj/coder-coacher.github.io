extension development tutorial this is
mail from Gordon calm and in this
tutorial what we'll be learning is will
be learning about chrome dot dash dot
execute script API now many times what
you'd like is when you're working on
real extensions and inside background or
cheers you would like to execute the
JavaScript code on your real users page
for example you are working with some
critical chrome api's in your back on
the chairs and you are like oh I need to
execute the script on the main page to
change the background color of the user
but I need to display a pop-up to the
user now what you would do now we have
an API called chrome door tab stored
execute script which would come to your
rescue
now this API would allow you to execute
a bunch of JavaScript code or a whole
JavaScript file at once in any of your
tab in the active window so for example
you could run the JavaScript in this tab
this tab this tab this tab or in the
active one okay so this API would as
usual except two arguments the first one
being table ID and the second one being
the options the tar ID obviously is the
ID of the tab but in most cases we would
like it run on the current window so
we'd pass it as null because this
argument is passed as null would default
fallback to the current tab only and
inside the options is where the magic
happens
so inside here we have like code now
here you can type good as let's say
console dot log
Wow this actually works alright so this
is our code simple enough now let's go
to the browser let's reload our
extension make sure that you open the
inspect element of the page not of your
background script inspect view so you
see that I have opened this page inspect
element of the Chrome extensions page or
let's visit google.com so you see that
Alex open the inspect element of this
page right here not of the background
script now whenever I'll click this icon
you see okay now that's not mine well
okay let me check
okay so we are missing some permissions
now here you can either write all URLs
or if your extension is specifically
made to work where the current time only
you can specify active tile as the
permissions which I would do in this
case let's reload this again and when I
will click this you see that I got
console logged as wow this actually
works inside the main screen so if I do
like document good body dot style dot
background is equal to red oh yeah there
should be no semicolon here
okay so let's reload this click here
okay so you see that we got a very ugly
world page and if you like I could
change it to cream and then we can test
it again looks much better so that's how
you work with Chrome the tabs should
execute script and in the next tutorial
I'll be showing you how to execute a lot
of JavaScript code at once without
typing that inside this ugly quotes so
that's it for this tutorial and don't
forget to subscribe
