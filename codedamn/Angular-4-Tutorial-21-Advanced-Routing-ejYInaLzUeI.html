ho and welcome to your 21st tutorials
for angular and in this tutorial I'm
going to go a bit deeper into routes and
angular and how pretty much we can
create some complex routing patterns and
match them with angular so we have seen
how we can create some basic routes like
just a normal route and then going to
the dashboard which very much allows us
to go to something like during dashboard
right but right now it doesn't work
because of the guard in place but anyway
so we can just get rid of this if you
want but I'm just keep that in place
right so now what we can do is we can
create a new route which again would be
less a safe distance users right so
let's say you are creating an
application for your internal network or
whatever it is where you have associated
every user in your company with an ID so
what you want is that people should be
able to access something like users and
then the ID of that user or maybe
something like the username something
like this right so it pretty much looks
like you want a pattern something like
this in regular expression right users
and the match anything after that
and pretty much angular would take care
of that what is being passed by the URL
right so in angular what we do is that
we create a token out of it so you can
really must say is like users and then
an ID or a name or whatever you want all
this right so with this you have created
a token inside the URL so now angular
knows that user would be passing some
sort of dynamic data it could be
anything but we actually need to
retrieve that later on so we're going to
show that right again we can create a
component for this and we can just say
this is user component and we can create
this component by ng Skindred come
Inc and your same user so it would
create a user component for us and I
guess we would lose these changes so I'm
not going to reload this I'm going to
just import it manually you're going to
stay in forward user component from user
and then what we have a user component
right and then we can just include this
inside our declarations or we can just
bring them down if you want like that so
now we have this user component in
action okay so now how do we actually
make use of this token which the user
would pass inside the URL inside our
component so we go to our user component
dot type script file okay so now to
actually get the data we are getting
from the route what we need to do is and
by the way this ng on in it is nothing
but a lifecycle call function of angular
which is fires when your component is
ready right so you don't need to worry a
lot about this you can just make use of
all of your code inside you can just
write your code which you want to fire
after the component is loaded inside
here so what we need is we need an
activated router which again we saw in
our god I guess it was right but this
was wrong snapshot anyways so what we
can do is the pretty much right here
state private route and I can say the
activated route and we can import import
activated route from angular router
right and then what we can do and
actually this should go inside
constructor because this is
our dependency and right here I can stay
this dots out so as you see what we get
inside our activated roles right 9:50 we
have our users and then a name so I'm
going to go something like this and when
I just fire up the console as well and
hit enter okay so we see user works that
is the default template but for
activated round you see that we get the
subject now let's just examine what this
is it contains a lot of properties right
and we are mainly interested in the
parameter which is metal impeding so if
we take a look inside the snapshot and
right here inside the subject you see
that we get this name as McCallum pity
which is exactly what we wrote here that
is the name the name is the name of the
object property and the value is what we
passed in here so what we can do is very
much right here we can say name is equal
to nothing right and right here inside
ng on there we can take this stuff name
is this route dot what we have is the
snapshot as a property name and then we
can get our parameter which is dot name
and simply and I guess this is snapshot
parameters not name right so now you can
see that we can just get it like this
but if you have pretty much yeah that
would work right so now all we can do is
inside our user component we can say
hello and then name right here and it
sees you can see that we get hello may
hole and BD we can write anything like
hello one two three here and this would
just work fine I guess
angular by default has some sort of
protection for cross-site scripting yep
you can see that you cannot
very much do cross sites for Dragon just
remove the square because it includes
the tag so we can really must try our
luck with do with honestest yeah angular
just predicts sanitizes your data
automatically you do not need to do that
so it's safe to work with right so with
this you can create dynamic routes and
something like I don't know if you write
do if you have a service where you
create an email address something like
this what you can do is create an md5
hash of this email address right here
and display it in an image and get it
from browser right so that you can
actually display the image of the user
associated with that crafter account
which is pretty much you can do at least
with angular for now right so again
to sum up you can get your parameters
with this dot robot snapshot and again
you can create something like name and
then ID as well if you want to and then
if we take a look we get some errors it
says that it cannot match any route so
what we can do is keep the original
route in place right and one more thing
about routes is that it starts matching
from the top to bottom right so if there
are two possible matches for a single
URL then the match which comes first
would be the route which would be
preferred by angular I'm just going to
show you an example real quick for that
and for now we can do something like
users Nehalem VT + 5 and hit enter see
we just get hello McCallum pity because
you're not making use of that ID so
again we can just console.log this this
crowd dot x dot this dot route dot what
we have snapshot
snapshots of terms right here and you
can see that we get Michelin BTN ideas
five right so you can just make use of
that as well okay so now before ending
what I want to do is create a wild card
route so right now you can see that if
you with it something like which is not
defined you see that we get an error in
the console which says that cannot match
any route which is quite useless because
you would like to show 404 not found at
least to the user because you cannot
implement a header for 404 because
angular is running on the front end so
at least you can just show the message
that your page is not found so to do
that what you can do is inside your
router you can make use of a wild card
which is back and then do a strips right
here which pretty much saves that match
everything and obviously you want it to
be the last route in your route
configuration because if you place it
anywhere above then any route below that
would not would not be ever executed by
angular because as I said route should
be executed in the order they are placed
inside the SAP house ray right so we can
say like component is a not found
component and again we can just quickly
create this one we can say ng generate
component not found like that
and it would be okay so we can do fast
and component not found component like
that and inside are not found component
we can say 404 not found right so now we
take a look in our application and I
visit any random page you can see that
we get for for northbound instead of you
know just angular throwing a bunch of
error messages and making us sad so
again if you make this
a little higher in the queue you would
see that we would lose access to we will
have access to a home road because it's
the first one but if you try to with it
users now or maybe even make a Liberty
for which we have the route defined you
see that we do not get to the sprout
ever because angular starts matching
from the top to bottom and it sees oh
yeah we have got a white card and this
matches this route so I'm just going to
go with that so again you want this
route or whatever route you want to have
for a 404 to be the last route in your
script so that angular always considers
this as the route when none of the above
Road matches so yeah that's pretty much
how you would make a basic routing with
the angular and it's this is kind of
like token based routing where you can
split up your or make your URLs a little
bit more dynamic and in the next
tutorial we're going to go into a little
bit more into routing and we can just
pretty much ignore or basically improve
this kind of structure which is made by
making use of the children property
inside these routes so yeah that's all
for this one and if you liked it then

thank you for watching I'll see you then
