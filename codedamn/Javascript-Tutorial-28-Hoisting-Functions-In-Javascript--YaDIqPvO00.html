JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
we'll be extending the previous part in
Wichita to you about hoisting of
variables now this pad also will be
covering hosting but questing of
functions in the last part we saw that
how which appears acceptable to the
human eye is actually different in the
compiler and interpreter of JavaScript
so in this tutorial I'll also give you
one such example where you would be
confused about what would be the output
okay so before starting this tutorial I
want to tell you that or basically you
should know that if you have done
programming in C or C++ or any other
language that whenever in a function
whenever in a function you use return
statement
nothing down return execute ever that
means if you have function a supposingly
we have variable is or B is 10 and we do
return right here and set B equals 2 10
20 and call this function and allure
just be then you'll see that be remains
10 now this is because in every language
almost in every language having
functions and like that anything after
return statement does not execute that
means this statement does not execute
okay if we copy the statement above this
then yes it will execute itself as you
can see the B is not 20 okay so coming
to the confusing part which is the
hoisting let's see let's create a
function foo
let's call a undefined function right
here bar and let's return this return
false and let's create a function bar
down here as I told you the code under
the return statement does not execute we
do a load hey will I
collected
okay so what's your guesses where I call
the function foo when I reload the
browser what's your guess is will the
alert box be prompted or not if you said
it would be prompted then this time you
were completely right yes now why this
would be prompted I'll tell you in a
minute and as we refresh this page and
do the surprise of those who said that
it won't be prompted because of the
return false statement then this is what
hosting is all about now as earlier
tutorial I'll show you a a alternative
code of this tutorial this function
which would technically mean same to
JavaScript so in function who is staying
JavaScript what JavaScript does is it
takes every function and it moves every
function to the top of this scope that
means JavaScript things that this
function foo is right here like this
make sense yes it does now because now
we are declaring this function foo this
function bar at the top of the return
statement and then we are calling it so
as this invariable we just get the
declaration of the variable move to the
top of the block but in functions we get
the whole function copied to the top of
the block that means if we do like foo
here then it would return undefined or
maybe some another name who who is find
this would be undefined but this would
be called up and this is what is about
the function hoisting and this is the
best and the easiest way I could explain
it to you and I hope you got this
concept clear because this is very
important concept in JavaScript and how
JavaScript works so if you are not clear
out as well in this tutorial as well
then I highly recommend you to watch my
previous tutorial as well and this one
as well it would take hardly 10 minutes
to you and watch 2 times both of the
tutorials and doing the math we get that
it would take hardly or 20 minutes and I
promise you you will get be you'll be
mastered in the hosting of variables and
functions in JavaScript so don't forget
to subscribe and keep watching my videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
