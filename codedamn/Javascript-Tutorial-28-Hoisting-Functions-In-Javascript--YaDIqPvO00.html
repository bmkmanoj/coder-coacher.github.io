28th JavaScript tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be extending the previous
part in which I taught you about
hoisting of variables now this pad also
will be covering hoisting but twisting
of functions in the last part we saw
that how which appears acceptable to the
human eye is actually different in the
compiler and interpreter of JavaScript
so in this tutorial I'll also give you
one such example where you would be
confused about what would be the output
okay so before starting this tutorial I
want to tell you that or basically you
should know that if you have done
programming in C or C++ or any other
language that whenever in a function
whenever in a function you use return
statement
nothing down return execute ever that
means if you have function a supposingly
we have variable is or B is 10 and we do
return right here and set B equals to 10
20 and call this function alert just B
then you'll see that B remains 10 now
this is because in every language almost
in every language having functions and
like that anything after return
statement does not execute that means
this statement does not execute ok if we
copy the statement above this then yes
it will execute itself as you can see
the B is not 20 okay so coming to the
confusing part which is the hoisting
let's see let's create a function
let's call it undefined function right
here bar let's return this return false
let's create a function bar down here as
I told you the code under the return
statement does not execute how we do
noted
okay so what's your guesses when I call
the function foo when I reload the
browser
what's your guesses will the alert box
be prompted or not if you said it would
be prompted then this time you were
completely right yes now why this would
be prompted I'll tell you in a minute
and as we refresh this page and to the
surprise of those who said that it won't
be prompted because of the return false
statement then this is what hosting is
all about
now as earlier tutorial I'll show you a
a alternative code of this tutorial this
function which would technically mean
same to JavaScript so in function who is
staying JavaScript what JavaScript does
is it takes every function and it moves
every function to the top of this scope
that means JavaScript thinks that this
function foo is right here like this
makes sense yes it does now because now
we are declaring this function foo this
function bar at the top of the return
statement and then we are calling it so
as this in variable we just get the
declaration of the variable move to the
top of the block but in functions we get
the whole function copied to the top of
the block that means if we do like foo
here then it would return undefined or
maybe some another name who-who is find
this would be undefined but this would
be called up and this is what is about
the function hosting and this is the
best and the easiest way I could explain
it to you and I hope you got this
concept clear because this is very
important concept in JavaScript and how
JavaScript works so if you are not clear
as as well in this tutorial as well then
I highly recommend you to watch my
previous tutorial as well and this one
as well it would take hardly 10 minutes
to you and watch 2 times both of the
tutorials and doing the math we get that
it would take hardly or 20 minutes and I
promise you you will get the you will be
mastered in the hosting of variables and
functions in JavaScript so don't forget
to subscribe and keep watching my videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
