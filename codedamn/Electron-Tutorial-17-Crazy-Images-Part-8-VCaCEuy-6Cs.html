on everybody my name is men who are
welcome to your 17th tutorial for
electron framework and in the story 'l
we're gonna move forward and add some
new things to our app so the first one I
can relate is that we need a div ID this
class go back button here with the
staves are done and I'm going to see
that this is entry click hide this we
need that in our ng-repeat loop so I'm
gonna go ahead and sign my script and
stay school but hi this is a function
which is pretty much stays school dot
controls ActiveX controls active to
false right and we can style this one as
well but we need to take a look in the
browser so e1 right now done contrast
done in word done and brightness okay
looks fine but we need to style this
button and this area a little so let's
see what we can do so we're gonna now we
get real quick to brightness and I'm
going to say that effect name is the
margin button let's say 40 pixels font
size is one point or rather to R and
let's stay on three I guess 2.5 to do
then we can have for the done which is
let's go back wait the 90 pixels
pipeliner pixels background tripoli or
we can just go with any black
sort of color as well color wide justify
or slave flex justify content central a
line item center border-radius
50% and margin drop 20 pixels 30
whatever right so yep and if you go to
style of CSS and paste it right here we
can see that we can add a cursor of
pointer to this go back right and we'll
be good to go so yeah let's just take a
look right now increase the brightness
we go back contrast increase the
contrast we go back okay looks great now
let's just add a little background to
the preview we can thirty must say give
it a back end off a little crazy type of
color right and for the buttons we can
just leave that as white or maybe just
give it a border of prefixes solid
Triple E right and we can say that when
we give draw its text type for
background is same as the button but my
globe a little confusing so let's just
bring it a little or just enough right
so we can just go with that they've done
to what we have a
right effect type it is expect type
effect type so we just leave that and
yep so again if we take a look looks
much better at least for now I can go to
brightness increase the brightness or
decrease brightness and all that stuff
again there are just some basic stuff
left otherwise you're almost done some
enhancements we can add a title here as
well there are multiple ways to do that
I'm going to go the most dirty way so
I'm going to say content before content
crazy images position:absolute left:0
top:0 color white font size a 35 not
change this to 15 then I'm going to go
real bad with the positioning but you
can actually just go ahead and fix that
yourself so yep and if you know finally
take a look at the app it looks almost
ready we open a file key one select an
image we do some brightness stuff we do
some contrast we invert the image we
greyscale it little we saturate a little
we blur it a pixels and we are done with
the world's best image ever made right
so that is all for this one and in the
next tutorial we're gonna make it a more
or rather we'll just take a look at how
we can actually save this image but that
is going to be a little bit of
challenging tasks to do but we're going
to manage it so that's all for this one
and if you liked it then don't forget to
