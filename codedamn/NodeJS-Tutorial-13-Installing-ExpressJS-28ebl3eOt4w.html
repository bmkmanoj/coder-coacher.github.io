and welcome to your 13th node.js
tutorial in which finally we'll be
installing Express what is going on
everybody welcome to your 13th node.js
tutorial in which will be finally
installing Express Jas framework now for
all of those who are wondering what the
heck is expressed and why would you need
that
well Express is an OGS framework and it
is kind of you can say the most popular
framework for nodejs so why would you
need that well if you take a look at our
simple server program you see that we
did quite a bit of work for just the
hello world program for the server so as
you might get an idea when you create
bigger applications so that's why you
need Express because you can't just do
everything with just plain node that
would be way too cumbersome and would be
cluttery and might you know just force
you to bang your head on the keyboard so
I would like that to happen so that's
why we have expressed it comes with a
lot of plugins and support documentation
and all that good stuff so let's get
started to install Express hop into your
terminal write NPM install Express and
save now make sure to include this so
that it just pushes your Express into a
file load as package dot JSON which just
manages all of your packages so hit
enter
let it run for a while and as you can
see a new folder is created here
node modules so if I just take a look in
here I can see this Express folder and
all of the magic goes in here so let's
just hop back and as you can see looks
like this is installed so how do we
check that well to check that just hop
over into your script 13 file and start
writing Express is require Express are
as you can see that I'm not making use
of like this because this is a core
module ah so I'm just going to say app
is Express and try that out so if I do
like node script 13 or a yes as you can
see it does not throw me any error
because they'll do like something
invalid module it would surely throw me
an error so by that what I mean is that
Express is some sort of module available
to node so that's how you basically
install Express and we'll be starting
off with Express in the next tutorial
and that's all for this one and don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
