and welcome to your 18th angular 2
tutorial in which we'll are discussing
about routing from the last year
tutorials so in this tutorial as I said
I will just move this this thing right
here which is kind of another component
for up our application because now we
are not only restricted to a single page
application but actually to you know we
have multiple pages set up for example
the card one for now Holly so to move
this thing right out of here
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a bit
of file changes right here so I'm gonna
say this is my component that app dot d
s so this is my application file now and
again I'm gonna create a separate file
which says component not index dot d s
so I've changed this to add the TS and
I've created a index dot TS I'm gonna
copy all of that and I don't need the
route config or the card for this file
and again I don't need the selector
because we'll be working on that on the
app dot d yes yes I need template URL
and yes I need style URLs
I don't need direct is because I'm not
creating any child redirects right now I
don't need route config and I need the
mash-up component so for the component
app let's just trim this application a
little bit we need all these three and
we need another one and that is if you
might have guessed the my shop component
component dot index as you can see I
have split at the index file as well but
there's are there are a bit of conflicts
here so I'm gonna get rid of this
template URL at all and I'm gonna type
template and this would be the router
outlet which would allow me
to add different components and yeah if
you I guess I haven't tell you what this
router outlet is and this tag is
actually basically this is a place where
anything which you load by a route
config would get loaded so for example
in the last application we were making
use of the router outlet inside this
index.html file so whenever I was on the
cart page this component file executed
and then all of the stuff which was
returned by this component note card was
directly copied into this router outlet
so that was its role actually so again
we don't need this because we are now
creating a separate page for the card so
what we can do is that we can just leave
it right that right there and for the
component a dot TS I actually don't need
anything like that so I have to change
the name for this to avoid conflicts
let's just say this is my main app and
for this I need to go to main dot TS
mean up because again we are just
component that up and boarding that and
bootstrapping that as well
now all right
not for this we are done we need to add
another path that is if the location is
the home page that I want to have the my
shop component and the name for this
would be Leicester say this should be
what you suggest let's just say this is
home or we need a capital letter first
home page why not
so this is our home page and I don't
want it to link to anything because that
would be loaded by default whenever I
visit my website and now we done I guess
we are
so inside this index no we don't need
this one index we needed this and God
and I guess this would probably break
the application because we were actually
fetching the click event from a
different page so we might need to make
use of the local host local host and
just missing that on we need to make use
of the local storage actually so to make
it work and again some sort of problems
with internet or angular code I guess
this just says me can't bind to router
link since it's isn't a known native
property all right router link okay so
yeah so we need to make use of the
directives here what would be the router
directives and for that I guess we need
to make use of this route config import
as well but we don't need the route
config module right let's just see how
that works done or what just taking so
much time I guess this file listing is a
bit of time so I guess I can just get
rid of that for now so as to because
fonts are not important in the
application so we have the following
movies available but it doesn't look
like we have any of those my movie list
is empty because okay so I need this one
inside my shop component as well because
I'm making use of the inside this index
dot HTML not this one
the template one this index dot HTML I'm
making use of the ng four so that is why
I need this
and again these images are not loaded
because there's some sort of problem
with my internet right now
so anyways they are trying to load okay
so if I click on my card you can see
that now we have a separate card page
instead of just getting that ugly
embedded card inside that same page so
now this kind of looks like a route so
if I click on my card we have this card
but eventually we don't have anything
right here because I'm missing a lot of
events and actually I can just place the
whole code here because it's just get
rid of this at all I'm sure I need all
of that code right here so the final
step what I need in implementing the
simple card application is that I need
to actually somehow style this page and
the next thing is that I need to somehow
push this card this card array into the
local storage or somehow just transport
it to this page this component to this
component now let's just see if I make
use of a local storage or passing of
data between different components so for
that don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching and I'll see you then
