Mabel and welcome to your very second
react jf tutorial in which I'm just
going to improve a little bit of looks
of how this board looks so what we can
do is first of all these borders bother
me a lot so what we have it here square
right so we can do something like to the
square three yeah okay so if I play
around a little I guess I need to get
this one bigger now what this is three
and three and I guess yeah stable right
zero fair enough
and then what we had three and plus one
for the left zero okay now for these two
I guess we need to hard-code them and
how we do that is NF child zero
bottle top zero and a child one actually
it's not zero index rather one two three
there we go and similarly we need 7th
8th and 9th ah but we do not need bottle
tops your photos okay so we're going to
just leave it like that and we just kind
of copy this again paste it here
boiler bottle
zero and we're going to say this is
seventh this is eight and this is
finally nice there we go now the boat
looks much cleaner so I copied this
place right here I just bring the weight
again yeah so that kind of looks like a
tic-tac-toe board now and again we can
just get rid of these okay looks cool
but we still get this X and this over at
some weird place so instead square again
we can just get a display flags justify
content central because centering
vertically centering was never so easy
before flex box and there we go hey it's
just I don't know I just didn't not even
reload the page just change the CSS
that's pretty cool right so you can just
kind of work update CSS and it would not
actually change your HTML wow that's
great okay we can make it a little
bigger font size 20 pixels
chutki ah 45 yeah okay that looks good
and what else you got we can make it
look like pointer and I'm able to select
these I'd not want that so we can just
do that use a select none and there we
are so it kind of looks like it came now
and you can also do something like
square for background
something like that to add a little bit
of interactivity you know it's up to you
again what you can do is that you can
just customize the color of X and O
inside your script so that the boat
knows to color excess red and OS blue
you know there are a lot of things you
can do to this but that is how pretty
much you make a game like this and again
we need to do something if the match
draws right so what we can say is the
return or we can say rather if this top
state dot total moves is equal to nine
that being said that being said that
means that the match has very much drawn
because if somebody has won earlier then
we the code would not arrive here so we
can just simply return throw and we can
say he'll pay for you do not need any
else that there's all difficulty so we
can say this state set state game and
there is two and the winner is the draw
right and then finally we can create
something like dividing the right is
character and we can say this dot state
dot or rather we can say yeah this is
the state dot winner win a line and we
stay here when a line is matches drawn
when a line match won by oh and we're
line match 1 by X right let's see how
this looks like if you get match 1 by X
and again since we are not quitting the
game we would be able to go ahead with
the school but our status does not
update well that's kind of thing we
would want but this should not be
allowed right when the game's over it
should automatically reset so yeah you
can do that yourself and yeah that is
all pretty much how you create a very
basic tic-tac-toe game with react yes
and that's all for this one and if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching and I'll just
put all the code for this game on my
forum and I'll just paste a link in the
description so you can just download it
and play around and mess around and do
some editing and post it back on the
forum for the community to see and that
is all for this one and if you liked it
then don't subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
