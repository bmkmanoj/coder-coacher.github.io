are welcome cheer 26th express yes
tutorials so let's just copy the score
indiscreet 26 30 years and in this
tutorial we'll be doing a bit more of
stuff on our login application I have
meanwhile I have done some styles so
that's all that's pretty much all the
Styles I have written down here and the
application kind of looks like this for
now so that's pretty much what I have
applied for styles so right now our
application is a little bit biased it
just redirects for the admin one and it
doesn't actually do anything else so
instead of this what we can do is we can
pretty much say that instead of who are
you and all that stuff and yes I change
this from end to send well is added
right here so this would just render me
this HTML link and instead of this we
can just say that our request dot
session dot you need ID not found and
actually we can do is that right here we
can just set that for everybody like
that so we can now say that if session
dot unique ID then console.log this
check this out in the browser ABCD ABCD
login okay so okay so I'm working on
script 526 yes login ABCD ABCD I'm just
gonna see it shows
seedy not found instead of just an
abrupt message so if I do like admin
then a tweet asks me do admin but since
I don't have a route set for it so we
can actually set around for admin as
well request response you and that's
very much what it looks like log in as
well we are able to access we are able
to access as you can see it
automatically redirects me but if I just
paste this link again here change this
from end to end
then we'll have no problem killing
session we are again redirected to login
nobody actually you can access so we
need to just take care of that as well
session unique ID is then response dot
end authorized access we see that
unauthorized access is there and if I
change this to send we still get an
authorized acts and so responses
technically over here it doesn't come to
this line so we have finally managed to
create a little bit of application which
involves some sort of login stuff on the
basis of this what you can do next is
that you can actually fetch some data
from the database the MongoDB and as I
told you I'm
make that series as well to work with
nodejs plus MongoDB or Express I should
rather say and then pull out the data
and then pretty much do everything you
wanted to do with users or tend to give
them and redirect them through them from
one page to another and all that good
stuff so that's all for this tutorial
and yeah I'll see you then in the next
one and if liked it the known forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
