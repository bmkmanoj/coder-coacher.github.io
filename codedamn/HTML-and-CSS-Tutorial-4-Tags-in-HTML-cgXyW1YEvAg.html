your fourth HTML and CSS tutorial in
which we'll be discussing about tags in
HTML and tags in HTML are basically
nothing but kind of containers or
placeholders for your content and by
that what I mean is everything in HTML
is literally written in attack hTML is a
tag based language so let's see what
tags are and how they work so let me
zoom in a bit this should be good
whoa so this is way more than I expected
so anyways now to write a tag in HTML
what we do is we create a less than sign
then we write the name of the tag
between and then we close the tag with a
greater than sign so basically tag this
would be the syntax of a tag a simple
tag a less than sign dark name and agree
to the inside so now the browser knows
that do not print out this text because
this is not some normal text this is a
kind of function which has to be passed
by the browser and kind of
kind of it is the kind of like you say a
browser action needs browser needs to do
some action on the stack to perform
whatever the content is inside this
diagonals so for example in HTML we
start the document with the tag HTML now
every document you see online
we'll start with HTML tag and HTML tag
should be the root tag of every document
so we have HTML tag and then inside HTML
tag we write head now head means that
all this information down here which we
write inside head would be kind of not
appear to the user but would be useful
to the search bots or to the browser
itself to locate and find files so since
we don't need any support right now for
the browser let's leave this head tag
and let's close this and by closing a
tag how do you close the tag is that you
write the tag name just like you open
the tag but the name would be followed
by a slash symbol and this last symbol
denotes that your tag starts from here
and ends here so that's how you close a
tag in HTML
the next thing we need to do is to open
a body tag and all these tags right now
I'm teaching you and my own fancy made
tags but they are actually standardized
HTML tags which are accepted by all the
browsers so these are inbuilt tags in
the browsers which are acted upon by the
browser APs and other cool stuff so
let's open body and let's close body and
finally let's close HTML so let's zoom
out a little bit and you should notice
you should note that hTML is now make
sure your HTML tags are always nested
properly so for example
like I'll show you that suppose this is
your opening tag then if if this is your
very first opening tag then this should
be your very last closing tag similarly
this is your second most opening tag
then this should be your second last
opening tag closing tag basically that's
suppose you have another time right here
then obviously these are nested properly
because there's one parent tag and then
we have this tag which contains this tag
opening and closing and then the star
closes then this tag again opens then
this contains opening and closing and
then the star closes so basically I was
just explaining you the nesting process
in HTML so now when we have this HTML
document ready we have HTML head body
and now we can write our hello world
program again so here we go
now here we have our browser let's
reload this and as you can see we got
hello world return so
this was all about right David an
understanding tags in HTML and in the
next future tutorials we'll learn more
about these tags and how they work and
basically pretty much everything you
would want to learn in HTML so stay
tuned and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
