your seventh MongoDB tutorial
my name is Miho and in this tutorial I'm
gonna discuss about Mongo our CGS and
this file is kinda cool because this
allows you to customize your Mongo shell
a little bit because this file runs
before your Mongo shell runs so where
this file is is that you can just look
at this file in C users your username
for your computer then you just find
this file right there setting blank do
not create this file - would be
automatically there waiting for you and
for Mac users the process would be kind
of similar
you just have to locate this file in
your user account folder or something so
in a terminal what you have to do is
sometimes it's like you are writing
Mongo and you just create an object with
most awesome optimized settings ever
Mongo has ever experienced so you create
a ton of objects right there but you
then finally realized that you want to
edit the object well that's a nightmare
then because you you are working on and
you know on a command line and it's not
kind of feasible to edit multi-line
things in command line because it kinda
just allows you to work on one command
only at a time so that is kind of pain
so what you can do is you can make a
default editor for command line so
whenever you say like edit my variable
then that editor fires up and you would
be pretty much good to go so what you
have to do in Mongo RC is save editor
then your path to sublime text and you
could just actually write sublime text
only as well if you have sublime text
set up in your variable and the reason
we are writing such weird stuff is that
there are no spaces allowed in your path
so you need to make use of this thing so
anyways just save it and exit and then
again and from one go
and now if I create like more Maya
is a black one and I say like to edit
Maya check hit enter you see that a
manga file is created and right here I
can add tons of properties like awesome
crop is true I am awesome is false or
actually rather very true
right like that so now there's a twist
actually I see that I have saved this
file but the editor is still waiting for
something because I'm not got this thing
right there so it obviously tells me
that I'm not I would not be able to
write some more commands so see when I
close this you see that it Anna it
should bring back that thing well we do
have two editors right now you see that
it's back to normal
but if I write my object you see that I
get all these properties listed so that
is how pretty much you create editor or
default editor and now what you can do
is you can just say edit my object and
it will fire off sublime like a magic
and you can just edit your properties
and just save it close this file to make
changes happen and then go back to your
bash no sorry this says you are MongoDB
terminal or whatever you should call
this Mongo shell or whatever so the next
thing I was going to tell you about in
this tutorial is the prompt one so this
prompt is kinda this is a function which
would allow you to give a little bit of
customizability how your prompt in
MongoDB looks like so without wasting
any time I'm gonna quickly show you how
to work with this so I'm gonna say
prompt is a function this function is
simply return DB right so DB and a
little bit of space the dollar sign if
you you know convince you you're working
on Linux
so I'm gonna just exit this thing and
right here I'm gonna say Mongo it ain't
true and you can see now instead of
getting that ugly greater than sign we
just kind of unsupportable and
meaningless so now we are getting a test
which is a database name right right
there and a dollar sign right so it kind
of looks awkward but okay now what I'm
gonna do is say use MDB hit enter you
see pretty cool now we have switched to
MDB and it's pretty awesome to just take
a look at at which database we are
working we don't need to kind of like
add you know just write DB every time to
show which database we are working on so
you can pretty much customize it a
little bit more like when I add an
operation count rule like you can say
like ops is equal to zero and then right
there you can say like then you can say
pretty much plus plus ops and make sure
you just from that thing in brackets and
now if you just take a look here
exit Mongo hit enter you can see that I
get test 1 than $1 see what happens now
if I write like show DB's you know you
see that the commands change to 2 now
like all right use MD be hit and true it
change to 3 I'm gonna say md v dot i
don't remember any name kind of and give
it out find there's nothing no document
right now so Adam DB so anyways you know
you get the idea you have now an updated
counter right there and you can just
pretty much do anything you want you can
like show a date here you can show
current time your working time and
pretty much great lay around it with a
little and once you're done then just
move on to the next tutorials so that's
all for this one and if you liked it
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
