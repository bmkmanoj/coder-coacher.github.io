your 20th react yes tutorial in which
I'm going to implement a little more
logic to our game and fix some things so
first of all to fix the thing of
overwriting others move what we can do
is we can actually just inside our
clicky where we can check if the inner
text of that particular Divi clicked is
empty or not and if it is empty then
it's a valid move it's not empty then
it's okay just kill that but I guess we
can do it in a more efficient way you
can say I don't know it in a more kind
of state stateful way I'd rather say by
creating an instance of the board itself
inside JavaScript right that's what
pretty much essentially react is doing
with the Dom right it's just creating a
copy of the term itself in the
JavaScript and it just pretty much
messes up with the copy in the
JavaScript and does not touch the
original Dom because it's expensive and
it just updates whenever it needs to
right so we're going to implement a
pretty much similar logic so we're going
to do both and we're going to stay re of
how many elements we need 9 we can just
fill it with nothing right and yeah
inside a click even what we're going to
do we have to get the index off the div
which we have click now we can actually
do that with JavaScript and even in
one-liner with jQuery but I guess a more
easy and the friendly approach would be
to assign some sort of data with every
dev we have right here right so what we
can do is this I can get that right you
can say data
square we can say this one obviously I
don't want that for everything right so
just get that two two three four five or
rather we should start with 0 because
anyhow we'll just need to increment or
decrement that later so we're going to
start with 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
like that and inside here what we can do
is we can stay board or rather we can
just say that this state dot board is
event the target dot data set dot square
is equal to this dot state dot dot right
so I know I'm just modifying state right
there and that's not very reactive but
you can just do now board this top state
would write because essentially we are
just eventually calling the set state
method in the next line so I guess that
should be fair enough
so yeah we can just console.log this dot
state dot board as well just in case if
you want to see so if I click on here we
get X and if I click on here we get on
the last one and like that and there we
go we can see all the nine squares are
film now and we have a representation of
this 3 cross 3 matrix or you know this
board right here in form 4
arrey right Oh array has people say okay
so yeah now essentially what we need to
do to prevent something like this from
happening this right we just need to say
that if this does state that fold this
thing right there exist or rather we can
just do is something like this or this
or whatever then only we want to do this
okay right otherwise just silently die
out so if I click on X and if I click on
it again you can see that it does not
update now and it does not change to oh
so that's pretty good and yeah so now
when we have our board as well with us
so it would be simple for us to you know
calculate who's the winner and when the
game has ended right so yeah that is all
for this one and if you liked it then
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
