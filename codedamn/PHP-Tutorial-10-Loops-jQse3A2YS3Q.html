tenth PHP tutorial in which will be
learning about loops in PHP now loops in
any language are very handy because they
allow you to run a block of code
multiple times as many times as you like
so what loops are actually is for
example if you write a loop some syntax
here and you write a code block here
then this block would run as many times
as you wish to now this is extremely
useful when you have a thing to do a lot
of time so for example let's say I want
to print the table of two to ten
thousand so what I would do without loop
is obviously right echo to echo for echo
six and all the way down to echo 200 or
2000 are 20,000 whatever so that would
be a lot of Deadliest work and this
would increase the file size
tremendously as well so this will occupy
a lot of memory as well so to save us
from that we have something called loops
in PHP so there are actually three kind
of loops not actually three but forth
but we would be learning the fourth one
when we have done errors because it's
mainly used in RS so we have four loop
we have while loop we have then a
do-while loop and then the fourth one is
for in loop which this one we would be
doing in audits okay so now let's start
so let's come to follow first the for
loop would accept three expressions here
the first one being the initial ini DLI
initialization if I spell it right then
this is the condition and this is the
updation now what by that what I mean is
let's say I want
print a table of two so let's say two is
to obviously so let's say for i equals
to one I want to start with one because
i want to ones or two then I is less
than or equal to 10 now here what I'm
doing is I'm checking that if I is less
than then they'll run this loop or I is
equal to 10 then also run this group a
similar of this thing would be if I is
less than 11 or you could even write if
I is not equal to 11 like that so in
either case it would work so for example
let's just go with I is not equal to 11
and i will do i plus plus and this i
plus plus i guess i told you guys this
is similar like I'm doing i is equal to
i plus 1 which would just increment this
variable by one so i plus plus and this
line are equivalent okay so now what I
want to do is I would use echo do cross
some concatenation going on here i
equals
2-star I now this is saying to cross I
this is just the syntax par and the
multiplication is going on here so let's
run this in the browser let's reload and
as you can see it says me to ones or two
to do the 4 2 306 24 czar eight and so
on let's make this a little bit tidy so
let's just append new line here so what
this new line would do or this would
make it appear in next line and this
doesn't work in HTML mode because new
line is finished in the source one to do
in HTML what you have to do is write BR
here instead of new line so in the
source we can see that it's Tyree now so
it says two ones are to do booths are
four threes are six fours are eight five
to ten and so on so if i make it like a
billion times of whatever i could make
the stable run a lot down and i guess
the number was too large so let's just
cut this off a number let's just reload
this again
okay so even that one is a big number
because of memory management in PHP you
could always increase that limit but for
example guess there's a certain kind of
limit to see that it actually works for
a thousand so you got all the thousand
all the way down to 999 I guess yeah
because we checked for eyes not equal
two thousand now what is happening here
is once I is equal to 999 it comes here
it says okay I is not equal two thousand
then it goes down here it checks this
and then it increments this so an
equivalent of this would be like and I
must tell you guys that all these three
are you know optional statements so even
if you do like this you would have no
worries but this would be an infinite
loop and how to handle with infinite
loops we would be learning in the next
tutorial so that's it for the 41 let's
take a look at the wild now while just
like four are not just like four just
like four accepts three expressions here
while just accept the condition nothing
else so as long as this condition is
true this loop would run so if I say
like while I is not equal to 11 let's
just initialize I here with one echo i
dot new light this is just the symbol of
new lines so that the text appears in
the next slide so let's reload this
oh I guess we forgot to increment I and
this would be an infinite loop because I
would never be 11 so don't forget to
increment I in the while loop so you see
now that we got numbers from 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 so that's pretty much like for
only but in the wild what we have is the
increment is done inside the boot loop
body and the initialization is done
outside the loop body and the condition
is inside the expression of violent
similar to while what happens in do
wireless that your loop runs at least a
single times so let's say if a right
while I is not equal to 1 so what
happens now is when I will reload this
you see that the loop doesn't run at all
this is because I is equal to 1 so this
condition is evaluates to false so this
doesn't run okay so what about do while
in do while if i write this similar code
what we have do while in do wireless
instead of that while we have the do at
the top and then vile after this so
that's the only difference initially
what we had is while here and no
semicolon here but in do while we have
do on the top and while here now what
happens is I is still one but this loop
would run exactly one time now
alright so
okay so the problem here is that this
scored runs at least a single time so I
+ + increments I do too and then when I
becomes too then this condition is never
masked because I would eventually crew
and not what not you know decrease so if
I remove this then this should be an
infinite loop if I is anything except
one but since I is 1 then this code
block would run at least a single time
when this condition is matched this
would not run so let's reload this again
and as you can see we get one but if i
do that similar thing with while only
then you will see that this would not
run at all because I is eventually one
so that's all for the three loops and we
would be learning about these more after
we cover arrays and one more loop in the
air is section so that's it for this
tutorial and don't forget to subscribe
