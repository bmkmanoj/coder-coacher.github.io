angularjs tutorial this is Miho and in
this tutorial we'll be looking at
providers in angularjs like the last two
tutorials we'll learn about factories
and services but providers are basically
is the head of your services and
factories so services and factories
basically come under providers not being
said that means that whatever you are
doing in services or providers can be
done oh sorry the services and your
factories can be done in providers as
well with a little more flexibility so
you have little more control in
providers than in services and factories
now let's just take a look at a simple
example to demonstrate what I'm trying
to say okay let's just create a greet
message here I will just hook up this in
angular so let's create an application
with angular dot one tool set to main
app and let's just write a provider here
so to write a provider here you have to
write the name of your application dot
provider and just like you do in factory
write your name of the provider let's
just say I'm writing a date here a
function won't hurt so here you have
your provider
now this provider has to return
something now basically if you remember
from our very first tutorials I told you
about my tutorials were like
introduction to routing if you remember
and more odd routing I guess these were
the two so these two tutorials told you
how to make use of route and route
provider now in this tutorial or maybe
in the next one I'm going to show you
how these two things are linked to each
other
so right here when you create a provider
of date you automatically have
to something called date provider in
your application config well we'll be
taking a take a look at this very soon
but for now let's just concentrate on
what we were doing so application that
provided data creates a date provider
and then we have to return something
from this and we have to return would be
all which we are going to return so
we'll return this code to the injector
now injector is something which handles
whatever your controllers are doing so
whenever you are like updating your
variables in the document in the scope
then you are basically making use of
injector in angularjs so if you do like
get function that this get function is
in bulk and this would be automatically
executed by the injector so now you need
to return something to injector as well
so what you're going to return is just
going to come inside this now since this
is an object you can freely create
functions or properties inside it let's
say I just want to create a function
showed it and this would be a function
and the screen where you will date
equals new date and just got a return
from this function date dot get ours now
you might get confusing so many curly
braces and so many return statements
here inside just one function so I'm
just gonna overthrow you again this
return returns the show date a value
this return returns the injector a value
and this return returns the provider a
value so we are gonna see the value when
we call showed it that this one value
and the injector is gotta see this code
right here all right so now let's just
make use of this inside our control
so just write your application on
controller app and function scope and
don't forget to include your provider
just like you do in factories and right
here what I'm going to do is I'm just
gonna set the creat message equal to not
a static one but I'm gonna get date dot
showed it so let's just try it on the
browser let's reload this you see I got
20 because it's currently 8 4 p.m. in my
country so we can just wave I it from
here you see it's like Saturday October
21 2015
24 right now so it returned we did ours
now how we can use this as a dynamic
approach I'm gonna show you in the next
one
the next video so till then don't forget
