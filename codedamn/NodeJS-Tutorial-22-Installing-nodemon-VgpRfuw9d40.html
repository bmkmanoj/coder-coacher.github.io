and welcome to 22nd noches tutorial in
which I'm gonna show you how to install
and set up something known as a node mod
well we should have covered this
tutorial and I guess about 7th or 8th
one but you know I just didn't get
eventually to this part of node so here
we are well better late than never so to
set this up what I want you guys to do
is just go to your terminal and write
NPM install node Mon Mon and just save
it
alright so holy crap so we have a lot of
error here well this is a permission
denied error so I guess
might be running with sudo sudo and BM
install node Mon safe all right so it
seems like it worked with sudo well just
try with it without sudo first if it
didn't work for you as well but I don't
know why it didn't work okay
so yeah so we were talking about this
norm on well what this was do is that
let's just say you have written a big
node script and you know you're just
working on a project which requires node
and you're just doing an edit you're
making edit to your code every single
second so you're just updating your code
going to a browser reloading but heck
you remember that you didn't restart the
server remember that whenever you make
change to your node main code then you
have to restart the server to get the
changes applied and all that stuff well
what this Nordmann would do is that it
would come to rescue well it would just
watch over all of your files of which
requires the server to be restarted once
they are edited
and it would automatically restart your
node server accordingly so this would
make your life a lot of easier you won't
have to touch terminals for a while when
you are just creating some node code and
yeah that's pretty much it what this
would do so yeah so as you can see this
is Install Now and all right so it saves
me that it should be installed with G
well we could just go ahead and do that
as well so yeah sorry for guys for
missing this fly you can just go ahead
and just make it global as well yeah so
this shouldn't take a lot of time let's
just wait let's just count to 10 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 and well that was mercy so you
go in 5 4 3 2 5 to 21
yeah so whoa what the heck the Xcode
build command requires no not now all
right so once you're done with that just
write or let's just get some code very
first and why the heck is this always
right there so script 20 is black as
well all right
nice what does this copy is for 21 in
your script 22 I'm get rid of this just
need a basic application to work with
and this should be good enough first to
start now go to your terminal right
clear no more script 22 Jas hit enter
all right so now you can see that it
shows us a bunch of messages watching
startup star
do we start at anytime and rah-rahs well
this is for a manual restart but you
won't probably need that so if I just go
to my browser hit reload as you can see
it shows me Wow and if I do do like wow
again no sorry scar yeah and I directly
go to browser and reload wow you can see
that there's no server restart required
so if you can't you just see in your
terminal as you can see it automatically
sees that restarting you to changes
restarting you to changes all that stuff
so that's just gonna just make your life
a bit easy so dyad so that's all for
this one I'll see you then real soon in
the next one don't forget to subscribe
