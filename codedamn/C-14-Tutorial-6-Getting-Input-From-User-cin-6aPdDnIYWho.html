sixth C++ tutorial in which will be
learning about something called see in
now just like see out is used to display
something on the screen see in is used
to get something from the user from the
console now CN would actually allow you
to make dynamic programs based on the
user input and then parse the
information as whatever you like so to
do that first of all declare a variable
because obviously we want the
information which is received from the
user to store somewhere so that we could
actually pass that so let's say C out
enter in number and let's say I want to
get a number from the user now so what
I'll do is I'll type C in and instead of
these greater than signs I'll make use
of these signs or I don't know if they
are less than then these are opposite so
I just want to say you guys that this
looks like you are throwing off
something from see out it looks like
Anna and this looks like you're getting
something inside see in so that pretty
much makes sense so I want to get
something but we are going to store that
so I want to store that in a now this is
crucial because this not only tells
where the information has to be stored
but it also tells that what kind of
information the compiler is expecting
from the user now a has a data type of
integer so compiler would only accept in
teacher add if something else is entered
then the program would probably crash
down so I'll just zoom in a little bit
for you guys now let's just run this
program and you see that we get a prompt
enter a number waiting for us to enter
in number so let's say I enter 20
so it says nothing because we are not
using this information anywhere so let's
press ENTER and let's make use of this
number so let's say see out your number
when when squared gives let's make use
of cascading a star a now we are working
with variables now since we already had
a inside the value of user inside the a
we could actually perform automatic or
whatever we like under this line so
let's execute this again so let's say I
enter then and i hit enter so it gives
me your number when squared gives gives
us 100 and that's correct so you see how
see in works and CM is not only for
integer would also work for characters
so let's say I have a character my
initial and I see out enter initial of
your name alright and i c'n my an issue
and what i'll do is i'll just type your
name has the initial my initial so you
see that gasps getting not only works
with a single integer or a single data
type but with any of the data type so
when I see out this or run this so it
says we enter initial of your name since
mine is male so it would be m and it
saves me your name has the initial M
pretty obvious and stupid but
that's how you guys Roland so that's
pretty much it about CN and i'll be
using a hell out of CN in my future
tutorials so i want you guys to clear up
all your concepts about CNN see out
about these two streams and if you have
guys are facing any problem then feel
free to leave a comment inside the
comment section below so that's it for
this tutorial and i'll see you guys next
time so don't forget to subscribe thank
