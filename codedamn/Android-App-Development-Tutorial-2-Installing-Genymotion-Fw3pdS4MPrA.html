Mel and welcome to your second Android
app development tutorial in which I'm
gonna show you how to set up your
emulator for Android application because
just coding your raw application in one
go and then testing your final
application is a disastrous idea because
many things can go wrong in your code
and you would probably spend more time
on debugging than compared to your
coding one so what you need to have is
an emulator well an emulator is just a
simulated version of something so for
now we need an emulator for our Android
device which would just simulate the
Android operating system on your
computer itself now you could have
downloaded the Android emulator with
Android studio under to do does come
with that but it would be great if you
could just go ahead with genymotion one
because genymotion
is kind of faster than the regular
Android emulator and it is free as well
so that's a plus point and so is Android
emulator well it's really up to you but
I do prefer gain emotion because it's
kind of relatively fast and you could
just use it as a phone as well when
you're not testing apps so here we go
now just go to google and write gain
emotion and you'll get on the first
website getting motion you might need to
sign up on this website for the free
copy but that's kind of fair so yes
these guys do have a paid copy as well
which comes with a lot of features but
for now we just need a free copy so we
just go with individual and this basic
one so it would just ask you to I guess
sign up yes because it asked me earlier
so you just have to sign up and it will
just send you a link or something or it
would present your link and you would
finally end up with a setup you just
have to install that setup just click on
next next and you'll be probably done
and once you're done installing that you
scored your start and right genymotion
and once you open the application you
would get something like this and here
we go and I do have two devices ready
already so I'm just gonna delete both of
them and I'm gonna show you from scratch
how to do stuff so when you would you
know install it and open it something
like this would open so you just have to
say add and in my case it doesn't ask me
for any login because if you see it I'm
already logged in into this application
but once you click Add here it would
probably ask you to login and you have
to just use the same credentials which
you used here to sign up and once you do
that it will present you with all these
free devices which you could access with
your free account so you could just
probably go with this custom 5
marshmallow API level to anyone and just
click on next and just name your phone
like my phone or something anything
would go and you could just change these
configurations later on let's just click
Next for now and it would just do some
sort of stuff and we'll just take a
while it would all obviously download
some files as well from internet so in
my case it doesn't because I guess I had
already this device only installed as a
list so it already had the files
required for this device but in your
case it would download I don't know it's
all wrong I guess 200 to 300 MB of data
so once it's done just click on finish
and then click on start just say
initializing virtual device and all that
good stuff
so it looks like you're working with a
real Android device now so just give it
a few seconds and it will just boot up
so here you can see that a phone pops up
right here and it's probably in its off
state right now so let's just
give it a few seconds to start and write
on the right you can see all of these
features so you can see that it pretty
much loaded nicely and all of these
features are your regular Android the
GPS then here's the camera I don't have
a camera set up right now otherwise it
will just act as a front or back camera
then you could just go to menu let's
browse some settings you see all that
stuff which you have right here and you
can scroll down just like a regular
phone let me check your about phone and
you can tap the bill number actually if
your developer options are not open so
that you can just make use of the
developer options so now it says you are
now a developer just go back you can see
that developer options is unlocked and
pretty much you have access to
everything in Android for a developer
which a developer requires so that's how
you pretty much set up a Android device
on your PC or your in your Mac whatever
so you could actually use it as a
regular device as well but I'm not gonna
make use it for now so you could just go
ahead and try that and once you're done
then proceed to next tutorial I'll see
you there
so if you liked it then don't subscribe
