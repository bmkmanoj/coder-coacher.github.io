Mabel and welcome to your seventh
responsive web design tutorial in which
I'm going to show you how to add media
queries for landscape and portrait views
exclusively so let's just begin our
website as you can see right now looks
pretty messed up on a landscape view so
let's just do something about it so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create
another media query for 720 and I'm
going to say on maximum with 720 and
orientation orientation is landscape a
simple as that so now you're only gonna
target devices which are in landscape
view right so look and I think it will
not work with these iframes so
essentially we're going to make use of
the actual device toggler provided by
this guy right here right so if I do
like display body display:none yeah that
works
okay perfectly fine so if I get rid of
this reload you can see it is messed up
so in the landscape you can see that we
have got more width but less height so
we cannot afford to have these elements
right here so I'm just gonna get rid of
language group at all and we need to
position this appropriately as well so
we have this welcome again yeah I have
messed it up again so
we can do is stop 50% margin tops zero
and we can say transform from still 8y
minus 50% but it's just touching that so
I do not want that so my header which is
it is around 77 pixels roughly with the
logo size so what we can do is say plus
37 pixels and just wrap it inside calc
yeah looks really good but we have again
this over I think sort of things so we
can again get rid of this at all
display:none and that looks more like a
nice and good website I don't know if it
will work here yeah it probably didn't I
did it I guess it did Oh
yeah maybe it would so anyhow we have
problem with iPhone 6 now so I for 6
this looks good then what's happening
here long yeah this one looks a little
bit messed up so
what we can do about this well it's 736
is just about 720 so we can rather just
make it to 736 only that doesn't really
matter and we'll get a fixed website
right so that should be it and we are
doing a lot of spacing here so let's
just bring it down a little there we are
and it looks a little bit messed up well
that's a closed design to 720 we cannot
put our 720 code into this so apparently
you could even create some media queries
to actually specifically target these
sort of devices the more famous ones
likely start off with Apple devices then
you move on to some famous Samsung
devices and next those and you know then
some generic device tags like 720 480
and all that stuff because you know
Apple Apple is creating 736 pixel by 414
which is you'd ever know this sort of
strange number to do so yeah our titles
are a little bit messed up so we can
just reduce them to
three reps and three runs fixes it
pretty much for this device it looks
good again yep so next we have is the
iPad and all that stuff and I think we
pretty much made it again there might be
some devices where it would not be as
good as it should be but mostly we are
pretty much colored right so yeah that
is all for this tutorial and finally
finally in the next one we are going to
set up some viewports and will actually
test on a real device as well that's all
for this one and if you liked it then
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching and by the way I almost
forgot to tell you in every tutorial
that I have come up with a new form the
code damned form right it's the
community of programmers like you only
and I need your support and help to make
it crew and together we can do it and
I'll be hyperactive there would be
supporting all of your queries from I
don't get a lot of time to interact with
you guys on youtubes comment section
because kind of YouTube doesn't always
inform me about all the commands it sort
of marks a lot of useful comments as
spam as well because you guys mostly
post links to jQuery scripting and write
some HTML so YouTube are the audience
sort of not programming minded types so
we need a different place sort of out of
youtube to move our tasks and this is
the form I have been working for past
two days and
I have created some forms here and
please make sure you can you contribute
to the form or provide any suggestions
by going into this journal discussions
tab and creating a new topic or you know
doing going in any other form and
posting any relevant content you have or
any query any question anything you have
made to share with the community and
again there's a little thing you need to
do you need to create a free account
just agree to the terms put all the
information and get started that's
that's pretty much it for you to come
for you to join the community and these
are some recent posts the latest post
and I have created this this one
responsive design tips and tasks and I
have added a website here which
essentially is a task for you guys to
convert into a responsive layout and I
would want you guys to do that and reply
me with the code you have done you can
attach files there as well and I'll be
happy to see and if you get into any
problem I'll be happy to help as well so
yeah let's just begin our community with
this responsive way right so that we can
grow and help other programmers as well
who are struggling or maybe just want to
grow or learn from other people like you
so yeah that's all for this one and if
you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one real
quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
