31st JavaScript tutorial or basically a
quiz by david sheriff
the last quiz section we covered
question number one to five with proper
explanation and reasoning of every
question and its solution so coming to
question number six we have this problem
right here which says what should be the
result of this so basically whenever we
subtract something from a string it
automatically gets converted into an
integer so what's happening down here is
if you looked into my previous tutorials
then plus sign plus operator is used for
concatenation of strains and adding of
numbers so basically a plus B is a B so
this process is known as concatenation
and plus is used in concatenation as
well as in the adding of numbers but
minus sign is only a mathematical
operator or an operator simply which is
used for the calculation only and if I
do a minus B then this thing doesn't sum
up with JavaScript JavaScript says how
could I subtract a from B so it throws
an error which is an odd number so
basically as we saw minus sign converts
these two here into integers because
plus sign JavaScript knows okay that
these two are strings then I know then I
have to concatenate these two but minus
sign JavaScript automatically treats
both of these as numbers so basically
what's happening here is
we are basically treating these two as
integers by using the negative signs and
one sign is enough to convert both of
these two integers and the next sign
basically follows the mathematical rule
that 1 minus -1 is basically 1 plus 1
isn't it if you have learned in your
mathematics class that minus minus is
plus and plus minus is minus minus plus
minus like that so basically what we are
doing is we are converting these two
numbers or basically two strings right
now into integers and then we basically
are performing a mathematical operator
we're using a double negative which
basically means adding these two so if
we do like 1 plus 1 then this here means
concatenation of strings but if we do 1
minus minus 1 then JavaScript says okay
so let me first of all convert these two
into integers if they are actually
integers and I'll then perform the
future operations so JavaScript with the
help of one symbol converts it into an
integer and this operation becomes 1
minus minus 1 and then with this
operator javascript converts this into
an integer as well and this operation
becomes 1 minus minus 1 and then
JavaScript follows its mathematics rule
and
which evaluates to the answer you know
now right now it should be okay now
we have this question number seven down
here the console okay so it says we are
initializing x-23 we have an object here
and I'll check literal we are assigning
the x value to 2 we have the object
inside an object then we are assigning X
to 1 then we have a function down here
return this text ok
okay so now what we are doing is we are
reading and available qu food at Bass
dot bar okay
okay pretty interesting now what
actually appears here is not happening
we are basically assigning this go as
food at bastard bar and calling it as a
function now you may think that this
thing right here is similar to this
thing because these are same but here's
where scoping comes in JavaScript now if
you remember from my playlist tutorial
where I told you the the disk II would
think this given yes I remember that I
taught you about this keyword this
keyword and explain you what is scoping
in this keyword and what does this
refers to so basically this refers to
the owner of the object we are creating
so here we have this function down here
and the owner of this function down here
we are assigning it in to go and what is
the owner of the function of the
function go right now it's the window
object I'll explain it again so what's
happening down here is we are assigning
this function down here to go go
variable now this is similar to this is
similar to creating a variable cool like
a function and return this dot X and why
it is like this because we are assigning
this function the bar function right
here to the go and as I told you this
refers to the owner of the function and
the owner of this function down here is
the window superglobal so this dot X
refers to window dot X and when you dot
X down here is what is X which is
declared in the top scope so this should
alert 3 this one down here should
obviously in its scope which is the
owner of this function is bus this dot X
is 1 so the order of alert should be 3
and 1 okay so now we have this thing
I guess I told you this exact same thing
in my last couple of tutorials or maybe
a more if you have saw them then you
could immediately answer this question
and what's happening down here is this
is similar to if you simplify this code
X is new string ABC and we are just
console logging this x instance of
straight and obviously when we are
calling the with the new keyword then we
call the constructor function string and
this is now not a primitive value but
but this enough this is an object and
then X is obviously instance of string
because we have called the string ABC
with the help of constructor function
with the help of given new so this
should be obviously true
pretty simple for those who have watched
my tutorial back coming to this now this
is basically something related to arrays
in JavaScript and in JavaScript we don't
have primitive Ares first of all we only
have Ares and objects as an objects if
you saw my videos in the past I have
always used the keywords like arrays are
special kind of objects in JavaScript
and what that means is in JavaScript we
don't have primitive arrays so what
actually means is for example if we
create an array like eggs we do type off
or basically ex instance of array then
it would return us true
and if we do new array with like eggs
and we do X instance of area and it
would still return us true
and finally if we do re just simply
added notice I haven't used the new
keyword down here and I do X instance
off array and it would again return us
true now what's happening here is and
how it is different for example if I
create a keyword or a string ABC then X
here is not an instance of the object
string and if we do string ABC
and X is still not in stance of string
but if we do the use if we use the
keyword new then we are calling the
constructor function and basically now
this string is actually an object and
not a primitive value so now X is an
instance of string
pretty good but in JavaScript in RS as I
showed you earlier we don't have any
primitive values so what's happening
here is when we are do is instead of
getting an array as a result javascript
treats them as strings now because of
concatenations so for example I have
like element 1 as a number in array and
element let's say 2 in another array and
if I concatenate these two then what
we'll get is 1 2 and basically this
operator down here is acting as a
concatenation right here because we are
not supplying any index number down here
so basically this concatenates 2 RS and
we get 2 however and 1 2 and remember we
have getting the output as a string but
however if we do it like 1 0 and
basically now it refers to the value 1
and we are doing like to 0 then what
we'll get is 1 plus 2 is equal to 3 as
you can see
now if we do like 1 0 plus 2 then it
refers to 1 plus 2 which is again 12 as
you see so basically
concatenating to empty RS root answers
an empty string and then we are just
appending the string with foo
and we are then just splitting this food
into this thing but what's the
difference is in this example at from
these all in the separate steps but
what's happening here is the split
keywords creates a array of the letters
when we supply like opening and closing
single quotes in the parentheses of
split so what would you be expecting is
creating an array of foo but what's
happening here is we are creating the
array and then assigning a string an
empty string basically concatenating an
empty string to this array and just like
our as I showed you if I concatenate an
empty string right here then it gets
converted into a string itself so
basically this would return as an array
but if I do at an empty area to this
so what this would return us is
fool no basically what's happening here
is this this is treated as this as I
showed you here so this returns us proof
pretty simple if you understand so the
correct answer is fou as a string
separated by comma
okay coming to the last question and I
guess I took much time in this question
anyways
so two string method okay so we have
this new RF 5 we are creating an array
of length 5
and we are just doing it two strings so
basically you are a five creates an
empty array five with undefined values
or null values has the values so if we
do like this thing above is equal to
okay so now if we convert this to a
string then obviously JavaScript would
eradicate all these null elements and
what it would leave is all these commas
and we have the commas as one two three
and four for commas down here and if we
do extra to string then we get only
these commas because javascript
automatically eradicate or removes these
null elements because we don't need them
so the output is obviously this one
correct okay so this was the next five
questions of david sheriffs mr. david
sheriff the great javascript quiz and i
hope you enjoyed the quiz and do go
forward and attempt these next ten
questions yourself and if you find any
problem then you are free to watch my
next video which will be I will do it
again question number 11 to 15 and then
finally from 16 to 20 so stay tuned with
me and thanks for watching the tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
