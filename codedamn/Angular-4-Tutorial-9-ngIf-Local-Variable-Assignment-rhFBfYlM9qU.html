May ho and welcome to your ninth
tutorial for angular in which I'm gonna
cover what local variable assignment is
and angular ng-if and how you can use
them right so last time we developed on
how to use if-else sort of environment
in angular ng-if let's see how we can
make use of a local variable or actually
what does that even mean right so if you
do something like div ng if I don't know
let's just say counter modulus 2 is
equal to 0 that pretty much means that
your number which is counter is
divisible by 2 then I want to show this
thing so yep what we can do is whether
it color is equal to 0 and what we can
do inside toggle div is a this dot
comfort plus plus right and now we can
do is pretty much say let random
variable write something like that and
if I make use of this random variable
right here and see you can see we get
yep true and we get nothing because this
condition is false and again yet true so
what's happening here is essentially we
are getting the result of this condition
into this thing right so what happens if
I remove this double equal to 0 and save
it now you can see that if I struggle I
get 1 instead of true so what what just
happened here well what we did actually
is that with this lit random variable we
are passing the radius
of our condition which might not be
always boolean but you know in
JavaScript one is evaluated as true and
if you are ever confused what things
would be valuated to what you can just
go ahead and console and write double
exclamation and something like or to
check an array so it evaluates to true
and object it also evaluates to true
one is true zero as false and you can do
that all day right so one is apparently
true so we get to see this and against a
toggle it you can see that it is gone
because our condition is not false and
yeah pretty much there's no point in
getting a random variable to it
now you can actually do that with some
objects as well if you want so you can
say my favorite languages then object
and you can say something like content
is a HTML CSS JavaScript will apparently
that's the only choice and back and we
can stay no yes PHP Python Ruby anything
right so yep and where we can do is you
can go ahead and say ng if my favorite
line dot front end which is obviously an
array and as we have seen it evaluates
to true this spelling issue here now I
can say this is front end languages like
witches now obviously you can just go
ahead and use something like this but
again it does not guarantee that this is
not null or this is undefined so ng-if
is a nice way to check if you are
working with okay well defined variable
or maybe it's not false E right so
what we can do right now it is just a
random variable
the or fund the languages stock join
with a comma right simple as that so you
can see that we get a yep HTML CSS
JavaScript back and we can just toggle
it but again we have some problems the
organ function doesn't exist so we can
just get rid of this right now right so
you can see that this is our local
variable for this thing only again this
will not work outside your div you can
see that we are getting errors so this
is local to your if conditionally and
that is all pretty much you make use of
local variable assignment and angular 2
and 4 again whatever you want to call
this just angular or angular 2 4
together so yeah that's all for this one
and if you liked it then don't forget
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
