doing good this is a quick screencast on
making use of external microphone with
your MacBook Air I have done a lot of
research on Google and there are plenty
of articles for MacBook Pro that you can
go into this input and change some
device from some settings from output to
input mode but for MacBook Air there was
none and there's a lot of confusion as
well whether if you can make use of any
external microphone apart from the Apple
earpods or not so yes you can make use
of external microphone and it's a lot
easy to set up and right now you can see
that I'm using MacBook Air with external
microphone which had just one port we
just said a headset icon with it which
pretty much meant that I could never use
it for input but you can actually do
that and to do that what you need to do
is first of all get this splitter which
is right now I'm making use of and if
you're in the end if you are from India
then you can directly purchase the same
product which I'm making use of right
now and you can find a link in the
description if you're from the US or
some other country you can purchase the
similar product I have the link for that
in the description as well and it worked
just fine but this is the product right
now right now I'm making use of I can
even show you that by disconnecting it
and when I disconnected it would shift
to the default internal microphone so
the audio would drop so this is
right here if you see this is the
Splinter I am using right now and this
would be our microphone and you can just
plug in the microphone into this little
slot and the main jack
into the MacBook Air and you would be
good to go so the moment I do this you
can see that sometimes it does not work
and the reason is that you have to
actually put in the speaker one as well
before plugging it in and then if I plug
it out again and plug it in again you
can see that the external microphone is
now detected and it works pretty well so
yeah that is all for this one and you
can find all the links in the
description how to set up external
microphone and the splitter as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
