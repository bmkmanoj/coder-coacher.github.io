ho and welcome to your sixth tutorial
for angularjs last PHP web application
and in this tutorial let's just finally
add some effects to our images to show
to the user and probably we can just
instruct the user as well to just right
click and save their images if you want
and yep so let's just say I create this
as the divided images as the parent and
we can just say this image here and call
em d3 with text Center I don't think we
would need that big thinker anyhow but
we can just do that and I'm just adding
this image class just in case if you
would want to edit this a little bit so
now as you can see we have this four
images effects now what I can do is
actually rent this down to 250 and yep
so using this we can simply trim down
the image to do 50 and not only this
actually print it scales it to 250 but
it actually reduces the size it's not
CSS it will actually serve you a 250 by
250 image that the size would be
actually reduced which is a great thing
now if we take a look in the
documentation and CDN you would see a
lot of other fix as well here so we have
this quality effect so let's just add
this quality effect and see what happens
so I add this quality effect right here
after this and let's just say and we
have these qualities so we have this
normal
better best lighter and lightest now
let's just go with the best why not to
see how this looks like now you can just
read about these qualities values here
then we have this progressive loading
and the baseline loading stuff but we
would probably skip this because the
image will upload would not be a lot
heavy so we would not want
to have any sort of floating to this
then preview we are already making use
of then would resize you can actually
resize the image as well now the
difference between preview and resizing
is that preview would actually scale the
image as well so if your image is
actually not square and if you specify a
square dimension then it would stretch
it out or whatever but resize will
actually resize it as well
you can just try this out on any of the
image right here as well or you can just
upload your image as well then we have a
lot of other six as well for example the
stretch and set fail and enhance we can
just get this enhance effect right here
and all these effects are separated by
this - then the effect name and then
probably the value of that effect if it
is there so it saves us that the default
values 50 and ranges from 0 to 200 let's
just make it 200 and then finally we
have some grayscale effect as well or to
rotate rotate and all that stuff so
let's just go with a grayscale one only
for now we can just do something like
this and just like that and you can
actually nest them as well so you can
have a quality best with and enhance
hundred as well something like that with
the quality best and then a grayscale so
that kind of is really good if you are
developing some sort of lake you can
actually develop a JavaScript API
yourself for this one for example you
can append the effects something like I
don't know it might look something like
effects array or sex object which is an
object of like preview then it has 250
across 250 value and then quality type
test and then you can just I create over
this object and relatively append every
value of the brief
and we just leave this text like for
example we have grayscales
as true or maybe just leave it now
because it does not have any parameters
associated with it so yeah you can just
go ahead and do that if you are actually
developing an application which parses
your user uploaded image and shows
different sort of effects but right now
I'm just going to keep it to for only to
take a look and now if you finally go
ahead and upload some awesome images and
see how this looks like so we got the
gallery ready and there you can see we
have this original image then we have
the second one as the best quality image
which is this one the third one looks
better which is enhance of 100 and the
fourth one is the quality based and
grayscale which is exactly what it is
and we can actually inspect these
qualities as well if you go to the
network's tab and switch it to images we
can see that in case of best its twenty
point nine in case of best and 100%
enhance its 25 point three in case of
grayscale is fourteen and the original
image is 11 kV is only so yeah that
would not matter a lot on small images
like this one but if you're hosting a
lot of images and a lot of other images
then this kind of really eases out your
process and makes it a lot more
efficient to work on the code itself
instead of just managing effects and
images all around so yes that's pretty
much it how you would develop a very
basic application with the angularjs and
PHP in place and using this upload gear
API as well so yeah that's all for this
one and if you like this then please

for watching and see you them in some
