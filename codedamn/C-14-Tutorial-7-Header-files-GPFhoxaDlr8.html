seventh C++ tutorial in which will be
discussing about something called a
header files which we have been
including in our code since seven
tutorials but I haven't explained in
world so header files as you can see on
the wave force land hash include
iostream is a file which we need to
include in our code you simply make it
work now why this is required the reason
goes back 30 years so around 30 years
back when and then it's richer you
develop see then at that time the
technology wasn't so much developed so
you know the performance of the
computers was not up to the mark so it
was necessary that the unusable code
should be kept apart and the code which
is only required should be brought in
the use so by the means of these files
what we are basically doing is we are
just including required good in our code
and thus reducing the dependencies so
though this were the file this was the
system developed by dennis ritchie for
see it was inherited in c++ as well so
about header files what they do is they
give you access to a bunch of glasses
and codes which is already written
inside your C++ compiler so for example
I've stream which we have been using
gives you access to see in and see out
and many more others so using iostream
header file it could actually accept
accept the user input and show it as
well so that's one way of using iostream
then we have something called map which
we write as math dot edge and see
II bad knob since we are doing c++ then
we'd right it's the C++ way so we would
use see map but without any dots ok so i
guess i must tell you guys i should tell
you that and see what we used to do is
we used to a penndot edge to every file
which stands for header file now this is
not required really required and C++
compilers though I guess modern
compilers would still support it if you
do dot edge here but anyways it's not
required so we'll just leave that for
now so see Matt what it does is it would
give you a bunch of access bunch of
functions to access like you could
calculate the log of two numbers you
could easily calculate the round off a
number of floating point number two
upper limit or you could actually flow
down the number or you could generate a
random number or whatever you like to do
so see Matt would gotta give you access
to mathematical functions which we use
quite often like trigonometric functions
or logarithmic and integration
differentiation or whatever so one
library is see map now another one I
would like to talk with you guys is the
string one now string one is a special
one as I guess I told you guys that in C
and C++ by default there's nothing like
string datatype inbuilt so we have int
yeah float double what I'm missing ntr
float double
yep that's pretty much it so we have
mainly these four so and is individually
as you know ers characters fluid is
integer with decimals and double is a
bigger container or individual with
decimals so we don't have any type of
strength so inside memory how they are
stored is like for example when you are
storing a character then character takes
one byte of memory so right here if you
have this as a memory representation
though it is not like this which is
which I have drawn here so the character
would be stored something like this in
the memory so this every block is one
bite and an integer would be stored
obviously in binary so for example if
you are storing to then how would it be
stored it will be stored like 000000 and
right here and I guess this should be
one so that's how an integer would be
stored and it's not exactly how it would
be stored actually there are around 30
20 SB for this one or I should say
rather 31 because all the other zeros
are used whenever a larger number is
stored and these all numbers are in the
powers of two so this number is 2 raised
to the power 0 in 20 plus 2 raised to
the power 1 into 1 plus 2 raised to the
power 0 2 raise to power 3 in 20 and so
on so let's just not talk about this
because the whole other than others
chapter so what we were talking about is
the string 1 now with the include string
library or hit a file what we can do is
we can make use of strings just like we
used to make use of the
or number types so let's say I create a
net variable string name and I do see an
name as the out hello name so let's try
to run this program let's enter my name
and as you can see it says me hello mijo
now it is not possible with a character
for example if you type gap your name
and then you see in name and hello name
now what would happen is since name is a
character it would just take one letter
and then it will quit so the subsequent
information which we are entering is
thrown away so you see that it only
gives me hello em instead of hello mail
so in this case what we can do next is
create an array of characters which is C
style but we would make use of string
which is C++ style so this makes life a
lot easier and simple to use because
with clear definition what string is and
with the string data type we could
actually manipulate this string with a
lot of inbuilt methods this string file
provides us so overall I would say that
you should better use string over
traditional character strings because
you know they are not just safe to
handle with some null bytes we should be
talking soon so I guess these much
introduction to header files would be
simple enough for you to start with C++
and in the next tutorial Abbott possibly
discussing you about namespace which we
have been using this line so far so
that's all for this tutorial I'll see
you next time so don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
