to your 16th angular 2 tutorial in which
we'll be starting off with routing in
angular 2
well routing is basically just adding
some sort of code which would allow you
to use not only your single page for
writing all of your HTML on it but you
can just split your content and just
distribute it on multiple pages for
example let's just say we have this web
application ollie
which is a shopping application and you
want to display a sort of a cut to the
user where the user can see whatever he
has added into his shopping list so far
so what you can do is you can just go
ahead and the user can go ahead and
write the website comm slash cut well
obviously you can also provide a link
for that
so whenever user clicks on that link the
webpage is redirected to this one and
the user is automatically shown all of
the items which have been added into his
or her car well we have already done
that actually but on a single page only
so we can actually just take the score
and they get to a different page but how
would then we recognize that the user is
on this web page well to do that we need
to make use of some routing bundles or
the JavaScript libraries which provide
routing but angular 2 already comes with
routing with itself but you need to
include a bit of files to make that work
so why go with something else when we
have routing already available in
angular 2 so that was a quick overview
of what angular 2 routing is and in this
tutorial I'm just got a set of routing
so now we can just kick start with it
from the next tutorial onwards so if you
look at the documentation of angular 2
the routing path is quite rich in
documentation it's a lot of explanation
a lot of go
stuff going on here and they have also
created one of their own applications
with the angular 2 so you might want to
check that out as well
otherwise you can just stick with this
tutorial because eventually we are gonna
cover all of that so first things first
let's go back to the top and from
overview
we have nothing to do much here the
basics is that we need to include a
bundle which would then allow us to use
the routing so without this we cannot
you make use of routing so this is sort
of an absolute URL right here so we
might find a relative one down somewhere
so again the next thing is the base href
so this base at shrift if you don't know
what this is this is quite an
interesting thing what this would do is
it would just set local you can say a
local path which all the files would
follow if they are set as absolute so
what I'm trying to say here is like if I
copy this base hf inside my index dot
HTML and let's just say i add up as a
directory to this base its ref now
probably my site would be crushed by now
and the reason is that if you take a
look here all of the URLs are shifted to
app so all of the absolute URLs for
example anything which was previously
making use of these absolute URLs are
now actually predicted as something like
this localhost / app / so it looks like
that everything has moved in a app
folder but they are not actually so if I
added this ad right here and if I remove
this even this right now so again my web
site is crashed for now but inside the
network star if I look in the CSS we can
see that style dot CSS is loaded
perfectly and the reason is that even
though the CSS folder
is nowhere in the vicinity of this index
dot HTML but still we have this CSS
slash style dot CSS ready because we are
already looking into the our folder so I
can just revert back all the changes I
have done here and there you go now
angular just recommends us to write this
basics ref is equal to slash so that it
might help angular routing module a bit
I don't know why they can't just do it
themselves but if they want us to then
here we go so just make sure you are
base hits ref of slash so that
everything points from the root to the
directories and subdirectories all right
now it just says uh some sort of
configuration or let's just skip over
that for now let's just jump over to the
area where they provide the files so
here we are so this is their file
section and again we can see that we
have a main dot ts file just like the
angular guys so we need to include this
route provider so I'm gonna just copy
this inside my main dot TS better add
semi-colons there then again we have the
route providers inserted and we are also
bootstrapping it with our application so
here we go then again we don't have a
lot of components right now created but
inside our dot component or TS which are
which is our component or indexed or TS
we can see that these guys aren't
pulling some sort of route configuration
we'll be taking a look at that what that
is and how that works so I'm gonna
import that again and down here they are
making use of route config but I'm just
gonna keep it blank for now
we don't have a lot to do for now and as
you can see this kind of looks like they
are specifying a path then a name and
then a component so this might look
familiar with the angle of one if you
have done that
so for mean we are done these are the
components and for the index we need the
basic chef it's done and the router
library so is this actually a level I
guess it is otherwise they might have
provided or absolutely URL which was the
director angular 2 bundles route true ok
so this is my default available when we
just NPM we did end BM install to the
angular 2 so we can just go ahead and
write that right straightaway right here
so we have set it up the angular 2
routing bundle as well and if I look in
the page we don't see pretty much errors
so that means we have set it up the
routing perfectly so that's how you
basically set up rounding and all we
have to do now is to add some sort of
magical code inside the shroud config
and we'll be good to go so that's all
for this one and in the next tutorial
we'll be covering about more about
routing and how that works so thank you
