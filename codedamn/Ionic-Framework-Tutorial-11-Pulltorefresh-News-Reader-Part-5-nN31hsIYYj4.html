IR tutorial in which I'm gonna add
another thing known as the ion refresher
and what it's gotta do is like you used
to have like if you have used Gmail
application then I usually use that and
in almost all application these days
like Facebook or Twitter or you know
what not what they give as an option is
that when you stretch this down a little
bit and release it at sort of text here
comes pull-to-refresh and the things are
refreshed down here so let's just create
something like this for our application
as well so this is ion refresh your page
right there you can just google this tag
if you want to copy it then I'm gonna
just scale it up a little bit and as you
can see ion refresher would go above
everything so I'm gonna add ion
refresher just after ion content and
right here I'm gonna say this - pull -
probably refresh would be good so just
make this look like a bit better so we
have this do refresh again you can just
copy this down function I'm not going to
change the name of the function you can
change if you want to then we have this
do refresh function in AB dodges and oh
let's just get rid of this yeah so again
we need to create a function like that
now again I want scope the do refresh
what it should do is probably get some
new news articles from the page right
there this one
and then just append them on the top of
this array so this will probably work
but I was thinking that once it is
appended then which Li last ID should be
used the one which is already present or
the one which is being served by the
browser right there so to avoid this
thing what we can actually do is that we
can actually just refresh this whole
list without any creating any nuisance
so what we can do is actually just
inside this do refresh I'm going to
copy/paste this whole code right there
and we need this code of line so I'm
gonna leave it for now and here we go so
I'm just gonna say dude then and right
here what I'm gonna do is instead of
this I'm gonna say right here school dot
News is a blank array and this should
pretty much work let's just see if it
does and what I'm gonna do is let's just
keep it down there and if you go down
and down this works like a charm and if
I now go up and just drag this up a
little bit you can see our nice little
pull to refresh icon and as you can see
it probably works but it doesn't look
like it's working because in short isn't
that fast for you know updating their
newsfeed so it might update in an hour
or something or maybe in a couple of
minutes or ten to fifteen minutes who
knows so what we can do is actually just
pull to refresh this and new items would
be load
and again if there are no new items then
obviously the older ones would stay
because all of these items are actually
fetched directly from this website you
can see the title the same the second
one is same as well so this is one of
the benefits of making a PHP API out of
this one so on an actual device this
would kind of look nice so I could just
probably change this newspaper to news
reader which is our actual application
name and this one to be positive here we
go looks better now so this is our
complete final application which is the
news reader and again I am saying that I
won't make the PHP script which I am
using for this project public because
obviously what we are doing is sort of
not allowed by the Terms of Service for
this website so currently the script is
live at godamm slash files code am slash
news PHP and this would accept a get
request only from local host and port
number eight one zero zero so if you
want to make use of this you can just
try it out on your you know your web
browser in your ionic application so
that's pretty much it and if you like
