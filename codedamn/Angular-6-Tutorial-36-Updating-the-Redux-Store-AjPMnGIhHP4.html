May ho and welcome to your 36th angular
6 tutorial and which we're going to take
a look at how to update the radix tour
and basically get the changes once we
update that so let's get started alright
so you know that to update the redux
tour we need to dispatch some actions
some like these which we had created
earlier so let's see how we can
basically dispatch this thing and see
that if the subscription gets an update
or not so let's just say I am on this
page and hit login
and once I'm successful I want to update
this state right here so first of all
let's just register with some admin one
two three and one two three
admin one two three its summit there we
are now if I write admin one two three
admin one two three there we go you have
no code bad when one two three
cool I just log out alright it looks
good now what I want to do is actually
update this thing so that we get the
State DOT user as admin one two three
when I login with that to do that what I
need to do is basically just go to my
login component here and see that what
happens so okay so let me just real
quick plug my Mac and first
okay so what happens now is we get the
user details and up data is successful
then we basically just redirect the user
to that particular place so if we take a
look at the tire again you see that we
get this dot or dot set logged in us
true what I can do else with this is
this dot user dot login user this user
dot let us say update state and I can
just basically say I can say something
like action is or what I can say yep I
can do that I can directly write the
action here I can say actual login here
we just updated that so what I can do is
basically this right here private user
user service and I can say I can create
this update state stuff here all right
cannot find user service weird if I try
it one more time there we go so now we
just need to basically create this
update state method inside this user
service so let's just create one real
quick update state what I'm gonna do now
is say this that store does select which
is our store right now a producer dot
dispatch and right here what I'm going
to do is since you are getting the
action here or are we you're getting the
action in the form of an object so let's
just do that Ollie so now we have access
to the action and I can basically just
dispatch that action in the form of
something like
is action and I could just add my
payloads here if I want but I guess our
reducers are not really into handling
the action dot payload or something like
that right now so yeah that's basically
it and what we can do now is basically
when this thing runs what happens is
what we can do right here is actually
just say one more thing
login true and user I can say action dot
payload right and here now we can make
use of the payload thing here payload is
what we just need to get this thing here
as an object check that action
I'll check dot payload just like that
right and right here inside my login
component I would pass the payload as my
username so I'm gonna say I'm not sure
from where I get that so let's just
first of all see how we get admin one
two three one two three summit take a
look at the console log in okay so we
are getting just success through here
but what we want to actually is
basically okay so we are getting the
data here as well on the data call we
can basically update this
or actually we have access to be
username anyway so we can do it right
here only so there we are and it updates
our state to the payload our payload to
the username and finally our state
contains that particular name of that
user once that's fired what happens is
that this thing is updated and our State
DOT user gets updated so if you take a
look here inside our a producer our
reducer is guest for now and if I
basically just try to figure out my
cookies here and reload this thing so
what happens now is if I log in like
admin 1 2 3 and then 1 2 3 hit summit
you should see that our header
automatically gets updated now this is a
cool thing about Redux you see that
there was no communication whatsoever
between the header component and the
login component but still they were able
to communicate with a single stone now
this is powerful and keeps things
organized as well nice you just want to
basically update the state whenever the
logout button his head what we can do
it's basically simple now we can say
something like user is null and login is
already false so then we can dispatch
this action of let's just say what we
have in here
okay so what we can do here is basically
say when I hit you log out button here
this dot user god where we have update
state action this action log out and our
payload is now basically so now if you
just reload this you see that we have
guessed right now because at the first
load we are not checking the users
logged in or not if I log off now I log
in had men want to I've met one two
three and one two three hits summit I
get hello and one two three I log out I
get guests so you can see that basically
it's very easy to communicate between
the header component and other
components and this is just a very basic
example now to fix this thing what we
can do is basically just like earlier
what we are doing here is that we are
performing a check inside our odd
service or inside a user service I don't
really remember that I guess it's odd
okay so I'm not really sure where we are
checking whether the user is logged in
or not so whatever we wherever we are
checking this what we can do is in that
same place we can update this thing as
well and our store would show the
updated values so basically you can take
that as an assignment the cool of this
tutorial up to this tutorial would be up
on github so you can check the link in
the description if you want to try this
out and yeah that's all for this video
