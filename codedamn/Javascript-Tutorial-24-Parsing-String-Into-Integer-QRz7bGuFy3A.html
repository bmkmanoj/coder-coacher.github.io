JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
we'll be learning how you parse a string
into a number with JavaScript now there
are some methods we can use to pass a
string into an integer or a number or
any float number and this tutorial will
see which one of them is the fastest and
how we can use them and why you should
use them basically so coming to the
question what is the need of parsing
string into an integer this is needed
because sometimes when we accept the
input from user in the real world
application then we don't know whether
the user supplied a number or any string
a random string so to validate against
that number or string and take
appropriate actions we need to check
whether the string is number and if it
is number then we need to pass that
string as number so first of all let's
create a string which is actually
holding a integral value let's say X is
whole length 100 or maybe some former
value like 2 raised to the power of 10
once you're - 4 so now let's see each
and every method we have in JavaScript
to convert a string into an integer
and since all the method works the same
we need to use some kind of time check
to see which method is the fastest and
which one is the slowest so for that
I'll use performance stuff now the
reason I am not using console time and
control the time end is because console
dot time is around zero point zero zero
zero millisecond accurate and
performance dot now is way more accurate
than console the time and controller
time and in this code we have a very
very very small time of execution so we
need a better execution time standard
like performance dot now stop coming to
code let's start coding
now here's how you write a performance
not knock wood
now and we'll just console.log B minus a
now whatever we write in between of
these two statement the performance
would not dot now would calculate the
time execution of this script
so let's write first of all try our
first method just write a simple plus
sign in front of the variable you want
to convert into string and then write
the variable name this would convert
this variable into a string literal okay
so let's do perform it stop now again
let's write another method to convert
the string into integer and that being
the formal method of parts and let's
apply the base then now what does this
parameter do in the first parameter we
supply the variable we want to convert
into string
sorry the variable we want to convert it
into integer the string variable
basically and the second parameter or
argument is called as a radical
now what this radical means here is that
we want to pass this integer as a base
10 integer now in computer language
there are many integers like the many
number systems basically like base 10
binary which is base 2 then we have base
8 then we have base 16 and all like that
supposingly this is kind of like it is
like 1 0 1 1 0 1 now supposingly i want
to pass this as a binary instead of just
base 10 then what I'll do is I write 2
here so it specifies that this number is
actually a base 10 number base 2 number
instead of base 10
the default fallback of
radical is based and that means if I
don't write here then this will
automatically be passed as a base 10 but
if there's a proceeding zero or X or
like something which is symbols to
another integer like base 8 then this 10
would be basically the second argument
would be like base aid instead of base
10 okay so coming back to code let's try
it once you're to 4 here and let's close
the performance talk now let's
console.log the time B minus a and the
third thing okay we just multiply the
strength with one I guess I got to
sequel just right here okay let's
let's console life Lord this type be no
keep myself
perfect now we have got this window
right here and I'll try to refresh this
let's see what it got here now this
first metal right here the plus x1 takes
16 points something milliseconds in this
run if you refresh this is kind of
variable so this method takes around
like 16 milliseconds or 10 milliseconds
basically somewhere between 8 to 16
milliseconds to pass this integer so
this is the slowest then if we refresh
this page again and again we could see
that sometimes this number these numbers
are 0 and sometimes this number are
greater than 0 so what does that mean is
these these two methods are so efficient
that performance start now even
performance dot now don't have any
integers to represent the total
execution time took by these two methods
so basically try avoiding using this
method and in my opinion I usually don't
use this method as well I basically use
parts integer which is a very good and
handy method
and basically it is the proper function
to pass your integer into any price your
string into an integer and we have got
another method which is known as
parsefloat which parses the float
integer okay so you've got this here
running as you can see let's try to
revalue X as something which is not a
number let's see we've got ABCD right
here let's try to refresh this page and
we get not a number not a number and not
a number now the special thing about
this not a number any n is that I think
in JavaScript this is the only type or
something whatever you call it which is
not equal to itself that means not a
number is equal to not a number with
return false and that's quite impressive
if I store not in number in a variable
then it is not equal to itself which is
quite impressive in JavaScript I have
not found anything other than not a
number which is not equal to itself but
as usual this was a quick tip the main
tutorial was on passing the integer the
string into integers so if you follow
with me then I would say that console
the parts in method is the best method
to pass strings into integer
so that's all about passing strings to
integers and I'll see you then in the
next tutorial
