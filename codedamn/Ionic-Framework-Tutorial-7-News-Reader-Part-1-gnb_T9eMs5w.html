May ho and welcome to your seventh ionic
tutorial in which will be finally
starting off with simple ionic
application for your mobile devices and
yeah so this is the first tutorial for
that and I remember I told you that
we'll be creating a Dammers file
uploader kind of application but I
realize that I won't be able to get you
a lot of concepts with this application
so I have thought about this for a while
and I have decided that we'll continue
this project but with a different
application and our application would be
probably like a news feed which would
just gather us the latest news the
latest happenings in the world cut off
from a website now I am making use of a
website known as in shots this is a
website basically this is a very nice
app for Android and iOS and it basically
just keeps you updated about all the
information and all the news going
around in the world and before starting
this tutorial I would suggest you to
listen to this carefully whatever we are
gonna do and this series like I'm gonna
retrieve news from this in shorts
website actually their Terms of Service
kind of say is that this is where it was
you're not allowed to modify or copy
adapt communicate distribute publish
download or store any of the contents of
in short app so kind of we are you know
just not following the Terms of Service
for this website but since this is for
educational purposes I don't think that
the administrator would mind a lot so I
would highly highly recommend you to do
not make use of any code I teach you in
the product
that is that you don't take it live with
your own application or you know your
own website by scraping data from
insurance I highly recommend you not to
do this if you do that you will you know
be at risk because of your own things so
my job was to inform me about this again
do not make use of this code which we
are going to do in this whole miniseries
in the production server so that being
said just practice this code if you want
on your computer or you can just simply
watch the videos as well so I have
actually created a simple API which kind
of retrieves data from this inch short
website from this read now page
basically so I have spent about and a
half an hour to you know just all of
these articles you see right here I have
basically created a simple PHP API out
of it because in shots does not provide
us with a you know API obviously because
the Terms of Service say is that so this
is the API which I have on my server
code damn so for now this is file score
damn slash news dot PHP so this API
basically what it does is that it would
just retrieve the latest news from this
page only which is right now this
ensures a and greed
so the first new distrito Lords goalies
match winning or NOK versus Australia so
you can see that this is the first title
and we have the next news as Easter top
trend Google as you can see so this is a
sort of API then we have this last ID as
a parameter and the use of this would be
that when you click on load more some
more news loads down here so you can get
those news by supplying a last ID
parameter now I would not be showing you
guys
how I made this API you know if you know
PHP then obviously you can make this as
well because it's not you know that much
difficult but I'm not going to expose
the PHP code for this API so you can
make use of this code down calm slash
files code down
slash news dot PHP for as an endpoint as
long as you know I just don't get a
threatening email from this website well
if you just you know just try it for
educational purposes then there would be
no problem at all
so what we are going to do in this
application is basically with the help
of angular and ionic will be retrieving
the news the latest news from this URL
because I have simplified a lot of
things by creating a simple JSON API out
of this news thing and contains pretty
much all of the things like image which
is same image which we have in the
Articles right here you can see this one
right there then we have the title as
well then time as well the time of
posting the date as well then content
and then link to the full article so
this kinda just makes sense for a news
strip for your application so what we
are going to do is we're going to
retrieve this API we are making we're
going to make use of this custom API on
go down and then we'll just customize
the looks a little bit and add the
functionality that whenever somebody you
know just clicks it then it the new page
is opened and probably a browser for the
user on mobile and then we might
consider adding an infinite scroll what
it would do is when you just kind of you
know just read at the end of the page it
would automatically get some older news
and that would be on the basis of this
last ID thing so this would be kind of
what we are gonna do so once we visit
this page we have the older news now's
so these news were are the next two
a previous news so this is equivalent of
clicking the load more button down there
so I've created a simple API out of this
so yeah so that's all we are gonna do
for this application and we'll be
starting off with programming with this
application from the next tutorial
onwards so if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
