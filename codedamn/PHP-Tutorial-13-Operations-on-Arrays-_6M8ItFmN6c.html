from Gordon calm and in this tutorial
we'll be looking at operations on Aaron
now these operations are really common
and it would help you do have a strong
grip on Ares and it's working so let's
take a look at what you can perform with
RS so let's see if you want to push an
element inside this area now usually
people would suggest you to make use of
re and push our array pop to remove the
elements but there's a much nice and
clean way to do that and I have a guess
always use that and that is to type the
name of your array and in front of that
only type 2 square brackets and type in
equals 2 and type the name or the value
whatever you want to push let's say wow
let's say let's just keep this for for
each my array as E echo okay so let's
take a look at this let's change it to
13 so you see that we got HTML CSS
JavaScript PHP ajax and well because we
pushed that now in your array you could
even delete elements on the basis of
index so on the basis of index what you
can do is you could make use of
something called unset now unset would
eventually remove your element but the
index would remain same for restaurant
elements for example if you do like
unset my array 0 and you want to run
this loop then what you'll get is CSS
JavaScript PHP ajax and well but you
must remember that since you have
unseated my RS 0 that it
HTML has been removed it's not that your
CSS is now at position 0 it's not that
thing CSS is still at position 1 but
since we didn't have any 0th element so
in forage we didn't got that so if you
run that in 44 i equals to 0 as less
than we have five right here i plus plus
I'm not five I guess it's 40 no is five
Foley ok so let's run echo my RA I let's
reload this so you see that inside the
for loop we got this error notice
undefined offset 0 this is because we
have already inserted this 02 elements
so we need to run it from the first one
and since you can see this doesn't push
the elements after it is removed so it's
like null here now add is at zero and
then 12 so basically zero the element
doesn't exist so your indexing is
actually starting from 1 all right so
let's just keep it here only so now
let's say that you want to remove an
element with the help of its name so
let's say I want to remove JavaScript I
don't know it's where it is placed or
what its indexes so we can make use of
something known as a day search now add
a search would eventually return the key
of that element which you want to search
so let's say if I want key is array
search needle and haystack very good
sublime text so the first argument is
the thing you want to search which is
scale of needle and haystack is your
array so if I type my array oh my area
under here
so this would return me the index number
of that particular element which I'm
dealing with so now i can again unset
the my array and the key so that's
pretty much works the same let's reload
this so you see that we got okay so as
we started with one here so we've got
HTML CSS and then we go out an error
because undefined offset to then PHP
then Ajax now that is why i recommend
that the for each loop because it is
specifically made to work with our is so
it can handle all that stuff so we could
eventually try that for my array as I
and just take wise so it will deal with
all the errors and would present us with
a nice little errand so that's it for
this tutorial and the next tutorial
we'll be starting off with something new
