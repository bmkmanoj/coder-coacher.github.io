Mohan from Gordon calm and in this
tutorial we'll be looking at operations
on Aaron now these operations are really
common and it would help you do have a
strong grip on Ares and it's working so
let's take a look at what you can
perform with RS so let's say if you want
to push an element inside this array now
usually people would suggest you to make
use of array and push our array pop to
remove the elements but there's a much
nice and clean way to do that and I have
a guess always use that and that is to
type the name of your array and in front
of that only type to square brackets and
type in equals two and type the name or
the value whatever you wanna push let's
say Wow let's say let's just keep this
for for each my array as II echo okay so
let's take a look at this let's change
it to 13 so you see that we got HTML CSS
Charles for PHP Ajax and Wow
because we pushed that now in your array
you could even delete elements on the
basis of index so on the basis of index
what you can do is you could make use of
something called unset now unset would
eventually remove your element but the
index would remain same for rest of
elements for example if you do like
unset my array zero and you want to run
this loop then what you'll get is CSS
JavaScript PHP attacks and Wow but you
must remember that since you have unset
that my RS 0 that is
steamin has been removed it's not that
your CSS is now at position zero it's
not that thing CSS is still at position
one but since we didn't have any zero
element so in forage we didn't got that
so if you run that in for for I equals
to 0 is less than we have five right
here I plus plus are not five I guess
it's four zero no it's five fully okay
so let's run echo my re I let's reload
this so you see that inside the for loop
we got this error notice undefined
offset zero this is because we have
already inserted this zero two elements
so we need to run it from the first one
and since you can see this doesn't push
the elements after it is removed so it's
like null here now odd is at zero and
then one - so basically zero element
doesn't exist so you're indexing is
actually starting from one all right
so let's just keep it here only so now
let's say that you want to remove an
element with the help of its name so
let's say I want to remove JavaScript I
don't know it's where it is placed or
what its indexes so we can make use of
something known as our a search now add
a search would eventually return the key
of that element which you want to search
so let's say if I want key is re search
needle and haystack very good sublime
text so the first argument is the thing
you want to search which is call of
needle and here stack is your array so
if I type my array my area under here
so this would return me the index number
of that particular element which I'm
dealing with so now I can again unset
the my re and the key so that's pretty
much works the same let's reload this so
you see that we got okay so I guess we
started with one here so we got HTML CSS
and then we go out an error because
undefined offset 2 then PHP then a
Jack's now that is why I recommend that
the for each loop because it is
specifically made to work with arrays so
it can handle all that stuff so we could
eventually try that for my array as I
and just equai so it will deal with all
the errors and would present us with a
nice little errand so that's it for this
tutorial and the next tutorial will be
starting off with something new so don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
