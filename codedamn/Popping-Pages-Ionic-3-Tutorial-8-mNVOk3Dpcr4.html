Mabel and welcome to your eighth ionic
tutorial in which you're going to take a
look real quick how we can actually pop
this page from our stack without
actually making use of this back button
already provided by ionic so again this
is cool if you implement this ion navbar
ionic would actually provide that back
button but somehow if you do not want to
implement this ion header and all that
stuff you're going to get rid of this
but how do we go about going back to our
main page now because it doesn't
actually have any sort of control and
nor URL as well so to do that what we
can do is we can pop out of this we
using again the nav controller so we can
again say button ion button and this
time color primary and right here we're
going to say something like go back and
yes that should do it
inside our first our tight script we're
going to do is actually refer to the nav
controller whenever we click this button
right here and we can say that on
clicking we can just say Bob this so
once we click this I'm going to say pop
this and I'm going to say this dot nav
control again this is the same
navigation control we used in the last
video and I'm going to say dot pop so
this pop would pretty much just pop the
activity which is the page which is on
the top of the stack and right now it's
on we are on the same page so it would
just pop it out and should take us back
to the main page so if we save this and
wait for it to build we should see
something like if we click on this we
click on this go back you can see that
we can pretty much go back in our
application so it might be useful if
you're creating a form right here and if
you want to say go back to the main
activity then you can create that sort
of button so that's all for this one and
if you like this then please don't
forget to subscribe
and I've got my patreon link in the
description as well so if you want to
check that out
we'll be great so that's all for this
and again I'm going to see you then in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
