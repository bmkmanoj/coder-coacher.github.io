and welcome to 32nd angularjs toriel and
in this tutorial we'll be continuing
with our creating toodles application in
angularjs part 4 so so far what we have
bettors we have almost completed our
application which allows us to add some
tasks and mark them as complete which
applies a little CSS to that so that's
pretty much what our application is
doing for now so in this tutorial what I
want to do is I want to show you guys
how you can create or how you can change
these static tasks to editable tasks so
for example a user misspelled the task
at the time of entering that and wants
to edit that then instead of removing
the task itself and writing the whole
task again you could simply edit it here
after watching this tutorial so let's
get started now to achieve this thing we
have a couple of approaches the first
one is that you create a cost input type
here this one and keep it hidden somehow
would CSS and then you just populate it
with one task dot task message and then
bind it with the same thing instead of
this what we can do is we can simply
move this out
right here and I'll simply write
ng-model one task but task message now
what I can do is whenever this receives
ng double-click and I hope this is
something I want to content edit now
whatever this and receives a double
click I want to make this span tag
content editable and we can easily do
that with JavaScript or what CSS as well
now I guess not what CSS but here we can
make that where the JavaScript or we can
make use of the content editable HTML
attribute let's try this out so I would
like to register another function here
scope dot content edit is a function and
what I want to do is I want that event
dot target wherever this is clicked
but content editable this is the
JavaScript property and why don't we
just added here
and we can just do our cleaner approach
would be
okay so what I'm trying to do here is
first of all I resisted a double freak
even on the span tags so this function
fires off whenever there is a double
click on the span and inside this I'm
receiving this plan as even the target
and content editable is a HTML attribute
which I can get access to with
JavaScript as well so I'm just
triggering or just toggling this so
whenever this double-click and if this
is false then it will turn to true and
if it is true then it will turn to false
let's just take a look if that works or
not let's just add a task let's just see
for any error messages okay
let's just console.log something
okay so the evens firing but property
isn't changing
all right let's do some debugging
okay so we are getting hold of writing
that shouldn't be a problem and what
about this property right here
okay so we are getting everything right
then oh okay okay I guess this is being
treated as a string okay so okay
nevermind let's just follow the
conventional approach if or just let's
just say bollocks is bootlegs as false
then they should be true otherwise be
false
now that's a neat shorthand for that
okay we still have some problems I guess
okay oh now I guess we all can do that
like that so let's just directly operate
upon that because bollocks is actually
storing that value it's not working with
that Dom child anymore I should have
realized that I left that let's see okay
so I guess I got a text editor here all
right so that looks cool
now we need to style this a little bit
so if it let's see if we can do
something about that now this is content
editable so what we can do is we can
just expand content it's true then I
just want a turn background a little bit
of gray the pairing of three pixels so
that the user is just aware that the
editor has gigged and so you see now I
can edit the task and hit enter but
nothing happens because we have not
registering for the intro event yet
okay so with this content editable false
ng double-click and ngmodel
now we have to make use of a ng key up
as well here but we'll do that in the
next tutorial because it's already eight
minutes for this one and that's it for
this one and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
