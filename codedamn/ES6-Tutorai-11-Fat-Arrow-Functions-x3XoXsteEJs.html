hole and welcome to your 11th egg my
scripts 6 tutorial in which I'm gonna
show you how you can make use of
something known as fat arrow functions
in Equus crypt 6 now with this es6
there's a bit of change in the syntax
and that is that the syntax is a bit
changed for the function declaration and
writing that so let's just say if you
want to add two numbers in JavaScript
then what you'll do is that you'll quit
a function like that function return and
inside here you will just supply with
someone and num2 as the parameters and
you simply return num1 plus num2 easy
enough now what if I want to add the
same code I will rewrite the same core
with ACMA script 6 so what I'll do is
I'll write war add is function and now
we don't need this function keyword with
ACMA script what you need is that here
would go the name of the arguments you
are expecting so this thing right here
would be the same thing here so if I
just copy and paste now once you're done
with the argument stuff you'll need to
write an equal to and then a great a
downside or you just have to make this
arrow I don't know what you call this
graded I'll let Stan then you have to
write your body of your function
definition basically and then you can
write anything you like like var sum is
actually num1 plus num2 and return sum
so you can do something like that so if
I get rid of this and I call this like
that console.log 10:40 load this in my
browser as you can see we get
some as 50 so now you can actually
compress the score even more by getting
rid of this line and just passing num1
plus num2 here now you can if you have
just a single line return you can
compress the score even more how well
you can just get rid of these
parentheses and curly brace oh sorry and
then you can get rid of this return
statement as well and you can just
simply write like that so that is a
perfectly valid it must grab 6 line so
if I just reload this again you can see
that the result is still 50 and that
looks so much compact and nice as
compared to your traditional JavaScript
approach and you can actually just omit
these parentheses as well if you have
only a single argument like if you are
doing something like this where you are
just returning that particular thing
then you can just get rid of that at all
so this is still a function but it
doesn't look like one so yeah so
whenever you have a single argument only
you can get rid of these parentheses
except when you have this rest argument
so now you need to put the parentheses
so if I just reload this 10 20 30 40 all
reload this as you can see I get an RA
out of this so that's how you basically
work with the fat arrow system and ACMA
script 6 and in the next tutorial I'll
be discussing something more about this
yeah so that's all for this one and
