May hood and welcome to your third
WebSockets tutorial in which I'm going
to show you a very basic implementation
or a working of a bit socket and that is
just transferring simple text messages
over the WebSocket right
so this website is WebSocket argh and
this guy has made a simple application
we just shows you how our socket would
work with the help of these buttons only
like you can just connect to the socket
see it says connected and now you can
just send some messages and the server
would echo them out as it is whatever
you send right so let's see how this is
working so if I go to network and switch
this to WebSocket ad we load the page
just calm down a little bit and if I
connect you can see that the socket is
open it's soft type web socket right
there you can see and right here you see
that the headers are not so interesting
and actually they are but you know they
are not familiar like you would see in
HTTP requests so this is a first as a
protocol handshake which happens so that
your server knows that you are the one
who's requesting data and the frames
would be an interesting place for us
because this is the place where your
server messages and the messages you are
sending over the socket would be logged
right so let's see what we have in here
so if I send in like first message and
it said you can see that in green I get
the message which I have sent and you
can see the delay in the WebSocket is in
order of a few milliseconds only not
much
so and this white one is the message
received by the client from the server
right so and the screen one is the
message your client sent to the server
so this is how you basically would debug
a WebSocket because you know you need to
have your network tab opened when you
are first of all connecting otherwise
you would just miss this request and
will eventually miss all these frames so
how do you implement it it's pretty easy
just go to your index or whatever file
open up console and start writing so
let's just say you are sock is new web
socket and then right here you just
specify your web socket so let's just
steal this one right down and scrupulous
and paste it right here and what this
WSS is actually it's a protocol and this
means web socket secure right you can
just omit this s as well if you want but
I'm just going to keep it so just hit
enter and now your socket is really not
Network you would see that you have
actually kind of requested a socket
request but for receiving and sending
messages there's something more you need
to do so if you write sock and dot see
that you have a lot of methods here like
on clothes on error on message on open
and this send and some other interesting
methods and properties through which you
can implement your socket right so yeah
so that's all for this tutorial and if
you liked it then don't really subscribe
and thank you for watching and the next
one I'm going to show you how we can
implement this thing this application
right here without creating so much of a
mess and because
this code looks you know just way too
much for a simple application like this
one so yeah so that is all for this one
and if you liked it then don't forget
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
