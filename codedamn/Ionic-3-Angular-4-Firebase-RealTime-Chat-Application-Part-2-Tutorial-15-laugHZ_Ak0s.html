second part for ionic channel occation
development with the firebase so we have
actually done a lot of things in the
first part itself and we're just left
with a little bit of things for this one
so let's get started so first of all let
me just start off the ionic app by
saying ionic serve and we do have our
stuff ready right here inside sublime
text and if you take a look right now if
you reload this and wait for it to load
actually let's just reload it one more
time because it's not done yet
so let's just wait for it and there we
go now we can reload this one more time
and then we have our menus so we can
write our username and hit login so
first things first we have this problem
of a little bit of padding so what I'm
gonna do is actually let me just get it
right there I'm gonna get rid of this
ion toolbar completely like that and if
we try to log in now we can see that
it's pretty much done
more or less and what we can do is for
the ion input part we can say something
like instead of this we can say ion
input padding left 15 pixels something
like that and you can see that we have
got our padding with that and we can
just say font size is 125 percent so
that our font looks a little bit bigger
right there okay so with that being done
we can now send messages and there's a
little bit of problem I guess so
what we have right here is a sort of
conflict so we can say this is message
content
and right here we can see that for in
our message dot message right obviously
we want this to be right here with both
the classes because that overrides it so
for the message content if you take a
look we do not need to do anything right
now so if you try it again
let login write a message send it we get
our message send but it's still on the
left side so I guess we need to swap
these two or maybe we can just change
the condition right here so now if we
log in one more time we get our messages
we can send messages as well all right
so the next thing I want to do is that
whenever somebody joins the room for
example if I open it ending incognito
tab and I log in as admin and hit login
we can see we get messages from a whole
MPD we can send a message from this
admin as well and we get it right here
but what I want to do is actually first
of all show a little kind of thing here
which just says admin has joined the
room so how do we go about that well
right now you can see that in our chat
database what we are doing here is
inside shadow PS we are assigning data
to messages every time so there could be
multiple ways of doing this you could do
any one anything you like but I can just
keep it simple right now this is not the
best way for a chat application but for
char application like this simple this
dead simple it is kind of the best way I
guess so what we can do is whenever
somebody joins the room we can push a
message to this chat list only but
instead of doing a user name and message
like that
we're going to say a message and then we
just bind a special message property and
we're going to set that to true so what
we can do is the first of all we need to
actually get to know that the user has
actually joined the page or user has
actually left the chat so what we can do
is make use of some ion lifecycle events
so not the native one right here I guess
we have this lifecycle events right so
we have this life cycle list of life
cycle even so we can make use of and
even like ion view will leave so we can
just know that the console dot log user
is about to go so we would just
unregister our subscriptions like this
one and we're going to send a message
that this user has left the room so
first of all let me just make this
subscription as the chat subscription
subscription make sure to spell that
right toward any sort of confusion later
on so this is our chat subscription now
this would allow us to unregister it
later on when the view is being left so
we can say this dot this dot dot
unsubscribe like that and what I want to
do next is first of all when the view
loads I want to say this dot DB dot what
we have right here list and this is chat
and I'm gonna say that
we're gonna not subscribe this time but
actually push it so we're going to push
something like first of all I'm going to
say this is a special message is true
now this would allow us to actually work
inside the view itself to display that
message right so that is why this is
necessary so that we do not have to jump
out of this NG
Ubud all right so we can say the message
as whatever the username is so we can
say something like this don't username
has joined the room and finally for the
view I undo leave as well we can do the
similar thing but we can say has left
the room and finally for that and if we
can take a look if you need to do
anything else right now all right looks
great so for that being done we can
actually move down to our chat HTML file
out and we can say that this is got a
class of message dot special message is
the ecial message if this is true then i
want to say that this is actually
message special otherwise i want to say
that this is just message right are we
going to schedule off this thing okay so
now we will have some sort of control
over these messages so if you take a
look now inside our ionic lab and if you
can just remove the previous chat right
so now if I login with my username head
login we get milem vidiians join the
room and if I login with admin one two
three right here we see that we get
these two messages which is perfectly
fine and valid and what I want to do now
is actually customize them a little bit
so what we can do now is that we can see
that this is our special message so I'm
going to say message dot special and
that for the inner message we're going
to say that this background
is actually transparent color is the or
rather let's just keep it black and the
font size is 80% right and again which
should be 100% float:none text align
Center and yeah that's pretty much it
for that part and what we can do more is
actually you can create before element
right here and we can say that it's
content is nothing I can give it a
height of two pixels we can give it a
background of d'Estaing and we can make
sure this this is display:block we can
actually first of all give it a position
of relative so I can say that this is
top 50% position is absolute left zero
and width 100% and height we have given
us two pixels right so yeah so for this
part we can actually say this is the
rather we can just send it back right
but we would still need some sort of
background there so we can say that this
is the same thing but inside in our
message that message content I'm going
to say that this is background is white
right so that for the message content we
can also say that this is
display:inline-block and padding is five
pixels 0 or rather zero five pixels
okay so now it looks more like it so we
can just copy all these styles now and
go to our
Chad dot a CSS file and paste them right
there
and we should be good to go get rid of
these and there we are
so now if we take a look we can enter
messages like Haider
let's send and they would appear on the
other side as well and the admin has
joined the room so if the admin leaves
the room we can see that admin 1-2-3 has
left the room and if some other admin
like admin for 5-6 joins the room or we
can just send some messages before that
and then the admin four five six joints
you can see that we get admin four five
six has joined the room okay it looks
good and yeah that's pretty much it for
this tutorial and if you want to support
me you can check out the patreon link in
the description and do the needful that
would really help so that is all for
this one again and if you liked it again
