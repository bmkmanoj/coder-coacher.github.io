Mabel and welcome to your day pipe of
making code damn and in this video I'm
gonna show you the code damage right now
and as a community what you have done so
far in order to make goddamn life
as well as possible so let's get into it
so if you take a look right now for the
pull request there's no pull request
from the community which is sad but if I
take a look at the notifications you can
see that I get we have a couple of
modifications regarding code down and
one of them which is adding e-mail
verification from the same guy as usual
native speaker so he says that do you
want to use this e-mail verification
kind of plug-in or we want to write our
own logic to a fire so if we take a look
at this email or education module which
is suggesting me what it is is
essentially okay it can be used to
actually work with the thing I'm telling
him but I believe that would be I
believe it would be easier for us to set
up set it up from the scratch itself so
that should not be a problem so let's
just write a comment
to him so yes you can do it from scratch
Holly because it's kind of easy to work
with it from scratch as I believe
there's just a couple of steps we need
to do so we need to - here is just
basically let him know that I'm going to
use a third body email service so anyway
for goddamn Letran so we can do right
now is you can just use any dummy
account for testing purposes or if you
just want to send emails to users or
registration so what you can do
basically is just create a field in user
schema which is kind of like
verification and education token rather
and off is of type string then you can
generate a random key then you can
generate a random key possibly like md5
of current time for salt and send it as
a confirmation email to the user now we
have something like verify and then
token you will need to create a route to
this above URL and grab the token from
the URL and do a database search for
existing user having this token and set
it to now upon login then I can check if
the Fae fication token is now and the
user user is not verified else the user
is verified so if you need any support
on this let me know because there's a
lot of things to do in this BR alone
and let's just change the tag of this
thing to medium because I believe it's
kind of a lot of things to do and would
be that of time-consuming so let me just
do it real quick here so here we go our
comment goes here and if you add some
issues I had open some issues yesterday
so you can see that - we have some
issues from yesterday like making home
page responsive and add an e-mail
verification is something I just
answered right now so if you take a look
at this making home page responsive
right now we have this query from Nitish
PG again let me just check notifications
real quick if you have anything else no
just this issue
which we already sorted earlier so that
should not be a problem let me just give
a quick comment here on the good work he
has done so good work for this buddy
comment and let me just close this issue
real quick as well there we are
so now if I just go to the making home
page responsive again so you asked me
should we use any CSS frameworks like
bootstrap but you realize CSS or
semantic UI or custom CSS okay right now
I believe that we do not need really
need any framework or CSS framework like
that because um it's actually relatively
simple to set up a site from scratch
right now I don't know we do not really
need to use bootstrap right now on the
main site sure we can make use of it
later on inside something like developer
portal or something but right now I
guess we can just go with one in a CSS
right so I'm just writing this show we
might eat each one and the developer
portal or things like that
let's go neela right now why not so
that's it just comment this thing and
then we are so here we are with all the
issues and stuff basically if I can just
show you the site for now let's see what
the site looks like simple plain old
side we have right here you just delete
my cookies here real first login admin
admin there we go right now I know the
panel looks horrible
trust me it's nowhere near too close
even to the initial version because
panel will not look like this what I
think it might look like is something
like you will have
kind of level zero and stuff like that
here at the middle and then gradually as
you proceed as a user your level ups and
you gain more and more experience with
the programming language you wish to
learn and basically that's it that's how
you become the world's best programmer
don't you want to be one so that's it
for this video for now and I'll see you
then in day six goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
