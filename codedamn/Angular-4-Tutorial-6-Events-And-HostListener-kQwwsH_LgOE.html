Minh hole and welcome to your sixth
angular tutorial in which I'm going to
cover a little about even in angular and
pretty much that's some basic stuff
which we always do no matter what
framework like covering on click and on
mouse intro and mouse move and all that
stuff
right so to declare events what I'm
going to do is make use of the stat
active only so that we can pretty much
set a directive on any element and then
that word that element would get all
those events which we will define for
this particular directive so let's get
started
well we already have a directive this
blue colored set up inside our component
HTML file all right so if we navigate to
our directive file here what we can do
is we can make use of something known as
a host listener right so host listener
is something provided by angular itself
so that you can actually listen to what
happens to the Dom element on which your
directive lives right now to define an
event how would you do that is right
something like post listener a ste area
and again you can just say this is your
own click for instance and then we can
say that do something I'm off we about
to do is we're going to say anything
like a lot it works and again we're
going to make use of input so the host
listener there we go and if you take a
look in the browser you can see if I
click on this this should be a
we just click not on click if I click on
this you can see that we get an alert it
works right and again this is something
year 7 stuff going on here you do not
need to worry a lot about this you know
you can just go ahead and read about es
7 decorators and you would probably get
that but more or less if I explain you
what's going on here is that these
decorators this decorator right here is
actually redefining this do something
function by adding some more value to it
right and value in the sense that you
know on its own this do something is
just a private function of this class
blue color deck directive right but this
host is no clicks behind the scenes bind
this to something to the click event of
the directive on which of the Dom
element on which this directive is used
right so yeah this is all es7 stuff so
we do not need to worry a lot about this
because it is not strictly related to
angular right now then again there are a
lot of other functions like mouth enter
and now is leave and I'm just going to
console.log because it's gonna then
flood me where the loads Mouse just
entered and you can again create another
horse listener and say on Mouse leave I
do something else and Mouse just left
the element and if we take a look I was
entered left enter level actually it
would just alert once for Mouse enter so
you can create like house move and again
something else else you know you can
just name these functions anything you
like it's not necessary so you can see
that we get all these even scroll here
right so that is all very much you
create events using host listener and
bind them to directives actually so
that's all for this tutorial and if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching and in the
next tutorial we're going to cover some
more interesting stuff about angular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
