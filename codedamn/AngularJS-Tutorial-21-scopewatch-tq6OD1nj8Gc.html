angularjs tutorial in which we'll be
looking at something called angular
watch now angular watch is basically
used to watch a variable and okay so in
angular what happens is there's
something called as a digest cycle so
this digest cycle actually runs every
time to check the update to any variable
which is registered in angular so then
now what we have been doing is we go to
the input type text and ng-model of my
text and what we used to do is just in
the two curly braces we used to type
this my text and whenever we reloaded
the browser it magically appeared like
some text here inside this instead of
this my text but how does that actually
work now let me tell you how is this
actually working in angular
so inside these two curly braces when we
type in the name of this ng-model
my text then what happens is in angular
this is registered inside the digest
cycle now every time angular checks for
any updates for variables it checks for
this ngmodel
input type as well and if it founds that
it has been updated from an old value to
a new value it would be updated here
unfortunately in angular you can have
register you can't register every of the
variable or ngmodel here so angular
provides us with an option called watch
now with watch what we can do is we can
actually watch our variable ourselves
and take hold of the JavaScript which
was earlier with angularjs and we could
actually customize it
more so let me show you an example let's
say we have this text box and I want to
know how many times this text box has
been modified now with angular we can do
simply like this so we need to have a
counter and a counter which will watch
this input type so let's see let's give
it a br let's say you updated text box
counter times okay now this counter
would be under our control in the
controller or GS so now let's get the
scope counter let's set it to 0 first
yep now what we want to do is we want to
watch watch now watch on what I want to
watch on my text so whenever my text is
updated or hindered or whatever then
what I want to do is I want to run this
function and this function would be
populated by angular by two arguments
precisely the new value and the old
value now if I do like console.log new
value and console.log old value let's
check out the result in the browser
let's reload this okay I guess we are
missing something because there is no
error in the code
okay oh yeah okay so we didn't create
any controller so this would be good
enough to get us started okay so first
of all we got undefined now I know this
is a little bit confusing so I'll just
append all or new value and old value so
let's let me just show you this one by
one so it doesn't appear in a half a sad
way so it says new value is undefined
let's type one so it says new values 1
new values 12 1 2 3 1 2 3 12 like that
so you see that that's how it works now
about old value let's comment this out
you see that old value is undefined
because obviously nothing is there let's
type a now still old values undefined
now Wireless undefined because a is the
new value now whenever I would type the
next character then old value would be
shown as a because a would be the old
value to that character so when I type B
then it shows me all value is a then I
type some numbers and you see the magic
well that was expected now what I'm
gonna do with this is actually I don't
have any use with new value and old
value for this logic which I am going to
code but you may need to have access to
these two so these are pretty useful if
you need them so I just want to do scope
dot counter plus plus so what it does is
whenever this is hindered or you know
modified or pretty much like edited then
this counter would be updated so when I
reload this it shows me 1 times because
when this starts then the scope dot
watch runs first time and this is the
reason we got all val new value as
undefined in our first run so if I do
like school counter as minus one then
this would fix our error so let's just
update it let's say a b c d e and like
that now this is not a collector counter
if you see that this is not a character
ground even if I'm removing the
characters it's not decreasing the count
value it's just telling us how many
times a character or in this scope not
watch has been called to be very precise
this counter is actually telling us how
many times the scope dot watch is count
for dicks in this example scope dot
watch is count for 100 times and that's
it for this tutorial I hope you guys
learned something about scope block
watch and you have a lot of control here
you could do like if scope dot counter
is equal to unware alert gone low or
whatever you want to have so you see
like if I make it 200 you see I got a
Congo or 99 I hope you know why so
that's it for this tutorial and we will
be learning about more about angular
