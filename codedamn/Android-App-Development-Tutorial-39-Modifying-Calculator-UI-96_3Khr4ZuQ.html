Mei hole and welcome to your 39-hundred
application development tutorial in
which I'm just gonna enhance this layout
a little bit by making use of the Rose
pad on the colspan properties which we
saw in the last tutorial so what I'm
gonna do is I just I'm gonna find this
equal to and move this out and if say
this this should do a call span of 2
right and Android Browdy
to fill here we go and then what I can
do is after this plus I can add equal to
and I can say Android call span to be 3
and then I can say this wide layout
gravity to fill and then finally what I
can do is go to my plus symbol and a
kind of can be confusing Android rowspan
to be to avoid layout Rowdy to be fill
now it looks much better than the
previous one and it looks much like of a
calculator as well
now you can what you can do is you can
just add another text view or you know
an editable text if you want to but I
would just go with text to you actually
because we do have all these supported
buttons here as well and you can create
a clear button here as well if you want
to like if I just take a look here we
have a square root button here as well
so you can just implement that as well
but for now let's just implement a clear
button so this would be another row of
buttons right so this one we clear and
you know just write C E or C whatever
the
then this one could be like I don't know
what there should be square root well
you can just make use of these symbols
as well if you can just copy them from
web or somewhere then I can just
actually just pan these two across two
columns not a very big deal
Android call span to be 2 or actually
let's just make it three and this one
one is good Android layout and then what
I can do actually is that I can pretty
much take this out and add it inside a
linear layout right and change its
orientation to vertical and then what I
can do is add this right here it sort of
looks like there's some sort of problem
Android layout gravity actually out
height as much parent and Android layout
width is much parent as well so what did
I just do well actually what I did is
that I added this inside a linear layout
so as to add a text view here which
could be which could actually just
contain the result of our calculator
Android text text to be like 0.0 and
this could be Android text size to be 30
SP and this would be actually this
pretty much parent and Android text
alignment to be
this one is text end right so it just
sits right there and you can just just
leave that for now you can just specify
some margin as well to the right
actually and to say to ten babies or
maybe 50 so anyways the margin is sort
of not of very much relevance and why
not some padding as well to be 15 DBS
so right so that is how pretty much you
create a very basic layout and you can
again change this to wrap content and
add content and Android gravity to be
centered so you again get it in center
or you can just keep it at top whatever
position you like so that is how pretty
much you create a very basic UI for a
calculator you can just add a border
across it or just align so that it looks
much like something like a result feel
instead of a text view so yeah what I
have done in this tutorial is that
pretty much just customized this layout
a little bit which we had in the last
one and added a text view as well to
support result obviously this is just a
mock-up of what it would look like you
need to add a lot of functionality to
this like the Flex listeners and the
operations and I might implement the
click listeners as well in the next one
so that is all for this tutorial and if
you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
