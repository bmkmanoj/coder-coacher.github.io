Mabel and welcome to your fourth for
ionic framework tutorial in which I'm
going to show you how you can set up
sublime text for ionic applications and
again this is completely optional
tutorial if you want to set up some
other sort of text editor you are free
to go
I just like sublime text so I'm going to
make use of that but you can make use of
any text editor you want or maybe even
an IDE if you want to do so we are on
Mac again and the steps would be again
similar for Windows users you just need
to install sublime text and follow along
so once you have installed sublime text
what you want to do is in your terminal
once you open the directory of the ionic
app you have just write s ub l dot and
it will open the directory in your
sublime text so right now I have all the
syntax highlighting and themes available
with sublime text and a lot of people
ask me about the team so this is not the
team which I use on Windows this is a
material team and I liked it actually
but the one I had on Windows is very
good as well so to install this team
what you can do is hold command shift B
and write install package on Mac and
right here materials team I wouldn't get
that option because I already have
installed that thing so it doesn't show
me that but you should get you should
see an option here which is like team
material team and just install that and
once you do that you will be presented
with this theme okay so next thing is
that once you open any of this type
script file if you haven't configured
your sublime text you would pretty much
see here plain text and there would be
no syntax highlighting to again to make
syntax make use of syntax highlighting
for sublime text type scripts just write
type script here again I have installed
type script in my sublime text so it
doesn't show me that but you would
probably get a type script just a type
script package here where the or
actually is much of B type come on
should be right here install package
sorry install package and then ty
scripts here so you should see a tight
script with the description that it's a
syntax highlighter and all that compiler
but you can just go ahead and install
that and we'll just start showing you
the basic syntax highlighting so yeah
that's all how you would configure your
application with sublime text and the
other matter of fact I can just give you
a pro tip that your application starts
from this index dot HTML so you can
write here hello world just in case you
are trusted and modifying it from the
day one so if we reload this you would
probably not see that right here but you
would see it right here this is the same
index file we have okay so yes that's
all pretty much for this tutorial and if
you liked it then please don't forget to
subscribe and again I have my patreon
link in the description so if you want
to check that out we've go ahead and do
that so that's all for this one and if
you liked it
I can then please don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one
we're going to start with the real ionic
coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
