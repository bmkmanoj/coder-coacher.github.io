Mei hole and welcome to your fifth
Chrome extension development tutorial in
which we're going to take a look at how
we can actually modify or mess around
with the user in real so what we're
going to do is create a little extension
which does some changes on the web and
right now for this extension what we can
do is actually get rid of all of this
because we just need the content scripts
in running and what we have right here
is that it matches every page on HTTP
HTTPS and when that happens I want the
jQuery just fun to run and after jQuery
is ready
I want this my script to run so that we
can actually make use of jQuery inside
my script ok so let's get started so
inside our my script which is nowhere to
be seen because I have changed the
structure a little bit if you see I kind
of removed those two extra folders which
were redundant so this is my script
Egeus and what we're going to do is
actually say that I and every page which
there is an a so I'm going to stay on
click function and I'm gonna say a load
you are about to go to and I'm gonna say
this dot attribute XS and I'm gonna say
just then kind of this could be rated
users right because if you are just
getting in a load every time you are
visiting somewhere it's kind of weird to
accent okay so yeah that is it for our
simple extension and if we take a look
and if I reload this and it sees me
could not load okay I
given up because I have changed the part
and there we go we are alive again so if
I reload this now and click on any link
you see that it saves me or about to go
to even pages just saying it ok we go to
even pages I click on another link and
it's not really a link thing or is it it
is a data list item you're about to go
to manifest just saying you're about to
go to manifest just saying it's kind of
weird and hate dating but that's how
pretty much you can mess around with
users for example you can say like a
doctor set or something like which has h
rift value so handy class this has got H
rift and you can stay body body dot
append style this has got H ref and
actually you can do this with the style
here is that content scripts as well but
I'm just going to go with the jQuery one
for now because it's relatively small so
I'm going to say and we can actually go
ahead and use string literals why not we
can say something like what we have
string literals now so we're gonna say
colors white and background black our
favorite combination right so again if
we reload hit enter and wait you can see
we pretty much turn the page into some
weird page and every link which has the
next riff with it is changed so let's
just find some link which does not so we
take a look it's not a link at all
and there's pretty much no link right
here which does not have an extra and I
guess and does not have regular
expression sourcing yet so yeah we just
modify the page a little bit so yeah
that's how pretty much you can mess
around with the page and change the UI
according to your own wish so yeah
that's all for this one and if you liked
it then don't worry subscribe and in the
next video we're going to take a look at
some more realistic extension because
you know this is kind of a weird
extension to use so yeah that's all for
this one and I'll see you then in the
next vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
