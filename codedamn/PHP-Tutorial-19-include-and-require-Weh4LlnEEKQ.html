and welcome to your 19th PHP tutorial in
which will be looking at include and
require functions in PHP now these two
are very interesting functions in PHP
because they will help you to keep your
code organized and cleaned by separating
by basically splitting all of your PHP
code in different files and not only PHP
you could have like any code so with
this what we can do is we can include
another file inside the main file so
this is kind of a server-side include
server-side include so what this means
is that just like you can see on the
client side you can make use of
JavaScript to get a file with the help
of a JAX in jQuery or in one image is
only with include and require you can
perform a server-side include and you
can include the files from the server
itself so how this is useful let me tell
you so let's say you are creating you
are creating a website which is quite
big so you would have a lot of files
like to start with let's say you have
header dot PHP which contains the header
of your file let's say you have a
sidebar dot PHP which contains the
sidebar off your file of a side then you
have content or PHP and all these files
are dynamic then you have photo dot PHP
then you have some subscribe dot PHP
widgets dot PHP and so on so create a
single page with just like you could say
to create your homepage you would need
all these files to include header
sidebar content now it is not feasible
to go to every file copy its content and
create a new file paste in that go to
sidebar copy its content go to index
based it
content copy index-based that would take
a lot of time moreover let's say if you
want to change your logo then it would
be a nightmare to go to all the pages
and change it so what comes to the
rescue is the PHP is include and require
functions so these two functions what
they would do is they would include a
file automatically so let's say i'll
just create a function here let's say
not a function sorry a file here this is
a demo file let's say I just right here
echo or yeah okay so let's say I just
right here echo div I m in a div and I
save it as a file file dot PHP let's say
so here you go I have the simple file
with file dot PHP and let's say I want
to include this file here so what I'll
do is I'll write include file dot PHP
now when I will run this 19 dot PHP page
you see the 19 1 not the file dot PHP
you see I got diff I'm in div and poor
me I didn't close the baby yet okay so
well that doesn't even make a difference
but anyways so you see here we got the
output as I am in a div on the page 19
dot PHP now this is just looks like just
lame but this is really useful for
example you want to pass some variables
as well so let's say this is your custom
page and you have a like a title here
with this is custom title and you want
to you have the this one the 19 dot PHP
is your site's template and you have
inside HTML PHP echo title so even
though this title variable is not
defined anywhere on this
page but since you are including this
file and title is defined in that file
therefore it would work here so you can
say that variables are automatically
copied into the scope whenever you're
including a file so you see that the
title got changed to this is a custom
title so that's how it works now what's
with require and what's the difference
well if you see then include and require
has one major difference is that and
that is that include would not crash the
good if the file is not found by that
what I mean is let's say I I want to
include a file which does not exist
let's the file dude file to dot PHP and
I have some text here echo this would
run later on so when i'll run this 19
dot PHP script you see that i got a
warning include file 2 dot PHP failed to
open stream no such file or directory
and another warning failed to open file
2 dot PHP and like that but what happens
with require when our type require
instead of include I'll get a fatal
error instead of a warning so anak as
you can see that this line is not output
is not outputted inside in the require
one so when I'm using require as an
example then the code execution is
stopped here so this is stopped SD o PP
ed stop here as soon as file or that's a
bit wrong stopped here if the file is
not found so require stops the execution
of your script if the file is not found
and include would just give a little
warning and would keep the script
running on
now when is required useful and when is
include useful so require is useful most
of the times but you could use include
as well where let's say you have a
website where you're displaying charts
of your employees and let's say somehow
a file gets missing from the server so
you won't like to crash the whole script
because of just a single chart missing
from the server so for in that case you
would like to use Ric include instead of
require but let's say you have file
require transaction lot VHP which
contains all the important variables
like the credit card information or the
CV number or the verification or pain or
whatever and obviously you would like to
immediately stop the transaction if this
file is somehow damaged or it's not
found so these are basically the main
use of require and include this will
help you to keep your code clean and
nice because as the code grows you can
split the code in different files and
then in theorem include the files at
different areas so that's it for this
tutorial and don't forget to subscribe
