hole and welcome to your very first EMC
es Script 6 tutorial or the es 6
tutorial in which are in this whole
series of es6 tutorials we'll be
covering a lot of things about es6 now
es6 to begin with is just the new
javascript which comes with a lot of
features so this is the future this is
the future of JavaScript and in the
coming years this would be standardized
as the standard javascript in all the
browser's but currently it is not so to
avoid any problems while coding in es6
what will make use of is something
called as this tracer compiler now thus
tracer what it would do is that it would
actually convert your es6 code the code
you'll write like this code into
something like this code so this code is
currently you know just you can just
write that in every browser because this
is emc a script 5 implementation and emc
a script 6 code would be compiled by
this tracer and this tracer is a
repository at github and we'll know how
to set it up on our computers in the
next tutorial but what does EMC script
do well it brings a lot of features as I
told you with es6 you can have things
like fat arrow functions you can have
constant declarations like that with a
single keyword instead of just writing
this whole bunch of code then we have
modules we have classes in es6 we also
have spread operators we have new
methods with different kinds of literals
like we have new methods with Ares their
manipulation and all that stuff we also
have a bunch of new primitive data types
and yeah so that is pretty much it we
have a lot of other features as well
with es6 so we'll be covering that real
soon and let's get started with es6 and
if you like this tutorial then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then on the
tutorial number 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
