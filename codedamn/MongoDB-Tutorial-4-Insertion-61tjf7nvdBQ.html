May ho and welcome to your fourth
MongoDB tutorial in which I'm gonna show
you how to properly do an insertion and
getting the data as well and well you
have already seen that hard to do that
but I'm gonna show you how to make use
of a script to do the same right so
inside your script what you have to do
is write DB equals connect and then 127
point zero point zero point one and the
booth number this two seven zero one
seven I guess for the default one and
then your database name right so this is
M DB or let me just first show you how
you can delete your database as well so
just say use m DB which your database
name is you know you can just show DB s
so now you want to delete MD B so use m
DB and say DB s dot drop database hit
enter well not DB s actually got DB not
drop database hit enter and you will see
that show DBS shows none so I'll cool
now what I'm gonna do is simply say use
m DB right here so that it does not kind
of make sure it doesn't kind of appear
in your show DB s so not connect it like
that
in your DB and then what you want to do
is I'm gonna create a function which
says insert data and what its gonna do
is that it's gonna say DV dot M DV dot
insert and actually this is M DB is a
collection it's not necessary to name a
database I can just name it names not
insert and I will just say my object and
right here I would just pass in my
object as well so then I can do function
get data back and inside here now the
equivalent of this for the terminal
would be way too short but for
JavaScript we have to write a bunch of
stuff so I need to say you are cursor is
a DV dot my collection name is my object
no no no it's name actually not find and
then while cursor god has next as next
then I'm going to say print JSON it will
just print a JSON cursor dot next right
so I'm gonna show you that in a moment
how to do that from terminal itself and
that's way too short but it's up to you
what you prefer so what I'm gonna do is
say load square J s hit enter that's set
connecting to this and then it's written
true so what I'm gonna do is write
insert data and then hello to true
write hit enter now I want to get the
data back so get data back hit enter you
can see that I got my data so this is
how it kind of looks like what you can
do is inside here what you can do
instead of calling this get data back
you can just get this data in one line
by saying DV dot m DB not find write
wrong because our collection name is T V
dot name start fine hit enter you can
see that this line and this these three
lines are Kara equivalent actually where
the this name start fine you get one
more advantage and that is you can write
names dot find dot pretty right so when
you write that pretty well actually this
is kind of one-liner
but when you get a lot of code then it
would just show you a mess out of it so
what you can do
I can write insert data and then another
object Wow true now if I say DV dot name
starts fine actually let me just zoom in
you can see it kinda looks like this and
if I say pretty it ain't true
so it kinda looks nothing different but
because it's kind of already readable
and pretty but it would kind of make
difference if the output is all you know
messy and all that stuff so that is how
pretty much you basically retrieve data
and set data as well so if you can see
now these two other records in your
collection and these are actually the
documents and this names is your
collection right so that is how you
pretty much do a basic insert and
getting the data back with the MongoDB
and that is all for this tutorial and if
you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
