28 android application development
tutorial my name is may-who and in this
toriel what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
show you how to real quickly add a click
listener for your individual list items
and it's super easy to do at least
easier than what we have done the last
couple of tutorials so what we need to
do is we need to say first of all we
need to get our list view which we
already have in this my first this view
then what I'm gonna say I'm gonna say
that this my first dispute dot set on
item click my snow right this one you
can try this one as well if you want to
but I'm just gonna go with this one and
say right here new not be new adapter
just hit tap and boom here we go Android
studio does a lot of work for us so see
that we get a bunch of arguments as well
here so the first one is the adapter
view parent then the next one is the
view this is the view which is clicked
right so and then finally we have this
position an ID associated with that so
this position is where this position
where the element is located right which
I told you in the last tutorial as well
that this position position is something
like if you have your phone then this is
your list item one then this is a list
item two then this one is at a position
of zero right and this one is at a
position of one right so so on and so
forth and then what you can do just like
here we did somewhere like that you
can't get that particular element and
then pretty much show it show its
position or do whatever you want to do
with that element right so but instead
what I'm gonna say is just toast dot
make text
and the first one is your message right
so I'm gonna say that this is actually
context main activity does this right
the second one is our message so I'm
gonna say my first ListView item and
probably like that right then the third
one would be the length so I'm just
gonna keep it short and then show a
toast so that is how you pretty much
make a toast or add word if I build the
application again so now when I click on
any of these list items right so this
one is highlighted I don't know what but
if I click on this one you can see that
as get my ListView Adam then my list you
Adam like that so it's pretty cool right
what you can do instead as an assignment
you can say you have to get this
particular element which actually using
its position with something similar like
this one so what you have to do is
pretty much just paste it here and then
you have access to that particular
language we are which you're working on
right so you have then access to all
those things which we have right here in
our languages so you can just play
around with this application try a
little bit and then when you are done
we'll move to the next one so that's all
for this tutorial if you like that then
