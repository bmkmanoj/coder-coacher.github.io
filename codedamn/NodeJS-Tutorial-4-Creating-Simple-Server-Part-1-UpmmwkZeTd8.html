fourth node.js tutorial my name is Mei
hole and and the story L will be looking
at how you create your own server in
node.js or basically how do you just
create your basics first so we're in ojs
so that you can just get the things
started up so in the last tutorial we
took a look at what is required function
and how you can just work with it we're
just some methods and variables hooked
up to the response of the required well
in this tutorial I'm just gonna show you
how to make use of this required
function to import something called HTTP
now this HTTP is a module so this is a
module and we'll be learning what
modules are which may be the tutorial 5
or 6 or whatever well this is for I
guess so yeah so I'm just talking about
the next one so anyways I'll just take a
look and would you know you would
obviously see the videos in the playlist
by now so what is a module we'll be
discussing in this module tutorial but
why the heck haven't I used this thing
right here instead I'd simply made use
of this thing well I told you that I'm
just gonna tell you that in the module
tutorial but hey you know I'm a nice guy
so I'm just gonna you know just quench
your thirst by just what do you know why
I have just written it simply has HTTP
are not a dot slash STP
so in this file what was the case is
that this methods don't chase is our
local module so I'm just making use of
this I can just either make you look
like that I like that well obviously I
would prefer highly prefer using this
approach instead of this one and why the
reason being let's just say let's just
assume that require oh sorry the node
has a official module with a name HTTP
nodejs let's just assume so what happens
if I just create an
you file in here and just name it HTTP
not Jes so when you include it like that
so node obviously doesn't know which one
you are referring to to your own local
module or to the global module which is
available to your script
so that might create conflicts and
irritation as well so to avoid that what
nodejs did is it said that you should
always make use of this to load all of
the modules which are local or basically
which are coded by you so if you have an
HTTP dot JS file here then this would
simply make Nord happy and one would say
that all right so that is a nice cold
line I see there and I'll be happy to
load this HTTP JS file for you and here
you go and blah blah blah and the story
continues so anyways getting back to the
tutorial so in this tutorial what we had
to do is to create a simple server so
HTTP is another module provided by node
and using this you can just create a
simple server and for all of those who
are still wondering what the heck is a
sir well let me just show you a simple
example to demonstrate that let me just
close the unused applications and yeah
so that's pretty much it so let's just
say this is this is my computer which is
the user which wants to visit your site
and let's just say this terminal is your
server so whoa okay so well what the
heck is that
well who knows and who cares actually so
there you go and now what happens is
that this is server and this is
programmed to receive some you know
interaction from remote computers so
what happens is that when you're you
your browser or your computer tries to
access my server my server
a lot of scripts on its own computer
first and all of those scripts are coded
right here so all of these scripts which
I am writing here are just executed on
my server before sending them to the
user so once they are executed and are
ready and basically all of the scripts
go operate and know that yeah we are
going to send this data and we are not
going to send this data to the server
for this request then your server sends
some data to the computer which is
requesting that particular data and
that's pretty much it how the server
client interaction works in a nutshell
so okay so enough of talking and just
let's just finally do something so
server dot create server and let's just
say this is engine and what everyone
this is to listen to any boat you like
so I'm just going to go with one three
three seven because why not this is the
lead words so let's just make this
engine as blank so what happens when I
was at this site right now so localhost
one three three seven now as expected
this would not work obviously because we
have not you know we have not even
started fired the node inside the
terminal so it should probably not work
if it works then there's a problem with
your code
well obviously so now the next thing is
that this create server accepts a
function as a passed in here and created
a dummy function got a black function
here so what this function accepts or
what these parameters will be will be
like looking at that real soon but what
this listen is so I hope you should know
this but if you don't then here's a
quick you know just a quick mini
tutorial on what this port number is so
every website
URL syntax something like you know the
protocol protocol which is your HTTP
HTTPS then your sub domain which is
optional some sites don't have W W some
do have then your website name then your
top-level domain then your path and for
this you have your food so path and
while I just complete this out and then
you have the query then you have string
and then you have the hash so that is
the maximum information domain can
contain and correct me if I'm wrong
because I guess I'm right so you know a
typical URL pick up any URL you have and
you could eventually split that URL up
into all of these components which I
have written so yeah so what happens is
that this one three three seven is this
thing right here which is the port
number and default HTTP port is 80 so if
you do like something like example.com
let's just say and if I run it on both
80 as you can see Google Chrome
automatically removes that because
that's some obvious thing similarly for
the HTTP the default port number is 443
and as you can see Google Chrome again
removes that because it is obvious and
if I do like it's your eight zero or any
custom board that Google Chrome won't
remove that because that might refer to
some other board
well since Google doesn't work on the
sport so this were kind of not load well
I don't want it to load either so what
this listen does is as you know now it
would just say to the local host to the
local host here so local host would be
our guy here so listen to this port and
this port
is this web address so obviously it
doesn't listen to it right now so let's
just fire off node a let's just say node
script for no GS ad as you can see your
node doesn't quit now because you know
you are kind of creating a server right
now so no needs to run in the background
to see which application or which
anything which computer is trying to
access your website so if I reload this
now and wait a bit you can see that it
is not still this web page is not
available though it is currently not
loading because I haven't just worked
upon this function very well
this engine run right now so if I just
go to this network's tab and reload this
again you see requested but it is just
waiting for localhost
it is simply waiting for us because
there's nothing we are doing right here
at the server so just know what is just
working on is just going crazy to us
basically so it is just saying the why
the heck you haven't programmed the
server what the heck should I do to this
user what should I send on all that
stuff notice saying to me in my
headphones right now so let's just go
ahead and create some stuff here so
inside the engine it would accept two
parameters request and response so these
two are obvious parameters which you
can't even think about if you give it a
little bit time because obviously in a
server you need something or some
information about what the browser is
just requesting to the server and what
the response you want to send to the
browser so let's just say inside here I
want Rick
Qwest just really request for now let's
just write a response but right head now
this right head would accept again do
things is the status code and here's the
object you can say so let's just get
started on that
so status code is 200 and object is
let's just say content type text lane
which is the m IM e type for a text file
and response dot and header from the so
and so that's pretty much it
let's just try to run this again clear
no script for j s and and and we've got
some time I expected token well kind of
Miss that so you don't have to put the
Colin in the codes as well so this is
obviously an object this is the key and
the value
okay no problem
and again notice listening to the server
so let's just reload and voila you see
that it says you hey there from server
so yeah so that's pretty much
interesting and thrilling as well to see
how your program is working and as you
can see that this localhost if I take a
look and if I just go down you can see
the content type here is text plain and
I can add my custom header as well and
you can just say blah blah blah and from
code damn calm
and again if I just reload the server
and reload the page as well you can see
that it sends me this blah blah blah
from koat.com header so yeah so that's
pretty much it on this tutorial and in
the next tutorial we'll be taking a look
at some more interesting thing which you
can do with this server and so yeah so
that's pretty much it for this one and
