ho and welcome to your eighth angular
tutorial in which you're going to take a
look at something known as ng-if now
this is one of the things which angular
team has changed when moving from
angular 2 to angular four right so there
has been some changes and syntax and
some new things have been added so it
will be interesting to look at right so
let's just begin now from angular 2 if
you remember or if you have you know any
sort of experience with that ng-if is
pretty much like if your condition
evaluates to true then display that
thing otherwise obviously don't display
that so right now if you take a look I'm
in the app component and the application
is running on my PC so what I can do is
simply go ahead and create a div which
says this works simple as that and as
you can see that this works now what I
can do is actually write something like
astrick ng-if and this Astrakhan g if
you don't need to worry a lot about this
Asterix it's just an tactic sugar it
just decodes into a more template sort
of syntax later on angular would do that
for you if you don't need to worry about
that so ng F now here goes our condition
which is a boolean result literally
right so what we can do is for very
simple things we can say 1 equal to 1
and you can see that the app is set on
automatically reload so it probably
works right and we just move it down
here okay so if I write if 1 is equal to
2 you can see that we do not get that
because this is obviously false right so
this is a very basic users of ng-if now
let's see how you can create something
like let's just say what was it both we
can say right and again with the bill is
not defined so let's just go to our
half and stay with Apple is equal to
true and this works I have change it to
pulse you can see it doesn't work right
so what we can do now is that we can
just create a button here which says
something like now when we click on this
button that particular button on the
screen then we can just toggle this
visible from two to false or false to
true accordingly
so a very simple simple implementation
would be writing button click and again
I haven't actually explain this this
button click while you're writing this
in brackets but I'm just going to
explain that later on so just stick with
me and just remember that you need to
put that event in bracket right now our
or if and do is now write our function
name or we can just do it right here as
well but I'm just going to create a
function which says toggle this right we
can say don't go just like that
and now we can just go ahead in our
component and right here we can say
something like toriel diff and then we
can say this but with little Z equal to
start with because right we just
essentially changing its value from true
to false or false true accordingly right
so if you take a look if I click on
toggle you can see that our div pretty
much toggles between visibility:visible
T true and false because of this ng-if
right here right so with this what we
can do is we can get deeper into what
angular 4 offers now which is the
if-else kind of statement inside this
ng-if itself so what angular 2 does is a
regular four rather nine is that it
provides you with something some syntax
like div NGS
we are conditioned if it's true then
what you need to do then a template
right else another template now
essentially if you write something like
this this they would actually never
appear on the screen right so let's just
go ahead and create a template now a
template you can create a template
essentially with ng template for angular
for now angular has deprecated this
template because it has been introduced
in HTML as a standard tag and it will be
actually pretty much included in future
releases of the browser so with ng
template you can create something like
hostess a word or odd click and I can
say odd number of clicks and I can
create another template even expect we
can say even number of clicks right and
right here what we can do is we can get
rid of this body and say that
or rather we just want to need that so
if ng F is visible then odd clicked and
even flick-right so first of all our
button is visible so actually that means
that we have zero clicks right now so
there should be alt click right and make
sure the spelling matches yeah so if the
button is visible is true which is
indeed right now then showed the even
click template otherwise show the odd
click template right so right now this
is an even number of clicks if I click
on toggle odd even odd even or even like
that so if you take a look in the DOM
then you'll see that we are not getting
this div anywhere in the scene right but
what happens if I are actually as you
can see as well we do not get this works
anywhere on the screen right so
essentially the stiffest not in dom tree
if you are making use of dead but if you
do something like just l right so in
this case it would show you this works
and our number of clicks and now you can
see that inside a Dom for the visible
when visible is true we are getting the
div inside our dog and when the order
click template is working then we are
not getting that we are just getting the
template right here which we have
defined right so either way whatever you
like you can go ahead with that I'll
just pretty much stick to ng templates
as well only because it kind of makes
things clear and explicit so yeah that's
pretty much it for an introductory
tutorial for ng if and we also have
energy for which we're going to take a
look at later on in the series so yeah
that's all for this one and if you like

thank you for watching I'll see you then
