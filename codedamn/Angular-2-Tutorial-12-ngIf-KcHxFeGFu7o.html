hole and welcome to your 12 angular2
tutorial in which you will be learning
about something known as ng-if in
angular 2 well this is a sweet directive
you can say which you can add to any
HTML tag or you know you would just it
would just allow you to compare a bunch
of stuff and just do some conditional
coding so well before even starting with
this tutorial I would just like to get
rid of some of the code right here
I'm just gonna get rid of this directive
some styles let's just get rid of this
as well then again let's just exclude
this we don't need this anymore and yeah
as you can see I have just separated the
J's compiled files in another folder and
to do that just delete all of your J's
files from this folder which you had an
app one and just go to this ts convict
or JSON and add this line out directory
is app /a s what this would do is that
this is the configuration file of the
typescript so once your files are
compiled by type squared they would
output the compiled files in this
particular directory so this is my app
GS R once you are done with this line
then go ahead and your index dot HTML
and change this system import app slash
main to app /j s slash main and you'll
be good to go so in my component dot
index dot d s alright let's just say we
have some particular sort of movies
which are you know just available for
the Premium users let's just say this
isn't if you are not eligible for this
movie or this movies restricted for you
or whatever you don't you get that idea
so if I look in the browser right now as
you can see this shows this message to
everybody on the website well you won't
like that you would like to have a
particular sort of category of users
which can
this message so let's just write an NG
if statement and write a star ng if and
what this star means is that whenever
you see a star and then a directive name
that means that you know just this HTML
particularly throws the control to
angular 2 and angular therefore then
evaluates what has to be done with this
div actually so whatever inside there is
angular would determine if this
condition is true or not and therefore
it would just throw or basically just
you know just decide but this diff
should be displayed or not let me just
show you an example so let's just say I
say if 1 equals 1 well this is obviously
true
so you can see that it shows me this
message but if I change this to 2 and
Grille or this as you can see the
message disappears and in the HTML also
this is not there so angular 2
determines that this condition is false
therefore this div would not be
displayed so this dip would only be
displayed when the condition inside here
is true again you can just make use of
the greater than or less than operators
as you can see this condition is false
and this one is true so this is
displayed well again to make it a bit
more realistic you can just say ng if if
premium account equals true and since we
don't have any premium account variable
right now what you can do is just write
premium account is equal to true here or
you can just write a public here keyword
as well it doesn't matter because by
default the variables would be public
only so if I just get rid of that public
and write just premium account true you
can see we get this message so if I just
change this to false you should see that
we don't get the message so this is
quite useful when you'll be just
learning about the click event so you
can just make use of the click events to
display a div or a block of you know
HTML code on your web
side like you have you can have tabbed
menu when you click on that tab the menu
then you can change the you know the
state of the tab right here inside this
ng-if then you can compare that if ng if
the tab active is 1 or 2 or 3 or ID
whatever so we'll be looking on that and
this was a quick tutorial to get started
with ng-if so yeah so that's all for
this tutorial and in the next tutorial
we'll be looking at some more
interesting things in angular 2 so don't
