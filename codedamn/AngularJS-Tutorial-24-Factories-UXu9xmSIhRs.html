angularjs tutorial on metal and this
tutorial we'll be looking at factories
in angularjs now the last tutorial I
told you guys about factories and
services now services and factories are
pretty much same and do the same job but
there are a bit or two differences
between those and let's first of all
look at what our factories in angularjs
and how do you write one so from the
last tutorial we have this code the HTML
one another JavaScript one here so I'll
just remove the comments and let's just
modify this code from a service to a
factory now how we can do that I'll show
you now there's not a lot of difference
between a service at a factory the first
one being instead of writing application
of service you'll write applications
factory now once you have done that
everything else in this line would be
same the name of your factory and a
function but in factories what happens
is instead of using the desk keyword you
would actually make use of an object and
you would just create a functions or
your properties or whatever you want in
that so let's say if you create like
random object as it is and initialize it
as a black object and then what you can
do is you can just create functions
inside the random object don't generate
like that and may you can make use of
the num as well here now as I told you
that this would not be accessible for
the outer code as it is so what we'll do
is to make this accessible we'll just
return it so once we return it all these
properties etc would be available to the
outer core as well so
the syntax for the latter is same and
will similarly do like a random dot
generator with the help of random object
it doesn't matter whatever you the name
you use here it should be just the
factory name should be right and the
function name should be right as well so
now let's just take a look of it in the
browser and once I click this you see we
get four four three three or whatever
and I guess you might have guessed by
now that factories are also singleton in
angularjs and similarly they would
return the you can see they would just
create one instance and would just
return the reference of that instance
every time so that's how factories work
in angularjs and in the next tutorial
we'll be looking at a few differences
between the two and I'll also show that
suggest you what you should use and when
or probably will be looking at providers
in the next one so that's all that's all
for this tutorial and thank you for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
