and welcome to your fourth I guess
angular 2 tutorial in which I'm gonna
show you or I'm gonna explain you that
how our hello world application was
working in a rather simple way because
since we don't know a lot of things in
angular right now so I'm just gonna keep
this explanation real simple so starting
from index dot HTML first of all we
loaded these four script modules and
maybe I could just get rid of this
alright so we are loading these four
modules then down here we are
configuring this system GS and this file
basically it does nothing but it is a
module loader so it just loads some
modules and angular is angular 2 is a
modular language so everything is split
into modules like you see this is
component as a module which we are
importing from angular 2 slash goal and
then our main dot J's file is also a
module so it is actually a dot J's as
defined here but we don't need to put an
extension because we have already
written on default extension of dot
Cheers
so this is then some sort of chaining
and debugging then it console logs if it
doesn't find this file or there are some
sort of readwrite protection or
something like that then we are making
use of this selector right there which
we always made use of like in angular 1
and then pretty much what we are doing
is that inside this app dot T s main dot
TS this main dot TS file is called first
and then this main dot T s imports the
app component now you can only import
something which is exported so you are
exporting this app component that is why
you are moving this app component if you
just name it X
and you have to change this to X as well
and you have to change this class name
to X as well well that would also work
so yeah so you are bowing then this
class from dot app and this class is
exported right there and then these
things are attached to it then what we
are doing is we are bootstrapping it and
as you can see bootstrap is located in
this directory and one thing you might
have noticed is that though this
component is located in angular 2 slash
core that means this is a core component
this bootstrap module is loaded is
located somewhere in angular 2 slash
platform slash browser so why is this so
well if you look in angular 2 node
modules way dominant yeah angular 2
platform right here you can see that
there are a bunch of files right there
browser door chase browser static
dodgiest common Dom de Geus
server dot GS and all that stuff and the
angular 2 actually works on server and
it is you know compatible with ionic as
well which is used to develop Android
application mobile applications
basically so what happens is that you
can bootstrap the application from
various places for various platforms so
that is why this is not located in
angular 2 slash core instead for browser
it is located in this directory
well once you have bootstrap the
application that means you have
initiated the application then this
component comes into play and then it
imports this thing and the selector is
the CSS selector this is not diag
specific selector this is actually a CSS
selector so if I try to like div class
my selector if I do like live right here
also if I do like my selector notice the
period and yeah so I guess I already
have that running so if I just locate
this HTML down there you can see that it
is on div class my selector instead of
just the tag so this is a CSS selector
this is not a tag only tag specific
select road then this is the template
which we also had an angular one then
you can also have something known as
template URL then this there's a file
name there then that would load a file
out there and like that so we'll be
creating a lot of components in future
application of angular and yeah so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
and I'm just gonna reward that back
everything here we go so yeah so that's
all for this one and we'll be starting
off with angular from the next tutorial
onwards so don't forget to subscribe and
