welcome to your 30th Android application
development tutorial my name is Mei hole
and in this tutorial what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna set up ListView which we
learned in the tutorial number 26 and 27
I guess and if you have just landed from
nowhere on this video then i would
highly recommend you to watch tutorial
number 26 and seven before coming to
this video because all i'm gonna do in
this one is just copy and paste from my
previous app to this app so in my
previous app we had this long line we
just add java as a separate class right
so in this one what i'm gonna do is i'm
gonna create a new class and i'm gonna
say this is as news item dot java and
probably it will just take care of that
for me and we are getting stool to check
aps compiled with api 24 please update
and what the heck to update okay we'll
just take a look at that later on so
what I'm gonna do is pretty much just
copy all that stuff because actually not
really because I can just create setters
and getters automatically so I'm gonna
say this is private news heading this is
a strength obviously private string News
description and then what we want is
private strength and I wonder sizes News
description but this one is small right
so for example if you are displaying a
list you don't want to fill it up with
thousand characters so that's all for
that so next I'm gonna say private and
image ID again integer for image ID
right and then then then then what we
need what else we need let's just take a
look at API you have image title okay
time and date and link as well right so
that came handy right so private
strength time private string date
privates frame what else we have URL
right so now we have all that stuff and
I'm gonna say generate constructor and
select all these right so that I could
just make use of getters instead of
setters generate get or are these Gators
right because we need access to all of
these okay so if we take a look at our
first application you see that that's
pretty much it what we have done in this
one so that must be enough for this
application as well I guess but if you
want to add some other stuff we'll just
do that later on so now in main activity
dot Java what I want to do is I just
want to copy this code which I did
earlier so it's pretty much all the same
code and there would be a bit of
variable changes to make sense and
otherwise it would be pretty much
similar yep import all those and yeah so
what I want to do is I will say that
again this is my yeah not long languages
but news item right so this is my new
ArrayList then what I want to say is
that this is new
new dynam here we go my first ListView
okay so we need to create a list view as
well we'll just take a look at that
later on new item use item right so for
every label language I'm gonna say this
one as my news feed we can say that that
add we go now we need to make a bit of
more changes for now I'm just gonna set
this as dummy news 1 and then this is
the isolator only then for constructor
we have 1 2 3 how many arguments 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 right and the order is a bit weird
again
okay so I would like to have the heading
first then I want to have the
description then I want to have actually
we can just get rid of this news
description small because we can just
trim it down in our own class right so
we don't need this from our main
activity we can just get rid of that
later and then we have new description
then date then time then URL and then
the image so pretty cool now so now we
have news item then description funny
right then we have date so I just gotta
say this is Jan 1 1970 and then we have
time 12
right and we are just gonna set that
later on to an API call so we don't need
to do that anymore then would be has URL
so I'm just gonna say this school damn
calm for now and then for ID odd mipmap
dot I see launcher because that's the
only image we have right now right so we
just have one item in our newsfeed and
we do have some red marks still because
we are just making use of so we can just
get rid of all that stuff and we need to
create a layout and there should be
there should be you see it right ok so
what we are left with is the ListView so
let's just hop over to our resources
layout activity vein and then drag a
ListView out of here which is in
containers ListView and then you can
just extend that a little bit or you can
just keep that like that and then gonna
show your logo in here well that is that
is by a pressure code because much
payment here you go
and then Android text alignment central
pretty good right and then change this
to news feed and Android Android text
size as 45 SP and maybe 25 would work
good yep and that is how we created our
little bit of sweet interface for our
newsfeed and then we would just populate
it with
our ListView so I'm gonna say this
ListView has an ID of news item and this
logo kind of and we will have some
problems here so in main activity I'm
gonna say this is news items right then
change this to news items as well news
items new items and we're gonna change
the layout well we don't have one right
now so item item right there so yeah I
guess that's all for this tutorial and
in the next one I'm just gonna create
this layout and push some more code and
then if you like this tutorial again
then don't you subscribe and thank you
for watching I'll see you then in the
next one real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
