your seventh angularjs tutorial in which
we'll be learning about ng-repeat
directive in angular and somehow I
missed that in the last tutorial my aim
was to explain you ng-repeat in the last
tutorial itself but it somehow got
skipped so never mind let's learn what
is ng-repeat in this tutorial so
ng-repeat is yet another directive in
angularjs which we often use make use of
when you are kinda looping the data and
we have got some complex versions of
ng-repeat as well with filters and
controllers which we'll be learning soon
but in this tutorial we'll be looking at
a simple example of ng-repeat so let's
make use of whatever we learn so far in
angular and javascript so let's say if I
create a div of let's say ng initialize
that means store the data with ng in it
and I say let's say my favorite language
and I create an array so inside this
array
let's see
I create a kind of object so what we can
do is I can give it a property which is
name this should be set to PHP then the
next thing would be extension maybe we
can say and it would get dot PHP then
another object another property let's
say name or the should not be in the
quotes name javascript extension dot JS
then another one to illustrate name
let's say Ruby
and extension
and this should be RB and what else
let's end up with
C++ and the extension should be
undoubtedly C++ I guess I have
most a full stop for any of the
extensions okay so now we have got a
bunch of data ready in our energy in it
our favorite languages so I want to echo
it out in separate span tags so what I
can do is let's say uh not span let's
say B so that they all appear in
separate lines so I'll say P ng-repeat
and this is yet another directive which
I was talking about in this tutorial and
I'll create a kind of a for loop which
we learnt in JavaScript section but
without any for keyboard so we'll loop
it again and again let's say for
language in my favorite language and if
you are familiar with JavaScript then we
have a similar syntax like for X in
array and we loop like whatever print X
dot name or X tall extension we do like
this mainly but in angular what we'll do
is we have to evaluate it like an
expression so we will put double curly
braces here and I'll write language
because we are working with my favorite
language as a temporary variable
language dot name would give us the name
of the language selected BR
let's say extension would be language
dot extension simple as that so let's
check this out in the browser let's
reload this and we get named PHP
extension dot PHP named JavaScript is
Ruby RB C++ dot c BB so sounds much more
comfortable and convenient than our
traditional for loop in Java Script and
now you can see that we have actually
not touched even the script tag even
once we are just making our HTML
language dynamic with angularjs so
that's one of the most favorite things
in angularjs that you can make your HTML
interactive itself instead of
introducing JavaScript to your HTML to
do the stuff so you add life to your
HTML code so that's it for this
ng-repeat tutorial and in the next
tutorial maybe we'll be discussing about
some more advanced concepts in angularjs
