Miho and welcome to your 15 angular 6
tutorial in which we're gonna create a
brand new login application for angular
6 in angular 6 basically so let's get
started alright so in this video we're
going to take a look in this mini series
we're going to see how to create a login
app which consists of app components
obviously we need them back and
validation a little bit with PHP for the
time being but you can switch it to node
or whatever you want then routing with
angular and how to actually protect your
routes so we're going to span this over
in tutorials I'm not sure how many but
there would be some so starting with the
app components what we need is a login
component and admin component for the
time being right and if you're coming to
the series and you have no idea about my
previous tutorials what you need to do
first is you need to actually set up
something known as a proxy a proxy
forwarding for your API calls to the
backend to do that what you need to do
is just go to your package store JSON
file inside your scripts modify this
start by writing NG so proxy config
proxy configuration
then create a proxy conflict or JSON
file here and write this thing and what
this essentially do is that it would
forward all of your API requests slash
API requests do this another server
which is your remote server for the time
being for the development for your API
calls for example I can send my
validation information to this slash API
slash validate and this would be a post
request and and the body it consists of
username and password and actually
angular will swap forwarded to my this
server so what advantage does it give us
well it just gets rid of that course
policy which browsers have so that's for
that and now we take a look let's just
create some components here so I'm gonna
start off with let's just say we need to
create log in our and component so we're
gonna say I ng generate component a
let's say this is login component it
enter and ng generate component admin
component hit enter all right now what
we can see is a login component is here
and for the time being our app component
what we can do is say eh v or a router
link as
or rather rather what we can do else
this is create and degenerate component
as home
you
WordPress so what we have now is that
what I can see is inside my app
component I'm going to see a router out
lid
this gives us access to routing an
angular and inside my app module if we
see we have these modules already added
we have input that alter module let's
just import it inside our inputs for
route and what I'm going to do is
provide array of routes the path would
be blank the component would be home
component they will have then for the
second route what I'm going to do is the
path would be login and the component
would be a login component and for the
time being we're just keeping the road
unprotected admin the component would be
admin component they we have it I will
just move this a little down so the
abbot's will just use your eyes and
there we have it right we also need to
create a service for the backend stuff
so I'm gonna say ng generate service and
I'm gonna write the service a spot or
let's just say not off or maybe yeah
part should be all right let's just go
with that
so here what we are doing is that we are
generating this spot service
and there we have it odd service
tortillas that we have it and we're
going to implement a method like get
user details and we just got a post
these details - HTTP server or API
server rather and return user info is
correct
all right we will be that neutral for
now what we have is login shows login
component inside a log and component we
can wait a quick little form form should
be nothing when I say input type text
and this should be placeholder username
a password placeholder password
I'll form so to handle forms a mission
but you're gonna do is right summit and
let's just say Oh login user something
like this I can just pass in the event
object here and right here what we can
do is an our login but component dot
file we can say login user event we can
pretty much call so log that either for
now and then we have it
you
all right you just need to set up our
routing here correctly
Eileen if you go to oh we already have
but we don't have any links right so I'm
just going to go to home component right
here you should see my work step and I'm
gonna say a router link login login and
just gonna say hey Rockland link as
admin go to admin just for testing
purpose after we are finished with the
app click on clicking on this link
should redirect to us to this one if we
are not logged in and should show admin
content if we are so let's just reload
good login we see our form all right so
now now we are on login what we need is
a button to actually summit the form
input type text input type submit' value
summit it's safe wait for it to load and
meanwhile I'm just gonna fire up my
console so if you go to console and it's
summit now you can see that we just got
a console staple here but it did not
prevent the default behavior of page
reloading so let's just prevent that by
actually going here and say you went dot
event
default
just like that preload
at Summit you can see that we get our
event console logged properly and there
we are
alright so now we have prepared a form
which looks like this we have prepared
the admin page not really
top secret we have prepared the admin
page the basic structure for the form
for the login page is working but we are
missing the authentication part had the
admin obviously be back and serve about
so that's all for this video in the next
