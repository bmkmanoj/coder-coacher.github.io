your 25th annual application development
tutorial and in the story of what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna show you how to
pass data from one activity to another
using indents so right now we are just
passing the control from one activity to
another but most of the times you would
like to have data some sort of data as
well like you need to inform activity
what it needs to do and you know all
that good stuff so let's get started and
in this tutorial I'm just gonna build a
really basic application to demonstrate
the same so first of all in my activity
mean let me just get rid of this button
and probably just change this to you
know layout as well and I'm just gonna
say this as my edit text width is match
parent height it's wrap content and
Android actually hint is user name write
an android ID of user name then the same
one for password password and password
and then finally I need a button right
which would be rock content both and
where text is sign-in right so here we
go and pretty much just assign it an ID
as well so that you just finish it
nicely sign in and in main activity what
you need to do is just change from
button to sign it alright yeah so now
what I need to do is actually I need to
somehow pass this username and password
information from this activity to the
secondary activity right so what we have
to do is actually first of all get this
text whatever the user has entered first
right so I'm just gonna say this is edit
next then let's say this is username is
edit text find view by ID r dot ID dot
and this is username right and then the
same thing for password as well password
password so now we have both these stuff
in edit text so now I have to pass this
to this activity to another one so how
do we do that well we do that in the
form of intent put extra right so in
this case our intent has a variable I
put extra and what this would do is it
would accept a key value pair right so
here is your key and then your value so
you can retrieve this particular value
if you know the key on the other side so
this would be my super-awesome key then
this would be my super-awesome value
then you can just get this value from
your super-awesome key so this stuff can
be dynamic right so I'm just gonna say
this is my user name and then I'm gonna
say this is user name dot user name dot
get text dot to strength right you don't
want that as an object and then similar
things for password password password
get text are two string right so now
what you want to do is you want to start
the activity so you have already started
that and pretty much you are done here
so what you need to do next is you need
to retrieve this data we sent on the
other side so our other side in this
case is sick and reactivity and for
secondary activity what I'm gonna say is
first to fall inside your super dot on
create let me just get rid of this
button because we are just passing data
from one side
now I'm gonna say that if you get intent
now what this would do is that it would
check if has extra right so this method
would check if that particular key
exists that key value pair exists so
make sure you know the key value key
name at least right user name so I'm
gonna say first of all in this red
string my user name is and same for the
password as well there is not as well so
I'm gonna say that this has extra user
name and I'm gonna set this my user name
get intent dot get string extra then
here your key again user name right so
I'm just gonna say that if get intend
dot has extra password then as well I
want to say this my password is this
thing and make sure you change that to
password as well and you could just make
use of this else statement and just
throw an error if you want to but
illegal argument exception like that so
I'm just gonna leave that for now you
can just do that if you want to so now
we have our username and password so
it's time to quote some awesome layout
so that we could actually display it and
I'm gonna say I show actually in this
should be show username and then this
would be show password and why not
selective linear layout right so this
would be Android text something like
this something like this right so
take slice TSP increase that a little
bit so that it's at least visible so now
let me just remove this thing and say
that I'm gonna say thanks to you show
you the name is textview fine view by ID
dot ID not show user name and then
similar thing for password as well why
not just right here show password is
text me you find me by ID dot ID door
show password right so I'm just gonna
say show you the name dot set text is my
username right and then I'm gonna say
show password dot set text as my
password
pretty cool huh and now we are good to
go so let's just try our application on
the emulator whoo so here's our device
and let's see if it works or not
so here's my username let's just say
this is me whole and password is me who
as well
let's click Sign In and pretty sweet you
can see that it appears like me ho and
me whole and if I change it to like Wow
awesome and like metal why not
it's pretty sweet right so sanon you see
that we get Wow awesome and middle so
this can be pretty much used in a
similar application if you are just
trying to authenticate users for your
application well that would be a really
bad idea
to do that on the inside the code only
but you know if you're just playing
around a little bit so that couldn't be
a lot better so that's how you pretty
much create and pass on data with
intents in Android and these two are
critical lines and this one as well
to retrieve data right so that is how
pretty much all that stuff works and if
you liked it then don't forget to

I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
