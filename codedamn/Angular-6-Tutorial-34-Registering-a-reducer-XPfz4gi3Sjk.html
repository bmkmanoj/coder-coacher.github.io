mayo and welcome to your thirty fold
angular 6 tutorial in which we're gonna
take a look at how to register your
reducer into your app dot module dot ES
file and make it available throughout
your app so let's get started
okay so if we take a look inside our app
dot module dot ES file right now and get
rid of all the old code we had what we
have here is that we wrote this initial
state which we no longer need because we
had already defining that inside our
reducer here so we have this store
module but for root and what it does is
that the first argument accepts or
reducers so what we need to do is
actually provided reducers so what that
means is that your application can have
multiple reducers not just one because a
single reducer will not be able to
manage all the data flow in your
application if there's a lot of data and
that actually makes sense as well you
don't want to over complicate your apps
so we're gonna do is just write reducers
here and the second object will be just
that and what we're going to do is this
import reducers prom and what we can do
here is write store reducers add
that's it so we need to create an
indexed of tes file here and what goes
in this index dot T is file is that I
just want to say that export my reducers
which would be let's say this is not
this is a reducer for a particular but
of your state so let's just assume that
your store had a state let's just say
your store your store is has has various
kinds of states for example I have us to
say user state we just manage this data
for user then we have let's say app
state which is manager stuff like log
and logout functionality and all that
stuff user state contains information
like the name and email ID of the logged
in user and information about them
basically which can change over time in
app state might contain things like how
many people are online and all that
stuff so you don't want the reducer
managing user stayed or actually rather
you want that reducer managing user
state should be different from the
reducer managing app state so what we
can do is we can actually explicitly
define here what if you want to do with
a particular reducer so if we take a
look here what we can say right here is
I can just say a producer is my a
producer itself and after that what we
can do is we just can just import this a
producer from a producer file well let
me just see this is just a reducer so we
can just say something like this right
so once we had that in place we have a
reducer subject with us which we can
pretty much just put in here and this
now makes it available to your
application now obviously we can add
tons of type-checking here
and basically we can do something like
actually your rear are your ng rx module
also provides something like action
reduce your map and what it does is that
it would just check whether the reducers
you are passing actually match your
state in your actually match your actual
state of your application or not so for
example if I just import this from the
let's say ngrick store what I can do and
this is purely type checking right so
this is not really strictly part of code
but obviously you should do type
checking so this is actually with action
reducer map and it could accept let's
just say it would accept something like
app state something like that so what
this app state would be is that this
would be an interface so this is an app
state and with this interface consists
of is obviously my type of reducer so
this would be the reducer of the type of
reducer I have here so for this what we
can do is basically just quickly create
the same interface and apply it as the
return of our export function and
similarly just mark it at export as well
and introduce it into the interface as
well so that completes our type checking
and yeah let's take a look real quick
what we have if everything is correct or
not
so yeah everything looks good and we
have all the imports in place as well so
yeah basically that's all for this video
and in the next video we can explore it
a little bit further
so I'll see you then in the next video
