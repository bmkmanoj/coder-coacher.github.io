your ninth HTML and CSS tutorial in
which we'll be discussing about images
in your HTML document now images play a
very vital role in your document because
they make it graphical user friendly and
would act like a breakpoint in your
document for the user to view now images
make your document interactive and using
HTML you could insert images or
basically any kind of image in your
document so to do that we have a special
tag for image which is IMG tag now IMG
has a bunch of attributes for you to use
and let's see what they are so we have
IMG with the help of SRC attribute we
give the source of the image and it's
relative to path and for example I have
this image right here which is an image
of the truck and if you have watched
interstellar then you know that this
truck is from that movie
anyways then SRC would accept a image
filename and for example mine is right
and next to this file in this the same
owner HTML and CSS so what I'm doing I
would just write the name of the image
but for example if my image is on Google
servers for example like google.com
slash image then this was this would
grab the image from google.com so since
my images right now for image dot PNG
that I'll just do I am G SRC image dot
PNG and let's close this
let's reload the browser and you can see
as you can see we have this big image
loaded in our browser window so using
int tag you could insert image with the
help of SRC now we have another
attribute called alt which would
basically supply as an alternate text
when your image is not available
let's say I write truck in interstellar
movie now this is an alternate text
which would appear if in some case due
to maybe server failure or any other
case this image is not available to the
user so let's say for example for now
this would be obviously available every
time because there's a store on my
computer itself but let's rename it to
some image if it does not exist right
here
so now let's reload and see what happens
now as you can see we see a broken image
icon but it provides some information to
the user that what this info or
basically what this image was meant to
be
but this image was basically showing
in the first position so all using all
tag you could supply some information
that would appear if your image in case
does not load and then we have the title
tag title attribute sorry now this title
attribute would using this title
attribute you could give up any to it
and let's say if I gave truck just truck
do it let's reload this and when you
hover your mouse with this image then as
you can see we see a little notification
pop up down here
which says truck this one so this
appears because of the title attribute
and if you modify do anything then this
would change accordingly so that's how
you work with images in HTML and we have
a bunch of more tags like width and
height which allow you to specify a
width and height for an image but
actually I'm not interested to teach you
this because this is kind of HTML for
stuff and I want you to learn only html5
things and we would learn this width and
height in the earth CSS section instead
of this HTML one so for now let's just
leave it to SRC and old and title only
but if you wish you could experiment
with width and height but I would not
recommend using you using width and
height on your production site instead
use CSS for modifying width and height
of image which we learned in our maybe
after two or three more tutorials or
maybe who knows the next tutorial so
I'll see you then don't forget to
