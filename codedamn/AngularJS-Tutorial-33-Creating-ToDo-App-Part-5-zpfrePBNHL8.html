and welcome to 33rd angularjs tutorial
in which we'll be looking at the to do
list we have been doing from for
tutorials now and let's just take a look
where we ended last last time so last
time I told you that we are gonna create
a register event for the enter key so
let's just do that now so ng key up
should be and I guess we already have
this but this would be a little
different this thing so let's just say
enter again so again let's just add that
so scope dot enter again and remember
that we don't need to do any of the
array pushing or updating elements
because we have we this ngmodel is
already doing that so the Skee a
function is simply just checking for the
enter key and would be just toggling
this thing here we could even toggle
that with double-click so if I do like
SDA SDF and then do that like so you see
that we are already updating that
successfully so this is my new task and
if I do like that it works
but you know people are usually
comfortable by just typing the new task
and pressing enter key but this won't
work for now but the double-click would
so let's change it to enter as well so
this is a function and obviously we'll
just do something like that only but
here I'm just gonna say
we could actually just call this
function here because it's doing nothing
but it's just toggling them content
editable attribute so it's just add some
tasks a world this is life called damn
press ok well that was crazy
so if even dot which is 13 and scope dot
task is not blank okay
hmm
I guess we need to pass the task in this
function here the entry again oh I guess
we were missing the parentheses let's
just see no it's not about parentheses
yes I guess you have us thinking about
that let me just check first if we are
even reaching here or here
okay so we reach here but not here and
the reason is that I guess this task is
not defined or even if it is then it is
not pointing to the raw right task so we
can pass in the task which we are
working with so we can pass and one task
dot task message simple as that and
we'll just receive it here as message or
anything and we'll just check that for
now let's just see if that makes any
difference yes it does so you see now
that upon my enter this changes and the
reason that you see a bit of delay when
I press Enter the cursor move to next
line is because I'm using the key of
function if you use the key down then
what would happen is that as soon as I
pressed my key down it will reduce to
that so you see that there's no delay
now that looks kind of better so in this
tutorial what we do is we learn how you
can create editable tasks in angularjs
and pretty much how you can get
everything to work with everything else
in your code so that's it for this
tutorial and then in the next one
I'm gonna probably show you how you can
make use of local storage to store these
tasks and browser and how you can
retrieve that so that's it for this one
and if you liked this tutorial then
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching I'll see you then next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
