mail and welcome to your eleventh
bootstrap tutorial in which we'll be
starting off with many application
development kind of you can say and that
is to create an application to upload
images on your server or not like kind
of server but it would be targeting that
interface but as you know that would
require a kind of server-side
programming as well in your favorite
language let it be PHP or C sharp or
whatever you like but I won't be
touching server at all because in these
tutorials I just want to focus on
bootstrap and JavaScript stuff so let's
get started real quick now to get
started first of all you would obviously
need to create a navigation bar and to
create a navigation bar we have learned
that before let's just go with Dave you
can also go with nav if you like number
but default and now fixed our top simple
enough now the next goes navbar header
and then finally we have H H ref
the class should be number brand let's
just call it awesome uploader why not
and then if you want to create the list
items in your navigation bar you can do
that with navbar collapse collapse and
then just a regular unordered list of
navbar and here you go your allies go
here let's just say home allowed contact
what else purchase or you can just see
it whatever you want code blog are you
sick of whatever you like so let's just
take a look oh so that kinda looks tacky
I guess we are missing that missing the
edge shrift
that's why that's happening it's gonna
place the links real quick the closing
tags as well
perfect there you go now this candle
looks a bit aligned to left so to fix
that I'm just gonna throw all the scored
in a container
easy enough why not just indent the core
a little bit here you go
so looks nice now the next thing you
need to do is you need to hop over to
your style file sheet oh oh did I just
spelled it or you know pronounce that
the other way round style file sheet it
should be file
style sheet now this is my style sheet
style dot CSS and inside here what you
need to do is just add a padding of 50
pixels or something don't ask just do
that now I'm just going to show you why
you need to do that in a while now for
now just go and throw in another
container and don't worry if you are
thinking like or you are being lazy to
type all this code
don't worry I'm going to start form ad
code damn real soon and there what I'll
be going to do is I'm just going to
place all of these files you see these
one two three four numbered they're in a
organized manner so you can just go
there and you can just download that but
currently it's not live I've technically
speaking not started it either so you
know it would take a bit of time to do
but once all of that would be done and
completed I'll just edit the
descriptions of all of these videos and
would place the link for you guys
alright so coming back to business let's
just add a simple greeting message to
the user let's just say the user of the
most awesome
file uploader ever period and that kind
of looks but you know this sentence has
a bit of strength in it and you can just
go ahead and type a smaller description
as well allows you to upload images and
download them again well that's weird
but that's why it's awesome and as you
can see this appears here and the reason
I wanted you guys to add the spanning 50
pixels is because if you remove this you
should probably know what would happen
and this would happen if see this div
just starts from the very first pixel of
the screen and the reason being this
navigation bar is a fixed navigation bar
you can see here its position is fixed
right here so you see that it would just
stick to the screen and all of the
elements would not care whether it is
present or not you should probably know
that before because that was kinda
understood if you know CSS alright so I
guess that's pretty much it for this
tutorial and in the next tutorial what
we'll be doing is we'll be creating a
kind of interface for this with
application and then we'll be working
with some JavaScript as well all of that
cool stuff so stay tuned with me don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
