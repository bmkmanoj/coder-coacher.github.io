Meho and welcome to your second tutorial
for natural language processing with
with AI for the messenger platform and
let's get started now first of all let's
just sign up a Twitter eye and verify
our web hook real quick in this tutorial
so you can sign about what that AI with
your github or with your Facebook about
I'm just gonna go with github because I
already have an account with that so
once you do that you should be
redirected to a place where you can
create your first app and once you do
that with this plus icon you can create
a full staff you can keep your data open
to the community or private it's up to
you now once you do that you should be
able to get something like this so I
have created one app core damn and just
keep it open don't panic
what all the stuff is what does all this
mean we're gonna go through over this
later on now once you do that just head
over to Facebook for developers and just
go to my apps and create a new app right
here
I have called dam official chat board as
the app and once you do that what you
want to do is go to add a product and
then add messenger as your product
I should see messenger here instead of
this marketing API because I already
have added messenger so once you add
messenger you should see something like
this now one thing you should know is
that when Facebook rolled out messenger
platform 2.1 it introduced something
known as built in NLP now what this is
and why you should care well built in
NLP is just a facebook's way of natural
language processing some very common
information for example email ids phone
numbers date/time something like this
very generic so in most of the cases you
might not need this because this is
extremely basic but when we use wet dot
a
I Facebook seamlessly integrates with AI
within its platform so we need not to
worry about that so we're gonna make use
of whether a is NLP instead of the built
in NLP which is very basic provided by
Facebook so what we're gonna do is first
of all select a page in this case it's
Chad but go down not really it's the
official page we're gonna make a chatbot
for the official page this time right
and let's set up a web hook real quick
so we're gonna listen for messages and
do yeah that's pretty much it for now so
for the chat bar what we can do is you
can create and extra cheese file here
and what we can say is let me just zoom
in here if I can well this is kind of
weird but I just figure a way out of
this so that we just we're going to
editor instead of the fullscreen but
this should be enough for now I believe
this one all right I know it's humongous
this left side is humongous the right
side is not so but let's just go with
that so I'm gonna say con Express is
require next rest and then con staff is
Express then we're gonna say Arquette
and I say was request and response
I'm gonna send just respond start end
with a token for the token now this is
just a really dirty way of verifying
token I know what we're gonna say is ABC
1 2 3 4 5 and I'm just quickly verifying
we're gonna make this thing a little bit
nicer
and easier to handle and read but this
is a quick verification of a book so
yeah that is pretty much it we just need
to listen to put some random boat I'm
just not gonna say any garbage so here
we are know what I can do is actually
hop over to my terminal and fire off in
grog here so if you take a look here we
can go to chat board and we can say and
grog HTTP 8080 because that's
essentially what we are doing and we get
a tunnel version of our application
online and if you don't know what an
Krakus well this end clock is used to
tunnel your localhost with a boat online
directly without any hassle so you can
see that now if I was at this URL right
here since our application is not
listening obviously so let's just say
node node mon rather instead of node and
extra chairs and here we are
saves me that I have an install Express
sure enough let's just install Express
first and what old one will do is that
it will just keep watching our index
tortillas file if there's a change it
will automatically restart the server
instead of us firing off every time just
cancelling the server and then
restarting it and this is good taking
quite some time make sure not
okay I'll take a look
and let's see if we can proceed one more
time and yeah looks like we are on it so
we have installed Express now unless its
launch our server now no morning extra
chase now let's just see how it looks
like now
so we had our and crock URL right here
listening to our ABC one two three four
five here which is apparently our token
here so what I'm gonna do is go back
here and inside verify token I'm gonna
paste this thing and inside callback URL
I'm gonna face this thing and I'm gonna
hit verify and save and you can see that
response does not match the challenge
expected value okay so if you take a
look at the data here
I believe Facebook is sending us a
verification token which we are supposed
to yeah so we're gonna we are supposed
to echo that out so what I'm gonna say
is if request dot or rather was less we
just quest dot
rather loose console quest or query
first let's just see what we get in here
if I send a very fancy request right
here inside our indexed ideas we get
this JSON object so I'm gonna say that
if our request or query hub mode is
equal to subscribe
there should be obviously if then what I
want to do is request dot response dot
end with request or e dot hub challenge
right and the use of the token was and
request that query hub token is equal to
token like that else next quest response
next there we go so now if we try to
verify and save this thing you can see
that we get us status code of 404
because I think we are not parsing the
JSON properly here subscribe is indeed
correct and request query hub token oh
it was rife a token how dot verify token
right here and if you save this now you
should see that our way book is set up
correctly so now finally we can
subscribe to a page which is indeed our
code dams official page
all right so once you do that what we
get is something a change in here right
so what I want to do is actually select
a page for built-in NLP and I can toggle
it on and off with just a tap now
obviously I told you I don't want to use
the natural language processing
algorithms righted by Facebook but by
oai so what we're gonna do is actually
make a change in here to actually change
our built in LP with a width AI app
token which we're gonna take a look at
right now you can see that we can select
a custom model I would we'd acquire a
with token now with token we can get
over token from here
so what you want to do is copy out this
server access token and paste it right
here and hit save and you should be good
to go now your width application is
successfully integrated with your chat
bot so Facebook would automatically
instead of sending your text directly to
you as a script it would send it to
window di first which would just run its
NLP algorithms on it and apparently it
would get back to you with the data
already and cooked for you to power
style so that's all for this one and in
the next tutorial we're gonna take a
look at some real coding stuff and
probably maybe not we're gonna learn a
bit about how to work with with REI and
integrated using its NLP so that's all
for this one and if you liked it then
please don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching I'll see you then
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
