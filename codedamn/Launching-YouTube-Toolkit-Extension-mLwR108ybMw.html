this google chrome extension development
tutorial armijo and in this tutorial i
have not numbered this one and this is
because we are not gonna learn anything
new in this one but i'm going to show
you one of my extensions which are
launched last night and this extension
is about youtube so it all started from
Cora where a person asked me that they
are not me actually he just asked on the
side that if there's a way to rewind and
forward the video of YouTube with
keyboard controls and actually I like
this idea because even I was thinking to
have such extension which allows me to
just set my own controls and then
control the video from my keyboard only
so i created this extension and this
includes some more features as well
which includes fear filters to the
videos and you have default controls or
writing setting default volume and so on
so to download this i hope you would
like this so to download this first of
all go to this link i have placed this
link in the description and then scroll
down and first of all enter your name
here
and your email address and click on
let's begin so here you see this message
and it's funny that I place this all
junk folder because it would go into
your junk folder I don't know why but I
have not able to configure the mail the
PHP mail function with godaddy because
whenever I'm using that with custom
headers it is always sending the email
into spam and since godaddy blocks the
smtp ports of gmail therefore i am not
even able to use my gmail address to
send emails so this would probably go
into your junk folder so make sure to
take a look there now go to your email
address and it doesn't go to my junk
folder because i have already marked
this email as not spam earlier so click
on this and because i have to already
emails here so that's why it showed me a
collapsed one so you'll get this a
message and this is the link click on
this link and it would take you to
Chrome Web Store
and click on add to Chrome
so it will install right here and once
it has been added you need to go to this
page again because this is the page
where you can customize the options of
the extension so before you have not
installed the extension it will show
something like this but once you have
installed the extension this iframe
would be changed to the options page so
you now can see various options for the
extensions so let's start with let's say
we do settings 144 p and let's say jump
video 25 seconds with mac on custom
controls let's say ctrl + J or K and
lets the control and let's say o or
whatever you like you can choose these
keys yourself like down ki aur aapki but
make sure you don't create a common pair
of keys for both controls because that
would cause some problems so that's all
for this extension and I hope you would
like this and if you did then don't
forget to share this page with your
friends and whomever you know which
would be interested in this extension
and that's all for this one and I'll
start with the tutorial series from the
next one as always so thanks for
watching and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
