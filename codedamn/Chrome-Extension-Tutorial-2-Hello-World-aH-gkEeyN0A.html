your second tutorial for Chrome
extensions development Adam Astoria I'm
going to show you real quick how we can
get up and start running a real simple
Chrome extension which just shows us
hello world and side browser itself so I
have prepared a simple boilerplate you
can see and it actually just consists of
three frames which is icon manifest
eyedropper and actually store this icon
from the action documentation so yep so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
mess up make use of this thing right
here and I'm gonna create folder with
the versus a call extensions let's just
move into this I'm going to say get well
why not and fit that you okay so it
saves me it has grown this it has
created another folder we have another
folder by the world we have a lot so
this right there so yeah and I get my
path at the terminal is little bit nicer
I've just happy take a look at that but
anyways so we have our files ready so
what we can do is go to extensions right
here note our extension first of all
this and every developer body click
click and then load an unpacked
extension and what I could do is go
wherever you have saved it at about this
is called a desktop here call extension
to do a boilerplate
and you have to navigate to that folder
which consists of your manifest or JSON
file because that's essentially what the
browser is looking at but first run so
we're gonna select this folder and you
can see that we've got our world holding
the little extension as you click on
this you will see that this is fun is
revealed
so that is how pretty much you can set
up a very basic on extension and that
was quite immaterial I guess so yeah
that's all for this one so
yeah if you like them don't agree
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then and the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
