and which will be continuing without
creating a to-do list application which
we have started six parts ago so this is
part number six so we technically
started at five parts ago I guess well
anyways so in this video tutorial what
I'm gonna show you is that how you can
move this application to local storage
remember that in the last tutorial I
told you we'll be doing that so here you
go now to begin with what is local
storage
well local storage I hope you know from
the JavaScript lessons that it is a
storage area in your browser which you
can use to store data and later you can
retrieve that as well for your own site
or your own files you can say that's
pretty much it with local storage and if
you knew that already that's good for
those who don't knew then here you go
so go to your script file and what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna first check
whether some data is present in local
storage for us to use or not so for that
just go and here write task data is
local storage and the square brackets
just like you're accessing inari tasks
list now this would return
obviously undefined but if it is not
undefined not null my friend but if it's
not undefined then what I want to do is
I want scope dot tasks to be json.parse
here you go the task data alright so
what is happening here now in local
storage you cannot store arrays or
objects directly so if you have an area
like one two three the only way to store
this array in local storage is to
convert this into a strength
now when you convert an hour into a
string it is simply just like another
strength
now you can either convert that string
back to an area by writing complex for
loops or checking for a
multi-dimensional array and all that
stuff
or you can make use of the inbuilt
library with json.parse so this will
help you to you know convert your arrays
and objects or anything else you want to
string and convert them back to RS so
this is our JSON bars and then what I
want to do is whenever there's a task
added I want to update the local storage
as well so here I'm just gonna say local
storage dot task list should be json dot
stringify now this stringy fire is the
method i was talking about so this would
convert your array or object into a
string and what I want to store is the
scope dot tasks so you see that this
array is stored in local storage and
then we are retrieving it here on the
application runtime so if I just call so
long my local storage after this let's
just see what happens so here's the
application let's reload where I just
hook up with the console as well
oh all right here you go so now let's
just hire tasks and let me just get rid
of this sidebar hey bub
so here's my task one alright so in the
console what we see is a storage tasks
list as you can see this task is updated
now when I reload this you see that the
task remains on the screen because it is
already fetched at the run time of the
application so if I do like this thing
and reload then this won't work because
I'm just updating the local storage only
on you know when the task is added so if
I do like this task to reload whoa all
right well that's weird
ng-repeat duplicate key in repeater aha
okay so looks like there's some
duplicate stuff going on and right here
we use some kind of loop right here so
what is happening is that when you are
fetching the tasks from here it is
actually storing some of the angular
properties as well in the local storage
if I check that out
so these hash keys and all that things
are I guess some angular things and they
are creating some sort of conflict so
you can just fix that easily by just i
treating the repeat instead of tasks on
your index so you can just write track
by index now what that would do is
actually that would just you know would
increment this thing instead of just
relying on this so it would be like 0 1
2 3 4 and would be no duplicates so
let's just check this out all right so
you see that the error is gone and our
task 1 is still striped so the next
thing I want to do is I want to add this
this dynamic edit feature so you see
that when I added this to task X and
reload then nothing happens or basically
the task 2 remains on the screen and
that is because we are not doing
anything
when this content edit is fired because
we are just pushing this scope door
tasks to the local storage only when I
add task function is added and moreover
what we have problem here is that inside
the content edit this
scoop dust era is not updated so even if
I do like this thing right there after
doing this then this won't work because
scope dot dust doesn't know the new
content of the task we have edited so
that is a problem and I'm just gonna
show you how we'll fix that in the next
tutorial so that's all for this one and
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching if you liked I'll see you
then real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
