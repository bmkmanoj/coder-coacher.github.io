27th jQuery tutorial in which we'll be
discussing about something called
animation in jQuery and I'm pretty much
excited to teach you guys about this
tutorial because animation is kind of
something which excites me in jQuery
because it's fun to code it's easy to
learn and using this you can create
actually beautiful animations on your
website itself so let's get started to
create an animation first let's add some
container which will animate so let's
say animate animate me I let's say we
have this is a simple jQuery or let's
keep it short let's just say code dam
inside this alright so inside the script
section let's remove the older code and
add some new code and I would need a
button here as well button and click
here to animate sweet now I would like
to register the event and since we have
only one button on the document so I'll
just can go with button bucket function
and whenever this button is clicked I
want something to happen with this and
what I want is animate me dot animate
now animate
is a you can say a built-in jQuery
method are not basically a method yeah
you can see that it's a method which
accepts three parameters basically one
is the things to animate second is the
speed of animation in milliseconds
obviously and third is the callback
function just like we did in the
previous tutorial so let's make this
easier to understand first of all we
need to let the animate matter know what
thinks it needs to animate so to do that
we'll pass the kind of object here and
the second would be the animation
duration let's set it to 500
milliseconds from now and the callback
should be the callback function and we
can just create an empty callback
function right here callback and it just
says a lot of animation
and here right here in the animate in
the things to animate this is the most
critical one you have to follow we have
to pass just like we do coding in CSS so
let's say I want left to be 300 pixels
and top to be 400 pixel let's say and we
have got this stuff ready everything's
ready let's take a look at the browser
let's reload this page right here let's
click on this button ok all right so I
guess the animation is being done but
since this is a position:absolute set we
can either say position:relative set
sorry we can either set it to absolute
or change this to margin left and margin
top but I want to show you guys how to
do margin left and margin top in the
next tutorial because it's not just like
you do margin left margin top it's
something special you need to do that so
for this tutorial let's just change this
animate me to position:absolute
that's it pretty much let's reload this
let's click on this button right here oh
so I guess that's pretty much a long
animation let's just drop this to under
pixel and top should be 100 pixel as
well so let's reload this now Alice
click here so you see that this
JavaScript alert is fired
whenever the animation is done so we can
actually make it just a left one so that
it's easier to see what's happening
actually let's reload this and click
here so let's apply this a background
astral so background should be color
white padding 20 pixels
or just kind of white but the battle
should be something like this
and let's just copy this for now
here you go
if you guys notice that this callback
function inside the animate method
itself then what if I called an
animation inside the callback itself
well if you already thought about that
I must say that you are good at your
imagination and yes this can be done so
basically we can call a animate function
inside a callback function itself which
would do two animations one after
another and we'll just leave this
callback here because this would become
recursive if not so now what we can do
this whenever this callback function is
fired I want when this animation is
completed let's increase the font size
of this a little bit so we can do like
fun or I guess I need to explain you
camel casing right now so let me tell
you so in jQuery while setting things to
animate an animate method you cannot use
like font size now this would become
invalid because - - right here is used
by jQuery as well in many things so we
have got to fix this problem we have got
something like camel casing so whenever
you type font size like this instead of
jQuery sending it directly to the CSS
like font size
50 pixel what it would do is it would
whatever literate find as capitalized it
would small up that letter and before
that letter added - automatically in the
CSS before sending it to CSS so that's
how you do this is called something
called camel casing which I was
discussing in the next tutorial but with
our callback function animation I had to
do it in this one home so let's reload
this now let's click here to animate so
you see that first of all what happens
here is this this box right here moves
to the right and then the font size
grows so if I do something like let's
say padding to be zero here and I guess
there should not be a comma right here
because you should not put a comma after
the last property in the object so let's
reload this let's click here you see
that the font size increased but the
padding decreased so if I say like font
size 50 pixel unbarring should be only 5
pixel and now animate this so see that
you could create kind of nice animations
and actually I could call back a
function within here do this function
right here
and you know I can make this thing
recursive that whenever this button is
clicked this function is called this
function calls this function and this
functions again calls this function so
let's let me give me a try to this let's
say if I have this function right here
as a function
call back to and
what we had here doing is we're creating
a kind of infinite recursive but it will
obviously not hang your browser because
we have some sort of delay but yeah if
you would give it running for long then
it will surely cause some lags so inside
the function directly passing the
function what we can do is we can just
pass this callback to function callback
to a scrolling callback let's call the
callback to okay and from here all right
so we have please created a kind of
closed loop here which would run
infinite time and let's reload this so
here you go oh okay okay so you know
what we need actually three functions
here callback three because we need it
to return to its original state as well
so function callback three should be
pretty much the same but what it it
should say is that instead of left 500
it should say left to zero and after
this I want to call the callback to here
you go
back callback tree callback - all right
let's reload this click on animate grows
wapis and it just keeps on moving but I
guess I didn't reset the font size size
so you could actually do that as well
with 10 pixel and
Dada gasps padding as well 220 pixel
which was the original one and I don't
know what the font size was originally
but we could always set the font size
here to 10 pixel all right
let's reload this again 10 pixel is way
too small I guess so this should be 15
or 20 maybe here
now let's reload this looks good
click here grows shrinks grows
shrinks grows shrinks and it happens
again and again and again and something
we would be discussing in the next
tutorial but I want to give you an
overview of that right here you see that
it goes back and comes again goes back
comes again doesn't wait so what we can
do this to make it wait we can add
something called delay now delay we just
stop anything for 200 milliseconds and
you could just give it a delay here as
well and here as well so let's see what
result it has on the animation let's
click here now you see that an emissions
are much more you can say less
intensifying and our cleaner to view
because things are not just going here
and they are randomly this is stopping
at every point for 200 milliseconds and
to see it as a reasonable change let's
drop it down
excuse me let's drop it down to one
second and let's reload now so you see
that now it waits for one second every
time it completes it's one of the
callback so that's how I created a
recursive call back with jQuery animate
and this would keep on going forever and
ever unless your computer just switches
off itself or your mom just bang your
head on the keyboard so that's all for
this tutorial and we'll see what we do
in the next one so till then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
