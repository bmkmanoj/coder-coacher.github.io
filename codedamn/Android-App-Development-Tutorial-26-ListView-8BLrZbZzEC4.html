your 26th Android application
development tutorial my name is Mei ho
and in the story what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna show you how to create a list
view and this view is pretty special in
Android because using this you can
create scrollable list items and it
looks pretty cool though
so what you have to do is that let me
just show you how this looks like so you
can just add a ListView like that and
give it an ID off let's just say my
first ListView right so oh this should
be ID right so what happens is that on
the right you see that it just gave us a
dummy look of how it would look like so
you can see that there's a scroll bar as
well so you don't need to put around it
in a scroll view or something so it just
takes care of that stuff so what happens
is that a ListView is pretty much it
would allow you to add items to the view
and make them scrollable right so you
can have a lot of items like if you're
creating a news application then what
you can do is you can have a list view
of like like an image here and the
headline and then the content and if you
remember if you actually you wouldn't
because you wouldn't have seen my ionic
tutorials well in ionic what I did is
that I actually created an application
with actually HTML and angular and CSS
and all that stuff because anglo works
on ionic works on that so that was
pretty much the same application so what
in that application what I did is that I
created a sort of ListView with the help
of my front-end languages because ionic
at the end of day compiles them into
Java code and which is workable or
Android so I'm gonna show you that in
the next video but for this video let's
just stick to list views right
so in the listviews if I go to my code
right if I write here list you blessed
me you actually bro not list so my let's
just keep that same as ID so my first
list view is list view fine view by ID
ID ID my first list view right so before
writing some more code what I want to do
is I want to explain something known as
an array adapter so what happens is that
you have a box here or let's just say
you have some options here or the data
you can say alright you want which you
want to display so what happens is that
you want this data to go on the user
interface right so this is the screen of
your phone so you have an array of
information like head light headline one
and then the image associated with it
the URL and then the short summary you
want it to go to screen then you have
another item we wanted to go to screen
so how would you do that and what would
you know what thing would manage all
that stuff like all the items are you
know placed in their respective orders
then if you want to add a click event or
a drag event or just motion anything you
want to say that how would you do that
well for that what we have is something
known as wrong arrow something known as
to do suspense guys so we have something
known as re adapter right so this boy
what this does is that it acts like an
intermediate between your data and
you're actually not screen but something
known as a view right so let me just
correct this so this would be a view
right so a view is you know pretty much
we have
a lot with it so a view is pretty much
which you can just push on your screen
or in your XML file and it would display
nicely so what this area adapter do is
like think of like this you have a
chessboard right and you have all those
Associated players with it I guess it is
32 I guess because you know two four
rows of eight players each so it makes
it 32 so you what you do is that you put
that chess board and all those 32
players inside a magical box which has
area that will written on it so you
pretty much put it your chess board
right here so this is your box and you
are like this pretty much right so so
you are this and you put your chess
board and your players inside re adapter
and what this did is that it gave you
out a nice chess board with all the
players pretty much aligned in there
what the heck
aligned in their respective positions
right so the King is that the position
where it should be and all the other
players as well well I don't know the
names of all of them actually so that
was a pretty lame example wasn't that so
that's pretty much what our adapter does
and let me just quickly show you how a
basic example of this thing would look
like right so what I'm gonna do is right
here on the top I'm gonna say it's a
string my items right so this would be
like let's just say I'm creating
let's just say I'm creating a for my own
website code down so I'm just gonna say
what do you want to learn today and then
I'm gonna give you a list of items like
HTML CSS then I would say JavaScript I
would say you
Android programming why not then I'm
gonna see you to learn angularjs why not
then ionic as well well these are kind
of interrelated languages then C++ and
blah blah blah because that's the most
important language so what we have is an
area of string right there and what I
want to do is now I want to create an
area that row right so I'm gonna say
array adapter and it just includes the
required file as well and inside these
angular brackets I'm gonna say the type
of the our adapter which it would be so
this is a string and I'm gonna say this
is an adapter equals new array adapter
string and then I'm gonna say pretty
much I'm gonna give it three arguments
right so the first one would be the
context this right here then the second
argument what this would do or actually
contain would be the layout which you
want to use so we don't have a layout
yet do we
well you need to create a layout right
so in my resources layout folder with my
freaking activity layout I'm gonna say a
new layout resource file and let's just
say this is my list layout layout here
we go and pretty much it is not meant to
be an activity alright so this is a just
a file for my layout so I'm not saying
it to be linear layout I'm saying it to
be a simple text view with Android
actually you need this XML I think
whatever this is so I'm gonna say now
text view then this thing and Android
world Android layout wait to be much
parent right
the same with the height as well layout
I to be much parent and that is pretty
much it
what we need for our layout to work a
simple one right so all of that stuff
you do would be you know just push into
this file and then a view would be
returned and you just kind of see it a
little bit of time so we'll just stick
with me so I'm gonna say now that this
is r dot layout dot my list layout right
so now it points to my list layout then
finally I'm gonna say that this is my
items right there see so it's working
pretty good okay so now we have created
an adapter so I've shown in my data so
what I want to do is I want to set this
adapter to my ListView so I'm gonna say
that this is my first ListView God set
adapter right and I'm gonna say this as
my adapter suite so everything looks
nice and easy so let's just try to run
our application let me just quickly fire
off get emotional so here's my nexus and
let me just close it for a while
and here we go pretty much let's just
close this as well and paint as well so
we're good to go for the emulator but it
will just take a couple of seconds to
build
okay so we are good to go now and here
we are so alright so looks like hey so
this rotated but this didn't what's
going on well oh wait a minute
I guess my arm with many first let me
just change this to let me just
completely remove that right so now
let's just fire our application and what
the heck is going on again II motion
well you look drunk and this one right
so all looks good here right so yeah so
I'm just gonna fire this again and see
if it works or not
okay so now what we have is a list of
items here and this list of items is all
these items which we have right here
these HTML CSS JavaScript all that stuff
right so you can see that I could pretty
much interact with these items but right
now nothing actually happens because I'm
not actually attached any of the stuff
to these any of the listeners sorry I
meant to say so yeah so that's pretty
much and these are each each one of
these is an individual text view if
you're wondering so that is the use of
your all list layout so each of these is
a text view and this is rendered by our
adapter and all that stuff which is
going on within this our adapter class
so that's how you pretty much create a
very basic ListView and in the next
tutorial and we're just gonna show you
how to make it a bit advanced and
creative and that's it for this tutorial
