another ionic tutorial and in this
toriel four-hour timer application I'm
gonna create a functionality very user
gun and through his own number and the
countdown would start from there onwards
so so far we have just hard coded this
to number 10 but we can actually just
make this application a bit more dynamic
so to do that again we need to hook up
with our code and first of all let me
just create a simple input type let's
just say this is my input area for any
further customization and the label of
glass item item input and that's all
unbuilt span class item label and right
here
input type number and I'm gonna say
right here seconds to elapse and right
here I'm gonna say ng bind our ng model
actually what we have here my timer
right yep so look like yeah I guess is
it input label or item label
yeah there's input label actually so it
looks much better now okay so now we
have got this thing right here you can
see it nicely nicely works and if I
reload this actually we can just get
this input area some space to breathe
margin-bottom
10 pixel and margin top 20 pixels not
really
like that so let's just keep it to this
one only and right here we just start
the timer
it works well if I reload
change it to like let's just say 20
started okay now the problem start from
here first problem is that we have said
this max timer so obviously if we check
out the documentation it says that this
is actually required so because this is
required let's just set it to an
arbitrary large number and let's try
that out now let's say this is 20 start
again now this thing doesn't really
looks like it's working now the reason
is that with angular if you try to weigh
data binding like with ng model there
comes a sort of problem because of
different child's creating their own
scope and if you have watched my angular
tutorials I guess I have this discussed
that thing this thing in very much
detail and the solutions for this as
well now the most basic solution would
be to make use of an object instead of a
variable so what we can do quickly in
our code is just change this I can get
rid of this one I can change this code
to school dot my timer is an object and
then I can assign this a value so now I
just need to change everywhere to a
value this is a value of value and yeah
that's pretty much it I guess and yeah
here as well I need to change it to
value and here as well so that should
pretty much do our job
start doesn't yeah it looks like it has
done but yeah we need here as well so
that we circle actually displays so
start condoms working but the thing
doesn't look like it's it's working okay
I guess we need this thing right there
so you can just actually just set this
to this one only and wait a minute yeah
okay so we can just make use of this or
no actually what we can do pretty much
is we can actually just initialize this
thing from 10 but we can actually change
it only only when your input is changed
so let's just say ng change my time are
fixed is my timer not value so this will
run only when your input is changed not
when the counter is you know just
decrementing so let's just change this
to 15 16 17 18 you can see that this
effect right there which just changes
the maximum value so I started from 30
you can see it pretty much works really
well and it looks very cool so that's
how you pretty much create a very basic
application and yes I'm making use of a
lot you can just make use of a popover
dialog box as well which would look nice
on phone devices and yeah there's a bit
of problem with this you can just click
on the start button again so you would
like to disable this button once it is
clicked and yes we could actually just
implement that as well and I probably
might do that in the next tutorial
and if you like this tutorial again then
