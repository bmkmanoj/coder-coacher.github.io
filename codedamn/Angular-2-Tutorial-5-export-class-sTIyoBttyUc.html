May ho and welcome to your fifth
tutorial I guess for angular 2 and in
this tutorial we'll be talking a bit
about this template and these export
class app component so we already know
that in Maine dot tes this bootstrap
simply just initiates our application
and then your index dot HTML file this
bootstrap looks for this thing my app
and populate it with this template so
what you can do in this export class is
that you can add your own properties and
methods and just like we used to do in
angular 1 from expressions we can use
them in right here in this template so
if I do like name equals go down and if
I just replace it from code damn I look
at the browser you can see we get hello
angular 2 whoa this is name actually
hello angular 2 code damn so you can
just assign a property here and just
give it a name here and you could also
put a comma if you don't like a
semicolon in the class so if I have like
my array here as HTML CSS JavaScript
then you could do something like name my
array and angular will automatically try
to convert our into string like you can
see but it's too bad to do that well I
guess it is doing something like to
string yeah so yeah it makes use of the
two string method so you can actually
customize this yourself looking that
later on so again you have you know you
can just do something like this and one
thing to note is that since we are you
making use of types
script you can actually implicitly
specify the data types for these named
variable or my array variable so if I
can say that name is a string only and
then name is code down so it works
equally well but if I change it to like
a number so though it would work fine
because as I told you that
typescript would always always compile
into a JavaScript file no matter how
many errors you have in typescript but
it will surely throw some errors in the
console so as you can see it says file
change detected error semicolon expected
semicolon expected all right come polish
and complete all right so it's saying
it's a make all unexpected all right so
what now okay like that now as you can
see it throws me an error type number is
not assignable to type string but
eventually it just compiles into a
JavaScript file because it has to so if
you see on the script it kind of looks
hell and it is seriously I don't know
how to even say how how you can just
write this code without any compiler
well this is kinda looks like an off
skated code but anyways so coming back
to here well we you can actually make
use of something known as a constructor
function as well so if I write
constructor here and right here I can
just say this dot name is equal to code
like that and I can just get rid of this
here you go
and if I just change this to one two
three four five it work but again in
console it should probably try never
doesn't well I don't know some sort of
things going on here but you know you
can just do that thing with typescript
so yeah so you get the idea that hardest
working and yeah so that will be all for
this tutorial and in the next tutorial
we'll be looking at something cool and
angular 2 and yeah if you liked it then
