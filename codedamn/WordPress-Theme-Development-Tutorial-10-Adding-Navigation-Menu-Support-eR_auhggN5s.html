tenth WordPress team development
tutorial my name is mijo and in this
tutorial we'll be starting off with the
header portion of our website and if I
look into PSD some things I realize is
that I need a 960 pixel sort of grid for
the header purpose for the inner one and
the red color of the header spans on the
whole page then we need a placeholder
for this logo alright and finally we
would require a menu sort of thing for
besides the logo so let's get started
now first of all what I want to do in
header dot PHP is write some content
let's just say this is not died HTML
then I have HTML head and head I have
Medicare said utf-8 yes you can make use
of that block info function as well for
this one then next I have something like
in title then inside body I have stuff
like let's just say header and it would
be great if we could actually just put
everything inside let's just leave it
anyways so it would be good with header
only so for header this would define our
red color thing so we need to have a
grid so let's just say this n 60 and I'm
not gonna make you the bootstrap or
anything because you know why just
include a bunch of files when you just
need grid system which you can actually
build yourself in a few CSS lines then
for with an N 60 I want to divide e of
logo and DIF and for now I'm just gonna
write it myself but later on we're gonna
see how you can just make it more
dynamic so that any user can edit it
from WordPress dashboard only without
messing up with code okay so the next
thing is that we need to
make this menu somehow now it would be
trivial in HTML because you just have to
start writing you will an LR and this
then customize it with CSS but with
WordPress obviously you would want a bit
of you know more dynamic nests and
customizability because what press do
provides you with something known as
menus here and the reason why menus are
pretty much not appearing right now is
that because we haven't added support
for them yet and what press do require
you to pretty much add a support or
basically inform WordPress for anything
which you require for your team so let's
do that
in supply and just go to your functions
dot PHP and just open your PHP tag and
say that add the team support and for
the feature I want its menus so it's
gonna do that for you now reload and you
can see that you got menus right here so
now you can go ahead and do that now
if you have just added that support it
would show you a blank thing so let's
just say this is my primary menu and
just create a menu and just add a sample
page and pretty much on home page also
so let's just say clean com
home let's add this one so there we go
alright so we are done here and the next
thing is that in other teams you might
have looked at in team locations you get
things like primary header menu or
secondary header menu footer header menu
so how do that work well to make that
work what you need to do is pretty much
say register nav menu and as it popped
up we need to pass in two arguments the
location one that's the location B
primary and the description would be
something which would be shown here so
if I say like primary
menu navigation save this reload pretty
much you can see that in team locations
I get this primary header menu
navigation if I can check that and save
menu we'll be good to go so you could
just add pretty much some more like
secondary and just main footer all that
stuff but I'm gonna leave it with
primary only so what you have seen here
is that we just did this code without in
any function usage or something so when
you grow your template make it more you
know like add a lot of code you would
like to keep a record off there you have
you know just hope then menu or register
menus and that would kind of make it
more you know easy to customize and
pretty much organize your code so what
we can do here is create a function
which would say like team option set up
and inside here I can just indent this
code a little bit and down here what I
want to do is action and I want to run
this function team option set up
whenever my team is initialized so this
would run whenever the team is
initialized and the initialization phase
would be before the user interaction
phase so you are pretty sure that every
time the user is browsing your team
browsing what first administrator area
with your team active then the menu
support would be already available
before any user interaction so this is
the function name and the next two we
don't need them for now so I'm just
gonna leave it to here only and if you
reload pretty much nothing changes
because you know we have just organized
record instead of doing anything
so inside header dot PHP obviously we
don't want HTML body to be close because
that's something footer would do
so there we go and inside index dot PHP
we need to include our header and footer
and one more thing I forgot to do here
is that say PHP WP head and right here
in index I'm gonna say get header and
get let's just see if that works
you can see we get order as the name but
that's the only thing we have on the
documentation or the team right now so
to add a menu to header what I'm gonna
do is right here I'm gonna say PHP WP
nav menu and this would be primary oh
yeah
question mark so this would be the WB
nav menu would be the function which
would call a menu based on its name
right here which you specified not here
but actually right here so if you just
create like a secondary and you know
footer menu as well so you can just
output that in foot around wherever you
once again free to be so let's reload
this you can see we get sample page as
the output so this is my menu structure
so there's a sample page and you post
titles save this menu reload you can see
I get a couple of items here so this is
still far far away from looking like
this so but pretty much we have God
the dynamic feature for at least the
navigation for now and why not let's
just make it home donations gallery
something like that so let's just get
rid of this so for custom links I'm
gonna say home then for donations then
for gallery then we want sermons sermons
then for events pages and shop pages and
the shop so here we go save this menu
and you'll be good to go so if you just
look in the structure how WordPress laid
this down you can see that what was
provided us pretty much a lot of things
to do like you know we have selectors
like menu primary menu and class of menu
with allies as well we have a lot of
customizability with CSS so that would
be a plus point so that's how you very
much add a support for menu and add it
actually on your page and in the next
tutorial I'm gonna create a real header
out of it but the next one would be
simply just sort of CSS and HTML gaming
so that's all for this tutorial and if
