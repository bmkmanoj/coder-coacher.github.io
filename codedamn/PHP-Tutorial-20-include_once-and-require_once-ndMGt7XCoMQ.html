hole and welcome to your 20th PHP
tutorial in which we'll be looking at
something called include once and
require once now these two functions are
just like the functions which we learn
in the previous tutorial but the
difference is that these two would
include the file only once even if you
are including the same file on the
including page well that's weird so
let's just take a look at an example and
let's try to see what's happening so
let's say I want to include this file
dot PHP here okay so I include file dot
PHP here so let's say just just echo the
name of the file here file at PHP and
let's say I include another file inside
file of PHP so let's say I'm field file
- dot PHP here and I include file - dot
PHP here as well so what's happening
here is include this file - dot PHP is
included two times one by this main page
and another by the file which is
included on the main page so if I create
a file - dot PHP here file - dot PHP and
I just echo here file - lot bhp then
what happens is when I'll run this
script here on xx page you see we got
the output as file - dot PHP file dot
PHP and file - not PHP I'll just give it
a little indentation if that helps so
you see that file - dot PHP here it is
file dot PHP
filed with a PHP file of PHP and file do
dot PHP so you see that this file is
included two times because if it wasn't
then this wouldn't be outputted two
times so this could happen if you are
working on a large website because these
errors are difficult to pick up so to
fix this what we can make use of is
include once
now this include ones what it would do
is it would just include this file once
no matter how many time you include it
so if I place include ones here on the
file - dot PHP on the main page xx dot
PHP that what happens is whenever this
script would run it would check whether
this file do not PHP is already included
or not and if it is included then it
wouldn't include this again so if I
reload this you see that the third one
is now gone so this one performs a check
whether this file is already included in
the document or not so now what happens
is even if I ride in a lot of times then
the score wouldn't run because the file
- dot PHP is already included but if I
change each of this to include then what
happens is this file would be included
as many times as I am writing this
include file - dot PHP now just like
this we have required ones which would
obviously produce a fatal error that the
file is not found so I'll just write
require for now and require here as well
require here as well okay so here if I
do like right now we get the three
outputs file - dot PHP file dot PHP and
file to the PHP but if I change it to
require once then the third one would be
gone and if I change it to let's say
an invalid file then you see that we got
a warning and fatal error and this code
below require once won't even execute so
this code won't run so if I reload this
you see that I didn't got the echo below
this so that's how require once and
include ones work and that's how they
are different from require and include
and I hope you learned something from
this tutorial and if you did then don't
