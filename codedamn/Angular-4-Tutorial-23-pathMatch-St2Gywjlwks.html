angular tutorial in which we're going to
take a look at what path match is in
angular and why would you probably need
that though actually you wouldn't
require path that all the time but I
guess in some case if you need that then
you should know what that is or if
you're at least reader than somebody
else good so bat match is essentially
just telling angular whether you want to
continue with a route or not if the
parent route matches right so what
essentially angular is doing behind the
scenes is that when you revisit a URL
something like this angular decides okay
so I'll just break this URL into parts
first of all I see this users right so
I'm going to look for the users okay
angular says yeah here we find we have
the users all right now angular would
look at the path match right so we have
this property fast match which is by
default prefix now angular would look at
this property this is set and would
consider this as prefix if it does not
set now what prefix means is that
angular is taking a look at the part of
the URL and says okay that thing matches
but what about the else what about the
rest of the URL so with the prefix
angular takes it one at a time if the
part matches a little bit in the
stunting angular says ok I'm going to
continue running this part and take a
look if it matches of course if you'd
rather consumes the full URL or not
right so in our case it matches the user
so it will just continue searching for
children or any other particular match
then we have this methyl amputee which
inside our children matches these two
both of these right now angular has to
decide again which one it has to go with
again we have this idea right now which
is five so angular sees that this has
got our perfect route and it has
consumed all of the part of the routes
so we're going to go with this one
all right so far so good but what
happens if we make this full instead now
if I save this and go to the stage you
can rather see that we get full full
northbound now the reason for that is
that instead of matching it one at a
time
angular stays if the Strongs matches I'm
going to go with it otherwise I'm going
to leave it at all so it goes to users
well it does match user but apparently
it is not the full match right so this
would pretty much just match localhost
and then users right it would just match
local host users with a path match of
wool but the path match of prefix it
will match the users and then it will
check if it actually consumes the whole
URL or not but right now with a smash-up
full it just stops if the URL is not
completely consumed so yeah that is how
pretty much bad match works in a
nutshell and I don't think we really
need to explicitly set it all the time
maybe there are some use cases but I
haven't come across them yet so yeah
that's all for this one and if you liked
it then please don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
