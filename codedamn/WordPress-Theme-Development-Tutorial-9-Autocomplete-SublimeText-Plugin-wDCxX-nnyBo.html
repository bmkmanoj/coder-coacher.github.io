Mickel and welcome to your ninth
WordPress Team Development tutorial and
in this tutorial I'm gonna quickly go
over do how to set up your sublime text
with WordPress team development because
if you look like right now you would see
that if you start writing PHP then you
don't have actually access to you know
autocomplete features like if I write
anything like mr. settings there's a
sort of function like that so you don't
have access to this thing and the reason
we would need this a more solid reason
would be that what pres contains a lot
of functions methods hooks constants and
all that stuff
so it would be kind of cumbersome and
boring to just go to documentation every
time to look how many arguments we need
to pass in and what is the order of
arguments so an autocomplete plug-in
would save us a lot of time so to do
that just go to preferences package
control write install package hit enter
and it would just load the repositories
you can see down here then right in
WordPress and just install the first one
and it says installing packaged
WordPress down here you can see and it
send me back in installed successfully
alright so the next thing is that you
have done installing that so just go
ahead and write like even if I can do
that it's function star PHP because that
would kind of make more sense so I could
just go ahead and create a function like
function my function and right here I
can say like register setting and you
can see that on my tab it gave me this
autocomplete thing like option group
option name sanitize callback so this is
kind of useful and this is not I'm not
gonna use it in this tutorial but we're
gonna make use of this thing later on
when we are just you know kind of
developing a real team so I guess I
would just end this tutorial here and
from the next tutorial onwards we are
extremely you know just extremely
excited to start
for this because it's been too long
since we are talking about other stuff
like organizing things and you know
different stuff so from the next
tutorial onwards we're gonna start with
what pristine development and if you
