your ninth PHP tutorial in which will be
discussing about the second condition
statement the switch 1 now 2 switch 1 is
similar to the f1 but switch only
compares for equality nothing else and
switch would actually work only for
integers well that's bad but that's how
it is so you can have equality
Compassion's and switch for Strings so
let's take a look let's say I have an um
so have a string one as well let's start
with simple one let's say I have dead so
what i will do is I'll type switch and i
would take SD r 1 now switch a curly not
a curly bracket a simple bracket and
really will pass in this so it sees me
that i want to work with this str1 and i
want to do something now after that
right curly brace this one these two
comes in Pierre and inside here right
kiss and right one and a colon now what
this means is actually switch this
number and when this is one then do this
when this is to do this when this is
three do this well this could be
deadliest but actually this is useful in
certain conditions over the if one for
example let's say ever let's say I have
this one only so let's see if I have if
SD r equals to one I guess I didn't talk
to you about the or operator i would but
for now just remember that this all
would actually check for if this
statement is true
or this one is true in either case it
would execute the block of code below it
so i will be talking about this in more
detail in the next one but for now just
consider it as an option to run both of
these so if either one evaluates to true
then the code block under the if
statement would run so a similar
statement similar code for the switch
one would be if str is one if str is too
or if SDR is three this whole to 10 and
then we could use echo congo you lie in
one to 10 so in this case what we can do
is we could just write some cases case
for case 5 case 6 k-7 case 8 case 9 case
10 and right here echo go on go you are
in top 10 and break now we would be
discussing about break am inside the
loop section but for now let's just see
if I have case 11 as well and let go
this is 11 so if I didn't have to break
now actually house which works is that
let's see if I have this number one so
what would happen is when it compares
for one it would keep sliding down
sliding down unless it encounters a
break or the switch is closed so it's
kind of a slide so the slide starts from
the case itself so let's say this is
three then the slide would start from
the case three if this is too then slide
would start from case too and if this is
1 then the slide will start from case
one and it would keep falling down as
long as it does not encounter any break
statement so even if i had echo one here
and if i had it
Oh for here and this was this number was
too then what would be the output is it
would start from two since we don't have
any statements it would fall to three no
statements for four it would echo four
on the screen and then would keep
falling down then it would echo Congo
you are in the top ten this line right
here then again what would happen is it
would encounter this break now after it
encounters this break it would come out
of the switch statement if we did not
have this break right here then this
would also be a good so i hope the quick
introduction to the switch is clear to
you guys but if there's any problem then
you could ask me in the comments section
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial and in the next tutorial we'll
be discussing some more things on PHP
and in a couple of more tutorials we
would be finally starting with actual
development with PHP which we actually
do so that's it for this tutorial and
