and welcome to your eighteenth PHP
tutorial in which will be looking at how
to return a value from a function now
what does that even mean to return
something now in the last few tutorials
we looked at how to create function like
this function add this num 1 num2 so we
have created its function before and
what we did is we just summed the two
numbers supplied by the user and we
displayed it on the screen now what
happens is that let's say I want to
store this value somewhere and I don't
want to just echo it right away and just
throw it on the screen I want to do
something else with this so what i can
do is i can return this value from this
function where i am calling this
function so previously what we did is we
call this function like this add this 10
and 12 let's say so it will produce
ready to ask the output and once it
produces going to do it would right way
through it on the screen so it is
visible to the user but what we can do
is we can make use of something called
return now what this return does is
whenever i'll call this function this
whole expression turns out to beat the
value which is being returned so what is
happening here is let's say i have a
variable x equals twenty-two and i have
a variable y equals add this 10 and 12
so what happens is when this function is
called this function is called the
control goes here these two numbers are
added and they are returned now they are
returned where they return where they
are called so they are called as value
of y so when this is called this would
return something and that return value
would get stored inside why so currently
if I call why with arguments 10 and 12
then why also contains 22 and X also
contains 22 so if I echo
why right here and if I displayed on the
screen you see I got 22 but I could make
use of like my final result is like this
also so see that we got my final resort
I guess I should change it to users to
normal view so we got my final result is
22 now just like I have this value of y
here I could even make it or modify it
by any factor I like so i can multiply
it by tundra and then subtract 100 for
men as well then i can add 78 then minus
ninety nine hundred and one then divided
by 10 or whatever I want to do and then
I can echo your updated value is this
which I don't know what would be so it
surprisingly is 20 87.9 okay so that's
how the return type in a function works
and not only this you can return
anything you like so for example let's
say you have a function here let's say
greet user and let's say is a name let's
say you want to echo hello name now this
would immediately echo the hello name as
the name as supplied but I want to store
it somewhere let's say I change it to
return hello name so what I'll do is
I'll write it as result equals create
user Mabel so what happens is now in the
result there is the string hello name
but it's up to me now that whether i use
it or not so II I can display some
HTML here and then i can again echo
result here freely so i can make the
call to the function somewhere and then
use that value somewhere with the help
of return statements you see and not
only this in PHP you could actually
return an array as well so let's say you
have to return a lot of values let's say
you want to return let's say just do
i'll use for the simplicity of this
tutorial so let's say you have calc as a
function and it accepts or let's just
say square and cube as a function which
would return the square of a number and
a cube of a number past so let's say we
have answer here as SQ c you be as let's
sit down and inside hero what i did is
square is n star n and q is n star n
star and simple enough and then what i
want to do is I want to return square
and I want to return q now this won't
work because in a script in a function
you can have only one returned actually
you could have as many returns as you
want but only one would be executed why
because as soon as the first return is
encountered all the other good is
ignored below it so let's say even if I
have like echo blah blah blah here then
this code would never be run because
once the control comes here it returned
Square and it kills this function called
so the control comes here it finds this
okay I'm a sine square the value of
square the cube the value of cube and it
returns the school
that's it then nothing else runs below
this so even if you have a return
statement here it won't run even if you
have an echo here even if you have
something else here that won't run so
that's the reason you can't return
multiple values but to return that we
can make use of an array so we can
return a single array which contains
multiple values obviously so we can make
use of array let's same result is an
array with square and cube as the values
now I can make use of return result
which is an area so there is no problem
now because I have returned an array
therefore this value is also an array
now so this is not an integer this is
not a string this is an array so we can
make use of what amp here or pintar
pintar would be pretty here so let's
make use of printer our answer let's
reload this so inside the view source
you see that we got an array as output
with the zeroth element that's 100 and
the first element as thousand which
makes sense because the square root of n
is 100 and the square of hunt square
cube of 10 is thousand let's try it with
let's say two so you see that square of
two is four and cube of two is eight so
that's how basically return works and
you could pretty much return anything
from a function as long as you are not
breaking the code so that's awful that's
all for this tutorial and if you liked

so that's it for this tutorial and thank
