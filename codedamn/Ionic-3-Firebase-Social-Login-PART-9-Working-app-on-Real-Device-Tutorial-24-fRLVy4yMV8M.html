another tutorial in which we'll be
finally finishing off with our
application the social login one by
implementing it on a real device and
probably in the next one will be just
seeing how to create a signed apk to
actually distribute it on the Play Store
so finally the app would look something
like this we would be implementing in a
browser within our application which is
when you click on that and in that
browser would be opened and something
like this would happen so all the
redirection would take place inside the
application itself and pretty much the
users information would be returned
within the same app so let's just get
started all right to do that open up
your project again and just follow these
things right so first of all add this go
to a plugin which is browser tab and by
the way you would be able to find all of
these all of this code in the
description on the form so make sure to
check that out if you want to get a
little speed up in your process first of
all add this browser type plugin then
add this in a browser type plugin and
again all of this is already in the
description for you to copy and paste
from the form so make sure to check that
out then you have the universal links
plugin and by the way what we are
actually doing right here and the reason
why this works is because now we are
telling firebase to use an actual HTTP
URL as a base URL instead of making use
of file protocol and we'll just take a
look at that how we can do that now once
you have installed this one install the
plugin buildin for one plugins and once
you do all of that just go to your
firebase project and what you want to do
is go to this dynamic links here now if
this is your first time visiting just
dynamic links on this project then you
would not see something like this
you would see a button here get started
and once you click on that what you
would get is some
things like something like this once you
click on that you would get an interface
like this right so she's select Android
so what you want to do here is write
your Android app name for my case this
was gone go down don't test demo app
right and just your Android name up just
register your application click on next
next and you are pretty much done now
again you have to do that from here not
from the other app section now once you
do that you would represent it with a
URL something like this just copy this
URL and go back to your project right
here now in your project open your
config dot XML file just go to the
bottom and you should be able to see
something like this
so just paste this thing again this
thing is available now you would not see
this you have to do this yourself this
thing is again available on the forum so
make sure to check that out if you want
to then paste the host without HTTPS and
all those lashes and here goes the auth
domain now how to find this one well you
already have that so go to your app
folder and inside your app module now
copy and paste this thing this is your
auth domain right so just copy this and
paste this inside right here and keep
everything else same and you are pretty
much done one final thing you need to do
is go to your home dog TS file where we
had implemented all this nice and easy
stuff and right here instead of doing
sign-in with pop up which we were doing
previously do a sign in with redirect
now once this happens what happens is
that you are not anymore using pop up
for authentication but silent with
redirect works with file protocol so it
redirects to your sign-in provider then
firebase takes in control with the
dynamic link and all that good stuff
happens and then dynamically sends you
back
to your application and you get the
result again because redirect does not
really provide you any information we do
not get pretty much we do not need to
have any sort of result here but when
there is a redirect is complete that
means the oath is done so you need to
get the redirect result and then we have
the response code which pretty much
contains everything just like it did for
the sign-in with provider and rest of
the code is pretty much same right and
yeah that's pretty much it so once you
are done with that what do you want to
do is run your application so just go to
here and hit ionic auto or run Android
and wait for your application to build
now once it's built you should see
something like this
now you can pretty much try with any
provider for example if you go with
Google you would see that it opens and
in our browser instead of asking for a
browser like Chrome or default browser
which was terribly wrong so again this
one looks quite appealing than the
previous one and you can see that
firebase is taking control of all the
authentication and since I had already
authenticated my Google account
for this app so I do not need to do it
again so firebase is just getting some
tokens from Google server and we should
probably be back to our app really soon
and you can see that we get our result
back and now we have access to a user's
information so that's how pretty much
you would implement a very basic social
login application with an ionic and
angular and firebase so again that's all
for this one and if you like that then
please don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching I'll see you then
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
