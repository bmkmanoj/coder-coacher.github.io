May hood and welcome to your 16th
typescript tutorial in which I'm gonna
show you how to create methods and
typescript and it's pretty easy just
like we created a constructor it's kind
of just like that so let's say you are
creating a method which returns likes
and K and this would again would accept
all associate it accepts nothing got it
and just make use of the Facebook Likes
in our class itself so it just returns
us return Facebook or actually this dot
Facebook Likes divided by thousand times
a key symbol right like that
and you can just specify it something
like that if you want to otherwise it's
just fine as well so you can just say
console.log Google dot likes and K
something like that and if you just
build this thing and run it right so
reload console you can see that we get
twelve point three four five K right so
it is just making use of the property or
the class itself
which you just call in the constructor
so you can just do pretty much anything
with a method you can create your own
methods and do some manipulations and do
a lot of useful stuff so we'd be making
use of a lot of methods later on so that
is one display in this tutorial so yeah
so that is all for this tutorial
and if you liked it then don't forget
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one real
quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
