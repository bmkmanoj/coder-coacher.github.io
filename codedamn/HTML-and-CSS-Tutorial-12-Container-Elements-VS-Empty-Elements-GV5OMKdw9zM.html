your built HTML and CSS tutorial in
which we'll be learning about container
and empty tags now this is a topic I
would like to talk to you
maybe tutorial number four or five but
it is too late a bit but never mind so
here we are with this tutorial and
container and empty tags would be my
special attention to you now container
tags basically means a tag which has put
an opening tag and a closing tag all
these tags you see except this our
container tags for example we have a
opening tag for HTML then we have a
closing tag for HTML now we have an
opening tag for head we have a closing
tag for head you have opening tag for
body are similarly a closing tag for
body but you look when you look at this
meta then we are we have just opening
tag of this meta character set and no
closing tag not we are not doing like
like meta so why is this because this is
some taxes invalid now meta there are
certain tags in HTML which are self
closing or basically empty tags which do
not require any closing and for example
these some of these tags are dr you do
not close be out like this like this
this is invalid we have BR we have IMG
as empty tag then we have meta as I told
you then
let me think we have I guess HR
horizontal rule this is just useless tag
don't use it ever this is kind of HTML
for tag but just for an example I am
telling you that HR is an empty tag and
we have a bunch of more tags which are
empty tags and do not require any
closing tag so I would also like to
discuss the method of writing empty tags
and this tutorial only for example a
container tag is written in the
following format container tag and the
continue tag but an empty tag is written
like this empty empty tag and either you
just write it like this way and or you
write it like this way so just like I
have written this meta car said utf-8
and the name of this all the things or
diagram and attributes are there a space
and then a slash with an angular racket
so that's how you write a self-closing
tag and this is adopted from xml
standard so
most of the times we do not write it
like this we just do like this but if
you are following a very strict standard
of HTML our writing basically XHTML so
you need to do like this one because if
you don't do like this then your
document document want validate so for
our tutorials we won't be using any
forward slash for empty tags but it's up
to your wish that you want to use them
or not so this was a short tutorial on
container an empty tags in HTML and if
you are not subscribed yet and are
willing to then you're free to so I'll
see you then in the next tutorial and
don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
