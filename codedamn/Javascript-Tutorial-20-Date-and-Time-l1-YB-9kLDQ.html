JavaScript tutorial in this tutorial we
will be learning about something called
date and time in JavaScript in the
nineteenth tutorial or in the last
tutorial we created a simple clock which
gets incremented with the help of set
interval function every second in this
tutorial we'll be creating or basically
will be knowing what is date and time in
JavaScript and how did sometimes work in
JavaScript before starting with the
tutorial I would like you to introduce a
bit to the history of time and date in
JavaScript now javascript has actually a
certain base time which is 1 Jan 1970
and the midnight now basically the
clocks of JavaScript are set on this
time and the number of seconds basically
are counted from this time in the unix
time stop by this I mean okay let me
first create an object right here I'll
show you what did I tell you right now
let's supply the date as one John
1970 and the base time
the midnight and I guess I didn't open
the chrome today
twenty-eight tutorial an open way to
grow
oh I guess I just closed the window
and here you go
and if we try to inspect element' this
lets console.log they don't get that
I'll explain in a while what they are
just showing you what did I mean by that
base time if I try to view it in console
we get this number now what this number
is this is the UNIX timestamp format now
the clocks of JavaScript are basically
set on this number and if we try like if
we try to get the date in millisecond so
one two three four five we get dead dog
get day and if we refresh this we get
four maybe or let's make it a more
technical get full year I'll explain all
these methods right now 1970 this this
unix time step is somewhere in the 1970
and if I do like create a really big
number or maybe bigger than this
whoa I'm bigger than this and finally we
get to 29 okay so let me introduce you
to the date object to create a date in
JavaScript what we do is we type the
variable to hold the date object and we
do new date and in the parentheses you
can supply your own date to be passed as
a new date but if you just leave the
parentheses then this date object would
hold the recent or the current date
let's try the console log each of its
main property this string would give us
a long string of date containing all the
useful values let's try to write fast
it's console.log they'd get it then we
have did it ours
and we get date dot get minutes
and you have guests now what I'm going
to write get seconds
and you have already guessed now what
I'm going to write did get
what he said that milliseconds
and then finally again let's write down
that function I use right now get that
let's try to run this in a console okay
pretty good we see date returns a long
string of date containing all the values
my time zone the time the date the man
the day the date ear all that stuff get
fully a returns to us 2015 which is
currently right now get month returns us
to now what does that mean is zero
stands for Jan 1 for FEHB and like so on
indexing starts from 0 as usual
get months we have discussed yet did
now get did actually starts with one
actually no zero indexing here we don't
have any zero date so today is actually
26 March and it returns us 26 get our
students 12 its 12 right here now get
minutes 3 get seconds 32 and get
milliseconds 57 okay so this program
actually ran into console at the exact
time 12 3 32 and 57 this is the exact
time when this program running to this
remember we have milliseconds from 0 to
999
now this stuff right here gives us the
number of seconds or kind of
milliseconds past not this stuff right
here this number is the number of
seconds and the last three digits are
the number of milliseconds passed and
this is basically the unix time step and
this this number would overflow in
somewhere around 20 38 when the unit's
timestamp would crash and this is
referred as kind of new y2k problem the
new bug I'll explain this in the next
tutorial what is this and trust me this
is very interesting so this was all
about important stuff regarding data
object and using all these methods and
there are a lot lot lot more methods
than just these ones if you want to
learn all of them you can go to Mozilla
developers network look at them and they
are not much of useful but using these
all these methods you can technically do
everything you want to do with date
so this tutorial was about date and time
in JavaScript and I hope you liked the
tutorial and don't forget to subscribe
and yeah happy dating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
