tutorial we'll be starting off with the
usage of Chrome that storage API and
let's have a look how it works so on the
documentation page we are right now and
let me go through with the documentation
first and then I'll explain you in easy
word what the heck all that means so it
says that it's available since chrome
wasn't ready for missions needed our
storage alright
content scripts fully supported got that
all of you boring stuff manifest says
that you have to declare the storage
permission not a problem then his little
note which says that confidential user
information should not be stored storage
areas and encrypted and by that it means
that it isn't storing your data in any
hashed or encryption forms and it stores
everything in plain text so if you were
looking to store the login credentials
of your websites the users and we will
localstorage then you should immediately
drop that idea so
the next thing we have is the storage
and bottling limits so it says that
Chrome da store is not a big truck it's
a series of tubes and if you don't
understand these tubes can be filled
blah blah blah
so coming to the example first example
it is creating a function here Save
Changes it's getting a simple value of
textarea somehow and just a blank check
otherwise Chrome that storage not
synchronize that set value the value
function this is a callback function if
this was successful then this callback
function would execute so this is just
simple thing
let's see some advanced example so it is
a chromeless storage or changed add
listener and all that stuff down there
so let's start it our own way so
here's our previous extension which was
the
rich Twitter modifier all right so let's
fix the thing about doing here first of
all exchange it to
let's say just a line feeder what we'll
be doing is we'll be just getting in
line from the user and will be storing
it and retrieving it with chrome but
storage and the description should be
stores just a lie
I don't need any icons right now so I'll
just comment out this code background
page not required version should be 1.0
permissions storage very much that's it
so I'll just remove that and we have got
our manifest ready I will let this key
that's these files right there reside
there
okay so now we need a
the file which triggers whenever we
click on the browser icon so browser
action should be
and next on HDL
this should be default
Papa shouldn't it be
and oops here we go
reload and Abel
let me disable it from the meanwhile so
that it doesn't just cause any confusion
here's the line feeder and since we
don't have anything to work with an
index dot HTML file - now it sure those
black results so let's populate this a
little bit
all right so
title doesn't matter
we'll just create it textarea here
yeah and I'll just assign it an ID save
life
the script should do fine
let me show you I'd do it if I have
similar script no we don't have it so
that should work
and here down here
what we'll do is
I'll write document dot and we need
something
to trigger on input type button' ID save
or a you should obviously be still life
and that's it so I will say document dot
get element by ID save dot on black
function I hope you're getting me this
is all plain JavaScript nothing fancy
about here so I just want value stored
in this variable let's just allow it for
the mean time to check whether this code
even works or not so here we have our
code
let's see what happens so first of all
I'll just remove
this whoa geez that was a big blunder
but anyways
it's reload this
okay that's embarrassing let me check
out with console
on click of null
so let's just find this hole even a
window
now let's see if it helps
let's reload this
and yes it does so we got the alert
whatever the text we had inside this
and the next thing we need to do is I'll
disclose this that's interrupting a lot
so the next thing we need to do is we
need to save this line inside the chrome
storage and how we do that will make use
of chrome storage API so I think this
tutorial is extended over five to seven
minutes I guess so that's it for this
part of the tutorial and we'll be coding
with our chrome storage API in the next
one so till then stay tuned unknown
