me hole and welcome to your very first
react.js
tutorial in which I'll try to implement
the winner logic so this is going to be
a bit tricky because to know who the
winner is we have to calculate which
person has got the columns any column
any row or any diagnosing right so yeah
let's just do this so I'm going to
create a function let's say check winner
and inside here we already have access
to our board so what we are essentially
looking for is if our board is like 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 like this so we have a
winner if I don't know if we have like
zero zero three five zero three seven
right so I guess we got to calculate
some moves here we have a window 4 0 3 5
yeah yes we have to do this 1 4 6 0 3 6
I guess zero one two three four five six
one four seven two five two three four
five eight right then we have winner for
a diagonal
0 1 2 3 4 0 or 8 right we have a winner
for 0 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 2 4 6 2 4
and we have a winner for I guess what we
have done so far
g36 is this one verse images to private
is this then we have done our to
diagnose then we need to do these
columns right so we have a winner for 0
1 2 we have a winner for 3 4 5 and we
have finally a winner for 6 7 8 ok so
that was quite some moves right so we
have in all 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 moves
for which we have a winner right so now
we need to match our board and see if
any of these positions have a same
symbol and if it is the case then we
have a winner right plus what we can do
is we can create something like this dot
total moves equal to 0 and I'm just not
keeping it in state because I do not
want to rerender the component because
I'm just you know you can just do that
yeah you can keep that in state because
anyhow when we increment this total
moves the state is going to change
anyway so you can state total names is
frankly 0 right now we can say total
moves is just stop state dot total moves
plus plus like that
ok yeah so now we're going to say is 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 right so if total moves
are I guess we should just do that after
we have checked there is no winner so
essentially now we are going to check
our board for any of this possible
combination so I'm just going to go
additional you can just use off it make
use of map or you know all those fancy
or sick stuff I'm just going to go like
for that I put 0 eyes left and move
Scotland I plus plus so it's easy to see
right and then what I'm going to do is
say let's store our board and this state
board because that's kind of lengthy to
write so I'm going to stay if board
moves 0 now what's essentially happening
here is in the first go we pick up this
element and moves zero hour rather moves
I 0 right so mood I gives us this one
and then 0 gives us 0 I'm going to check
is equal to board moves I won and then
both board move i1 is equal to board
moves i2 right so what's happening here
is I can just increase the word whole
little here right so what we are doing
here is that I've created all the moves
all the valid moves which are you can
consider them to be winner moves
so if symbol a same symbol is there at
these places then we have a winner and
we should immediately stop the game so
I'm just checking the board if the board
index of 0 matches with board index of 3
and board index of 6 that means 0 3 6 if
these three values matches and
yeah or in the next code these three
values matches if these three value
matches if these three values matches
then we have a winner right so what we
can do is we can simply save return
board moves i0 it doesn't matter because
all the symbols are same right so now
the problem is is that in some cases
what would happen is that in first turn
you start from here so 0 3 6 are all
blank and they'll match right so check
winner would say that there is a winner
apparently but there is not we're just
comparing the blank values so what we
can do to fix this is actually we do not
need anything to fix this we already
have the logic in place just have to
call check winner and clicked event and
we can say if check winner is equal to X
are we going to stay or result is check
winner and we can say if result is equal
to X then we'll just say this state dot
the start step state rather okay and it
is true and we have a winner and that is
X right simple enough we can just add a
winner here as well as undefined you can
say and else if result is equal to oh I
know you can compress this code a little
and just bring very explicit with this
code and this is all ok so we
have some errors there and I'm just
missing a call and Shake winner is not
different where's sequitur just start
shake well yeah and I guess that should
be good I click on here and do we have
anything to check right now nope so we
can just say this dot state dot the game
ended right so now if I go ahead and
write okay
okay so there was a delay in the
updation because the stud sets that does
not immediately update your state it
takes a while so yeah the code is
working now you can see that we can
still move after the gamers in the month
one player has gone so we essentially
just want the player to reset the game
if any player has one so yeah so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial and if
you liked it then don't forget to

next one will just improve upon its
looks and good stuff and then see you
then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
