Google Chrome extension tutorial number
25 I guess and by now you would be
thinking whoa I have got documentation
at developers.google.com/live this
boring or tutorials from goddamn I learn
the chrome dot storage dot get myself
and you happily with this page right
here scroll down a little bit see that
yeah god damn taught me that whoa what
the heck is this you don't have any
examples for our chrome dot storage get
and when you see this thing you're like
whoa get out of my way I'm out and
here's where I come in
so let's get back to the point and what
we were learning in this tutorial was
chrome storage dot get now we get
instead of said if you notice would
allow you to get whatever value you
stood inside that particular key so the
syntax kinda confused a lot of new
developers but it's simple so right here
let's say if I create another button
input type button I did get and I say
well you get saved line and right here
if I said he won't listen to this
dot get element by ID dot click this
should be a function of nice little
function fired and what did you do is it
should first of all connected to the
chrome storage and it should get and
what it should get is the value and the
suspense here is that you don't enclose
it as an object so this value right here
stands for the value of your key and
obviously we do have a callback function
here which you could anonymously write
as well so I'll just omit this for the
time being and
if you notice these two should be same
swiffer right my line and go back to my
extension and play with it a little bit
so let's save a click on save line it
says success and I say actually I'm not
doing any alot here so what I'll do is
I'll just alert this thing
so now if I reload this save a line gets
a blind
there must be a typo here invocation of
a form gets strength as a mastic
definition get offshore strength
function will call back
Oh stupid me this should be obviously in
callback function Dara hello data
well that was stupid
so if I do get save line I get object
object okay so I'd rather prefer it to
console.log to see what the heck is in
that object so
again let's reload this
save a line
get aligned
check the console so in right here we
got my line as a property to access the
value so let's do it right away
so let's say dated of my line and it has
got our value we wanted so
let's reload this again
and get save line and you see we got SDF
SDF and I have no idea what that means
so let's give some meaningful line this
is a cool video tutorial made by go down
alright I'll save this line it says
success you see folks ok so now let's
see if I go to settings extensions and
allow it incognito mode and launch and
cognitive tab and open this and click on
get save line so you see that this is a
cool video tutorial made by code damn
appears out of nowhere so if you do this
thing right here with a kind of storing
technique with JavaScript you would
obviously encounter an error because
JavaScript session is completely
different in these two processes but
since we are storing everything we wrote
in that text area inside the chrome
storage and obviously the chrome storage
doesn't change with the incognito tab
therefore we could get whatever we
stored inside that using this little
dirty trick right here in front of you
so I hope you got this tutorial and got
how to use chrome dot storage and that's
pretty much basics of chrome storage API
to set and get the values and variables
and you could
do multiple values by just adding more
and more keys to your set your set
method and obviously you could get them
as well so do whatever you like combine
them with loops get some hot stuff ready
until then stay tuned with me
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
