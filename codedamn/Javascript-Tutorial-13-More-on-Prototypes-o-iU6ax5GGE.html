JavaScript tutorial and we'll be looking
more on prototypes and what we have
learned in the previous tutorial to
start with let's create a constructor
function with name
let's say area of square
I'll choose more friendly names now
instead of just going like a B and C you
like that let's create a valuable
let's give it two parameters X and y
this dot side Oh actually I don't need
another side because square area of
square is side square don't know how I
forgot that anyways this dot side is X
and let's with stock area as a method
and it would return simply
this dot side star this one
let's create another
function with constructor class kind of
excuse me area of rectangle
let's give it to sides now XY understood
side one would be X this website too
would be why we just return this area
function with
we've done this side 1 start of this
site 2
now
what happens is when I create variable
square is equal to new area of square
and with site ten now what happens here
is the JavaScript creates a empty object
now this object right here is empty
object of this constructor function what
happens is JavaScript by default creates
another method called prototype which is
invisible to us that means JavaScript
doesn't show it to users but JavaScript
creates this method to this object to
link all the methods and properties of
its constructor class that means
actually if we look here
if I do
like function dot prototype
now you see that it returns is a
function empty now what happens here is
JavaScript do when we create this object
VAR Square is equal to new area of
square then JavaScript creates this as
an empty object that means this object
is kind of like this it doesn't have
anything but JavaScript attached a new
method known as prototype remember you
cannot access this method directly but
you have certain commands like proto in
inbuilt command unofficial to use this
but anyways javascript assigns this
prototype method to this object this
empty object you link it to the chain
now what is the chain here let me clear
this
and let's
okay so what's the chain right here when
you create a new object you
I will just write area of square the
sake of my handwriting okay now when we
create this object then JavaScript
creates an empty object empty this
object is right now empty EMP e BP y
object with the method with the method
with the method
prototype
yes much better okay so this object has
this method robot prototype prototype
what never mind
okay so this method is actually
responsible for linking this object to
this constructor functions all the
properties and methods right here so
first of all when we call this
console.log square dot area now what
happens is when we call this
when we call this function right here
square dot area what happens is
JavaScript is to this object do you have
any method area Square says nope I don't
have any method
so what JavaScript do is square object
this is the object and since this is an
empty object but only has an
automatically created property prototype
or kind of method then JavaScript says
do you have any method area to this
object this object says no I don't have
any method area then JavaScript in the
prototype chain goes above to the
constructor function which is this one
the area of square the area of square
this function the JavaScript asked this
function do you have any areas the area
method this functions lookup on its
methods and says yes I could have and
then it returns the function or the
method to this prototype chain and it
returns to the square object and then it
console logs this thing but what if this
method was not even in here let's do two
straight method now we don't have this
method in the square we don't have this
method in the ABR square so what now we
don't have this method and it should
show an error but it doesn't because
when the prototype chain is right here
when the JavaScript is asking this
function this function says no I don't
have this two string method and the
JavaScript this function as well has a
prototype attached to it and which helps
this JavaScript engine to navigate up
and up to the prototype chain unless a
null is returned now this function here
say that don't have any method like to
string so javascript moves up to this
function and finds the object
object now what objects is yes I do have
a function now why do object has a
function because object
there's nothing object is the top that
talked everything like functions like
air is your air is your objects
themselves object literals or the new
object key word derives all its
properties from this object the object
says yes I do have this prototype what
you say the to string method and then
object returns this to string method to
function function to prototype prototype
to square and square console.log this
pretty simple isn't it if you learn it
with concentration so what's happening
here is kind of a chain chain type of
reaction going on that square-ass
prototype prototype to function function
its own prototype its own prototype to
object and then the reverse thing is
going on
if we call a unload function like ABC
now what would happen is it would keep
looking in the chain unless a null or
undefined is thrown back by the object
object function now this object function
when the JavaScript asked this function
do you have any method named ABC then
this object's function says no I don't
have any method now jobs that don't have
anything above to go then
therefore JavaScript throws an error
which says uncaught type error undefined
is not a function so this is how a
prototype chain works and this was
something brief on prototype we'll
discuss more on this in the future
tutorials till then don't forget to
subscribe on my youtube videos and stay
tuned for more thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
