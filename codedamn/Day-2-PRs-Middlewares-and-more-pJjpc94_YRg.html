may hole and welcome to your day to of
making cold damn and in this video I'm
gonna show you what the community has
provided me for day two and what I have
done for the cold damp as platform so
let's get into it so if you take a look
at day two we do not have any pull
requests from you guys which is sad and
for the issues you can see that I have
opened a couple of them today so you
might want to take a look into it and
basically if you take a look inside the
comets will be half for today is I
worked on some middlewares and types in
typescript so what essentially I have
done for the middlewares for now is just
included this middleware right here
which prevents authenticated users from
visiting the login and registration page
and if you think about it it actually
makes sense because are registered not
really a registered but an authenticated
user should not visit should not be able
to see at least the login and
registration page so that's that for
that and the next thing we have is some
error handling in registration on login
which is basically just some minimal
kind of error and validation for
usernames and passwords and all that
stuff okay after that what we have is
adding the types for different kind of
modules we have for our project and you
can see right now for this debug module
I'm including this X debug but the error
which happens to appear which is saw
just a couple of seconds away happens
because type shrim does not know what
this XD body looks like so let's just go
ahead and install its type a writing npm
install and other eight types followed
by the module
which is debug in this case and hit
enter once I hit enter after adding a
safe flag what happened is that type
trick would gather data about this debug
module and this error would be gone
so there you go we now have you can see
it now the error the warning is gone and
typescript nars aware of the types which
this debug market contains its
properties methods and all that stuff so
that's that and then we have is just
some merges and fixing some typescript
issues as well which finally makes me
like typescript again now we have fixed
the typescript thing with the TS config
file which contains the target as es 8
because hey it's running on servers so
we do not need to worry a lot about that
and basically yeah that's it
mutually for this one just try to
contribute on the issues I would highly
recommend you to if you are trying to
get into open source this is the easiest
work and think of as of now it's just an
easy project you can contribute to the
issues and opening are not to you know
difficult to handle so yeah that's it
for this day - I'll see you then real
quick in day 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
