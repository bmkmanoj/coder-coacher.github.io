maple and welcome to your 7/16 I guess
reacts yes tutorial and in this tutorial
what I'm gonna do is show you a couple
of ways to use CSS with react and
actually there are a lot of ways to do
you can just find in the documentation
or you know any other post or something
so you can if you're using like CSS if
you're using like SAS or less for
pre-processing CSS then you can just
configure that back as well and then
make use of import statements and all
that stuff so there are a lot of ways to
do but I'm just gonna stick to the
simplest one using our old-school CSS
only without any pre-processors or
anything anything like that so yeah
let's just begin so first of all let's
just get rid of these this to do app
right and return to a simpler one so
let's just delete these and I can just
leave this main door chairs because
you're just importing that let's just
change this to do from to shave right so
I'm just gonna change this to render
shapes or rather shapes and we don't
need anything or now I guess we'll just
see if we need something so this would
be shapes right we don't need these
again nothing like that okay so now
inside our render function what we can
do is or actually rather let's just
change the to shape only and pass in
something like name equals circle we can
just copy this again
square and rectangle right make sure do
it encapsulate that inventive there we
go
and now instead of shape what we have is
let's just return a div with some styles
right so what we can do the first
approach is that you can just create a
stylus variable itself in the render
function and then we can just finally
apply it as the class to our returning
element inside our component right so so
what we can do first is this check if
our shape if this approach dot name
equals circle that means we're gonna
round the corners right so I'm just
gonna create another property here
border radius and set it to zero zero
like that we're gonna say border radius
is 50% 50% something like that and
instead let's just change it to
something like what already value so
that it's easily distinguishable from
the property so what we're gonna do is
simply say something like let's just
hard code the width for now and the
pixel height is 100 pixel I wanna say
border radius and remember you can use -
here usually you would do something like
that for CSS but just make use of camel
casing here because we are writing in
JavaScript and then finally what we can
do is we can say div class name equals
styles right and that should get us so
if we go to our document
the way back let's see if we have
anything there well obviously we do not
need that as a class but actually styles
right because class name actually gives
it a class right so this should be
styles and again a type of there this
should be style and there we go so now
you can see that we have got our three
divs but they are invisible right so
what we can do else is that we can
create a background property background
and then pass in a color but instead
what we can do is we can save this drop
color or BG let's just say and from our
main script we can pass in color as you
know any hexadecimal value or any RGB
value because essentially it's gonna
just replace that right here so you can
either save something like red and the
color is something like that and color
is black there and you'll be good to go
right so we are you can use BG there
okay so now you can see that we have got
our colors ready right and right now you
can see that styles are individually
applied to everything everyday right so
it kind of looks weird so what instead
you can do is that if some styles are
common you can just take them out into
another separate CSS file and then just
include that file and safe last name
equals whatever class you have said
there so that will just you know
save you or maybe just provide a little
readability but that's pretty much it
how you do that and again in react
inside this return you need to make use
of this class name instead of class
because remember that we are just making
use of this class again here so you know
you can just make use of that in
JavaScript so that is how pretty much
you do basic styling with react and sort
of dynamic as well if you want to like
passing colors from the parent and
making use of them like that so that's
all for this one and again because we
are making use of this little rectangle
we can just pass in width is equal to
100 or maybe 200 pixels and height is
equal to 100 pixels and we can just say
this is width is equal to 100 pixel or
for the circle we don't need that do we
so we can just say which is equal to 100
pixels so essentially what we can do is
first of all say who our width is equal
to this dot plot dot width if it is set
then this dot prop started wilt
otherwise just fall back to 100 pixel
and the same thing can be done with
height as well right so that is it and
just replace these values right there
now we take a look you can see that our
rectangle stands apart from square and
the circle square is not really visible
so like that so that's how pretty much
you do basic styling with the react and
that's all for this tutorial and if you
