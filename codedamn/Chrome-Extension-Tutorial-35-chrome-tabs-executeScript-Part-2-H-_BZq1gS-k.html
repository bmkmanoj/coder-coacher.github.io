google chrome extension development
tutorial in which will be learning more
about chrome the tabs that executes
script which we started and the last one
so in the last torial what we looked at
is how to execute a block of code on the
page user currently is on so this looks
cool but if you want to execute a lot of
code then you have a problem then this
method is not very much clean and let's
say if you have like 400 to 500 lines to
execute then this would be kinda clumsy
and would not be very appropriate
approach so to avoid this what we can do
is we can execute a whole file on the
page and with that we can create a
separate file and we can execute that so
how do how do we do that is first of all
create a new file where you will place
your code let's say i'll call it
scriptures and in the background of GS
what you need to do is remove this code
and make sure you keep it to null and
right here file and a semicolon not a
story not a semicolon a column and
inside goods write the name of your file
so you see here i have written chrome
the tabs to execute script null which
gives me this script executed on the
current tab and this is the file name
which i am going to execute so even if i
write like alert this works and i'm
going to write console dot log yes or
whatever you want then this would work
so let's take a look let's reload the
extension first
and Google as well let's click here to
see I got an alert this works and
probably in the console as well you see
yes so that's how you execute a file
with chrome the tab should execute
script and it's kind of much handier
than executing or just to one line code
or just a bending a lot of code in that
one single line so that's it for this
tutorial and I hope you learned
something new from it and don't forget
to subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
