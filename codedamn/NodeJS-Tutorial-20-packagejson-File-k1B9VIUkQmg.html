hole and welcome to your 20th node
tutorial and I should probably say this
one as your 20th NPM why not because
package.json file is associated more or
less with NPM only so node package
manager as we have seen can be used to
install various packages on your node
and it not only works with node but with
in many other languages as well so for
example this works with truly like if
you are using typescript or angular
jQuery or whatever you might think of as
a JavaScript so you know NPM is kind of
very handy so what is package isn't
actually so package dot JSON is usually
your file always located in the root of
your project and it kind of contains a
lot of information which your package
requires so for example right now for
this project we needed to install this
body posture especially so what if you
kind of just have a ton of libraries out
there and you just try to push your code
on github and some other fellow just
clones or fork your code and pretty much
tries to run it on its own computer and
then voila he sees that a bunch of
errors out there on the call he sees
that all of those middlewares are not
installed files are not configured and
he just bangs it on keyboard so you
wouldn't like that and neither
so it's this tutorial for you well this
package dot JSON file would actually
allow you to add all of that cool stuff
that what your project name is it's
version then your description all that
stuff author then you have some useful
stuff as well like dependencies you have
you have repositories and yeah so you
can just
go to the documentation to look at some
more properties I don't remember all of
them neither should you so alright so as
you can see currently this is our root
of the project you can say this node GS
but there's no package.json file so
let's create one now how do we create
one is by writing first of all going
into the directory in which I want to
create I'm writing NPM in it I'll hit
enter now as you can see this is a
utility kind of and it saves me that
this utility will walk through you voila
whatever it is just read it yourself now
first of all it says me to name my
project so there's a safe and just
developing world's best application ever
so I'm just named like that and it says
that name can contain URL friendly
characters unnamed can no longer contain
capital it was okay so the here's an
update all right so let's just say
world's best application ever I'll hit
enter and it says me to add a version
let's say my version is one point three
point seven and hit enter description
this application looks rad enter entry
point now entry point is your main file
for example for me just look it's
methods - gia's I'll just leave it to
that test come on leave it empty
get repository for now just leave it
empty as well keywords any keyword any
keyword would go author may hold go down
whatever you want to write license just
leave it blank and it just shows me a
preview of the file it's going to create
so I'm just going to hit enter now as
you can see this package JSON is up and
ready and you can see that it
automatically added this body parser and
press as a dependency for me so for
instance let's just say if I had not
this thing right there this dependency
and let's just say I was just not using
this thing right here as well so let's
just say I just pasted this code from
somewhere on the internet but I don't
have the body parts are installed so I
am just a regular user who just cloned
your github project but the guy I'm just
the that guy who has only this file
you're this file code but no this module
so what you can do in NPM now is you
just have to hit a command npm install
and once you hit that you can see
basically what this command does is i
don't know what these rows are cut off
so what this command does is that it
will just look at the dependencies and
it would see okay so do we have this
file on the computer this module no just
get this version do we have expressed on
this computer no get this version and it
will just continue for all of these
files now when when you are creating
your project if I mentioned it I don't
remember
then let's just say you are the
developer now again so you are
installing npm install body parser now
you want obviously to add this as a
dependency so either what you can do is
just hit enter and then wait for it to
install then manually go to your
package.json hit enter write your body
parser then put a comma all that manual
stuff but why do that when npm is there
so what you have to do is just add a
save flag here
so the save flag would just look at your
package JSON in your current folder and
would add it so if I just get rid of
this right
and I hit this right there a let's see
so once the body parser is installed you
can see that it automatically adds this
dependency here so the user might user
have not much to do here the developer
and what you look here this dev
dependencies is the dependencies which
you are just you know it's kind of
playing around but they are not kind of
you know just they are not necessary to
be in your project but it would be good
if they are included as well so what you
can do is that you can just right here
save dev and hit enter and as you can
see it installs the dev depends in
dependency and this shows me right there
and when you are retrieving somebody
else project then how do you install the
developer dependencies by installing NPM
install and doing div or this is a flag
actually so it will do like that or that
so that's how you just install the
developer dependencies as well so
basically this is just a file to manage
all of your project dependencies your
main description version name author
license and you all the stuff you know
you get the idea so that's how basically
pretty much how this is working and I
just realized that we have a file out of
place so I'm just going to paste it here
well good to go now so that's all for
this one and let's just see what I do in
the next tutorial so don't forget to
