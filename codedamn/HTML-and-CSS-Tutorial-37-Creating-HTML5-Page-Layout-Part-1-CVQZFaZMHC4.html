your 37th HTML and CSS tutorial in which
we'll be starting off with a little
small of HTML and CSS series itself with
a little dependent within the series and
we would be developing a cool and nice
html5 layout page with CSS so basically
this would last for a couple of more
tutorials long and we'd learn a lot of
things a lot of new things about HTML
and CSS so let's get started so the look
of our web page would be something like
header would be here then a nice little
ad banner for displaying your
advertisements then
in navigation
then maybe
content right here
Slyder here
and them
footer one
put a 2
put a tree so this would be our basic
prototype for our webpage so now one
thing I should tell you that we would be
developing this whole webpage in pure
html5 and css3 graphics only and I don't
know maybe I would be using some
external images or not but we'll see
that so let's get started so first of
all what we need to develop is the
header one and I'll just comment it out
and I don't think this should cause it
problem basically but never mind
whoa
so we just did some
modifications okay so now the first
thing we need to do is to develop a
header and let's do it that with header
in the div so now we have got this day
for the header one and the first thing
we want is the logo that should be logo
actually here so now let's create some
logo here and we'll specify an image for
the logo as Mogu dot PNG
all right so I'll just close this logo
right now and we'll the start with
advertisement and there should be some r
dot PNG okay so now we have got this
head already you prove the type of the
header in the HTML and now let's style
this in the CSS so first of all what we
need is a CSS reset and the CSS reset
I'm supplying applying because by
default if you see that let's say if I
add some content right here then you see
that there's a little much and if you
see that red portion there's a little
margin by default which is applied this
style sheet which says user agent style
sheet which is applied by the chrome
itself so we need to have similarities
across browsers so I'll just select
every element and I would just say that
margin should be zero and padding should
be zero so by default any element which
was inheriting this user agent
stylesheet the statute would be
overridden by this style right here for
any element so now when I reload this I
get these two broken images
sticked with the top left of the browser
so now let's fill them with some images
you say I'll just open got to know what
incognito sorry and let's search for a
dummy logo
and I'll go with the transparent one
and maybe this should work
so let's just or YC when I can have the
URL because I'm always connected with
Internet
so I'll just have the York
the next thing we need is the
advertisement banner so let's search for
advertisement banner and you've got a
nice site for it which is placeholder
place we'll got it and by a slash
separated you could technically specify
any size and it will generate it
dynamically whether it's software built
inside it maybe on PHP but for now I
just want 728 by 90 one I will just copy
this URL and I'll just be this paste it
right here
so now
let's open the file tap
okay here we go okay so this is our page
and I guess added a mistake I shall have
shoot this tutorial and full screen mode
but never mind the next one would be in
full screen so this is our little page
right here I guess this is not much of
visible to you because of this small
screen so I guess I'll just end this
tutorial right now and in the next
tutorial I'll basically stop the head of
one so I'll see you then and don't
forget to subscribe thank you for
