50th javascript tutorial and this
tutorial will be looking at something
called remove event listener method in
JavaScript and from a last tutorial if
you remember we did something called
addeventlistener just like that which
just simply binds or technically
registered any event with any of the
element you have so let's say after some
time there's some activity from the user
I don't want the element to react to
that particular event at all now so how
would you do that so to do that we have
remove event listener so to demonstrate
this let me first of all quickly create
a div to work on and let's create some
style tags so that this div is actually
visible to you
okay this match should be good and if I
view it in the browser you see this
green little box right here let's do the
script work now now first of all I'll
just add an event to this div and let's
just say
dot add even you listener just like that
I wanted to act on it click they've
clicked should be the function and the
bubbling should be false so I guess I
can just split it up into variables so
that it's not broken up on the screen so
that might not look like I have first
enter okay so anyways
now I need to create a function diff
clicked and we'll just allow it
here nothing fancy
Dave for us great okay so let's check
that out
if that even works now see that we are
getting an alert so that's good it's
working now what I need to do is after
some activity or whatever the user do I
don't want this box to be following this
listener or technically I want to
deregister
the even listener of click on this div
so let's just say I create a button
right here
I'll just say the register click event
simple as that
and on this
I could actually add even listening to
this button as well or this should be
sorry
war butter equals document dot query
selector button and actually I don't
need the idea at all
so I'll just say button dot are even
listener click the register false okay
so now let's just quickly create the D
register function which would be called
when the button would be clicked now now
what I need to do is whenever this
button is clicked I want the div this
event to be D registered so I'll just go
ahead and type div because I already
have the reference to that particular
tip inside this variable and it's
obviously accessible within this
function so I'll just type div dot
remove event listener now what what this
do is it would remove the
you can see the callback function which
is fired on this event so technically it
would just say that it would just
suppress this event and your code would
run like this line right here was never
there or it just commented out so this
remove event listener is quite a useful
tool sometimes because we even sometimes
need to work with the user interactions
and based on its activities there are
activities we need to somehow disable
some events like if they have already
registered somewhere on the site or
inside a dashboard they have already
completed a task so we don't want that
whenever they click that button it pops
up and annoys them again and again so
anyways let's just start with this
remove event listener and what we'll do
is just like we did inside our add event
listener will write div dot remove event
listener and the second argument would
be the function we are dealing with so
this function should be the same one you
supplied right there in the add event
listener and I'll just explain that in a
minute
why this has to be so let's go back to
the browser let's reload this see we
have got this button first of all I will
click here so we see that this event
listener is working let's click on this
button to deregister the click event now
let's click it on again so you see now
there's no alert popping off now
the reason when he we need this second
parameter as a function as well because
technically you can attach as many
events or as many callback functions as
you want with on a single element so
let's see if I add another function div
click do right here and I just create
this function again I want
the tea with just
let's just reload this so when I click
this
we'll get these the alert box of whoa
so when I click this you see that I got
a load box of both of these tips but
when I will click this button right here
to deregister this event even then this
event is registered so technically you
need here - you need a function here to
basically deal with gesture and even and
one thing I want to tell you guys is
that anonymous functions won't work with
adamant listener and with remove human
listener in coordination so if you say
like if you do like something like an
event an anonymous function right here
only which is technically correct but
you need a function reference to
deregister that function so let's just
say I just do a simple alert and I just
said dot remove event listener click and
what should be supplied here because we
don't have any function so you won't
supply lick function and alert and door
won't pass the whole reference to that
so this code won't work at all because
you need to have you need to have a
reference to that particular function
you deal with the string so that's the
basics of how you register and you
register some
he wins would add even listener and
remove even listener and I hope you've
got that cleared and if not then don't
hesitate to leave comments below in the
comment section and I'll love to answer
your queries so that's it for now and
I'll see you that next time don't forget
