fifth ACMA script tutorial in which I'll
be showing you what is left key word in
es6 and pretty much how it is different
from the VAR keyword so first of all let
me just get rid of this file script
compile and change this to script ogs
only stone that makes a bit of sense and
just delete this file as well and
remember that if you are deploying your
web application for server and you're
just making your website life then you
will obviously need to compile your es6
code into es 5 because you know you just
can't tell everybody to enable the
experimental flag features on your
Google Chrome browser so that was a bit
of advice alright so now what this let
keyword is is that it's just like lets
you define variables just like in
JavaScript so what I'm gonna do is first
of all I'm gonna write you strict so
that JavaScript throws in a lot of
errors if I do a silly mistake even so
what I'm gonna do next is that I'm gonna
say let my first variable is 1 war my
first variable is to pass console.log my
first variable and reload this page okay
I guess just remove these two lines
reload and as you can see we get this
error so that means that let is pretty
much doing the same job which the
workiva does and it is that it is
declaring a variable so if I just change
this to 2 and reload you can see we got
one in the console well that was
something obvious so what's the
difference well the difference is that
there's a difference of kind of a scope
so if you create something like for Y is
0 is less than 5 plus plus
and if you just console.log I hear then
what happens is that once you have
declared this then this is available
here as well so this the scope of this
war I is not limited to this four block
but is actually limited to global or
basically it's not limited at all to be
very precise so eventually if you just
alert I here and if I reload this page
as you can see I got five as the alert
because once the loop was over you can
see that I comes out to be 5 because
once I is 4 then it consoles log 4 then
it increments I and then it checks that
hey eyes 5 is not less than 5 5 is
actually equal to 5 so it just breaks
out of the loop at eyes a lot it has 5
now what if I change this code to let
well if we will know now as you can see
that in the console we got the same
output just like we had in the VAR
keyword but this time
this eye is not defined or basically
this eye is defined but it's not
available here so that is a basic
difference between the let keyword and
the VAR keyword and you will probably
want to use this let keyword because it
solves a bunch of floor rooms and I
guess I have used this on their
enclosures as well because you know
there's a workaround for closures if you
have read about that that when if your
code is like if you're using like set
timeout or something like that in a
closure when you require it then you
have to just invoke an anonymous
function and pass the argument and you
know you get the idea something like
that you'll be thinking that what the
heck is going on but don't worry if you
don't get that we'll be covering that
real soon so yeah so that's all for this
tutorial and in the next tutorial we'll
be looking at some more awesome things
and
es X so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
