this tutorial in which we'll be
developing a kind of plugin which would
be based on the rich notifications we
learned in our last couple of tutorials
and we would be developing such plug in
a dynamic plugin with the Twitter as the
reference so what we'd be doing is we
would be writing a plugin which would
show you a rich notification down here
anytime there's the update or
notification on your Twitter account so
let's see what we need to do to develop
such a plug-in so first of all I'm just
opening my Twitter account to check what
we need to do
to develop a plugin so you see on the
chrome version basically we are just
dealing with chrome version because this
plugin would only work on Chrome so on
the chrome version we have got this
notifications right here if you observe
the URL right here
which gives us a lot of modifications
maybe first view and then the rest are a
JAXA fired they are loaded with the
helper Jack's so what we can do is we
can grab the first notification if we
look a little bit closer into the code
then you'll see that you have got this
ordered list and every Ally is a
separate notification so if you look at
it more closely then we will see that
each one of them I guess has got a
unique data item ID so this is the key
which will help us to distinguish if the
notification is new or old so I hope
you're getting me that we would be using
javascript to retrieve this page and yes
this one's important that this code is
present in the view source as well
because our JavaScript won't be able to
process the JavaScript on the page first
and then get the stuff so let me see
and as you can see this one's present at
the same content made three
and Tyler has and whatever you two did
you so
this is the basic concept or how our
plugin would work
we'll be retrieving all of these allies
doing some little CSS formatting all
these categorizing these on their
retweet activity or following or
favorite or whatever and then we'll be
processing this plug-in and finally
we'll be launching it live on the store
so till then stay tuned with me don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
