your 35th Android application
development doriel my name is Mei hole
add in this tutorial what I'm gonna do
is show you how you can add Picasso so
that you can just start walking off with
images in your I don't know template and
go to project structure click on this
app and modules add a dependency plus
sign library dependency and say that
this is because so and I guess I spelled
it wrong so right so well hopefully I
need to do it again well doesn't look
like it is we should have Oh actually I
didn't press the button that's quite
embarrassing
well the second one is what we want I
just hit okay and just leave it to
compile only ok and it would set it up
so it's downloading and you can see
pretty much we are done right so if you
just go to your build.gradle file as
well you'll see that this little thing
is added up and you're all good to rock
and roll so what we need to do now is
right here not right here actually right
here we need to say Picasso with then
the context here we'll the context I
would like to say main activity of this
right and then load right here I would
just say that this is my current item
dot and get image URL into then here
would go my image view right so I'm
gonna say this is my news image right
let's just commend this bad boy out
all right so okay so looks pretty cool
let's try this out and see if this works
or not so okay so it doesn't look like
it would or maybe restarted the current
activity but then do pretty much
anything
so again looks like that sort of bug
which I kind of hated and still hate I
guess and I guess we need to build it
right from scratch so let me just build
it again
okay pretty cool now you can see that we
are getting so sort of sweet images
loaded right into our image view and it
looks so cool right so what we can do
with this thing is we can actually
adjust its width and height right so we
can say that an item dot XML it has a
maximum height of 50 so let's just drop
that to 20 and see what we have got
right so oh ok so doesn't seem like a
lot of difference well what if I guess I
change it to like 20 DPS well in that
case it shrinks as well and with 50 DPS
it comes back to its original and why
the heck is that happening oh oh I know
that I know that well that is because we
have not said the view bounds so you
need to set the view bounds in order for
these two to work together right so yeah
now you can see that it pretty much
scales down to 20 DBS and just like we
wanted it to so 50 is fine for us and
here we go so now I can see that it's
way too close because of the image so
let's just change it to 70 and see how
this looks like and here we go so it
looks pretty cool and simple and awesome
actually so you can just increase it a
little bit if you want to but I guess
this much is fine so yeah that's pretty
cool
actually you have developed your first
app so users can just come across and
just well we don't have any click event
well we do have one but that's useless
as anything could be so what we can do
is actually we can open browser whenever
this is clicked with the URL I guess we
have no yes we do have the link right
here you can see so we can just open
this link as well on the click and we'll
just take a look at all those last
minute customizations in the next
tutorial and if you like this one then
