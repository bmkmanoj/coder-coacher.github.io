and welcome to your third angular2
tutorial in which I'm going to show you
how to write a HelloWorld program in
typescript
well basically besides hello world what
I'll be teaching you is that how to
basically set up the development
environment for typescript and angular 2
well for typescript it's a bit different
and it's a bit techie as well so you
might like it so let's just go back to
our old friend the documentation and let
me just click on get started select here
angular 2 for typescript and I'm just
going to follow each and everything in
the documentation only because this is
simple and easy to understand so yes we
have already set it up sublime text for
typescript and if you haven't then I
guess you don't need to either because
we will be making use of a light server
here I guess this one so you just have
to make sure that typescript is
installed so to install typescript
you have to just do in command-line NPM
install typescript or you can just you
know just omit that as well because
typescript is included in developer
dependencies so it would automatically
install it for you if you haven't so
let's just copy this package dot JSON
file and I guess we missed a file here
so first of all let's just do this ts
config config dot JSON and this
typescript configuration file is the
file which tells the command line or
whatever we'll use to compile our
typescript code that house the target
should be compiles for example we want
it to be an es 5 compiled file after
compiling the typescript then this is
module system these are some things
source map m8 decorator metadata true
remove commands false no implicit any
false
like that and this exclude is probably
that you don't want to compile the
already built in typescript files in
these folders well we don't have these
folders for now but we'll have in a
minute
so the next thing just copy this typing
start JSON file type pinkie swear here
you go now all of these are some sort of
dependencies you need before getting
started then we have this package JSON
and if I just copy and paste this right
there package JSON now you could
actually omit you know this type script
right there if you already have
installed it because I guess I have
installed that type script whoosh we
okay so I have one point seven point
five but I guess the latest one is one
point eight point two so you might
consider that but I'm just gonna leave
it for now because I already have that
so yes I have just deleted that line and
yeah you could probably install
everything else now these scripts would
be beneficial for us to you know just it
will just see about time a bit for
example we'll just see a minute that
when you are just doing your work and
save then you don't need to recompile
and rebuild every file it would
automatically do it for you
so these scripts would be handy well the
next thing these are just the snippets
and it says to do an NPM install all
right so okay so first of all let's just
navigate to this folder right there hold
right hold the shift and click
right-click and just open command window
or get bash and you know just open
command window right there and right
here I'm gonna say NPM install hit enter
and wait for it
so I'm just gonna pass the video here
and once it's done I'll resume alright
so once you're done with this you'll see
these two folders to new folder node
modules and typing's and yeah so once
these two are visible to you let's just
continue again all right so now it is
saying us to create an app subfolder so
you can either create that or you can
just give the step if you just want to
keep it on in the same directory but if
it's saying that that means that it will
keep us organized a little bit so let's
just create one so okay now add a
component file now components is
something we'll be discussing real soon
but not for this tutorial again because
that won't be a helloworld tutorial if I
started discussing that so this would be
whatever you like it to app dot d s so
alright well moving further then we have
this main dot d s which is just
bootstrapping this again you can just
pace it paste it right there only it
wouldn't make any difference just base
them just a moment this line and paste
it here just omit this line and just
bootstrap it but let's just separate the
things out so that it's easy to debug
later on main lot TS alright now we have
finally this index dot HTML all right so
yeah so we need to create one
index dot HTML here you go now inside
here again we don't need these three
because we aren't using IE but if you're
really pushing it on your web server
then you'll surely want to include that
no need for this as well so this is what
this thing is doing is that it is just
compiling basically it's not compiling
actually it is just making use of the
compiled mean dot TS file in your
application so yeah so what we need to
do next is pretty much I guess we are
done so yeah all right so yeah so we are
pretty much done with the setup and if I
just go to terminal again and say npm
start alright now as you can see we see
a bunch of compiled files here so this
main dot J's main dot J's dot map after
Jace and add the j-stop map wasn't there
previously but they magically came from
somewhere but I just run that command
and BM star so yeah now this is probably
not loading I guess ok so I guess I we
had a name change right there main is
good yeah so this one is - just app so
as you can see I didn't even reload this
it automatically just you know just it
automatically restarted the server for
me and it's as you can see it is on
localhost so if I just down a little bit
and as you can see right there a little
bit more and if I just change this thing
right there too
let's just say hello angular2 from
typescript and save this you can see it
automatically changed I don't need even
need to restart the server around it is
actually running on server so you will
have access to all the things like you
know making a Jack's request and all
that stuff you will actually do on a
live website so that's how you basically
get started with angular 2 and
typescript so yeah so that's all for
this tutorial and I'll see you then in
the next one real soon don't forget to
