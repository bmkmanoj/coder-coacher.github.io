May ho and welcome to your 43rd Android
application development tutorial and in
this tutorial what I'm gonna do first is
quickly fix that thing which I was
referring in the last tutorial and that
is that bug which actually did not allow
us to change science so what I'm gonna
do is actually say boolean just numb
pressed and set it to false right so now
we can play around with this boolean and
inside my number pressed I'm gonna say
that this just numb pressed is true and
inside my operation I'm gonna say that
this just numb pressed is false right so
what advantage does it give us well it
tells us that in this call in this
function I can actually check whether
just numb pressed is true or false and
if it fought if it is false that means
that the user is trying to switch the
signs without actually you know doing
pressing any other number so addition
and subtraction works fine but there's
some sort of problem with multiplication
and division so we are gonna need to
implement the condition and these two
only so what I'm gonna do is say to
multiplication first that if just number
pressed is true that means that the user
has actually pressed some numbers
between the you know pressing two signs
so I just want to return the result
times last number and if it not if it's
not the case and then what I want to do
is just simply return the result right
so I don't want to change the result I
just want to return that same particular
result okay so now what I want to do is
implement the same thing where this
thing but make sure you change the sign
too
and return result and okay so now let's
see how it looks like and let it build
okay so now if I write like 12 plus 12
plus 6 times 5 plus 5 plus whoops oh I
mean to do negative oh no I want to do
positive Oh No
negative positive Oh actually I wanted
to do it as multiplication no I guess
negative so you can see it didn't change
to zero so I guess our code is working
so it gives us 150 and if I do like
times two minus hundred times
oh no I want you to actually divide this
so divide oh no multiply divide multiply
divide so you can see that the sign is
changing but not our number the actual
numbers so I want to divide it let's say
with the hundred and it equals two wow I
didn't know that well so that is how
pretty much you create a very basic
calculator with the help of Java and
Android obviously so this is sort of a
gooey calculator with not so boring
interface like just two text fields you
can just actually do multiple
calculations but obviously better
calculators are more complicated and
including more operations and they're
actually they have the best ones are
like brackets and even Exponential's and
whatnot so you know you can just do
anything if you just get the basics
right
your calculator like how the numbers are
updating and you know you can just
implement the square root function
yourself I think so
because it's just you know just another
thing you can just make sure you can
just right here if ob equals square root
then return math dot square root and
then use any other function if you want
to or you can just calculate it on the
fly but actually I would just recommend
you to make use of inbuilt function for
square root God's not easy well anyways
you know you can just do that and yeah
so every other button works except this
one so you can just do it as an
assignment and if you face any problem
then I would just be available in the
comment section and I would probably
just post this as a github repo as well
so that you can just download the source
code for this application and if you
like that then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
then in the next one real quick so see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
