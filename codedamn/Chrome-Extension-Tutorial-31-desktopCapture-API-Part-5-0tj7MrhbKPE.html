the first google chrome extension
development tutorial in which will be
continuing with and ending our groomed
or desktop capture api series and this
time there was a delay of around like
one and a half month because i was just
engaged with different stuff i was busy
with my exams I crashed my pc twice
upgraded to ten removed lanix and
there's a lot of stuff with that so here
you can see that it's Windows 10 it's
nice and easy to use so I pretty much
like it the katana is easy to use its
friendly it's fast you know here you go
a free review about you understand so if
you're not yet upgraded to 10 then I'll
recommend you to switch to 10 it's fast
and easy to operate well if you want you
to know that here you go if you dent
then sorry for wasting your time now
let's get started with real stuff we
were doing so I did some research on the
stuff we were in the last tutorial and i
found out that there's a problem with
this so chrome by a default doesn't have
any api to encode this stream we are
receiving into a video file so
technically by just api support you
could not actually save the video which
you are recording and i'll just show you
what i mean by that so i'll just
console.log the stream itself when the
video is ended okay so let's reload this
extension and i'll just launch it so
let's click on style let's say select
anyone on the screen let's say select
this page and i click on share so you
see that
okay I don't know what just happened but
I don't really care let's do this again
and let's go with this so share stop
sharing and in the console you see three
messages receiving data from user which
appear when we started the recording
video recording session ended when I
clicked on the stop sharing and here's
the console log of media stream now this
media stream is the stream which has our
video recorded in binary now by default
javascript and I mean chrome doesn't
have any particular API to convert this
media stream the string in 101 101 and
all that stuff into a perfect with your
file you can say like my video dot mp4
so you can't simply do that in chrome
without any heavy JavaScript support and
all that things so we have a handful of
options here either we can't send this
media stream to server and then on the
server the back end we would use PHP and
would convert this media stream into a
video file and would send back to the
client but this would take some time and
coding but the second option is even
more tedious you can say and the second
option we would be using a client-side
JavaScript to do browser encoding and
decoding which is fast but it would
require a hell lot of coding so I'm
sorry guys this would be out of scope of
this series so if you ever want to
develop such an extension then when you
are up to this point then go ahead and
check my description I'll leave some of
the github links to help you guys with
to proceed on words from this point
because
at this point the complexity level would
be far beyond the reach of Chrome
extension and we would be actually
dealing with binary files and encoding
decoding because that's not what I meant
to teach you guys in this tutorial so
that was a quick introduction why and
ending my Chrome desktop API tutorials
right here and from the next tutorial on
words will be starting something more
interesting and more relevant which we
could actually implement in the
real-life scenarios and could launch on
the Play Store oh my bad good launch on
the web store as well so that's it for
this tutorial stay tuned with me and
don't forget to subscribe i'll see you
there next time good bye and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
