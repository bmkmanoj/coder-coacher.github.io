fifth WordPress team development
tutorial my name is may-who and in this
tutorial I'm gonna show you how to
create or basically how to split this
index dot PHP file into modules well
WordPress supports modular programming
and my modules what I mean pretty much
is just like breaking a whole bunch of
file in different pieces and then
including them separately well this is
extremely useful because in modular
programming you can reuse your code in a
lot of files instead of just increasing
the size of every single file so let's
suppose that for a website you want to
have a similar set of header for example
your navigation bar is constant all
along your website you have same links
same images same icons same everything
and you want to change an icon of a
single list item sure you can just grip
it in Linux pretty much make use of
notepad plus plus for Windows if you're
smart enough but if you're not then
pretty much you are in a trouble if you
have like 500 pages to do well in that
case modular programming would come
handy and that is you can just split
your code which is you know you can see
that it's repeating consistently on
every page and then just create a
separate file out of it and just include
that single file on multiple pages so
that's what we're gonna make use of here
so I'm just gonna take this whole code
and create a new file named header dot
PHP now make sure you create the same
name as header dot PHP because this is
not something that I'm creating at my
own will these file names are actually
you know what press knows about these
file names so when I'm gonna make use of
something like get header here inside a
PHP tag
WordPress knows that I am referring to
this header dot PHP file and not any
random file on the internet so what
press would probably look for this
header dot PHP found at the same working
directory so I paste this code right
here which just says similar thing and
pretty much if there's a get header you
might have guessed it by now this should
be a get footer as well yes there is and
you can just say get footer and pretty
much create another file which says
portal dot PHP and here we go why not
just make all of these PHP tags one are
the same so a bit of indentation right
there wouldn't hurt here we go now if
you take a look at your website if you
reload this you can see that pretty much
it looks still the same but now you have
split it up your index dot PHP in two
modules precisely two for now the header
1 and the footer 1 so now if you have
like million pages or something on your
WordPress and you wanted to add a script
which just says happy New Year to your
users then you can just pretty much go
to header dot PHP and make a change here
and pretty much it would look reflect
back on all of your pages which make use
of this get header function so that's
get header for you and pretty much which
you can do in the header of PHP is that
you can call a function WP head
now what this WP head is about is that
let's say from a team developer you
immediately became a plug-in developers
let's assume that so you are creating a
plug-in for users of WordPress and you
obviously don't know which user is using
what
sort of WordPress themes so it becomes
extremely difficult for the plug-in
developer to determine the correct place
of inserting the codes like scripts or
style sheets or something like that
so what does WP had means pretty much is
that all of the automatic code that
WordPress wants to insert before the
head tag are basically all of the code
which our plug-in developer or any other
developer liked module developer wants
to insert before the head it can be
inserted right here with the help of
this function so you can actually bind
things with WP head and WP head would
reflect back them on your page so if I
reload this you can see pretty much we
get a lot of stuff and the reason is
that WordPress is making use of things
like open sans font and then this is
sort of an emoji icon okay I don't have
a authorization to view this page
anyways I don't care so that's pretty
much what WordPress does if you include
PHP this WP head function word presence
automatically inserting a lot of content
it wants to have for example it says WP
admin bar display:none for the website
so that the administrator bar doesn't
appear on here so that's very much how
WP head works and for WP footer you
guessed it right we have a PHP WP footer
as well so make sure you include include
these two tags if you want your team to
work with plugins and stuff again if you
reload we get a lot of items here as
well so if I reload this you can see
suddenly our administrator bar appears
of nowhere and this is because of this
WP photo function and one thing one more
thing I want to show you in this
tutorial is something known as a PHP
function for WordPress and that is the
blog info so this blog info the HP blog
info actually I just want to show you
everything associated with it but let me
just see how can I do that so I wore
dump this logon for thing no not really
so no not really
so what this function actually does is
that if you pass in an argument for
example let me just show you an example
actually so instead of this character
said you df8 what I can do is I can add
PHP blogging for Garris it and what this
would do pretty much is that it would
still display UDF here but it would
actually now fetch that thing from
somewhere here I don't know it should be
inside some WordPress settings but you
know I just made it dynamic so you know
if I get an option here to change the
cursor type of my web page from UDF a to
some other thing then I can do that from
WordPress dashboard instead of messing
up with code which would be tidally good
for a user so instead of this my home
page again I can add a dynamic title
which is my blog name so I can pretty
much say PHP blog info and again I can
pass in the argument last name that is
whatever I want so if I we
load this you can see I get my homepage
no not really you can see I get code
damn WP destro inside title which is
actually the name of my website this
page right here you can see so we are
echoing of the name of the blog but that
has a drawback is that this actually
just keeps on displaying the blog name
on posts as well well we can just work
with that as well later on but for now
let's just learn how to just pretty much
do that and for now let me just get rid
of this toolbar you can just do that
from this page right here just update
your profile and you'll be good to go
so pretty much you can play around and
you can actually just say right here
inside h2 and say PHP blog info
description and this would again fetch
some sort of description from your
description field inside your settings
journal let's just see the most awesome
WordPress theme ever that attitude I
like that attitude
so reload and you get your new
description so you might want to use
this in your Medicare set for the search
engine BOTS to work properly with your
website but for now I'm just gonna leave
it with h2 only for the simple
demonstration purposes and that's how
pretty much you create a header dot PHP
file and photo dot PHP file and asked to
revise this tutorial in a quick short of
30 seconds you must include these two
ones and then we have this blog info
function which is pretty much returns
and some valuable stuff to us when we
pass in what people want from the
website like name or discord
or even the character said and yeah you
can actually just display the languages
as well so you can say PHP language
attributes and reload this users you can
see it automatically adds an HTML lang
en-us and for example if you have
specified for some another country I
don't know it's all in here I guess if I
just change this to some different
language and let's just see if it works
or not okay so this kind of looks weird
to me reload reload you can see that the
language automatically updates and
direction as well right-to-left and
languages some Arabic or something like
this so I can get my head around this
stuff so I'm just gonna revert it back
to english only so looks nice now and
that's pretty much it for header dot PHP
for now and yeah that's not actually all
of the stuff but if I have missed
something then don't worry I'm gonna
cover all of that stuff later on when we
are actually starting off the team
development right now we are just
learning about how things are working
with WordPress and how to work them how
to make them work so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial and if you like
