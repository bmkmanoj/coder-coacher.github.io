welcome to your 15 Express tutorial and
in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how
you can make some of your files
available on your server so right now I
have this folder right here called
assets and then said this I have the
simple stand sheet with a simple style
of body para and margin:0 so what I want
to do is that I want to make use of the
stand sheet on my website but eventually
no GS restricts me from doing that
because things are you know just there
are only bad people on the earth and
they would try and steal all the other
content all this secure content like
whichever module I have installed and
all the configuration files so node is
kind of over-possessive
so I'm just gonna say to node hey don't
worry about that I just want to make
this folder only accessible and would
keep all of your files secure so let's
just see how can I convince know to do
that
so if I open my terminal and run the
script you can see it listen to add this
boat and as you can see this works fine
so what I want to do is that I want to
say app dot use and this would be the
part where I want this to be accessible
so let's just say instead of assets I
said this should be available like CSS
files and then I want this as Express
not static dir name plus assets yes yes
okay so what the heck is going on so if
I just console.log
di our name here and viewed in the
terminal you can see the dir name is the
current working directory and it just
works fine so right here what I'm just
technically doing this all the way to
dis no J's folder then this assets and
this CSS files simply say is that on the
server make it available like localhost
boat and then CSS files so on the server
it would be like this but behind the
scenes all the files would be stopped
from this assets folder so if I just go
to the browser and I say CSS files and
say my style start CSS you can see that
this file is available though this
folder is not available but the file
itself is available so as you can see
now you can just make use of this file
in your code somewhere just create the
most amazing side ever weird note so
that's how you serve some static content
on your website and again you can what
you can do is you can just create an
images folder just push all of your
images into that folder and make it
available on your server so if I just
comment out this line and try to do that
again you'll see that it just throws
this 404 not father's so that's how you
basically do that and make your files
available with express and that's all
for this one and the next one will be
learning something more about Express
and yeah so I'll see you then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
