meho and welcome to your tenth MongoDB
tutorial in which i'm gonna show you
what modifiers are in MongoDB and how to
pretty much work with them well we
already worked with a single modifier
said in the last tutorial when I
demonstrated you how to update records
but set is actually a modifier right so
I'm just going to cover it again real
quick here so in what modifiers are
actually that in MongoDB you can do some
conditional updating or like conditional
operations like you just want to
retrieve some sort of data which is
based on this thing or you know you just
want to increment some field in your
object you just don't want to perform a
two-way trip like you are you're
retrieving the data from the database
first then you are incremental value
inside your programming language which
whichever you are using and then you're
sending that data back so MongoDB kind
of makes it you know easier to do
without performing a to two-way
interaction you just have to send the
data to increment and just simply
increment the value from the original
one so what happens now is that in this
tutorial I'm just gonna show you the
usage of the set one but there are a
couple of more modifiers which I will
discover later on so what happens is
that well i guess i need to create a
record was so let me just say that DB
dot o ok so it's just great and i'll
check first so the subject will be like
name mean then food pizza and then what
i want to do is let's just say learning
Mongo ok pretty cool now what I want to
do is that Sadie V dot awesome people
dot to insert object just build this boy
say it's me inside
it then I just want sushi or to DVD or
use and DB then i'm going to say DB got
some people let's find and you can see
that i have this record right there and
that's pretty has an effect right now
yes it has so it's kind of nice to look
at right so okay so now what I want is
that lets say you created your
registration feels right you have your
username field and your password then
profile URL and whatnot right so then
you suddenly remember after making your
site life oh I forgot this one so
instead of just taking your whole server
down performing a test on local host
which is kind of a good practice but
anyways you can just create a new field
in your database and how you would do
that is actually you would say something
like if I'd get rid of this and this one
has you'd say like DB dot awesome people
got update right and this would be your
first criteria what you have to update
right this like we did in the last
tutorial so this would have to be your
first criteria for this requires right
there I have like I can just do name as
male because i have only one record so
that's not a problem at all I'm just
trying to say name as me who write and
now what I want to do is I want to set a
particular value and if I do something
like this then it would just kind of
replace the object I don't want that i
want to set a particular value or you
know update something or whatever but i
want to do to a particular value i don't
want to flap flush out the record itself
so i'm gonna make you to the set and the
modifier start with a dollar sign right
so that's kinda make them unique to
identify and i'm going to say set to be
like i can say
I want to add a new field like you know
what do we have for now like I want to
add a country feel right so I'm just
gonna say country and then I yet right
so you know you could just add some more
fields here but I'm just gonna leave it
with one so you know what the heck well
if I just build it now you see that it
showed me right result and mashed one
and whatever you call this the terminal
or she'll whatever you can see that the
country record is added so pretty much
that's how it works and the see if I
kind of get rid of this right are we
close to completely yes so if I build
this one you can see that it changed and
modified to one and if I run it right
now you can see that we pretty much
screwed it up right you can see that the
whole object is deleted and the only
thing which we are left with is this
country and obviously the ideas this is
taken here you know mongodb just takes
care of this thing so you don't have to
worry about the ID all right so don't do
this sort of thing because it kind of
looks you know meaningful but it is
meaningless actually so that is how
pretty much set works and you could just
you know add an RA or whatever you want
to you know this is just your pretty
much your value which we discussed in
the data types so you can just add
awesome country or whatever you can just
change it to Pisa again or food or
whatever I don't know you know you I can
just show you that you can add some
things like pizza or burger and noodles
as well so if I now build this or
actually we have
change the criteria right so now it's no
longer name may hold its now country as
I n so if I now build this you can see
that it changed and modified to one and
then if I you were pretty you can see
that the food is added as an array right
so you can just do that with some sort
of integers as well and you can actually
add a collection inside or actually set
a collection insiders collection as well
so I'm just going to show you that as
well so what you have to do is write DV
dot all them just what the heck is it
scrolling down every time might be fall
with mouse or something well anyways I'm
gonna say DB dot awesome people dot to
like not here not to insert my object
here and the object would be again
something like name as Mabel and then
languages and a bunch of languages here
like web to be HTML CSS JavaScript
mobile as ionic and Android or actually
you native I should probably right so if
I now build this run this bad boy again
you can see that we have this crap right
there doesn't matter and this one right
so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
get rid of this one and I'm gonna say or
actually let me just get rid of this one
d v dot awesome people dot update right
and now I want to like update a
particular field inside my languages
document.write so this is a document
inside a document sort of inception
feeling so I'm going to say this would
be languages dot to web right so
languages taught web so that's how you
pretty much get into the hair I pre or
whatever you call that so the next thing
languages taught web is obviously you
need to specify some sort of thing and I
should have rather added a simple one
here as well otherwise we need to copy
this thing and make it one line or as
well and get rid of this one as well
well that sucks and that would do so
yeah now we have this update criteria
set and then I'm again when I gotta make
use of the set so we rest of the stuff
is kinda similar languages start web and
then I'm gonna set this to another re
which would be like well I know nothing
right so okay so now let's just build
this okay so it saves me that nothing is
matched and the reason is oh I have
actually enclosed re and codes it should
not be like that because it's then it's
creating it like a string now build it
and see that it's n matched one and then
modified one well I guess actually I
could have used name a hole here as well
well anyways so now you can see that and
web it changed Wow I know nothing so
that is how pretty much you go inside
what the heck go inside the documents
inside document
that is kind of buggy and looks like it
is falling under the action of gravity
or something well anyways so that is how
pretty much you make use of set modifier
and the next couple of or more tutorials
would be real quick because that took
some time in this one to explain how set
works with the nested documents as well
so yeah that's all for this one and if
you like this tutorial then don't forget
to subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
