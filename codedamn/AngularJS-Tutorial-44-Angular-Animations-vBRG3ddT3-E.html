Mei hole and welcome to your 44th
angularjs tutorial in which I'm gonna go
over through a library extension with
angular known as angular animate and how
this is gonna help you to create some
awesome animations with your angular JS
application so what I'm gonna do in this
tutorial is pretty much I'm gonna show
you a simple example so let's just take
up example of our search box the old
schoolfriend and pretty much to do that
what I'm gonna do is create like search
input type text then ng-model search box
and then I'm gonna go ahead pretty much
say Li ng repeat something we we need
something right here so to do that I'm
gonna go to controller dot chase and
here you would notice that I have this
main app from right here and this
controller from here but this is our new
dependency which we need so this ng
animate is coming from this library and
you could pretty much Google this
angular animate and you'll get the same
exact link so what I'm gonna do here is
I'm gonna say scope not I don't know
let's just say foods foods so let's just
say this is pizza then I have Burger
then extra cheese cheesy pizza and then
potato chips why not so here we go we
have four foods in our list and I'm
gonna say food in foods pretty much just
echo it out right here and here we go
now one thing we are left with is
applying a filter of search box so that
it actually
now let's just reload this and you could
pretty much see that if I write it it
filters out only pizzas so here we go
now but if you see in the Dom you'll see
that angular Cana abruptly deletes
elements from the UL which it doesn't
found in the list and abruptly adds them
as well so this would kinda not allow
you to animate stuff even with jQuery or
something so you need to tell angular
that you want to apply some CSS
animations or something so that angular
actually gives you some sort of classes
applied to these element elements and
pretty much you could then customize
those animations using those classes so
here comes to rescue the library angular
JS angular and made and using this I can
give it a class of animate and right
here on the top I can create some more
styles and what these styles would be
all about is how the events are handed
when angular encounters them so right
now I'm going to say animate ng intro
now this is this ng intro is a default
class which is attached whenever angular
funds finds that it is about to you know
make an element enter into the scene or
into the view and then how it should
behave is right here in your hands so
let's just say it should probably just
sure transition Arianna said yeah or in
five milliseconds linear all and we're
gonna need to add some more styles but
let's just make it common to ng leave as
well so that the leaves smoothly then I
want animate ng leave dot ng
leave active now what this means is that
ng leave would be applied to the element
which is about to leave an active would
be the active state of that particular
element so it is kind of hard to explain
right now so I'm just gonna coat it
right away and you're gonna realize what
this actually means so I'm gonna say
this is opacity zero and or again
similar thing ng intro dot ng intrude
active and this is gonna say opacity one
and this literally means that apply
these styles whenever animate as well as
ng and true as well as ng interactive
all three classes are present on this Li
right here we have so let's reload and
take a look now if I just open this ul
and right P you can see how smoothly
that burger kind of vanished into
atmosphere and if I write like I you can
see the potato chips right there now
what is happening behind the scenes
let's just take a look carefully now you
could even pause the video if you want
to whenever there's a little bit of
change in the term so that you could see
the actual classes so I'm gonna write B
and you could probably pause it so here
we go
B and if you just pause it and take a
look at what the classes are added by
angular you could probably see these
three classes only animate right there
animate ng leave and ng leave active for
the things which left the UL list so
that is pretty much how you create
animations with angular and you could
actually just customize these animations
how you can do that is right ng you know
pretty much I'm just creating a sort of
class so that I can access these styles
on the browser and chrome I guess
provides very nice interfere difference
faris interface actually so this chrome
provides me some sort of like cubic
Bezier curves you could just create like
you want create an animation like this
you could pretty much customize your
animation and this is pretty cool
feature of Chrome and it is available
from quite a time so if you don't know
about this I guess you should probably
know and this is really cool you could
create your own animation like or use
some preset animations like I'll call
that a cubic linear out slow and add all
that stuff and you could bus just play
around with the cubic curves as well and
pretty much you'll get a new set of
animation every time so you just need to
copy this code again and just paste it
right there to make it work so that is
how pretty much animations work and
there's a lot more to animations you
could do and that's all for this
tutorial though and if you like that
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then next
