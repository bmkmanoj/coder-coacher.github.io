your eighth C++ tutorial in which we'll
be discussing about something called
namespaces in C++ now namespaces in C++
to understand those let me give you a
quick example let's say you have a
friend named John and you have another
friend named the same name in John so
you have two friends who'd similar name
John now when you save them mobile
numbers in your phone then what you'll
do is you could either write save their
contacts as John school friend or John
coaching friend or their full names so
in short you will make some sort of
distinction between the two so that you
could recognize immediately which John
you are referring to so similarly in C++
we need something called namespaces to
recognize which function or variable or
block of code we are calling so to
simplify things let me give you a quick
example let's say we have a function
let's say we have an imaginary library
called my function here and let's say
inside this my function what we have is
a function and it just says C out Wow
let's say right here as well I have a
void my function it also says C out Wow
again so in the mean when I will call my
function then the compiler actually does
not know which function I am referring
to so to fix this what we make use of is
called namespaces so let's say I'll show
you a real quick example of this so
let's say I create a namespace here
namespace and I guess a little bit of
quick because I started off with the
functions so I guess I should just leave
that and let's just assume where were
you able to only so let's say I create a
namespace may hold inside the namespace
I said and my age is 80 right here I
created a namespace John and I said and
my age is 20 so inside the main let's
say I do see out navels age and my age
now the compiler does not know which age
I am referring to so to specify that
what will make use of is called the
scope resolution operator and the scope
resolution operator is two Collins now
these two columns means that we are
referring to a particular scope now if I
type in the namespace of my age and
write two columns then this means that
my age inside the variable inside the
namespace of may hold so if I run this
program I'll just get rid of that line
so if I run this program so you see that
it gives me males age 18 but if I change
the attitude Jordan now what will happen
is since I am referring to the scope of
John then it will give me output as 20
so what we learn from here is that if I
remove this line then what would happen
is I need to do something called STD now
because inside the iostream library how
the functions are coded is like
namespace STD so we either need to make
use of the using namespace STD or we
need to make use of the namespace scope
resolution operator and then the
function or the stream or variable or
whatever we are using so it's better to
use using namespace STD at the top
because most of the functions of C++
inbuilt library already use the
namespace STD and you could find that in
algorithm or in vectors and see Matt I
really or whatever you can imagine in
strings as well so that was a quick
tutorial on using namespace STD and why
do we actually use that so I hope you
guys are clear now why do we use the
namespace STD and what actually
namespaces are and if you have still any
doubts then don't feel shy to leave a
comment and I'll try to answer that as
soon as possible so that's it for this
tutorial I'll see you there next time
