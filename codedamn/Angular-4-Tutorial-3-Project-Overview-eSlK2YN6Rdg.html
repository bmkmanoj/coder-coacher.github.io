May ho and welcome to your third angular
tutorial and in this tutorial I'm just
going to give an overview of the project
layout and structure what angular CLI
has done for us so in the last tutorial
we installed actually rather setup a
very basic app using angular CLI and
let's just see basically what this app
consists of and how this all is working
so starting from the top we see
something e to e now this is end-to-end
testing and we're not going to go a lot
deep into it right now because we do not
need that then we have the node modules
and then we have the source folder which
is of our interest line setup folder you
will see that you have your component
which is this app component right just
kind of discuss component in a moment so
the CSS file is blank the HTML file is
something which we see on the page
itself but you can see that right now
here we are making use of this
expression in angular which is welcome
to title and this title might have been
defined somewhere right so yeah this is
pretty much what we were seeing last
time on the screen so this is your HTML
file of that component this is the CSS
file and then we have some typescript
files here so if you take a look at this
app that component you can see that our
title is app the variable which is being
used here and then we have defined a
component and imported all the necessary
stuff so anyway so yeah this is the
module file and we're going to discuss
what modules are later on so inside our
assets we do not have a lot of stuff
inside environment you can see that we
have Environment production and
Environment dot d s files which is just
simple constant which says production
falls in production true so not a lot of
interest for
these things right now then finally we
have our index dot HTML which is the
actual files of to the browser after
compliation which has the title hello
world lab which is the name of our app
right and then we have this app root tag
which actually is the root of all the
application the full application and
hear all the stuff would be put by
angular right so MnDOT es is the main
types of file which is actually combined
by web pack and angular to actually
produce some relevant JavaScript for the
browser then again you can see that we
are importing our app modules which is
this module or component you can say
right now from our app folder and then
we are just making use of that then we
have some shrimps and polyfills here we
do not need to worry a lot of logs em
right now it's just for compatibility
with all the browsers and all the stuff
then we have some styles here as say we
can add global signs here so then we
have something that's test and all of
this karma dot J stuff so we are not
gonna touch it right now because it's
not a lot useful for us right now it's
used for testing and all that stuff so
we are not going to go into that much
right now then we have this angular CLI
dot JSON which is the angular internal
file Indonesia so in settings we're not
gonna touch these ones as well we just
gonna operate either from command line
or they're going to directly add code to
our components and modules and other
stuff then again we have this Kermode
config dot JSON file a J's files then we
have our package to JSON file and you
can see that we have a lot of
dependencies which angular needs oh
that's cool and developer dependencies
as well so yeah
then finally coming down we have our
typescript configuration file as usual
and
what you can do if you're running
sublime text only is you can go to
package controls and write install
package here and you can actually
install typescript package which would
allow you to enable syntax highlighting
for typescript so you can write
typescript here in my case I have
already installed it so the package does
not appear as typescript name but for
your case it would be probably three and
one of them would be just type scripts
you just go ahead and install that and
you'll be good to go so yeah yeah well
that's all for this one and in the next
tutorial we're going to see how to get
started with things in angular so that's
all for this one and if you liked it
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
