Mayo and welcome to your way first
typescript tutorial in which in this
whole series I'll be showing you what
typescript is and how to work with it
and create some awesome JavaScript code
and pretty much just get started with
typescript so what is Dijkstra basically
so typescript on their official website
as I see is just lets you write
JavaScript the way you really want to
and it's a superset of JavaScript that
compiles to plain
jas any browser or any host any
operating system open source so this
language is open source and is managed
by Microsoft currently so what
typescript actually does is what the
superset means basically is that where
whatever JavaScript which you have
written so far
obviously the valid one is a valid
typescript as well but typescript what
it does is it brings a lot of more
features and functionalities to your
JavaScript so let's just say you have
written a bunch of files in JavaScript
then they are completely fine and
completely valid typescript as well but
typescript
if you write some your some of your own
type scripts then that might not be a
valid JavaScript file because obviously
you would compile it first and that's
what it says that it is a superset of
JavaScript that compiles to plain
JavaScript which the browser can work on
so why would you need typescript
well you can see a lot of hints are
provided here the typescript enables
typescript developers to use highly
productive environment development tools
and practices like all that stuff and
typescript basically helps you to create
a lot of applications which are very
heavy in size so for example if your
website has like let's say they it has
like 10
20,000 lines of JavaScript code then in
at some point on another you would
obviously need to check for a feature or
a bug in your code which you want to fix
and you'll probably get lost at that
time
so what typescript does is it just
brings some strict checking with itself
and it just allows you to write the most
valid and elegant JavaScript because of
its compiler so it's compiler would
compile your typescript file so it will
just you know just make your JavaScript
code perfect as possible as perfect as
possible so yeah so that was a basic
introduction to typescript and in the
next tutorial I'll be showing you how to
install and get running
typescript on your Mac operating system
and I'll be doing the series on Windows
with this Visual Studio 2015 so that's
all for this one and I'll see you then
real soon thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
