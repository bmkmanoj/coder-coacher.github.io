33rd JavaScript tutorial and this
tutorial will be finally ending David
sheriff's questions of JavaScript with a
perfect and obvious logic in front of us
we have question number 16 right now and
this question says that we are creating
a simple array of these three elements
we are just calling the second element
that means the 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 that means third
element actually the bass 1 and then we
are console logging 2 in my array okay
so this statement right here is
confusing isn't it but actually not if
you go back to my playlist in the loop
section then we have this in keyword in
my for loop so let's explain let me
explain you this again let's create an
array my array is equal to 1 2 3 4 5
let's use for I in my array let's print
out basically console.log I run it so
what we get here is 0 1 2 3 4
pretty simple now this eye holds down
here I is equal to the index value of
every element in this array of my array
so basically as I told you earlier in
JavaScript arrays are special kinds of
object so when we are accessing this two
in my array so we could actually rewrite
this area for for the interpreter as
this
just like this one 1 two 2 three 3 and
like that or basically sorry
it was start with 0 because indexing
starts with 0 and like that
so ok nevermind
so basically now when we run this to in
my array then it basically returns us
the boolean value that whether the
element with index value of 2 2 as an
integer or as a string javascript engine
doesn't mind it would automatically
convert it for you it's present in my
array then yes it is that is the path
value and so it would return us true but
what if we have this array a 1 1 2 2
just the two elements and we just do a
or basically 3 and 2 would also do two
and a then it would lock as false
because a 2 doesn't exist but one in a
wood log is true because the a 1 element
exists which is equal to 22 so this
question was simple enough and the
answer is true
now we have question number 17 down here
we are creating an array harvest zero is
a r1 is b RF ooh I see now this line
doesn't make sense any because in arrays
we have the indexing or basically kind
of keys only in in teachers so we don't
have any associative arrays in
JavaScript so we cannot create like our
dot foo or anything like that in
JavaScript so basically we can only
create arrays with the help of string or
sorry with the help of integers like
assigning the index value to every
element so this line is completely
meaningless right now so JavaScript just
doesn't add this C element to this array
arr the length is obviously one and two
so the answer should be two
now this is pretty interesting what's
happening down here is it's the
operation of our JavaScript evaluates a
command so to us it looks like 10 is
obviously greater than 9 is obviously
greater than 8 and this expression is
true but JavaScript what it considers is
like this it considers this statement as
this and
true now what's happening down here is
we supply this information to JavaScript
that 10 is greater than nine JavaScript
says obviously that's true then this
statement down here becomes true true
cool now while conversion while
comparing it to true javascript
automatically converts this boolean
value to integral value which is 1 now 1
is greater than 8 which obviously is
false so this expression down here
becomes false and false is not equal to
true what we get is false
okay now we have this function down here
and we have arguments and I guess I
didn't explain this arguments in my any
of my tutorials and I'll do that in the
next or maybe a couple after that but
anyways let me explain briefly what
arguments is in JavaScript we could
arbitrarily pass any number of arguments
in a function even if it doesn't have
any arguments as accepted in the
parentheses so what does means is
arguments is kind of an array of
arguments passed in a function so like
I'll show you just one now like we have
this function a let's console.log
iq meds let's pass called the function a
with the arguments as 1 2 3 4 notice
that I'd have no variables down here to
collect the values of this arguments
past so when we do this the arguments
console logs the number of arguments so
in JavaScript we could pass any number
of arguments no matter what the function
is and could retrieve all the arguments
with arguments but in this case we have
two variables in the parenthesis to
accept the two arguments passed by the
function called so what's happening here
is in this function we are assigning
arguments 1 the value of 2 now this
appears like we are assigning B as the
value of 2 but arguments and B are two
separate things now basically if if
somewhere B was called in this function
then this statement would work as
expected for example if I copy the
statement down here
if I copy this and
now okay let me explain this way now in
down here we are calling this function
with just one argument that means one is
in value a and arguments dot length is
right now one arguments dot length is
one now
it may seem to be correct to just add
this element like this way but arguments
are actually they appear like an array
but actually they are not eros now this
is something very high concept in
JavaScript because these arguments
appear to be like area and behave like
array but they are not completely like
an array so what happens here is if we
don't have any values applied for B we
could not modify the value for B using
just arguments so and had we have
supplied this value down here let's say
ABC or any other value down here and
then we have modified this value with
the arguments keyword then this should
have modified the value of B everywhere
in this function but since we don't have
the B argument as defined then this
statement down here does nothing and B
is simply alerted as undefined
I'll explain this argument thing in my
upcoming tutorials don't worry about
that not clear with this okay so now we
have a very special case in JavaScript
where one thing is not equal to another
thing and I have referenced this in my
previous tutorial as well and not a
number I guess in JavaScript is the only
thing which is not equal to itself and
if we enter this we get false and why is
that I'll explain in a moment if we set
a variable value to not a number now
this variable is not equal to itself and
that's pretty amazing
now why is this and why does these
JavaScript developers did not number is
not equal to itself this is because so
that a miscalculation in JavaScript does
not equal to itself so basically
JavaScript developers wanted that
developers do not just compare to
miscalculations among themselves and get
true both of these results for example
if I parse int a string an equal set it
to bars and
any other stray then we would get false
because this evaluates to not a number
and this evaluates to not a number so
basically if hard we got the result as
true that means this string is equal to
this string which is completely wrong so
this is important in JavaScript that not
a number is triple equal to not a number
which turns false so whoa we completed
with the score of 100% and the average
score with the quiz was 48 percent and
trust me it's not easy to complete this
quiz at the first time because I guess I
have also done this quiz around like
three to four times to understand the
logic and the working of every question
behind this and if you are ready to go
then go ahead and just go to this page
down here attempt this quiz be mastered
in that so this was all about this David
Sheff skies quiz and it was very awesome
I hope you enjoyed my explanation and
his quiz as well in the upcoming
tutorials we'll be discussing some more
aspects of JavaScript something cool
about it so I'll see you in the next
tutorial then don't forget to subscribe
