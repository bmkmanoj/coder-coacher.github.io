33rd JavaScript tutorial and this
tutorial will be finally ending David
sheriff's questions of JavaScript with a
perfect and obvious logic and in front
of us we have question number 16 right
now and this question see is that we are
creating a simple area of these three
elements we are just calling the second
element that means the 0 1 and 2 that
means third element actually the bass
one and then we are gone so logging to
in my array ok so this statement right
here is confusing isn't it but actually
not if you go back to my playlist in the
loop section then we have this in
keyword in my for loop so let's explain
let me explain you this again let's
create an array myarray is equal to 1 2
3 4 5
let's use for I in my array
let's print out or basically console.log
I run it so what we get here is 0 1 2 3
4
pretty simple now this I holds down here
I is equal to the index value of every
element in this array my RS
so basically as I told you earlier in
JavaScript arrays are special kinds of
object so when we are accessing this too
in my array so we could actually rewrite
this area for for the interpreter as
this
just like this one 1 two 2 three 3 and
like that are basically sorry it was
start with 0 because indexing starts
with 0 and like that so okay I had these
to their mind so basically now when we
run this too in my array then it
basically returns us the boolean value
that whether the element with index
value of 22 as an integer or as a string
javascript engine doesn't mind it would
automatically convert it for you is
present in my array then yes it is that
is the path value and so it would return
us true but what if we have this array a
1122 just with two elements and we just
do a or basically three and two would
also do two in a then it would lock as
false because a two doesn't exist but
one in a wood log is true because the a1
element exists which is equal to 22 so
this equation was simple enough and the
answer is true
now we have question number 17 down here
we are creating an array array 0 is a re
1 SB RF ooh I see now this line doesn't
make sense any because in arrays we have
the indexing or basically kind of keys
only in integers so we don't have any
associated arrays in Java Script so we
cannot create like a lead foo or
anything like that in JavaScript so
basically we can only create arrays with
the help of string or sorry with the
help of integers like assigning the
index value to every element so this
line is completely meaningless right now
so JavaScript just doesn't add this C
element to this array ARR and the length
is obviously one and two so the answer
should be too
now this is pretty interesting what's
happening down here is it's the
operation of our JavaScript evaluates a
command so to us it looks like 10 is
obviously greater than nine is obviously
greater than it and this expression is
true but channel script what it
considers is like this it considers this
statement as
this and
true now what's happening down here is
we supply this information to JavaScript
that 10 is greater than nine JavaScript
says obviously that's true then this
statement down here becomes true true
cool now while conversion while
comparing it to true javascript
automatically converts this boolean
value to integral value which is one now
one is greater than eight which
obviously is false so this expression
down here becomes false and false is not
equal to true what we get is false
okay now we have this function down here
and we have arguments and I guess I
didn't explain this arguments in my any
of my tutorials and I'll do that in the
next or maybe a couple after that but
anyways let me explain briefly what
arguments is in JavaScript we could
arbitrarily pass any number of arguments
in a function even if it doesn't have
any arguments as accepted in the
parenthesis so what does means is
arguments is kind of an array of
arguments passed in a function so like
I'll show you just one now like we have
this function a let's console.log
I cuman's and let's pass call the
function a with the arguments as 1 2 3 4
notice that I'd have no variables down
here to collect the values of this
arguments passed so when we do this the
arguments console logs the number of
arguments so in JavaScript pass any
number of arguments no matter what the
function is and put retrieve all the
arguments with arguments but in this
case we have two variables in the
parentheses to accept the two arguments
passed by the function called so what's
happening here is in this function we
are assigning arguments 1 the value of
two now this appears like we are
assigning be as the value of two but
arguments and B are two separate things
now basically if if somewhere be was
called in this function then this
statement would work as expected for
example if I copy the statement down
here
effect will be this and
now okay let me explain this way now in
down here we are calling this function
with just one argument that means one is
in value a and arguments dot length is
right now one arguments dot length is
one now
it may seem to be correct to just add
this element like this way but arguments
are actually they appear like an RA but
actually they are not eros now this is
something very high concept in
javathread because these arguments
appear to be like area and behave like
array but they are not completely like
an array so what happens here is if we
don't have any value supplied for B we
could not modify the value for B using
just arguments so and had we have
supplied this value down here let's say
a B C or any other value down here and
then we have modified this value with
the arguments keyword then this should
have modified the value of B everywhere
in this function but since we don't have
the B argument as defined then this
statement down here does nothing and B
is simply alerted as undefined
I'll explain this argument thing in my
upcoming tutorials don't worry about
that if you are not clear with this okay
so now we have a very special case in
JavaScript where one thing is not equal
to another thing and I have referenced
this in my previous tutorial as well and
not a number i guess in javascript is
the only thing which is not equal to
itself and if we enter this we get false
and why is that i'll explain in a moment
if we set a variable value to not a
number now this variable is not equal to
itself and that's pretty amazing now why
is this and why does these JavaScript
developers did not a number is not equal
to itself this is because so that a
miscalculation in JavaScript does not
equal to itself so basically JavaScript
developers wanted that developers do not
just compared to miscalculations among
themselves and get true as both of these
results for example if I parse int a
string and equal set it to bars and a
any other strength then we would get
false because this evaluates to not a
number and this evaluates to not a
number so basically if hard we got the
result as true that means this string is
equal to this string which is completely
wrong so this is important in JavaScript
that not a number is triple equal to not
a number which turns false so whoa we
completed with the score of one hundred
percent and the average go over the quiz
was 48 person and trust me it's not easy
to complete this quiz at the first time
because I guess I have also done this
quiz around like three to four times to
understand the logic and the working of
every question behind this and if you
are ready to go then go ahead and just
go to this page down here and attempt
this quiz and be mastered in that so
this was all about this David Scher
skies quiz and it was very awesome and I
hope you enjoyed my explanation and his
quiz as well and in the upcoming
tutorials will be discussing some more
aspects of JavaScript and something cool
about it so I'll see you in the next
tutorial then and don't forget to
