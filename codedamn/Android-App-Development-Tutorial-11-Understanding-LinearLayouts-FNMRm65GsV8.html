Android application development tutorial
my name is Mei hole and in this tutorial
what I'm gonna show you is a very simple
application of linear layout so first of
all let me just get rid of all this mess
and what you have to do before actually
deleting all that thing is just copy
these two properties the XML is Android
and the tools one and now you are free
to delete all of the stuff so except
this header delete everything else now
what you have to do now is write linear
layout hit tab just paste those two
attributes which were actually we were
making use of so later I mean earlier
whatever so now what happens is that it
kind of provides you a namespace so
you're gonna see that we're gonna make
use of properties like Android so
Android is a namespace and you need a
namespace so it's a the XML namespace
slot and call an Android and then this
URL sort of so you need this in order to
make use of a namespace so you might
have guessed by now that tools is also a
namespace so yes it is and we're gonna
take a look at that well sometime later
right now I'm gonna say that Android
layout width now what happens is that
with every layout you could specify a
bit for that layout like I showed you in
paint in the earlier tutorial that you
could create you know three or two
columns side-by-side well actually don't
need to specify a width for that we're
gonna take a look at that later but you
know you can can make that happen with a
great as well so it's kinda your
original width which you make use of the
term you make use of in day-to-day life
so layout width I'm gonna say this is
match parent now what this match parent
means is that take all the available bit
of the parent so if your parent has like
a 400 or 500 pixel screen then just take
all of that bread and similarly we have
a droid layout height and this is much
greater and as well and these two
attributes are required so you see that
the errors are now gone because it needs
at least these two attributes and just
these two these two are just required
for the route layout not for every
layout right so okay so the next thing
the most important not really the most
important but kind of good to specify
would be the orientation for which you
are coding this XML so like if you have
a web application and suddenly the user
switches the screen orientation and you
all of your app goes crazy that what the
heck has happened so in that case what
you can do is you can actually specify
different activities for your different
orientation I guess I haven't shown you
that that when you cannot rotate even
rotate an application all the six
processes are called like the one which
we had earlier okay so I guess have
delete the code so if you do have the
code which we which I made use in the
that one application which showed you
the usage of activity States then if you
just go to your emulator and rotate your
screen you would see that all of the six
callbacks are fired that means your
session your activity is destroyed it is
paused and you know in this in the
particular order that's created so you
know it gives you kind of control to you
know we start your activity or some
other activity when the rotation happens
so anyways for now I'm just gonna say
that this is Android orientation
vertical so what that means is that I'm
calling this XML file for a vertical
Android orientation right now
alright so the next thing is that we
need to add a view now a view is kinda
just like these things like you have a
plain text view something which is
viewed by the user and then this is
large text medium text so you could
actually just make use of a text view
and as you can see if I press tab it
automatically populated some of the
stuff for me and sees me Android layout
with rock content and hide wrap on there
as well
I can specify the text for this as
Android text and equals I can say right
now I can just hard code it for now I'm
again I'm gonna say okay there and you
can see that it automatically reflects
right here so in practice when you're
gonna launch your application you can
see that hard-coded strings should use
the string resource now if I press just
go to this more you can see that all of
those reasons why you need to do that
the only reason I Kara you know have
found out till now is that it just makes
your translation better for your app so
for example you're translating your app
from English to French then it would
kind of just make sure you have to edit
only one file instead of all those
zillions of layout and activity files so
yeah so that's kinda what this is used
for and actually this string is actually
another XML file if I can see right here
this is layout files then this is you
can see that it is string store XML so
you can see that this is first
application which is this one is a
string right now and it is how the name
of app names so yes we can do that later
on but it is kind of cumbersome and you
could actually automate that as well
later on so for now I'm just gonna say
this is hey there only and what I'm
gonna do is right here what this rack
content means is that it says that
pretty much take up only that much of it
which is required for me so like if I
extend this text like one two three four
five six seven eight nine you'll see
that the width changes accordingly you
see that blue bar right there
that is the width and height ticked by
this view right there so wrap content
pretty much means that it's kind of you
know it just saves you a bunch of space
if you want to say that so just say that
I'm just gonna take that much amount of
bread which I actually need and
similarly for hide then what happens is
that would match parent we have a greedy
approach so you're much better and your
layout has 100% of the width so it would
match the parents wear it as well then
we have match where and for the height
as well then you can see it pretty much
takes your whole screen now you have a
bunch of tags like Android gravity which
you can just use to Center the text as
well you see that it is in the center
now in the immediate center and this is
not only for this device it is for
pretty much any device you see it would
be in the center for any device for this
coating right now could see that pretty
much and let me just change it to Nexus
4 to switch back to text what the heck
so here we go and pretty much what I can
make use of is actually edit text now
edit text is yet another view but edit
text this time is a text not a text
holder but kind of like an input field
which you have in HTML so it would just
allow you to input some text so I could
say that this is Android width is match
parent and Android height is rock
content then what I can say that Android
hint and hint is kind of thing that
appears you know has a head like your
name so it would kind of appear only to
user does not tap on this input field to
actually enter something then when the
user is about to enter something this
would disappear so if you have used HTML
earlier then this is kind of an
alternative for placeholder attribute
for input type fields well you could
just pretty much replicate that and
kinda say that this is just to say your
email then we're gonna say that this is
message so let's say you are just assume
that you are kind of creating an
application which the scanner receives
user input and what I can do is I can
specify its height to be zero and with
Android studio what I found amazing is
that I'm kind of amazing and stupid as
well that you have to specify a unit
with zero as well so that is kind of
lame because you know you specify any
sort of unit it doesn't matter when it's
zero actually but anyways so we just go
with any other unit as well then what
happens is that this Android height 0dp
just changes its height to zero and the
reason why I've done this is that
because I'm gonna add something known as
Android gravity stop to this and Android
layout this layout wait
so what is happening now now this
Android layout wait what this is is
actually this kinda sets priorities for
your layout views so like if I said our
layout weight to this one as well you
could see that pretty much they are of
the same width
the rest of the width is by this field
and if I change this to weight one as
well you could see that pretty much they
are aligned equally on your screen so
what happens what happened here is that
well layout weight is kind of a
different topic and want to touch it
right now but it just came across so I'm
just discussing it a little bit so
layout weight Cara just distributes the
weight of your layout as the attribute
says among different views so if you
just specify layout weight to be 0 you
would see that you return to the
original configuration
here as well now there's a different
sort of thing known as Android layout
weights um and actually this was weight
somebody so this is kind of like if I
specify five and what happened here is
that Android would now expect a weight
of five so right now what I have is a
weight of one only because this is one
plus 0 plus 0 that is 1 so if I change
this to like five you would see that it
would now take the rest of the width
instead of taking rest of the width at
layout 1 because now Android is
expecting this layout to total a weight
sum of 5 and what happens if you exceed
that well it would just kind of overflow
your screen so not good just keep it in
to your layout weight sum then what we
have is like you could just change this
to 3 then 2 then 1 actually we have
overflow I guess so let's just get that
to 0 only so what you can do is just
change it to 10 and what would happen or
even 1 then what would happen is that
now you can specify in percentage how
much height you want of a particular
element and this works on height because
we have our orientation as vertical if I
change let me just do a quick read of
calculation first so I can just make it
10% I can make this one as 10%
and I can make this one as 80% right so
it fits on the screen nicely now what
happens if I change this to horizontal
now check this out well the scanner
looks not really because we have these
tags interchanged
so now I want the width to be rock
content instead of height so this would
be layout height now then I want this to
be this and this to be this this is
weight here we go now you can see that
pretty much the weight is distributed
why is this not central or we have a
gravity of table that as well so the
weight is now distributed in the center
so you know in a horizontal orientation
you have distributed this weight let me
just change it to centrally or let me
just get rid of that completely okay so
it just falls to the left so anyways the
way it is now distributed among the
center tags instead of the height so it
kind of really it's kind of fun to code
and as you can see by now that it would
not be possible to create such an
awesome thing from here because you know
even if it was you would need to hook up
with a lot of stuff here so coding is
always cool so I guess this much pretty
start would be good for you and for an
assignment what you could do is you
could just try this application out on a
device actually I could even show you
that so that you just trust me that
these are the editable fields and not
just regular fields so there's my
genymotion and I'm just waiting for the
Gradle to build the app and
well here we go pretty much done
and now you can see that if I click on
this keyword should have probably popped
up out of nowhere okay so I guess it on
get emotion it's not the keyboard
actually so you have to make use of your
original keyboard only but it might be a
setting somewhere but again this is a
free version so this might not be there
so yeah so there's some sort of problem
with my keyboard only so anyways you see
that it will just enter some of the text
here then you just create some sort of
summit button to do that well that's all
for this tutorial and in the next
tutorial I'll be taking some more usage
and how to make use of linear layout and
other views and linear layout and
actually views are common among all the
layouts kind of so that's all for this
tutorial and if you liked it then don't
