and welcome to your fifth ionic tutorial
in which I'm going to show you how to
create a simple header for your
application in ionic well we do have a
header right here you can see that this
is the ion header bar class bars table
now the thing with ionic is that it
comes with a lot of styles in belt so
you don't have to you know work a lot if
you're creating a very simple
application you can just go ahead with
the default styles and default
JavaScript modules whatever you want to
call them and you will be ending up with
a very nice and neat application for
your devices but if you have a complex
application then obviously you would
need some sort of styles for your custom
styles as well so to create an eye on
header bar what we do is we refer to the
documentation because documentation is
God so for this documentation what I am
gonna do is that inside the CSS
components for the header we have a
bunch of options right here now this one
shows that this is a div so if you
actually just copy and paste this code
right here instead of the I on header
bar then also it will work sort of but I
would just recommend you to stick with I
on header bar because this is a angular
1 directive so there's some sort of code
binding to this and when we are just
when we just start with the angular
custom directives for our application
for ionic then we'll take a look at why
they are important so for now just
replace any div you find for the header
with eye on header bar so for now we
have tried the bar light for example
this one is bar stable so if I just
change it to light
or let me just very much scale this down
a little bit
so I'm gonna say here we go and if I can
just scale it down a little bit more and
here we go so now we have this ionic
blank starter and I could just get rid
of this whoa what we did right there the
sidebar so this ionic blank starter for
the bar light for the bar stable you see
it looks something like this
and four bar light it load pretty much
similar so the next thing is this bar
positive and actually the plus point is
that angular automatically just keeps
showing you all of the stuff on the
right-hand side so the things are shown
in the real time so you can just try
that on the live website also but let me
just go ahead and create a bar positive
right here so I'm gonna say bar positive
and as you can see the changes are
reflected immediately then we have the
bark on and these are all the styles
which are inbuilt so you don't have to
do a thing so this is bark on now
and the next thing we have is the
balanced one so ferrite balanced then
you can see it done green then we have
energized and you know pretty much you
get the idea so if I just stick with the
dark that looks cool so I'm gonna stick
with doc next is sub-header well I guess
for any sort of application you would
probably not require the sub header
but if you do require then that's how
you go too much added you can just go
ahead and add the sub header for your
application and yeah so that's pretty
much how you add a header to your ionic
application and here we can see let's
just name our application which will be
middling so let's just think about that
in this little time so let me just think
about what we'll be building for our
ionic project a to do list would be too
mainstream because we have been building
that for pretty much almost every
language for example you did or did that
for angular as well so let me just think
about something different how about a
application which would sort of allow
you to load images to your web server so
for example you can create a file
storage application for your website
like if you have a site like mediafire
or you know sites something like that
which you know just allows you to store
your files on the cloud and share them
accordingly so you can just create an
application for such a site and that
site would actually that application
would actually require or would you know
need that user good user would need that
the application would allow the user to
actually upload files into his own
account and yes sort of that application
on a very low scale so let's just name
our application as file uploader well
that looks ugly cut off so let's just
name this as Dammers file upload
so that kind of looks rad so Dammers
file uploader is our newest website
which is going to compete mediafire and
everything else in the market and it's
got a rock with ionic so that's
basically pretty much your another hello
world program but with some sort of code
you've written yourself so that's out
for this tutorial and if you like that
