seventh noches tutorial I'm a whole
added this tutorial will be looking
something up more about the modules or
we already looked at what modules are in
tutorial number three when I just
demonstrated this require function but
let's just take a bit more look about
what this is a bit more of properties
associated with modules so what we did
in tutorial 3 let me just copy and paste
all of this code so if I just open this
method CAS and in modules you can
actually omit this Jase extension if you
wish this is completely optional so it
would work with GIS as well but it's up
to you so what we did here is that we
just create an object assign it some
functions and just couldn't export
stored data is methods now you can
actually do that with module not exposed
on tape as well so no js' automatically
creates something known as module dot
exports is equal to exports is equal to
an object when your module is
initialized so similar thing you can do
with methods as well for this object so
that you don't have to just you know you
can just get rid of this line at once so
to do the are just good ahead and write
VAR methods is export module or exports
whatever you like or export and is an
object now both of these refer to the
same object and that's the you know way
JavaScript works so if you have like a
simple demonstration I'm just showing
you that if you have an object and this
is wrong one it's true then you assign
that to be and you just say these a and
then you do B is drop one it's false and
when you just console.log a then you'll
see that
shows you false or basically a dot prop
one so when you did this slide then what
it did is is that it referred to the
same object which is a is referring to
so it does did not created its own new
copy of the subject it just referred to
the s copy and when you did the rewrite
you can say for the a it just overrode
the property associated with a so that's
similarly what we are making use of here
they're just setting methods equal to
module exports and then this object now
instead of this you could also use like
this just replace this with all of that
and you're good to go
or what you can do is you can just say
module on exports and then you can say
just some numbers is function and all
that stuff so you know there are a bunch
of ways to just export your data and
inside the scripts event you can just
receive your data or import your data
with just require keyword and as I told
you I guess in to do an earlier tutorial
I guess I have told you if not then the
reason why we make use of this dot slash
here is to just tell the node that we
are making use of the local module not
of a core module which is like we made
use of HTTP here so if I have another
module like HTTP here like HTTP dot J's
here and if I type HTTP like that so
angular won't know which one you'll I'm
referring to
so do you know just about the confusion
we make use of this thing right here if
I make use of this then it will know the
HTTP dot J's file from this folder no
dot no js' if I make use of this then it
would load the core module the HTTP
which is used to create a server
so yeah so that's it pretty much about
the modules and we'll be taking more
into consideration about working on them
as the time goes on with some new
application which will be cooling and
node so that's all for this tutorial
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
