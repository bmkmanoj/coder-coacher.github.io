your 11th HTML and CSS tutorial now in
this tutorial let's learn about what are
ordered and unordered lists so for
example let's say you are creating a
website on your web development skills
you want to say that I am expert in the
following fields
and you would like to have one my my
skewer you can say then second HTML then
CSS jQuery and all that stuff and
suppose you ever tried to like you want
to remove this HTML from your skills or
MySQL from your skills so what you'll do
is you'll just remove the slide but the
problem is now that this number starts
from - it is very pain to manage the
numbering of your skills so what we have
in HTML are unordered an ordered list
and using those we can completely avoid
writing these numbers or bullets
manually but HTML would automatically do
that for us so let's see let's start
with ordered lists now ordered list kind
of create a sequence in numbers or roman
numbers or any other numerical value you
supply for example let's take the
simplest example type the tag oil this
is oil element wood
create an audit list and it is closing
element and I guess I haven't explained
you a container and and D tags yet so
that should be the next tutorial but
anyways now open a li and type your
expertise in which you are in
so let's say I'm typing HTML it's that I
CSS
and PHP as well
why not JavaScript
why the heck not jQuery so these are
some of my skills in some of my skills
which I'm I am expert so here's our
browser and let's reload this and as you
can see we get an expert in the
following fields and we caught the
numbers automatically assigned to every
of our line list though we haven't typed
any number down here in the list but
browser automatically adds one two three
four five accordingly so for example if
I remove this PHP right here and save it
and reload this page then we don't have
three as nothing but three is
automatically replaced with JavaScript
so this is the kind of reliable way of
writing ordered lists and remember that
Oh L stands for
ordered list
so now you are happy with these numbers
but what if you say that I don't want
numbers I would like to have let's say
alphabets instead of one two three four
I would like to have ABCD right here so
for that we have a fix as well now Oh L
has a special attribute called start now
start what it would do is or not start
basically well type
I'll explain start later now type what
should type do is it would accept a kind
of a starting alphabet or starting
numeral which you want the oil to be for
example if I enter oil type a and save
it and reload this page and now you can
see instead of numbers just regular one
two three four five we are getting a b c
d e and that could be pretty much
helpful if you are creating your own
custom side and want some custom results
are basically if you're creasing
creating a quiz like show and want to
have ABCD as options automatically then
you can do oil type a and then your four
options and they would automatically
grab ABCD so the next thing we have for
type is the capital i now if you have
ever read about roman numerals then in
Roman numerals one is a capital I two is
to capitalize three
is three capitalized 4 is a capital I
and a V and so on so let's see what
happens and as a result we have got one
two three four five all the way down
it's your wish how many lists you want
to create the elements the Li elements
so no matter how many you create your
HTML would automatically convert all
these elements and append a Roman
numeral before them so now we could also
use like a small I to denote a small
alphabet for Roman numerals and you will
get this result and similarly we could
do that with ABCD as well with a small a
and as you can see and by default type
is 1 if you don't specify type then this
would be same as a well type 1 which
results in 1 2 3 4 5 now the next
attribute we have for o L is
start now what does start do it would
accept a value and would start your list
from that particular value for example I
give oil type 1 start 5 now what would
happen is if I reload this then as you
can see instead of starting HTML with 1
it starts with 5 now we have 5 6 7 8 9
instead of 1 2 3 4 5
similarly if I give oil type I start -
now let's reload this and as you can see
we have the starting Roman numeral as 2
3 4 5 6 and all the way there all the
way down that and one thing you have to
remember is that no matter what your
type value is let it be a or a Roman
numerals or number for instance I have
chosen Roman numerals right now your
stat the attribute the value of start
attribute would always be a number and
which would specify basically from what
value should this start and that means
when you choose like say 50 down here
then this type would go to 50 and 50 at
Roman numeral would be appended before
HTML and would carry on do all the
elements down there
so let's reload this and as you can see
we get L because 50 in Roman numerals is
L and then Li Li Kai and so on so this
was about Oh L now let's take a look at
ul now ul is pretty much like oil but
instead of basically creating an ordered
list
it creates an unordered and randomized
list so let's see what it is whoa what
I'm diving
so we have creating a ul tag an opening
and a closing tag and the same Li
elements so now you know that Li
basically depends on the parent element
so if the parent is oh well then
whatever we write in Li would grab the
ordered value but when we write like
let's see you're creating your grocery
list and let's say you want a noodles
back you want some vegetables and you
would like to have an apple so now you
don't care about in which order they are
or you don't want any numbers assigned
to them so when you reload this then
instead of getting let's change it to
something meaningful
let's remove the start now instead of
getting something meaningful like one
two three four five we get these dark
black circles around our li attack so
that's how you will differs from oh well
and you will have also a type attribute
and instead of accepting a single
character you will type accept a word
those words are let's say square if you
type u n type squared then these black
circles would be converted into squares
now reload this and if i zoom in a
little bit then you'll see the
difference previously these were circles
if I remove this
if I remove this and reload this then by
default they are black circles but if I
add you will type square to them and
reload this then these are converted
into squares similarly we have circle as
well and I'll explain what it is let's
reload this and now instead of getting
dark black filled circles we are getting
white and transparent circles with you a
type circle so what is the default
fallback for the black circles that is
disk now basically circle means only a
closed figure but will not fill with any
color and this literally means that a
circle inside black color so when used
you will type disk then we get the black
circles so this is the main difference
between ul and Li are ul and oil and Li
are used to list elements and to be more
precise Li stands for list items so you
now know that Oh L is ordered list Li is
list item you will is another list and
knew that you know the two attributes of
oil which are type and start and one
attribute of ul which is type we don't
have any start attribute because it
doesn't simply make any sense because we
are not organizing the elements in any
numerical way so that's all for this
tutorial and thanks for watching and
