your 47th JavaScript tutorial in which
we'll be learning about math object in
JavaScript
now math object is basically inbuilt
object in JavaScript which has its own
properties and methods defined itself so
as I said it's an inbuilt object so
there's no need of doing like math
object is equals to new math because new
keyword triggers the constructor
function and since this is just an
object math is just an inbuilt object
and not a function object in JavaScript
therefore this need not to be done and
should not be done because this line
would throw an error so let's started
with some math objects and properties so
first of all let's take a look at math
not by one of the most used values so
mad dot pi actually stores the value of
pi to some decimal places I don't know
maybe 14 or 16 I guess but all of that
are accurate so let's say if you want to
use math dot pi
a hundred times in your programmers so
you have the option of writing this long
number a hundred times in your program
which would make it ugly and unreadable
or you have the option of using math dot
five which would make your program
readable and pretty so now let's take a
look at what math dot bias that's just
console dot log this thing there's a
browser let's reload this and this is
the value of math dot pi and let's take
a look how many decimal places out there
basically this should be split it gives
us fifteen so there are 15 decimal
places after the three point so there
are our 15 decimal it is accurate up to
15 decimal places the pi one so now
let's just make a small program to
illustrate a practical use of this let's
say radius yes
now let's just get it prompted by the
user
let's just say area yes
by where we'll use math dot by
art which is input by the user and are
against so we know that the area of a
circle is math dot by star media star
radius which is PI R square so now let's
just count all of this and
let's just reload this Alice entered
radius as well and as we know that the
radius of one Center one unit of circle
is equal to d pi the value of pi
therefore we could verify that our
program is actually working because pi
is approximately equal to this number so
we have got a bunch of more functions in
math object and let's take a look at
some of those so let's say in this
program you just wanted this 3 right
here so you didn't wanted this all that
decimal place and you just wanted to
aprox the area to the nearest integer so
for that you've got a function called
math dot floor not mad
not floor what it would do is it would
flow down your number to the nearest
integer by in terms of simple hacks I
would say that this math dot flow right
here would remove all these decimal
places and throw them in the garbage and
will just return you this number so
let's say if I put math dot floor right
here and this value right here in the
arguments and press enter then I got
three so what it did is it just took out
these decimal places and thrown it out
of this number and I'm using through the
word because this also works when you
have very close values to four so for
example you have the number three point
nine nine and a nine and you press Enter
still you got three because the work of
math third floor is just to round off to
the
smallest possible integer in the number
so to fix this we have got math dot
sealed
math dot seal would round off to the
largest possible number no matter what
the decimal place is except zero
obviously so if I do math dot seals
three point zero zero one then you would
expect for as output and for it is so
math dot floor would round off to the
nearest possible number the smallest
possible number at math not seen to the
largest possible number so these two
have a lot of use when you are working
with the random numbers and I'll just
show you how do we work with them so
let's say you want your program is about
a game or anything where you require a
random number from the CPU as the CPU
choice and obviously the user would
enter its own choice so how do you
generate a random number well we have
got a method in math object which is
random so
let's take a look at it first
let's just do console dot log math dot
random
are here let's reload this
I'd be of God this number and every time
I reload this I get a new number
one thing you are noticing is that all
these numbers lies between 0 to 1 and
these are deaths are maybe 15 to 16
decimal places let's test it out
17 so the length is also variable
sometimes I guess so
this math dot random would generate any
number between 0 &amp;amp; 1 and to make use of
this you could say me that what's the
use of this number how could I make it
in simple whole numbers so to do that
what we can do is we can harness the
power of math dot floor or math dot seal
with this random number so let's see if
I do math dot random star hundred and
when I reload this then as you can see
we are getting results like 7.44 1173 40
49 which makes much sense now what I
want to do is I just want to throw out
this decimal and we could do that by
using math dot floor or mat got sealed
depends on your demands
so let's reload this and now we have got
it nice little number range from zero
to hard read zero because the number
could also be like 0 0 0 1 1 so in this
case the decimal shift would only do two
places this thing right here is removed
so the final number becomes 0 0 0 are
simply nothing which is 0
that's how you work with math dot floor
with bat dot random and that's how you
should read pretty much a random number
from zero to hundred so if I specify
like it has it here there I could
generate a number from zero to thousand
similarly run your brains ad you'd
figure out how you can generate some
numbers within a specific range so let's
take a look at some of the more
properties and methods and Alice
console.log mad dot e which is the
Euler's number and let's see what it is
this is 2.718 are all that stuff so you
might need this it's up here in your
program if you wish to then we have a
interesting function a method called
square root now sq RT beats square root
and it's had its parenthesis which I
would abuse apply the square root of
that number would be returned to you so
if I reload this then the square root of
10 is approximately equal to the
stubborn
we could verify it with perfect squares
which is for we got to blitz hardware
we'll get dead
like that so square root would allow you
to basically return the square root of
any W supply in the parenthesis we also
got log in bats which is pretty much
useful when you are in graphics and
animation where I reload this I get four
point six this is this this log is
calculated with the base as E so
remember that and we've got what's next
sign site costs are dad
Astrid no metric functions as well so if
you have ever been into trigonometry
that then you know that you could also
express angles instead of degrees as
radians so radiance is basically like
two pi two pi radians are 360 degrees so
one Radian is 3 60 by 2 pi and you could
do the math dead so in the side you
supply the value as the radiance and
adorn as the degrees so let's apply the
value as
what you say
what it
or not 180 let's just go with math by
now let's see what happens let's reload
this
I'd be got this value I have no idea why
we got this value but you could make use
of that so let's just work with dead
90
you could find your way around with that
are not that much into trigonometry
right now so similarly we have got cost
as well
let's reload this we got the different
answer dad as well let's reload this
this is the proof that these Agdal is
started degree because that night is not
defined actually because it's about zero
sub number upon zero I guess one so
that's pretty much how I do with math
object that would kind of help you a lot
in your JavaScript programs
yeah so I guess I forgot you do del a
workaround for that floor and silting
and what if let's suppose your input is
that I'm a CAD you just want to round
off anything with X dot five or any
number above that to X plus 1 or X dot
five minus any number that that to X
minus 1 so for that we have got round
function let's say if I supply 10.5 here
and reload this then I get 11 but it has
a blighted point for I reload this then
I get dead and though it's not a part of
that but I would just
I'll let you know about this that when
we generated this program math dot
random star hundred and this outputted
us as this number and actually we could
do something like this so if you want
the decimals as well so instead of just
flooring it down to a integral value we
could make use of two fixed not two
fixed would accept a decimal or soaring
a integral value which is the number of
decimals to appear after that number and
when I reload this we get the number of
decimals as two so every time you reload
this then we are getting a kind of two
places decimals assigned to the number
automatically some guess I guess now
I've done everything I've passed on
every knowledge to you which I know
about path object and that's all about
it
so I'll see you there next time at don't
