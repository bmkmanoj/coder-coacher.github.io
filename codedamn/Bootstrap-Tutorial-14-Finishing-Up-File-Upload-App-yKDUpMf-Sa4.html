name is Fievel and welcome to you're
about for a guess of bootstrap tutorial
not actually but four of which are
tutorial but actually the part four of
our kind of mini programs here is off
creating an applaud application and this
is bootstrap tutorial number fourteen
and in this tutorial I'll be finally
finishing off or wrapping up with this
application so we ready to get some
assignment at the last of the story life
plan something for you guys okay so now
what we have to do is just check we need
to just scale the images down a little
bit and we can just make use of maximum
width to avoid that and there you go
nice and easy way to do that no fussing
around okay so now that's the way to do
it kind of you know image uploading
service and what you can do even more is
that when you click upload or sorry when
you click summit you can just hide this
model box by just saying that you want
this to have a data this mess of model
alright and then obviously this is some
dummy code because in
real-life example you would not
obviously just close the model without
making use of anything and I'd want this
to have upload complete model and work
alright so now we have to create exact
same model and wisemen your time when
you have copy/paste ready and I'm just
gonna say upload finished just say that
your image has been successfully
uploaded and saved to our so happy
browsing and just get rid of all of that
code obviously you would like to have a
checkbox right here and you can get
those from wood shop comm / component
check and I have no idea how to make use
of these guys and I'm just gonna see how
they are going they are making use so
I'm just gonna copy this boy
and there you go
or wine I'll just place this inside okay
so let's try this out summit boom
nothing happens
embarrassing movement submit nothing
happens
alright upload Psalm 8 nothing happens
crazy little stuff and who a me because
this is not upload complete crazy me
anyways let's just sum it and as you can
see it says your upload your image has
been successfully uploaded and what was
written after that I can't read because
the model was closed so quickly
anyway so that's how you create a simple
upload application and your assignment
is I want you guys to remove this code
what I've created in this tutorial which
says upload finished instead what I want
you that whenever you click summit what
happens is is a nice little table is
formed in here a table with a row this
sorry this column would contain the
image a little small image this image in
a little you know a compressed
dimensions right here so this is your
table and here's the image here is the
name of the image you are going to
upload and here are the two buttons
which says upload the image or remove
the image so this scanner
creates a dynamic look and obviously if
you have a lot of time to spare you can
even go ahead and make this button a
multiple
button so you can upload multiple files
at once and do the same to them here and
when you are done even with this then go
ahead and create your back-end code and
when you are done even with that then go
ahead and publish your website online
and when you're done with that as well
then go ahead and purchase Flickr so
that's what I can suggest you guys and
that's all for this tutorial and let's
see what we'll be discussing in the next
tutorial but it will be awesome so if
