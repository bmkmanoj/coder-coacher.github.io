Mabel and welcome to your sixth react to
a story in which I'm going to talk a
little about what properties are which
is actually known as drops and react and
we all actually use them in our earlier
tutorials so what essentially they are
is that react introduces the concept of
drops to pass data from the parent
components to the child components right
so react allows you or allows the parent
components to talk to the child
components which are you know just
declare inside those particular
components with the help of probes right
so they are sort of used to pass down
the data from parents to children right
so in our case what we have here is this
yellow planet which is a component which
is inside this disk which is sort of you
can go on a component right so we are
passing the name ask earth and the name
here is the property just like we do in
regular HTML like script SRC and you
know HTML Lang and just like that but
right here we can just name our prop
anything we want and any value actually
any value literally not just strings and
numbers we can actually do something
like if you have let's say our object is
anything my favorite number anything
like that so you can just pass down the
subject as well if you want to and when
you are dealing with this sort of
JavaScript things what you would like to
do is say like my object and then since
we are passing this object as a property
we want to make use of curly braces
right so we make use of this curly brace
sort of thing and render function or
render method whenever you are dealing
with JavaScript or you know expression
it's like it would actually do something
like by thing to do like that
so it will just evaluate it as a
JavaScript expression so we can just get
rid of form Mars and Pluto for now and
inside our hello planet what we can do
is we can say that first of all this
console log this red box right there and
then we can say that dot to my favorite
number right so we can see your favorite
number is now we can see that our
favorite number is zero and essentially
we get 10 as well here because we are
doing this thing right there this
expression gets evaluated kicked in
right so that is all pretty much you
passing data from the parent component
to the child component right and
remember that when you see something
like this dot crops dot my object or
something like that then you should know
immediately that the data which you're
accessing right here is coming from some
other component which is sort of the
parent component of the component code
you are looking at right now so that is
how pretty much how props work and
they're kind of easy to do and yeah
that's all for this one and if you liked
it then don't forget subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
