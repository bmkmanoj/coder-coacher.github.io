May ho and welcome to your tenth Android
application development tutorial in
which I'm gonna discuss about linear
layout
well linear layout is a type of layout
obviously and what it does is and
actually before even that I would like
to tell you about why the heck do we
need even layouts well yes you could
design an application by just trying off
design like you want hello world here
and my awesome button here and perfect
you spend like three hours
designing how your application would
look like on screen device like this but
check this out
let me change it to some other device
like Nexus One or you know it's not even
like that so you can see here everything
gotta you know it's messed up because
you're spacing from the corner from the
edges is not the same now and the text
is kinda misaligned as compared to your
phone device screen and for other
devices as well and when you would start
moving into even complex layouts than
these ones then you would see that even
the slightest change in the screen
resolution would kind of disrupt your
app if you have a lot of things going on
without any layout so you would need a
layout to kind of make things organized
because a layout what it does is that it
would give you certain rules to layout
your elements or what we call them as
view for Android so each of them is a
part of a view so view is a class
actually in Java from which all of these
are inherited like text view and button
so we make use of that and we actually
just make use of them in XML as well so
it's kind of look has changed from a
theme so I would have for a to default I
guess
I guess that Genet the Nexus 10 what it
was earlier I guess next is for Olli
right so we had default team right here
here we go so we were talking about well
I forgot anyways so what I'm gonna show
you oh that is irritating I guess let me
just change it to Nexus 4 here first
then we have to change it to device
default and here we go alright so what I
was talking about was about linear
layout see yes so linear layouts how
they work is I'm gonna show you with the
worse drawing and trust me I the worst
painter or artist whatever you want to
call me ever so how do we draw freakin
rectangle and paint so what happens is
like if this is your android screen
right so you could just you know make a
linear layout by saying that you want
your layout to be either horizontal or
vertical so let's just say you have a
logo here for your application and then
two buttons which says sign up and log
in so what happens is that this kind of
thing this thing right here this top one
which consists of three elements is a
linear layout right so a linear layout
as the name says you can have linear
layout in a linear way that is a
straight way either horizontal or
vertical then what you can have is that
you can have another linear layout which
would be something like this right there
okay then this would be a vertical
your layout right with linear layouts
what you cannot have is something like
this well you can have that but actually
it would require you to have more than a
single linear layout so you know you
could just achieve this effect but it
would require you more than one linear
layout and we got a later on you know
know that using multiple layouts inside
a layout Escarra
you know expensive on performance and
even when you are you making use of
attributes like layout weight or
something so it kind of you know not
it's not recommended so for these type
of layouts we have relative layout which
are you know got a very cool for these
type of stuff but we'll take a look at
that later on so I hope you have
understood that what linear layouts are
and a quick revision would be like
linear layout would allow you to place
elements in a linear fashion either
horizontal like these or in a vertical
way so one layout can consist of either
horizontal or vertical so you could have
nested layouts obviously so you could
just create layouts like this could be
this is the main layout like if you can
see here as well or XML itself begins
with a relative layout so we have we
could have actually more relative
layouts or linear layouts as well we
just add something like this this should
be actually content content so you know
you could just create different sort of
layouts in a different layout as well so
that is how pretty much a linear layout
works and this is a separate linear
layout and this would be a separate what
the heck separate linear layout and this
would be a separate linear layout so
that is kind of pretty much how linear
layout looks like and work
that's pretty much it and from the next
tutorial I'm gonna show you how to
create some beautiful applications with
the help of linear layout so if you
