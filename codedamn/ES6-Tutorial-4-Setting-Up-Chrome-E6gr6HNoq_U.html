welcome to your fourth egg my scripts
sex tutorial in which I'll be showing
you how to set up your Google Chrome to
work with atma script now this may sound
weird because we already did set up a
compiler and that is to just compile our
at my script 6 code into egg mask 5 but
what happens is eventually that I'm
doing tutorials for ACMA script 6 so if
I just write some code here and then it
compiles into it my script 5 and then we
run it on the browser you know I just
defeat the purpose of the tutorial and
that is to teach you guys how browsers
interact with atmosphere 6 now if you
are coding atma script 6 for life
website for now for the year 2016 or
maybe even in 2017 you would require a
compiler for you know just if you are
doing like production skill development
but if you're just trying to learn
yourself then you can eventually enable
something called as the JavaScript
harmony flag in Google Chrome to harness
all the atma script 6 functionalities so
to do that just go to your Google Chrome
browser and I highly recommend using
Google Chrome for this purpose just go
to chrome Flags this page right there
and just search for Armani this one so
just go to this thing right here an able
experimental JavaScript if you can see
an able webpages to use experimental
JavaScript features and that's what
brings you the support for a class
script 6 and just click on enable
now just relaunch your browser and
you'll be good to go so if I just open
my web page again and reload now we have
access to
my script six and I can prove that by
just writing a simple function let my
war is one and let's just say
console.log my work well I would teach
you about this let keyword in the next
tutorial but I'm just gonna show you how
this works so yeah so that's how you
just set up your Chrome to work with
ACMA script six so in the next tutorial
we'll be finally starting off with es6
so that's all for this one don't forget
to subscribe and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
