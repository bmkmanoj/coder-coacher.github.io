Mei hole and welcome to your thirteen
electron framework tutorial in which we
are going to continue with our crazy
images and just give me a second here
okay so let's just begin where we left
now we were getting this error right
here if I remember so it saves me pretty
much that we have introduced to the
controller yet so let's just do that
after 20 folder let's get it from school
this will get functions so add that
that's pretty much it for now now what
we want is we want to have an interface
where we can pretty much show the image
to the user as well and show some
controls to the user as well so how we
can do those first list of all get rid
of that so we're going to create an ID
of image editor and this would be our
image editor page and then we can say
this pastorally preview right where
would where our image would be and we
can say that this image SRC now the
first problem is that we need to get the
path of the image from this controller
the home controller to the edges
controller right so we can pretty much
create a very simple so wizard which
would do our work so let's create a
service by app dot service and let us
call this image and this would be
something like our image but is this and
we can say this dot set image path is a
function which gives us a part and we
can say image path is but we can say
this get image but is another function
which pretty much just we've done the
image but
we have right and then what we can do is
inside our head controller we can
implement this image service we can or
not in head controller actually the home
controller and finally we can say image
dot set image path as fast and up inside
our edit controller we can again get
this image and we can stay that scope
dot image path is the image dot kept
image that and then finally inside our
edit image we can make use of ng SRC
actually instead of just occurring but
the echo would I guess probably work
just fine doesn't matter
so yep that's it
so if you take a look now if I upload a
one we get a broken image image but ok I
guess we can just do it like this and
now if we run it again you should see
that our image is loaded but it's way
too big so we're going to need some CSS
in here and set us dialogue CSS I'm
going to say this is edit image CSS now
we can see that right here we have a
preview and we are going to have some ID
image controls or image effects or
rather let's go with controls only let's
say Dave died effect type let's just
keep it to five for now we'll just add
or remove as we need so we're going to
say
preview display flex really yeah we're
just going to need that so we can just
do that a line item central and we need
these tools to be equal with right so
where's a flex one and for our global
selector we're going to say maximum
weight at 100% so that the image just
fits in again II won it is we see that
image fits in probably but our second
child is the actually scored because
there's no content in there so we're
going to say something like bright b rhs
brightness contrast I don't know and
word sepia and what else did I do gray
scale analysis give a cliff I will add
later on II won okay so we get this but
not really in the way we want so we're
going to add some styles in here display
flag flex direction it through and yep
so finally if you take a look we upload
a file we can see that our controls
aren't looking that good so we can just
customize image controls to be flex
direction column because for the preview
it doesn't really matter because this is
going to be one element so we can just
put that doesn't matter
right so that is pretty much how it
should look like
the words it yeah so these are our
options
and for the effect type we can apply
some more CSS and we can do that all day
so anyways we have just created our
basic layout for the editor and we're
going to make some CSS in here so that
this thing looks on the right looks good
and yeah that's all pretty much for this
one and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching and in the next one we're going
to continue again with the same app so
see you then real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
