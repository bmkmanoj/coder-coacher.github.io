to this tutorial series our mini-series
in which we'll be developing a rich
notification or twitter rich not vio
which will help you to get notifications
immediately has desktop notifications on
a computer whenever there's a
notification on your Twitter account so
let's get started with some little
coding stuff so first thing we need to
do is is to extract everything we have
on this URL not everything basically but
only this portion but you know we need
to do Ana Jack's request from our
extension page to this file right here
so in the last tutorials what we were
doing is we were clicking on this
extension which Bob dubs a little
modifier here but this trick simply
won't work with our new extension
because we need it to be automated and
not just whenever user clicks here to
inform the user what's happening so we
need to work with background scripts now
and here's my sublime text and let's get
started so we already have the
permissions and notifications we would
also like to have permissions as Twitter
handle
because we need to access this page or
we could specifically just restrict the
permissions to display only and we have
got the permissions ready so we don't
need this browser action now we don't
need the script but something called a
page and the page is simply just like a
script but we do have access to the HTML
ow as well so let's create this page and
I'll just go to do it we don't need any
specific title let's just add the script
back on the chairs and that should do
all right so let's just remove it and
just test whether it's working or not
let's reload the extension and we should
get an alert box any time now and here
we go all right should working so let's
just give it a little Ridge Twitter 95
maybe another question mark obviously
and some descriptions allows you to get
notifications immediately as dekstop
once
all right a comma for life and I guess
we are done with the formality all the
formal stuff we need to do okay so we
got this let's remove the alert box
and let's start with the cooling so in
the background page we need launched a
Ajax request and we would need to have a
lot of data filtering as well so I guess
I would just go with jQuery file because
this would kind of make life much easier
so I'll just create the jQuery as local
file
and in the manifest in this script are
we already have got the page so let's
just load jQuery right now
jQuery now I've made this resource local
to my extension so that you know I don't
need to get into any fuss of permissions
and all that for a simple library and
now let's test jQuery if it's working
then this code should execute and I
hopefully assume that you know how
JavaScript and jQuery are working all
right
so the first thing we need to do is to
do it at Jack's request to or not maybe
Anna Jack's just a get request to this
URL
and the function should log
or let's just use something else because
we have already got gone so lock lock so
data and let's just console.log this for
now and let's see what happens let's
reload our extension check out the
background HTML page
the console and bingo we've got all of
the data of that particular page and
since I am logged in right now into
Twitter
therefore this data belongs to my
Twitter account actually and let's see
if it really does yes so this sentence
is kinda associated with a Twitter
account only so yeah this is grabbing
data from my account and it's time to
append this into a variable I can
actually
let's just do it inside the gate only so
we have God who are HTML data as data
and let's just append it right now to
body
now let's just stick it out
and in here what we see is we have got a
lot of unwanted data as well which is
not required at all so what we can do is
we can just filter out what we need and
that is something this ID only we need
only this oh well right here and nothing
else from the page so let's go ahead and
do a HTML data and since it's HTML we
can use find and since it's an ID
so now let's reload this and let's check
this out the background HTML page
and bingo we have got only this much
data which was required but we have
calls a god
another Oh a list so we could just make
it restrict the first occurrence
and we could just die Rick location dot
reload so we have got only one so now in
every Li you see we have got a hell lot
of information and we don't need any of
these much of these actually so if you
see then
we don't need this activity header right
here or do we
because this truncated tweet or let's
just check it out
so
this header is something this and I
guess we only need header
don't we all right so we can actually
strip out everything else except the
header and which is everything else
includes activity truncated do it and
this thing right here so what we can do
is instead of just appending this let's
give it a variable
and
let's just see
or we don't need any data because we can
just find this one and just remove this
and it would remove every instance of
this similar to this one
and
just remove the second one or make it
prefix with a dot and let's let's reload
this
and I'll just do it body append
let's check this out
all right with the error
okay we have got an extra bracket right
here
so three like this again
um
okay so we don't see only the header one
and the rest of tools are stripped out
so we have got a clean nice version of
the header one and I'll just stop this
tutorial right here and we'll continue
with all this coding stuff in the next
tutorial as well so stay tuned with me
till then and don't forget to subscribe
