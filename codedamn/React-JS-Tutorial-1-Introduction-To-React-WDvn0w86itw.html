Smith will welcome to your very first
tutorial for a reaction and in this
tutorial I'm gonna discuss with you what
react is and probably why were you gonna
need that so react is a JavaScript
library yet another JavaScript library
like angular 2 but not really react and
angular 2 are sort of different in a lot
of things but they are quite similar in
some things as well so react is
basically used to build views the things
you see actually on a web page right so
react is basically used in the web apps
where you know a lot of dynamic things
are going on in a short interval like
you have a I don't know a chat
application or something which request
notifications or maybe a game or
something which you know this sort of
multiplayer or even single-player and
requires constant updating of some
things on the screen not all of them so
react is really quick and efficient and
doing that because it comes with a
virtual dorm which we were talk later in
detail which kind of speeds up the
process and updates only the things on
the webpage which need to be updated and
do not rerender the dorm every time so
react is a quick framework quick library
with JavaScript and it's open sourced by
Facebook obviously so that's all for the
introduction part and from the next
tutorial onwards I'm gonna show you how
to set up environment for react
development with sublime text and node
package manager with Bebo and web pack
so see you then in the next tutorial and
if you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
