mijo and welcome to your day 3 of making
code damn and in this video I'm gonna go
through over what I did in day 3 and
what I'd received from the community
from you guys to contribute to the open
source code that let's get started
okay so if we take a look inside the
pull request we see that today I
received three pull requests which is
great one by another speak' actually two
by him and one by Sam uke so if we take
a look at the first one it says move the
database connection string code number
and this to cookie config module okay
what that means is he actually created a
different file for the settings which we
have okay makes sense if you think about
it but I believe I do have already have
a secret study es file which kind of
does the same thing so if we take a look
so he is actually putting all of the
keys in that file but my secret study
has filed which you can see in the gate
ignore file right here you can see down
here secret stopped es so I'm not
committing this file so it contains
basically the keys the secret keys which
I do not want people to see the server
key is basically for Google's reCAPTCHA
or the keys which I'm using to sign the
Express cookies so that should not be
made public but otherwise I believe we
can make other stuff public and this
cookie this request might make it a
little bit easier to handle keys but
let's just leave a comment for - PK for
right now so we can say right here that
let's see I already have a secret
stop TS file which contains all the
information which does not actually need
to be made public and let's just keep it
simple so can you make a configuration
file just for the public keys all right
okay so let's see what solution he comes
up with time to move to next PR so next
what we have is moved CSS colors two
variables PR by Sam yoke this is
something I opened as an issue and it's
great to see that someone has worked on
it okay so let's see what he has done
okay make sense that's precisely what I
was asking so now we have variables for
global colors and white and all that
stuff yeah
these variables this dark gray radar
gray I remember I actually had these as
class names as well so yeah I guess it's
good its package lock got JSON so don't
need not to worry about that so I
believe you're good to actually just
come it changes just merge this into the
main branch and there we go
nice work Samuel and the next PR if we
take a look here making assets local
renamed images to their proper name all
right so yeah yeah that's actually that
adds more clarity to the project I
needed something like that so that's
great
another speaker has done that for the
site already so we can just basically go
ahead and merge this one as well or
that completes our third pull request
and great work as always so coming to
actually issues right now I haven't
really opened any issue for today but
received sample requests which was great
and we have some issues as well pending
for now on which we receive full
requests and coming to my code right
here if you see inside the comments
history let's see so I have started
working on something as a panel right so
what I'm trying to build here is
basically just providing a dashboard
kind of interface but just calling it
panel but before actually that what I
want is people who are actually very new
to programming basically who are not
familiar with programming at all I
should be able to provide certain
different experience to those people so
that I'm basically you know after
registration I want to ask people
certain sort of questions on which I can
just categorize them on the amount of
support they would need amount of
resources and all that stuff basically
just a structured timeline kind of thing
for every person so if somebody
experienced experienced users decide I
do not want him or her to actually just
bother with every small detail which we
usually know as programmers but for
somebody who is extremely new extremely
new to programming and all that stuff he
or she might need attention to those
small details so that's what essentially
I was thinking to build so I've started
working on panel for now but I'll be
working on kind of like hello or
something so yeah basically that's it
for this day three and I'll see you then
in day four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
