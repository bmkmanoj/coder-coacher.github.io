seventh angularjs tutorial Adam this
tutorial will be finally finishing off
with services factories and providers
now in this tutorial I'll be showing you
what are some major differences in
services factories and providers and I
guess the best way would be to write a
message in all three in a single good so
let's just first of all get rid of this
code or not all of that just the main
one now first of all let us create a
service so this should be simple let's
just write the service name as from
service and inside the function what I'm
going to do is I'm going to write this
dot message this this is from service
and that's it pretty much
and for application but fat free I'm
going to write from factory now let's
have a function again I'm going to do
warp factor equals to a black object and
I'm going to say flat free dot message
is this is from factory
and don't forget to return factory and
from the provider from provider and I
guess I forgot to tell you guys that
inside provider as well you can use this
keyword so you can make use of desktop
message equal provider or this is from
provider and obviously you would make
use of the get because get is what is
you can say initiated by the injector so
get function so this would return me
message or let's just rename this to
something else
m1 would be good so they start m1 and I
guess this would work so application
block controller is app function
from solace from factory and from
provider alright so I'm just going to
say that greet message here so scope dot
creat message is equal to from service
dot message from provided message should
be just message and from factory dot
message okay so let me just take a look
if everything's right doesn't seem so
okay so scope is not defined where you
will
okay so this is from service seems good
but bravado is not happy I guess okay so
if I change it to okay so I guess you
can rather change it to our mm and 1 and
this to m1 and see if it works okay
okay so yeah it works if you really want
to use that this one what you can do is
instead of writing route done instead of
returning anything you can actually
create get out of this function because
after all what's happening is that you
are eventually not you but the injector
is eventually looking for a get function
and it can find it inside this as well
because with this we are just writing
from the from provider only which we are
returning so if you see right now also
it works so you can either use this code
if you want to use this or if you just
want to avoid this at all then you can
make use of water m1 and just m1 here so
if you take a quick look at the whole
code you see not in services you're just
making use of this stuff message and
returning nothing it's up to you in
factory you can't use this you have to
make an object and return that in
provider it's up to you you can either
use this or return an object and
provider also gives you the flexibility
to you know act inside a provider
so from provider provider well that's
how it should be but it gets some
missing of function here
okay so there you go now inside this as
well you could write a function right
you can say set a name this function
would accept a name and this would just
set m1 to name plus a gap or a gap plus
name okay so now we can just set up our
provider from provider provider dot set
a name equals to go down if we take a
look at that in the browser you see that
we get this is sort of a provider go
with that now you see that how that's
how providers work and they're more
flexible than factories and services but
providers a whole lot less as well so if
you have a simple application or you
just don't care at all you can make use
of factories and services but if you are
looking to take control in your hands
you have providers there for you
so that's all how all three works and I
hope all three are clear for you and if
you still have any doubt then feel free
to leave comments below and I'll be
happy to assist you and that's it for
this tutorial and we'll be doing
something more interesting in the next
one and in the upcoming ones so if you
