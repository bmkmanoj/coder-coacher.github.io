hole and welcome to your 13th angular 2
tutorial in which I'll be covering
something known as ng far and angular 2
well we have already took a look at what
ng if is and similarly ng 4 as the name
says it would just I trade over some I
tribal objects like arrays or objects
something like that so we do had ng if
in angular 1 and ng for as well but
there's a bit of syntax change and
pretty much everything else the same so
first of all let me just get rid of this
and write public movie list and you can
just make use of the movie list only if
you want to Batman vs Superman yep
and then we have Civil War
Captain America Civil War and we have
Deadpool as well
let's just keep the list to three right
now again let's just get rid of this for
now right here I'm gonna create an
another list which just says Ally and
here's a bit of syntax change so what we
need to do and this Ally is first of all
right ng 4 just like we did for ng if
and this star just means throw over the
control to angular 2 and this is the
structural directive then for the
angular 2 now what I need to do is right
here will create a temporary I treatable
you know element for a list so what I'm
gonna say is ng for movie off movie list
now what this means is that I am just
grabbing one single element from this
movie listing at a time and that element
would go inside this movie variable
which I can then further use in my list
item to just add inside a tag or
something like that
so what I'm gonna do again is just close
this Li
and the ul1 as well
so inside this Li tag I'm gonna write as
an expression as what is this movie
similarly we had for example in angular
1 we had something like ng for movie and
movie les something like that then we
made you love the movie similarly we
have this thing right here in angular 2
so just simply take a look in the
browser as you can see we have got these
three movies listed out right here so
again if you can see in the UL tag we
see all of these three movies you can
just simply bind them in a span tag or
do like whatever you want to do this
would be still available again if you
just don't want to make use of this
another list you can just make user Day
right here and make use of P and again
this should probably work without the
list item as you can see now you can
actually have index as well for this I
know we had that in angular 1 so
similarly you can just a bunch of items
in the same statement so let's just say
I have this I ass index and this index
is by default value so this would just
increment itself automatically you don't
need to do anything so if I just do like
index then we have probably I want then
we have this thing right here so if I
just take a look at that you can see
that it starts from 0 obviously 0 1 2 so
that's how you pretty much add an index
to your ng4 directive and yeah so that's
pretty much a simple way of how you get
started with ng force so that's all for
this tutorial and in the next tutorial
we'll be looking at something really
cool with angular
- like adding data binding two-way
data-binding
exchanging data from user to the
components and all of that cool stuff so
