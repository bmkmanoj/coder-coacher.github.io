Mei hole and welcome to your eighth
electron tutorial in which you're going
to take a look at what remote is in
electron and why would you actually need
that so right now you have seen that in
our application we have implemented
these two buttons cross and minimize but
again they do not work obviously because
we are doing nothing to them right now
the problem is that these buttons are a
part of the renderer process but what we
need to do in order to maximize or
minimize a window we need to control
that from a main process right so our
main process has pretty much the methods
like wind dot minimize for example now
if I run the app you would see that
pretty much it does not fire and you do
not see it because it's minimized
right so this line was to minimize the
app which is essentially what we want
when we click this button so there are a
couple of ways I know to do this one is
now we can just make use of a IPC and
it's just interprocess communication and
then send a message to the main process
to minimize the window and do all the
stuff the other one is with remote
now what Remote does is that it exposes
some of the methods of your main process
to your regular process button it's
quite useful in these cases where you
just have to call a method of main
process so what we can do is so we can
is that our index dot HTML file we can
pretty much say analysis move it to
proper folders now
right and I'm just going to create some
folders in here
as this year and new file script is in
here and what I'm going to say is that
constant remote is require electron
right and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to listen for these options
click right I'll say this is cross and
I'm not saying this this or close rather
right cross and this is many mice right
I'm going to say document dot get
element by ID close dot a tequila
listener and then I'm going to say this
is click then I'm going to say close
window like that similarly for this I'm
going to say minimize window and change
this to minimize right and what we can
do is create function close function
many mice right and you can actually do
something like I don't know it's your
wish if you want to do something like
this it's your wish I just kind of go
with function close right now is just
easy to see and function many life and
actually this is close railroad minimize
way right and now we're going to make
use of this remote and say war window is
remote dot get current window we
obviously need to want to minimize the
current window and simply we can say
window don't minimize that's that
right other this is actually the code
for minimize window for closed window
what I'm going to do is again I'm going
to get this window dot remote cut get
current window and I'm going to say when
they lock close right so now and one
more thing we can do is inside our main
process we can say up or rather not up
or rather not app but actually window
dot can't close and then we can say or
actually I guess it doesn't get any run
interest in it we can say window is
equal to now so we're just doing good
stuff by cleaning memory right so yeah I
guess that is pretty much it for our
application to work and if I now try to
minimize this thing it doesn't work
really and let's just see why it doesn't
and even listen off now obviously we
have some problem because we are loading
JavaScript before the DOM is ready so we
can just actually move it down
old-school problem we can minimize the
window now we can close the window as
well so that is how you develop a very
basic electronic ation with a custom
toolbar and some control as well you can
actually add a maximize option here as
well and just fire window dot maximize
if it is not maximized and you can
pretty much ask it I can just write a
template for you that is maximized for
window and you can say
then this is your cordial window I can
say that if window that is maxi mice I
guess that was thing or rather let's
just make it cool and one-liner
window dot is maximized is true
then what I want to do is window dot and
maximize maxi nice and if it is false
then I want to do window daughter
maximize maximize rate right and yeah so
obviously this is on maximizing yes so
that's that this is how a maximize
window button would look like and you
can actually just add it as well if you
want maximize and this would be clicked
maximize window and I'm just gonna keep
it real stupid and simple I'm just going
to say this one as M right so if we file
this now you can see that if I click on
em I get some problem because this is
maximized right and if I click on this
again we are not getting back see got a
type when they're maximized I hate typos
so and you can see that you cannot
actually see but it's actually maximized
and if I click on this button again you
see that it gets unmarked summize right
so this is all very much you create very
basic controls with the electron up with
a frameless wind
so yeah that's all for this one and if
you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
don't forget to like the video as well
that helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
