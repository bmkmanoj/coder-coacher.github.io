it HTML and CSS tutorial in which we'll
be looking at something called comments
in HTML so comments are basically
additional piece of information you
could use to leave notes for future or
people in future who would want to look
at your code and see what your code does
so for example let's create let's say I
write B B tag stands for a paragraph tag
and would create a paragraph for you so
let's write hello world and close the P
tag simple enough B stands for paragraph
and would create a paragraph for you
and supposingly I want to tell you sir
that this displays in the world but I
would not like this to basically tell to
the world but only to people who need to
see that
or that I would make use of comments
comments in HTML are bounded like this
you're greater than side exclamatory
mark then two dashes then your command
in between with the space then your two
dashes again then a less than sign so
anything we write here anything right
here won't appear to the user but would
be available for the developer to edit
in the source code so for example let's
see this let's reload this as you can
see
hello wall gets printed and the speed
tag but not as anything would so now
right-click click on view page source
and by doing this you could view
actually what we died in this sublime
text on your browser so now you can see
that this commented out so it appears in
the source code but not in the
on the main page of the user and the
reason is because comments are used for
basically just hiding information and
writing small text of information for
development purposes so you could
actually also comment out your whole
HTML codes so that for example you want
to see what if I remove this code then
what happens but you would not actually
like to remove the code permanently from
your side so for the meantime you could
to comment out your code and if I
comment out this code and reload then as
you can see the hello world vanishes if
you look at the source code then it's
still there but it does not appear on
the browser because it is commented out
so this was a quick short tutorial on
comments in HTML and I guess this would
be pretty easy to learn for those coming
from a programming language background
like C or C++ but for those
not familiar with anything about
commands then if you're not familiar
with comments even now then I suggest
you do watch over again this tutorial
and I'm sure you would be mastered in
how to comment things in HTML so see you
then good bye and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
