third noches torial I'm a ho out of this
tutorial we'll be learning about the
require function in nodejs
so so far what we have done in node is
just simple console logging or
arithmetic and you know that you can
multiply numbers as well and pretty much
divide the last one so that's pretty
much what we have done so far in node
and now let's just make use of something
called as require now require is a
function in node which would allow you
to basically split your javascript files
in separate files and then use the
methods or variable so whatever you want
to use of different file in your working
file which you're currently working on
so let's just create a script here this
great new file let's just name it
method starts yes and inside here let's
just say that I'm just creating methods
variable which is an object methods dot
let's just say update server this is
some important function and why not
let's just say method start eat cookies
why not
Nord loves cookies the I would prefer to
have chocolate cookies and then we have
methods dot what we like node is
function our console log let's just say
no js' is awesome
so what we have done here is I've just
created a simple methods object and a
sign of three functions here do that
same object now what I need to do is
inside the script file script trilogies
I'm just gonna do our response is
require method start yes and obviously
you would be wondering that why I have
written like a dot and a slash and then
method Sturgess when this file is
already in the working directory the
current working directory will obviously
that has a reason behind that and we'll
be learning about that reason in the
section where we use or we basically
we'll learn about the end built modules
or custom modules which we you know just
download from other sources so you have
to wait till them because that would be
relevant for you if I explain it right
now so currently I have this response as
is as this is directly obviously your
JavaScript this require or basically the
node doesn't know which thing it has to
make available to the script file and
which think not so obviously you won't
like to have all of your variables and
all of your methods functions everything
publicly available to every other file
where it just uses a simple required
keyword so what you can do is here you
have to make use of something called
exports now exports is simply you can
say a node object which would just you
know contain some properties or
functions or you know just the data
which you want the file which is using
this required keyword to have access to
so when you make use of this exports you
can destroy it
let's just say export stored data is
methods so this is the squaring this
variable export stored data and this is
methods and now what I can do is I
simply console.log this
once let's just see how this works so
let's just type node script reader j s
it saves me okay so it can't find so CD
documents see you know GS and okay so
now we are in the working directory so
node script 3j s rich hose whoa
got a typo there so this is it
and as you can see it returns the object
data which updates r is a function and
it could eat cookies is a function and
no it is a function
so obviously that won't display the
whole function definition here to keep
the code precise so what we can do is I
can just do something like response dot
call any of these methods and
is not a function no mind so what we
need is response Don data as you can see
this works now so what's happening here
so exports this variable we are I'm
attaching this property right here which
is another object because this one is an
object and so this contains the static
and Dane's all of these methods and
since I'm exporting them to another file
which kinda makes this available to this
file therefore all of these methods are
available so you can build a kind of a
meaningful application for example if
you just want to you know sub numbers a
B and just return a plus B you can just
add methods dot circle area and just the
radius you need I guess just return what
is the cervical area it's two times math
dot Phi times R and that is these
circular friends so better change it to
circle friends because because the area
is PI R square so never wide then we
have methods dot area of rectangle a
comma B put on a star B and so on and so
forth so what else you can do is you can
just create this variable output and set
it to or basically just keep it like
that
therefore inside this function you can
say output is a plus B and then return
this and even if I initialize it some
value like this is one three three seven
or whatever and then do something like
this this thing and then just replace it
with the output are again with output
you'll just say a sprites be
and retard output so what I want to show
you guys is that whatever you don't
attach to the exports what we available
with this file so if I do like response
if I do like clawed soul or response dot
data dot or basically if I just got so
loads this thing right here ad once
again all right so this is a function
god dammit
oh so we have got all of that screwed up
a little bit okay so now as you can see
this output variable is not in here so
if I do something like explored start
output is equal to output then you will
see that this output is contained in the
output as well so as long as you don't
attach the properties to exports or as
long as you don't make use of the
keyword this so as long as you don't do
these of the any of these two either you
don't make use of the expose or don't
make usual did this then your methods or
your variables won't be available to the
file which is requesting your file with
the required keyword so if I run this
okay so if I run this then as you can
see output is still available because I
made use of this so that's pretty much
how you make use of the require and this
would come a lot handier when you are
just creating a simple HTTP server which
will be looking real soon and it has got
a lot of other uses as well so yeah so
that was just a simple beggining and if
you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe thank you for watching guys
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
