at HTML and CSS tutorial in which will
be finally finishing off with our html5
layout page by just filling up some
dummy content right here and a sidebar a
nice little sidebar so let's get started
so
let's create
a container container or the content now
let's just say this is the divider left
side and sidebars four divided right
side and you could actually named them
aside or sections as well but I'll just
go with deaf
right here you would place like H to my
content goes here and right side as well
sidebar
okay so let's take a look how this looks
so it looks kind of like distorted so
let's fix them up with their positions
right here and just make some space for
the CSS and container first of all
should be width of 10 60 pixels margin
yep so that it just matches up with the
header on the left side should be at the
left side with seven sixty pixels
looks good
on the right side should we at the right
side with 300 pixels
so here we go
I'll just place
please hold it ska-p this thing
go here business
and this should be seven
60 x 600 because i need a big banner
right here and this should be around 300
x 600 let's take a look how that looks
so you see the images are merging
because there's no technically no gap
between sidebar and the right side so
what i can do is i can make this 270
pixel and marginal left as 30 pixels so
now this should actually fix up our
problem
this should be 270 archery
so here you go that's how you create a
normal kind of side a normal kind of
thing with html5 and CSS and I can go
ahead and create a footer as well down
there but i'll leave data you that task
up to you guys and I hope that you
understood something about HTML and how
that works with this tutorial and up to
this tutorial because from now onwards
I'll be taking the difficulty level to a
little bit high so stay tuned with me
