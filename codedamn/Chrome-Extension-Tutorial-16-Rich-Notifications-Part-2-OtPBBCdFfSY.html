your 16th Google Chrome extension
development tutorial in which we'll be
continuing with our rich notifications
which we started in the last tutorial so
in the last tutorial we created a nice
little pop-up which appears when we
click on the extension button because
then only the script this page fires and
this page calls the script and the score
is fired by the browser so now let's do
some edits with our code and down if we
see on the official API page then we can
see some little examples this one I just
used in my previous tutorial and we have
got this create image notification
example now image would kind of create
your pop-up box and an image under your
information so let's see how this works
so let's say I change the type basic you
type image and I put a comma here and I
write image URL same as my icon wonder
so now when I would reload this test
extension and would take on this
then you see that I get this image right
here as below this content which is the
default which was the default pop-up in
our basic one so if you see right here
that then it says that you the tree is
too too rich for your image otherwise a
black border friends the image that
technically means that Google is not in
favor of displaying transparent images
so just make sure to have your opaque
background in the and in the room age in
the ratio of trees to do and also it
says that you do strict content secure
policy the URLs must be local or blob or
data URLs so your files should be
locally available in your extension are
not should be loaded over the web ok so
this was how do we create a image pop up
notification and let's see about the
list 1 so with a list is pretty much
like same like your content 1 right here
but the difference would be this text
would be bolded and
I guess some bullets are maybe number
ordering would be added to it and as you
can see this items is kind of array
which contains is own object with the
title message and the message one so
let's just copy this thing
who has got time to type this and we
have got this items one let's copy this
again let's paste it a bunch of times so
let's just edit this
part of one this is item to prop up to
this is item 2
three this is item three okay so we are
good to go
don't forget to change it to list and
comment out your image URL because we
can't have image URL in the list one
so now let's real of this let's go back
by a pitch
let's click the extension icon and you
can see now that we have got a nice
little list and the difference is this
text is opacity maybe or the color is
black but this color is little grayish
type which distinguishes it with the
list heading the list content so that's
pretty much how you insert a list inside
your pop up the small pop-up and we
could actually create a progress as well
let's see how do we do that so you
guessed it right first of all we need to
edit the type 1 to progress remove the
items 1 and add the progress to let's
say 30
and now it's reload extension
and let's click on this and as you can
see we have got this sweet little bar
down here filled up to 30% of its width
and you could actually make this move
and how do we do that we'll learn that
in our future tutorials so that's all
pretty much for this and okay so yeah so
one thing we could learn in this
tutorial as well is that how do we
respond to the user action let's say
let's say your pop up is not that kind
of informal but it's something like
let's say Bill Gates
just tweeted
or just replied to your tweet
which is a big achievement but
extension doesn't hear and message would
be like the tweet which he has sent so
let's say you are doing a very nice job
teaching people how to code
Chrome extensions thank you very much
sir and the icon should be the Twitter
one Molly and actually we don't need any
progress for this I'll just remove this
and I'll just turn this to basic one and
now let's call back as well we don't
need any call back and now what we want
is whenever someone clicks on this
pop-up right here
they pop up down here then this should
open a new tab and this should create a
new tab basically and should redirect
the user to the tweet so how do we do
that we attach a even handler to this
thing right here and how do we do that
with this API so this is an event
listener which is Chrome notifications
on button clicked add listener and let's
just copy this thing and down here let's
paste this and this is also asynchronous
so let's see I write
redirect window as the function
and what would happen is that whenever
somebody clicks on this pop-up which
will pop up right here this redirect
window function would be fired so let's
say I just do
hello it
hello world just to show you the click
event so let's reload this
click on the icon we got a pop-up let's
click on the pop-up
okay so
let me see
Chrome notifications on button add
button click
okay
and I guess this basically for for the
event which is fired and when the button
is a some sort of button is clicked so
this should be instead of on but turned
on clicked
so now let's reload this let's click
here and let's click on this and we go
out a hello world alert box so that's
how we create an attached a even fluster
to your Chrome notification pop-up box
the show images analyst and progress in
the chrome rich notifications and that's
pretty much all about that and I'll see
you then in the next tutorial and don't
forget to subscribe thank you for
