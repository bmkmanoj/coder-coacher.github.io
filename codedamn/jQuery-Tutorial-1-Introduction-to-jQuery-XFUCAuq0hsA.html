first jquery tutorial in this tutorial
we'll be looking at what is jQuery
how it is useful and why the heck do we
need jQuery now to start with jQuery is
a library of JavaScript now by this I
mean that jQuery is a kind of extension
to JavaScript that means everything you
do in jQuery can already be done in
JavaScript using the traditional
JavaScript code but we use jQuery
because it is more user friendly it is
cross browser compatible and you get a
lot of support and documentation with
jQuery and it makes your code to be
readable and easier to understand so
here I have the official jQuery site
from where we can download jQuery
if you visit J grade calm and go down
then you'll see some examples of jQuery
and now to use check very what we need
to do is we need to include a script
file a jQuery script file which is down
here
let's view it on Google APs
now Google actually manages certain
JavaScript libraries certain popular
JavaScript libraries like jQuery
angularjs and all these so jQuery is one
of those shaker is down here yeah so
so from here we can grab the latest
jQuery version for development let's
copy this
jQuery two point one point three is the
latest stable version of Java jQuery
library currently so here i stream to
http so here we are including a jQuery
library which helps us to use our Chico
a code down here in the body and if you
visit this URL down here then you will
see a lot of random text going on
because this is the minified version and
if we move minified and just see the
normal jQuery then it's kind of
understandable but very huge library
very huge code so we compress the
library to reduce the file size so if
you want to read them this you're free
to go and try to understand what jQuery
is doing but I'll suggest you to leave
this stuff with developers or jQuery and
move on move on with my series so
now we know that what is cheek very wise
cheek really used and how do we use
jQuery so jQuery is basically used for
Dom manipulation just like we do
document or write or document dot get
element by ID JavaScript jQuery makes it
pretty simple and easy for us to do so
let's write our first hello world
program in check ready make sure you
have included your jQuery file down here
to write a first hello world program in
jQuery what we do is body
dot html' hello what
I'll explain what's happening here in
the next tutorial our what this dollar
sign means and all these methods and
properties and selectors in the next
tutorial but for this tutorial
welcome to jQuery thanks for watching
