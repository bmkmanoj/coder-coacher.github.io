29th Android application development
tutorial my name is Mei who had in this
tutorial what I'm going to do is I'm
going to start off with a brand new
Android application which would be a
newsreader not as fancy as this one but
pretty much will be making use of the
same API which we made using the ionic
one right so before starting this
tutorial I have to say that I am
scraping this data right here from this
read now and there is no guideline on in
shots the website which I am using to
take out news headlines and description
on images and this website does not say
that it is allowed to do so so I have
restricted access of this API ganda this
JSON API to only localhost for learning
purposes right so this is access control
or our origin do localhost on at both
808 1 0 0 so if you try to access this
API with any other thing then you won't
be able to do that so what you can do
instead for these tutorials is that I'm
just gonna paste a bit of copy a bit of
code snippet from this JSON and would
give you a link in the description you
can make use of that JSON file instead
of this whole file because an ionic we
could probably set the know the port at
which we are running our app but for
Android it might be a bit ugly to do so
to run our device on a specific port
well we do have devices running on
specific port but I would just recommend
you guys to just copy a bunch of this
JSON and then try with it and it is
actually in real time see this the pink
ball used this is the same news which is
the latest one right so in the last I
have this last ID as well because this
is asynchronous
this is a Jax actually not a circle
sorry
so that is wired to make use of more
make more news load so yeah if you have
seen this tutorial you might know that
but what I want you to do instead is
that I would be making use of this API
only or I would be just making use of
gs1 if you want me to so what I'm going
to do is I'm gonna pretty much create a
new project because this project has
become a lot of mess kind of so what I'm
going to say a new project and this is
my project
which would be let's say this is
newsreader let's just name it like in
shots you're not an official and again I
highly recommend you to make use of this
any of the code you or any of the
snippet you pick up from there for
educational purposes only do not you
know make use of this API as an a
commercial one because even after
setting that access control you would
actually get access to this API directly
if you want to but if you know how to do
that will probably you might not be
using my API at all
so let's click on next then for minimum
SDK let's keep it on 16 only right so it
targets 95 point 2 and I'm just going to
go with an empty activity why not or you
can just go with basic one as well it's
up to you so I'm just going to go with
an empty one for now and I'm just gonna
call this my main activity only so
finish and it should launch new window
probably and let's just wait for it to
build
and right here is just running our
processes so that is pretty much what we
are we going to do in this tutorial a
little bit of setup so I guess you can
do all the stuff yourself as well so I'm
just gonna push this on github as well
if you want to just download the source
and would leave a link as well on this
video as an annotation or in the
description whatever I like so yeah so I
guess that's all for this tutorial and
in the next tutorial what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna show you how to pretty much
set up this package nicely and start off
with the Android app development our
first app for stablish you could
actually launch your Play Store but not
really with the API which I am making
use of so yeah that's all for this
tutorial and if you like that then don't
