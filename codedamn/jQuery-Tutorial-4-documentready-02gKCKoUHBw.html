jquery tutorial and this tutorial will
be discussing about an important
function and j plating
all document ready
now document already function in jQuery
is used to execute all the code after
the dorm Israeli by Thomas ready and in
that at a certain time in document when
the document is being loaded into the
browser the JavaScript cannot interact
with the Dom directly just after say a
1000 of a second or kind of 20 to 30
milliseconds after the document has been
received in the browser browser needs to
bars document in its own way so document
is not available for the JavaScript to
be read so for example i'll show you
what i mean i have this tape down here
in jquery using our hello world program
which we done in hello world program
let's retrieve the content of this day
to do that we'll follow the traditional
this symbol tells us that use jQuery
selector is still we want to get diff
and what we want to do the action is get
the HTML and the empty parenthesis
suggests that you want to get the HTML
we do not want to set the HTML so now
content has the HTML of div and now
let's alert content
here we have our browser let's refresh
and we get undefined but why why do we
get undefined though we have a div in
the document and this is because this
crib down here execute faster than
browser browser do not get time to add
this dip tag into the door so what
happens is browser says okay so you want
me to execute the script first instead
of loading the document completely I
will do that so browser excuse the
script instead of loading the document
since our spirit wanted something from
the document so it returned JavaScript
see is that it's not and the Dom yet
returns undefined so to fix this problem
we use document dot ready now as the
names it is
just explain what I'm doing it
so as the name suggests we are checking
once the document is ready perform a
function an anonymous function what to
do with that function is this thing now
let's save this file and let's try to
refresh this and we get all content in
the alert box so what happened here is
here
this is a kind of event which is binded
to jquery which is binded to dong and
once dom is ready once the browser says
porque tu che jquery once the browser
show the thumbs up to jQuery jQuery says
ok I'm ready as well and jQuery execute
this code inside this function if you
try to alert this
this first let's say
I'm alerting this first then let's just
move it down so it appears like this
code would run first and then this would
but actually if we refresh this page
then the order of alert is one and then
we get old content and this is because
this is gold execute without waiting for
this dog down here to load so JavaScript
says okay you want to go first then I'll
alert you javascript alerts this on the
browser and this function is fired when
the document is completely ready so this
was a tutorial about document ready
which allows you to wait for the dorm
that is the code to node completely in
the browser and only after that allows
you to do the Dom manipulation so in the
next tutorial we'll be learning more on
this and we'll be using document already
a lot of dimes do
run radius kinds of codes and functions
in JavaScript so till then keep watching
