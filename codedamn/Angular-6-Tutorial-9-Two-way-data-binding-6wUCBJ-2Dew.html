Mei who and welcome to your land angular
6 tutorial in which we're going to take
a look at what the way data binding is
and how to work with to ready the
binding in our angular applications so
let's get started
okay so let's first of all start with
what actually two-way data-binding
actually means so in the last toriel
what we did is that we discussed how we
can take some interactions from view
side to JavaScript side and from our
JavaScript side back to our view side
for example sometimes you want you know
when the user clicked a certain button
so in that case what are you looking for
is that you want some data from the EU
side into your JavaScript into your
controller kind of thing and other times
what you want is that your controller
should update some data in your view for
example you're fetching some data from
some REST API and then you want to
display it in that case what you want is
that the JavaScript which fetches the
API the data from the API it should
update your view so in this case in
these two cases what we are doing is
that in the first case we are binding
data from view to controller or view to
our JavaScript and in the other case we
are binding data from JavaScript to you
now what if in some cases for example
the best one is that you want to mirror
your input text in that case what you
want is that for example if you take a
look
plus a squared input type text here real
quick
and and now if you take a look for
example whatever I write here you want
to display here as well so that's
mirroring so in that case what's
happening is that I am updating the view
as a user I'm getting it
so I want it back in the controller now
the reason I wanted back in the
controller because controller updates
the view so what I want in this case if
you realize is two-way data-binding
I want the view to update the controller
or our JavaScript file in this case and
our JavaScript file will update the
mirroring value here so we need to
weight it up on here so how do we do
that well we can make use of what we did
in the last tutorial to achieve the same
now angular if you had used angularjs
then it actually come came with a baked
in two-way data binding system but
angular kind of mimics it angular from
angular 2 onwards so there's a way in G
model is away but it's not really
actually two-way data mining we're just
making use of both the data bindings to
make it like two-way data Mendel so for
example if you want to mirror this input
type takes one you what we need to do is
we'll write value in here now this binds
it to our controller to our JavaScript
right so let's say I write something
like text what I want is that when I
write in to this input I want to get
that text into my JavaScript so this
will do what it does is that it would
reflect value whatever is the value of
this text variable for example if we
change this add component I change this
to text it's safe take a look you can
see that we get app so this binds it to
the value of the input type feed okay
now we are our controller our JavaScript
is updating the view now we want
view to updated JavaScript so in that
case what we have is this input director
input Handler and what this would do is
that it would help us to update the
value for this text variable so let's
just say I call something like update
and value like this and what I want is I
want to pass and a special object here
called init now let's take a look at
what the subject actually is so what I
want is that my method here is update
one you right so I'm just going to paste
it and say E is my event so I can just
console dot log it e
do we go and if I save it take a look in
the browser
open console
now if I go to my input field and start
writing you can see that I get an input
event whose target is our actual input
input field right so if I do like ease
dot target dot value let save let it
reload
now if I could console and start writing
here you should see that the values
update right here okay now how do we
update this well this is now this should
be easy what we have to do is just write
this dot text is equal to e dot target
dot value there we are and now what I
want to do is pretty much write text in
here right and yep so now if you take a
look you can see that we get it mirrored
now if I write something
this is two-way data-binding I'm writing
this in the view it goes to my
JavaScript file that is one part of
two-way data-binding the JavaScript
updates the variable on the view which
displays the text and view is updated by
that particular variable so this is a
two-way data-binding now you can also
implement two-way data-binding with your
custom directives which we would take a
look at later on in the series how to
create custom directives but what
essentially the part is that these
directives so what these directives are
for example this valley directive and
this input directive these are the
directives which angular provides out of
the box and we can do is we can actually
create our own directives as well which
we can make two-way data-binding
possible in those we can make that and
one such example is ngmodel which pretty
much just does whatever we have done so
far in a very simple statement so for NG
model what we do is that we just write
ng model inside a square bracket and a
parenthesis right so how we do that is
that we just write ng model a square
bracket or parentheses ng model
and we write the name of our variable
here in our case this is text it's safe
have the component we do not need this
function anymore but safe now the thing
is that an NG model is not really part
of your basic app so you need to import
that you can see that we get ng model is
not a known property of input so we can
do is we can go to our modules file we
can import from angular
forms because that is a part of form we
would write ng model just like this and
now what I want is that I want to import
this module right now we can just clear
off the difference between declarations
and imports here as well as a whole they
are application this application is a
module right whatever you are coding is
a model now modules as I said in the
very beginning of the series are
independent piece of codes which can run
independent of each other so what we are
doing here is that we are importing a
module ng model from angular forms which
is an independent module capable of
running standalone right and that's what
happens yeah so we import that module
into our own module whereas this
declaration is used to add components
and directives and other stuff and pipes
into your application providers is used
to inject services we will take a look
at that later on so the main thing here
is that import is used to add you can
say feature based modules into your main
application and that's what we are doing
here so whenever you are importing some
different module into your app you need
to get that put that into import section
and whenever you are writing your own
component or directive or pipe you're
gonna put that into the declarations so
let's say we have ng model in here so we
should be good to go now if we take a
look here and let it free compile okay
and this we take will open the code
unexpected that I've been ngmodel and
that is because this is not
ng-model this is forms module we did the
forms module from the angular forms if
you seen it now take a look here we
should be able to see that if you bite
something here it successfully gets
mirrored so ng-model
is a directive which is inbuilt for you
which acts as a two-way data-binding
directive now we can create our own
two-way data-binding directives as well
as I said we'll come to that later on in
the series but that's all for this one
