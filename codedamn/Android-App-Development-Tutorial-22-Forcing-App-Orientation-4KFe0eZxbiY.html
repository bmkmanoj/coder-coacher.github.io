welcome to your 21st Android application
development tutorial my name is Miho and
in this tutorial I'm gonna show you the
coolest app on Play Store ever so I have
just created this application and it's
just gonna burn the rocks on Play Store
and Google is probably gonna crash with
the number of downloads going on well
what's so special about this app is that
it's the lightest app in the world and
it's native so that's pretty cool and
right now if you see it on my emulator
this app looks cool but it makes me sad
that this application has a weight less
than its height right so I can just
rotate the screen right so this now is
kinda better but what I want is that
this application should look like this
view only whenever it's launched like if
you have if you would have seen some
applications which are strictly
landscape or strictly strictly portrait
view only so if you even try to rotate
the screen they don't rotate it actually
so to do that what you need to do is you
need to make your activity as a
landscape or a portrait well you have
alternatives in Java as well which we'll
take a look at later on but the
disadvantage for Java is that you need
to unnecessarily restart your activity
if you just write that in oncreate
method right so because your activity is
already created you have to restart it
into another view in in portrait or
landscape if it isn't - pretty much
make that happen so what you have to do
instead is open this Android manifest
dot XML and this is kind of engine for
your project it would just manage all of
your information like your activities
which is your launcher activity and then
your icon for your activity application
pretty much and your name of your
application the package name
all that good stuff so we're gonna take
a look about this later on but for this
tutorial I'm just gonna say do this
activity which is my main activity right
and this intent filter is nothing but
it's just a way for telling that this is
my launcher activity so whenever the
person installs my app it should create
an icon inside menu with the activity
the launched activity pointing to this
activity menu as you do right so I'm
gonna say to this menu activity Android
screen orientation and now you can see a
bunch of options right so you could just
go with any option for example like
portrayed as default one actually in
portrait or landscape by default one
depending upon the rotation of the phone
then there are a bunch of other
activities so feel free to try them and
when you are done with all the stuff you
did stupid stuff then just go with
landscape alright
so now if I run my application you would
see that my application launches in
landscape mode by default and even if I
try to rotate my screen it doesn't
actually rotate the phone because you
know it would in reality you would just
physically rotate your device but for
this emulator it just performs the sort
of simulator rotation but it doesn't
happen because androidmanifest us and
lets it happen right so that is how
pretty much you make your activity and
actually this activity is sticky or
basically it's landscape sticky it's not
that if I add another activity it would
be landscape as well so it really
depends if you add this or not
so my activity is sticky and soon we are
gonna take a look at how to create some
more activities and have some fun with
them so that is all for this tutorial
