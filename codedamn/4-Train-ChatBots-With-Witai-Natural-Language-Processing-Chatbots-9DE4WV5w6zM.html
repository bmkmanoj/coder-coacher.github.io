and welcome to you another chat bar
tutorial for with dot AI using actually
I said it wrong for messenger using
widow di and in this tutorial we're
gonna train our chat board with some
data according to whatever your chat
board is so in my case chat board which
I'm creating is for code damn so expect
people to ask questions like how do I
learn this how do I learn X how do I
learn why and stuff like this so what I
want to do is actually to train this wit
not a I thing I want to straight away
till it a question how do I learn let's
just say angular right and once I do
that I'm going to add a new entity
now what this entity means is that what
you want do with things that the user is
telling you right so the first thing I
want to do is actually know what
actually the user wants to do right
broadly classifying the action of the
user so first of all I want to know the
intent of a particular user so I created
an entity called intent and I'm gonna
give it a value of let's just say
learning now what this means is that I'm
categorizing sentences like these how do
I learn something it has an intent
having a value of learning so whenever a
user sends a sentence something like
this to my chat board this window day I
would automatically be able to
understand that the intent of the user
the purpose of the user in this sentence
has a value of learning with that being
done the next thing I want to do is I
want to extract what the user wants to
learn in this case it is angular right
so I'm gonna highlight this angular
thing and I'm gonna create
entity not this time this would be an
entity which consists of names of
languages so I'm gonna write a language
name here double-click on it
enter right and it creates a new value
of angular alright perfect
now if I while I did this you should be
able to see that we have these two
entities added to our chat products all
right but what is the straight and free
text and keywords well trade means that
wit not a I would look at your whole
sentence the complete sentence to judge
Lee in debt and obviously that makes
sense because the intent should be
judged only after reading the complete
sentence
there are as free text and key words
means that these are the free text or
the key words inside your sentences
which we want to extract so with that
being done what I want to do is actually
train it a little bit more with some
data so let's just say how do I learn
JavaScript let it do its magic and let's
just see
if I add a new entity here intend value
of learning and I highlight JavaScript
value of language name well I did this
all right how do I learn jQuery okay you
can see that this time it big did on its
own we have the language name as correct
now which is not really confident on
this one right now it's just 50% but we
are missing the intent here so this is
again learning so I can just add that
and validate and I can add something
like how do I learn PHP let's just say
and you can see that with again returns
me a language name of PHP and we are
again missing the intent so I'm gonna
put it as learning and hit validate you
can see that it could not validate this
expression because there is some sort of
problem with my internet I believe just
give me a second on this
okay let's just try one more time so
let's just say how do I learn about es8
okay
it gets the intent that I want to learn
but it's not sure about what language it
is so I'm gonna highlight es 8 I'm gonna
add a language name and hit validate how
do I learn about let's just say react it
gets the language named as react
I can add an intent of learning here as
well and let's just say how do I learn
react native and I can see that gets the
language name wrong right now so what I
can do is remove this and we were wait
react native it is I can get rid of this
select this add a react native language
name and it never intent with a value of
learning and hit validate
okay with that being set up what I want
to do is hop over to my messenger and
actually let me first of all select a
built in NLP here within was it it's
custom and the width of a iced over
access token just give me
my server access token is in place a
knife I reload and actually if I visit
the end grog page as well so if I take a
look here and if I say let's just say
hey because the bar is right now
configured pre-configured to just
respond to whatever I said it's just
echoing me back but right here you can
see inside NLP I'm getting entities as
an object let's just try something like
how do I learn HTML okay and inside our
post request you can see that what we
have in here is the language name as
HTML now mind you that we did not add
HTML anywhere here at all inside our
languages name you can see that it's not
HTML but the mod engine which was still
able to pretty much guessing that this
is a language name with a confidence
value of 55% which is not so good
because we haven't trained the board
very much yet but the intent of learning
is quite confident which is the way
which has a value of 86% all right
so how about how do well learn about
jQuery right if you take a look in the
in croc how do I learn about jQuery you
can see that it has a value intent of 99
percent that's a whooping high because
it exactly matches one of the train data
we have so yeah so let's just say I add
about I add an intent here let's just
say tell me something about well that's
not really what people ask but anyway so
tell me something about jQuery okay so
you can see that it actually guessed it
quite well
95 percent score with an intent of
learning that's good
language name could be jQuery then we
are and then we have let's just say how
do we begin with let's just say what we
have in here Python well let's just see
you can see that the board was not able
to predict so I can add an intent of
learning here and a language of Python
here that's it and how do I begin with
begin with Ruby on Rails Allah so see
how the bots doing not really well so
this is at intend ourselves learning the
language name would be actually this is
not really a language but anyways so
let's just say you know that fact let's
just validate so if now if I ask
something like do I begin with react go
to an grok see the post request you can
see that we have an entity of language
name with the confidence of 95 percent
of the value of react but we do not have
an entity of our intent so we need to
train it a little bit more hard to I
baked in will let us say HTML if I add
so if I add an intent here of learning
the value half
unlesss a language named validate and
try to run it one more time you know you
get the idea how you have to train your
Chad but a little so it's more like
putting in some manual data you have to
do that if you want to make it a good
one and once we are here again let's say
how do I begin with CSS hit enter go to
end rock get the post request we can see
that it saves me or the language name
value of confidence of over 90% just
about 90% and the intent of a confidence
of 99% so you can see that with just a
few examples it's the confidence is
grouping high for unknown values as well
for the intent as well so that is pretty
much how you would train your chat board
with EDI and according to this what you
want to do is actually for in my case
what I would do is if I have tutorials
related with this on youtube as a
playlist or something I would return
that playlist or the top two videos and
send it to the user what you would like
to do depends entirely on you so yeah
that is how pretty much you would train
your wit AI chat board and you know only
takeaways from this video is you have to
create an intent you have to creates
custom entities which define what kind
of keywords or free text you want to
extract and the intent and overall which
is labeled as a trade
Caesar sentence overall and categorizes
its into one of its values so right now
I have just one intent which is quite
less and a lot of language names so you
can have multiple entities here
and multiple intent values as well so
that is all for this one and if you
liked it then please don't forget to

I'll see you then in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
