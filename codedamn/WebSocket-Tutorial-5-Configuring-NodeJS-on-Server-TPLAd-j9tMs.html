Manu and welcome to your fifth
WebSockets tutorial in which I'm gonna
show you how to set a WebSocket for a
node and you might need a library for
that because you know to listen to
WebSockets on node it's not just plain
easy to implement it native so what you
need to do is first of all let me just
create a new folder server so that I
don't just mess around a new file or not
actually a new file just open this
folder what this one just just open got
down folder right and right here I say
NPM in it and I'm assuming that you have
NPM install and node install as well so
if you don't have that installed it's
quite simple and easy to do
just go ahead on nodejs org it's
something like that I guess and just
download the software it's kind of easy
to install it's just next next stuff or
I guess I do have that procedure as well
somewhere in my node.js tutorials as I
guess one or two so just you can just
take a look at that so I'll just see
that this is WebSocket server no
description for now indexed Archie is
test command
nothing nothing nothing oh damn nothing
yep okay so our package structure so and
it's ready and if I create okay anyways
so if I just create in next our Cheers
right here and I say or actually before
beginning I need to install that
WebSockets which I was talking about so
just
you npm install WSHH WSHH is for
WebSockets and you can just use the safe
flag as well if you want to so as to you
know just add it to your dependencies so
here we are with WebSocket installed and
now here just to our server is require
WebSocket not server and then our s
maybe new server and then here we have
both as let's just say five thousand one
right and now again just go to your
server folder and say load index dot GS
it n true and as you can see it's
waiting for us that means it's kind of
working so you have threaded your kind
of WebSocket so now if I go ahead and
console or actually let me just edit my
script there and change this to
localhost and what wood are we listening
on five zero zero one here we go
and if I reload this just one now socket
connected successfully right but we
don't get any on message because
obviously I'm just sending that but the
server is not configured to resend or
you know reply to any of the replies so
that is how pretty much you implement a
basic WebSocket server on node you know
it's actually just half of the so it's
not replying but we just take a look at
how to do that in the next tutorial
because that is all for this one and if
you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
