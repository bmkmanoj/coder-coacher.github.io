first tutorial in require.js
javascript library so in this tutorial
series will be learning about everything
that is related to required years like
what is required years and why would you
use that in your projects and all about
its syntax and its usage best practices
compressing your code with other GS and
all that good stuff so to begin with let
me just tell you what required juice is
actually so if you look at their
official website it says that require
G's is a JavaScript file and module
loader it is optimized for in browser
use but it can be used in another
JavaScript environments like rhino and
node using a modular script loader like
require would improve the speed and
quality of your code well that wouldn't
help a lot if you are very new to
JavaScript or you just know the basics
but what they're trying to say here is
that require J's kind of packages all of
your JavaScript in one javascript file
and basically makes it easier for you to
manage how the JavaScript files
unloading so for instance let's say you
are using some framework let's say
bootstrap and you are using a lot of
script files here like that one dot GS 2
GS 3 4 5 and so on and so forth so what
would happen eventually is that let's
say you want to make a change do any one
of these files and let's just say this
file has some variables which are used
by this file and then somehow you you
know just introduce another file and you
gotta mess up everything
so what happens is that this file is
loaded before this file but this file
has some variables for this file so what
happens is that actually there are some
uncaught errors because a function is
not defined which is called by another
file so you know that is kind of
creating a lot of mess out of it so for
that require just comes to rescue and
what it does is it would nicely
by you just a one single file right here
script SRC and we'll be looking at that
what it would be and using that you can
manage everything nicely and neatly
without creating any fuss
so requirejs not only does that but if
you use that on the server side which
we'll be looking at in later tutorials
you can actually compress your
JavaScript and CSS before sending it to
the user and that is using node.js and
we'll be looking at the add that later
on so yeah so that was all about
introduction to require Cheers
and I hope to see you soon there so
don't forget to subscribe and thanks for
