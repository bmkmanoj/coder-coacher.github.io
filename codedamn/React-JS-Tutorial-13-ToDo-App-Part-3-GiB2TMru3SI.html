Mei hole and welcome to your adenoids
13-3 actually a story like this and in
this tutorial what we're going to do is
obviously continuing with our app but
right now what we are seeing is that
there is a sort of an external sort of a
race in our program starts list and that
kind of doesn't look nice so let's just
move another race to our state of this
to-do app so we can say this that state
is equal to this or actually just
colleague races boss and we can say
tasks is this drops dot da we have in
here dustless like that and then finally
we can just pass this dot state dot
tasks right there right so now we have
our state saved in there we are passing
in our tasks and obviously you will need
to either pass and props into super or
just make use of props right there like
that okay so now what about the updation
part well the app list works just fine
we are just sending some tasks in there
and it will just update when we change
the state somewhere here so actually we
need to change this Rob start actually
this task right there whenever we add a
task from this thing so it's time to
create our own summit so I'm going to
create an on from it here and I'm going
to say that the this dot just submitted
and we going to say just committed this
method which kind of gives us an event
and the first thing we want to do is
prevent the page from reloading
there we go now we stay there now the
next thing is that we need to get what
the user typed actually so we can just
add it to the you know the list so we
can just get that text by even the
target now even the target is this form
so we're going to do a query selector
here so that we can just make use of
reach to this input and this is just
sort of things you just do normally in
JavaScript and then we can just say you
value right there or instead we can just
make use of this as an input and we can
just leave it right there and save our
value is input dot value and then we can
say input dot value is just like so that
we can just give us sort of a reset feel
that your task has been added right so
now we have this value and then how the
heck do we get this back to our main
right there so that we can update our
state well again we can just pass in a
prop right there we can say update list
as this dot update list link let's just
do that so we can say update list
and then what we can do right here is we
can say first of all let's just get our
tasks this dot state task list we can
say tasks dot the push and we'll
obviously get an argument here which is
our test text and finally we're going to
say this the state dot or actually set
state and we're gonna say star is tough
well let's just rename this to updated
tasks so that it doesn't cause any
confusion like that
and here we go so again if we are making
use of this right there so we need to
make sure that we are binding it so I'm
going to say this that update list is
equal to this update list our bind
because again just because we are making
it like this right there okay so now if
we see then it looks like it will just
work fine so let's just see what we get
in the browser we have map of undefined
for now and tasks let's just see what's
happening there so you know to do well
well obviously we are passing it as a
task and we are accessing it as a task
list obviously that doesn't make sense
so yeah okay all right so now you can
see that we get our ad running and if I
write something like ABC I hit enter
well nothing happens and actually
something happens we get our value right
there but we are not calling that the
dropps function so we might need to do
that just now this got props dot what we
have there update list update list and
then our value and okay okay okay we are
just accessing this again so we need to
make sure this dot just committed is
running in the same context right there
so if I write ABC hit enter push of
undefined
okay this is tasks right there ABC hit
enter you can see that we pretty much
get tasks added inside our list right
there if i zoom in a little like that
easy stuff so that's how pretty much you
create a very basic to-do app and we are
still missing the remove task and all
that stuff and again if you just reload
our tasks are gone so we're going to
just take a look at how to prevent that
and all that stuff in some coming
tutorials
so that's all for this one and if you

posting the source code of this app in
the description I'll be just giving some
links so you can just download that so
