angularjs tutorial and not really this
is not an angularjs tutorial but a just
journal tutorial to inform you about a
new web portal which I have developed
and pretty much what this web portal is
about is that you could actually take
your hands down and learn and interact
with other coders while you're learning
a new language or you know just brushing
up your skills in a language you already
know or have learned videos on code damn
or any other website so this is the web
portal which is dev code dan calm and
yes I'd still do have the code dan comm
site life and I'm gonna just link the
two and I got about a couple of days or
something and yes I do have the forum as
well live right now so you could use all
three websites if you like you could ask
questions on forum and then you could
practice on dev code dan calm and pretty
much looks like I'm signed in right now
so I'm gonna log out and show you how
this works so you could either a login
on signup so I'm gonna sign up for now
and it gives you three options rather
for to sign up with your email address
or Facebook Google and Twitter and let's
say I'm gonna go with Facebook because
I'm already logged in for it and it
automatically redirects me to the
dashboard so once you're in dashboard
what you'll see is pretty much the
available courses here which I have
added from the backend and remember I
just need to do these tasks manually so
it might take me a bit of time to add
new languages and new courses but for
now I have some tasks for HTML and
streamline CSS and some tasks for
angularjs as a demo for you guys I'm
gonna constantly push this list over and
over and add new languages for you guys
so that you will learn even more well
apart from this we have this chart
so you could just start chatting and if
you just show you that you need to log
in first into the skitter dot I am which
I'm using for the chat line so you can
just probably login and okay so once
you're in the dashboard you have to just
click on any language so let's just say
if I go with HTML and CSS so it shows me
this HTML CSS hello world and right on
the left hand side you'll see that
there's a bit of description about what
you have to do in this mission and
underneath it is the goals which is the
list of things you need to accomplish
and this task so it says me display
hello world in the emulator or this is
your emulator screen which is the wide
sort of a mini browser which would
display whatever you write in here
inside this white screen so what this
goal says for us now is display hello
world so I'm gonna write hello world and
now I can either just run this code or
hit ctrl enter just like it is mentioned
so I'm gonna hit ctrl enter and as you
can see that this turns green that means
this task is completed and when all
goals would be completed this pop-up
would be shown to the user in case you
and you can just proceed to the next
task or if you want to just play around
a little bit just close this and you
could just probably play around it so
once you're done with this you can just
go ahead again and click on the next
task so you could see the mission list
from here you can see right now I have
about one two three four five ten tasks
added in the list but you have a lot
only two so as you proceed further you
would a lot more and more tasks so that
is pretty much it for HTML CSS and you
could make use of these useful tools
which is like discussion join chatroom
you could actually join a chat from
right now so that right now there are no
people online so when there will be
liquid chat with other developers who
are live on the web site and making some
awesome code challenges and you could
even ask for help or do whatever you
want to and then we have this two pages
right here request a feature and okay so
looks like it's broken
oh yeah I remember that this link was
actually not request a feature request a
feature like that no okay so I'll just
take a look at this this should not be
broken and then we have this reporter
bug so this is a page for bug reports so
I have mentioned all the information you
could just go ahead and read them and
you could submit this to my email
address as well well that's pretty much
it for this thing and then we have I
guess I have coded this leader board as
well and yeah once you start coding with
your tasks this green bar would
progressively increase and would show
you how much you have done so right now
since I have 10 tasks and you have
completed one so you have completed 10%
of the course
if you're good at not otherwise you have
a zero for angular and then you could go
to this leaderboard right there and
right now since there's only one person
that is me on this website because this
is extremely new and launched just now
so it shows me only one user with a rank
of 1 and this point I decided on the
criteria how many tasks you have done
and then this percentile is just T you
know the first one gets hundred
percentile and then so on and so forth
so you could probably just log out it
log out of it as well and I guess there
are some problems with the scheduler
that I am with my internet connection
itself because it's unable to resolve
the DNS address of Gator and here we go
so you should not probably face that and
you could just log out of it so I really
would I really really would appreciate
your response on this and
I could really you know appreciate if
you provide any sort of effort or
feedback on how I can improve this and
you could even contribute I guess I on
this reporter buck page I guess I even
have this column reader I say heroes
without cabe where I would hardly
mention out your name and your Twitter
handle or your website URL if you just
you know show your support to website
and contribute to like wall bugs or
anything which is you consider that is
important for me to you know fix or
implement on the website so I guess
that's pretty much it for this video
tutorial and please give it a look and
let me know how this works out so I'm
gonna just keep improving this layout
and all that stuff you want and then
yeah so that's all for this tutorial and
