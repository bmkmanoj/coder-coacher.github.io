May ho and welcome gr4 tutorial I guess
for WebSockets and in this tutorial
let's just implement this dummy
WebSocket and see what's going on so I
go to my sublime text and this file
right here and I say inside script I say
that sock is my new WebSocket
this is WebSocket secure echo dot
WebSocket dot-org right and it's like
that so now we have these methods on
clothes soft dot on error on message and
so dot on open right so we have these
four methods and they return me not
right now because they are not defined
on the socket so we need to define them
so let's just do so just go to your text
editor and say on open is function event
right and what I want to do is I want to
say this console.log you write reload
and see OPM God so we have got an event
with some sort of stuff which might not
be a lot useful but this would be useful
once we are doing something like on
message right console.log event a lot
socket connected successfully right and
after that what I can do is I can say
set timeout function and then I can say
that
don't send and I can say hey they're
right so just send it after a second
and just move it right here so that it
just sends it after a second it's
connected right looks good
reload we got our sockets connected
successfully it okay message event right
and if I networks tab if I look you can
see that we get hey there as the sending
sort of stuff and hey there as a
response which is obviously because it's
not my socket I haven't programmed what
response it would send but the guy who
escorted this echoed or WebSocket has
created a response or whatever the user
sent would be sent back right so that's
pretty cool and yeah so if you look in
the console you can see that somewhere
right here we should have something like
I do even dot data and if I reload this
again you see that we get hey there but
where was it and property logging and
see that actually so yeah right there
there it is so this data field would
return you whatever the server has sent
you right so and it has some other sort
of stuff as well which you might not
need all the time so this is how you
actually perform a very simple socket
request and exchange some messages and
do some handful of stuff now
this isn't very exciting using somebody
else socket so what we're going to do to
make this thing interesting is that
we're going to write our server socket
code as well and the client socket as
well so that is all for this tutorial
and if you liked it then
don't we're going to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one
in which we might probably be
implementing a server socket so see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
