and welcome to 23rd node or Express I
should rather say yes tutorial what the
heck why the heck is this file always
quitted always created in this document
rude instead of this node I'm sick of
this well wait a minute if I just go
ahead and create a new file here J yes
hmm well this is kinda screwed up so if
any of you guys have any idea how the
heck do I resolve this then you know you
are welcome to send me that alright so
what we were talking about Pisa I guess
yeah so Pizza Hut oh no no yeah so we
were talking about routes and Express so
what routes are basically is that they
will allow you to act as a middleware
and basically will just allow you to
modify or get control over the sub parts
and subparts like this so if you have a
URL like localhost and we already know
how to control this by using app ket and
then what about this well you can just
simply control all of those further
things right there with drops so let's
quickly get started let's just write our
Express is require Express then I want
my application to be Express only but I
want my route to be route true to be
Express dot rotor all right now let's
quickly create a traditional application
function request response
then I want to say yes response dot and
hey there hey go and then finally just
listen to one 3-3-7 function I am
listening
don't worry about the spellings because
I'm not either
so let's go to terminal and start so now
write note Mon remember we install node
Mon and we no longer need to write node
only so normal on squared $23 yes and
here you go now go to your browser and
we already have this text right there
waiting for us so this works kind of
well now what I'm gonna do is that I'm
gonna make use of something known as app
dot use app dot use like if you take a
look in these tutorials 21 I made use of
app dot use
now what this app dot use does is is
that it basically this is that whenever
you are routing something like if you're
making use of get or get or post or
whatever then make use of this thing
right here which is inside this so what
happens is that whenever you are just
calling this thing then under the hood
this is also watching what this thing
right there and waiting for it to do
something so that it could fire
eventually so what this app dot use
would allow us is that we can just pass
in our custom route inside here to just
enable the path routing so let's just
say instead of get this I want to use
app dot use
my first route and what I want what I
want
which route er I want to handle this is
let us say router itself so this is the
router here and this is the router and
these both are same things so now what
happens is that whenever your node
application detects a request to this
URL since it has no function defined for
it right now it will just pass on all
the functionality to this middleware
which is this one right there
so this router would be now in control
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say
router don't get now router or get would
just work like the app get thing and I'm
just gonna say hey there first route and
function request response and I'm just
gonna say response dot and what is going
on and I'm gonna create another route
which is also the get but this time I'm
gonna say hey there first route again
and yeah so what is going on there this
is a bit different like that so what is
happening here well as you can see I'm
first of all making use of the see use
to just pass on all of my routing stuff
on this URL to this router all right now
the next thing I'm doing is I'm defining
some methods on this router itself which
would just act like as if you are doing
something like this so this router would
fire something like this when something
like this would happen so I'm just gonna
place the code back again and this
router would fire when something like
happens so let's just take a look at the
browser remember we don't need to do
anything in the terminal because it was
already listening to us at every change
so I'm just gonna reload this and since
we don't have any method defined for the
homepage so it just shows me cannot get
the homepage let's just go to my first
route and as you can see it still shows
me come and get my first route because
we don't have any router get just a
slash we have these two URLs so I'm just
gonna copy this and paste it right there
as you can see now we get what is going
on so we are in second directory and
router is working here again if I make
use of this as you can see it shows me
what is going on there this is different
well now if you use apt-get instead of
router don't get here then this would
work normally even if you have this code
so if you have this thing right here
since we don't have this any methods on
this router therefore it doesn't work
and these codes would work as if you are
just doing the same thing on the root
directory and yeah so that's pretty much
it how this router would work so yeah so
that's all for this tutorial in the next
tutorial we'll be doing something cool
with routers because routers are fun and
that's what Xpress makes you know that's
why Express makes a lot of sense because
Express makes it a cakewalk to do
routing on node so that's all for this
tutorial and if you liked it then don't
