we'll be finally creating and finalizing
our social tutor toolkit and we'll be
adding the dynamic title facility I told
you in my previous tutorial so in this
tutorial to grab the information about
tab we'll need to pass another parameter
do this my function that parameter could
be tapped so what this tab contains now
this tab contains all the information
about the current tab the user is on in
the background script so to grab the tab
titled we have to simply do tab or title
now this tab the title has got the name
of the star title okay so let's test
this out once we have extension our
staff title name right click share this
page and here you go extensions cuz it
if we right click share this page there
poster to it on Twitter post a tweet on
Twitter here you go
so we have this facility ready and let's
name it to something professional click
handler should be good just to create a
look of professionalism and the next
thing I want to tell you is that this
text these sticks down here are raw
information supplied by the third user
third-party user and so we could not
test trust these information and by
passing them in the URL some malicious
user or attacker could get to know that
yeah this user is using this to - social
toolkit and I can pass some malicious
code into the URL to grab access of his
account and all like that stuff so to
just sanitize this data what we'll do is
we'll just encode URI component of this
data I'll show you what does that mean
for example let's see right here what
does that it does so we open console
and code you are a component so for
example if a past plus in this the as
you can see this is converted into
percentage and to be because plus is a
special keyword in the URL scheme and
has to be encoded similarly we have
different encode you are I components
for space as well like you see then we
have for quotes and all that stuff so
but basically encode URL component would
not encode these sentences so this were
actually just sanitize our data so that
it's not this plugin is not misused to
just cover your inputs with this
function this is inbuilt inbuilt
function in JavaScript so no need to
code this the last one we have tab title
here you go now we have all the useful
information we want let's
we load this extension let's see
as you can see no such change in the
text the text is as usual the same but
now the function is much safer and
sanitized and yeah one more thing I want
to tell you is that now right now we are
doing chrome tabs dot create so whenever
we right-click select something or and
right-click and select our option then
it creates kind of a new tab and I don't
want the introduction to be lost and the
user to be redirected from the page so
what we can do is we can create a small
popup type box right here on the screen
itself and so dude to do that we have to
rename that chrome start tab to chrome
dot windows now what it does is a tab is
as you can see with the name is a
different tabs opened down here but
window is kind of a new window so I have
renamed this to Chrome dot Windows dot
create rest of the thing is same and
let's try to run this now it's real of
this extension let's click on this and
this looks much better than the previous
one but still I don't flow on this
toolbar I just want the context this
contact box so because we don't require
any toolbars or any other information
down here so what we can do is we can
the clear property down here with type
ass panel now panel would what would
panel do is panel would remove all those
unnecessary information like URL box
your extensions and your other unwanted
information so let's reload this let's
see and here we go a nice clean box with
no extra information but whenever the
user click on tweet the tweet gets
posted and then user can close the page
so I guess we are done with our Twitter
social toolkit because now whenever I
visit any other any of the page on
Internet then what I can do is if I want
to share any of the links or any of the
tags let's say hello world and Python so
let's say I want to share this link I'll
just go right click on this link share
this link you to a Twitter profile
there you go
here's your strength what you can do
else is I want to share this page right
click share this page on your Twitter
profile the pop-up box will pop up and
here you go in Google search one more
thing we can do is to share this page we
can add the URL of this page as well to
this and let's see how would you do that
next week yeah title and
what we'll do is we'll add another
parameter URL and % URL is equal to the
URL of the page so to do that we'll do
data dot page URL this would give us the
URL of the page remember we are not
doing tab dot you page URL you're doing
data dot page URL so let's see reload
right click sure link on the profile
and
BAM here you go
but hey where's my content now let's see
what happened to that text is this
hey where's the content now
and URL is this let's remove the panel
from this so we can actually see what's
in the URL let's reload this
that's you know what's happening
extension the extension
Oh Oh okay I've added this in the page
actually stupid me whoa the page one
oh we have to actually add that in the
page one but I was actually clicking the
link I'm so dumb never mind
now let's reload this extension and page
URL we have alright this alright alright
just go right click anywhere on the page
this page on your profile and here you
go the title first then the URL then so
this was about getting your extension
ready the first ever extension ready on
the chrome and remember that this icon
right down here and this icon down here
are different because this icon is
fetched from Twitter site while this
icon down here is your extension icon so
this was a C's a mini series on
developing your first Google Chrome
extension and as you can see we have
developed this extension maybe I will be
launching this on the chrome with my
google chrome developer account and stay
tuned and keep watching I'm sure you
will be a pro in Google Chrome extension
