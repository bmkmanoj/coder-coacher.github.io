30th jquery tutorial in which will be
discussing about Ajax mainly now let's
get started now the last tutorial within
a simple method God load with just some
limited options we could actually
perform but i'll be telling you a more
comprehensive at a kind of more
versatile and flexible method and jquery
to perform asynchronous requests around
your file system so move the code from
the previous tutorial and type a dollar
sign it dot and Ajax now this kind of
looks odd because from the starting what
we have been doing is mainly either like
dollar some selector dot method or
directly like anything we would
eventually do like calling a function
like invoking a function like document
dot ready but this time at what I'm
doing is dollar dot Ajax now this
technically means that we are working
with j queries inbuilt goal functions so
i told you in the way first lecture that
dollar is equal to jQuery jQuery so we
are technically working with like chico
ajax which now makes some sense so i'll
just use dollar dot jacks and this would
accept an object if you see that we are
just passing in curly braces so this is
accepting an object so what we need to
do is first of all specify URL
now this URL would be something like we
did in the load so this would be similar
to like load me d XD and the next thing
would be for us for this tutorial would
be either you can do success or I'll
tell you one more method and the
difference between do not done now you
see that the success was the part of the
object itself whereas they've done is a
separate function after this attack
object so let's see with the done and
I'll just pass an anonymous function
here and just say alert and I'll just
pass data as a parameter so a JAX this
Ajax whatever it receives from this URL
would throw that inside this parameter
and we are just alerting that so here's
my page let's reload this and you see
that we got an alert this is a
dynamically stored text okay so coming
back we have a couple of more methods
right here instead of done so I've got
one has failed now this would just as
its as this would fire whenever the
request fails or something happens
strange so if i change the file name
here and if I reload this so you see
that I got an alert as object object and
let's just console.log what that means
because hello it has not been very
helpful in this case so let's reload so
see in the console we got this object
ready state 0 status zero and stated
status text as error so what we can do
is now we know that data dot state does
text
yep so this contains our message so when
I will reload this so now you see that
we get a lot as error so this fail would
eventually fire whenever the request
fails and the done would fire whenever
the request completes and you get a
valid URL and response data so they've
got one more parameter here which is
optional obviously data is also optional
but I just use that which is the status
code now if I alert status code and both
of these so let's see what happens let's
reload and you see that in the status
code it is success and for the fail one
in the status code you see it's error so
for the fail one status code is
technically the same as data not the
status text just instead of you need to
know about what is the property
associated with the error you can just
use the status code and alert that here
but yeah you cannot use like this thing
because the inbuilt JavaScript parser
doesn't know that you want the status
code because status code is only thrown
back on the second argument so you got
to have a first argument right here so
that's about a JAX a little bit of a
jacks and basically when you are doing
like a two-way communication because
this is a kind of one-way communication
you're just receiving data from this
file and you are doing nothing else but
in a two-way communication what you need
to do is eventually you need to pass the
data as well do that particular file so
let's say if this was not load me not
txt or something like we just do dot PHP
a file and I need to pass some user data
what i'll do is i'll just create another
property here data and this will accept
a object as well and right here I just
say username
and somehow selector dot get username so
you get the idea what I'm trying to tell
you guys is that you pass the data in
jquery with the data attribute here and
and then I'm checked as if data whatever
is passed so this would be our file and
it would be our data that would be a
really do way communication because then
the registered of PHP would give us some
specific code which will need to pass
using these functions so that's it for
this tutorial for Jax and I guess I
covered pretty much to get you guys
started and there's a lot more a lot lot
more things to edge axe so if you want
to learn all of them you're free to go
to the edge axe developer side which is
a JAX sorry it should be check right
calm and I don't remember the
documentation link exactly you can just
google that Ajax and you'll be presented
the first link for the documentation
itself so that's it for this and I'll
see them next time don't forget to
