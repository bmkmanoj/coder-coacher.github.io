jQuery tutorial in which will be
discussing about something called
chaining in jQuery now chaining is not
something very technical you need to
know about but it's just a good practice
which would save you some lines and
would speed up your coding a little bit
so chaining in jQuery what literally
means is combining a lot of you can see
methods together on a particular element
so let's say I have a div right here
with some styles like background Queen
with 200 by 200 simple enough so in the
script section let's say square the call
back to the document load and right here
I want the div right here to have CSS of
background red and that's it so when I
will load this on the browser then you
can see that the box is already red but
initially if you see the it was green
stupid enough but what I actually mean
by this is let's say I want this div to
slide up a little bit let's say 5,000 so
now when I reload this you see that it
slides up 5,000 and then hides I want
this to slide down 5,000 as well so
slide down 5,000 so let's reload this
and if you guys are confusing with this
5,000 this is the delay in the slide up
and slide down this has nothing to do
with the width and the height of div so
if I make this value small then the
transition will occur quicker so this is
the delay in the animation so now you
see the
we are operating on one Dave but I'm
using three different lines to do them
so to avoid this what we can do is I can
make this in a single line not by doing
this but pretty much doing chaining of
the chicory methods so right here you
see that first of all what would happen
is we have selected Dave and that CSS
background grid when this is applied
then this is called and when this is
called then this is called now this is
not necessary that these would run all
in the sequential order slide up and
slide down run in the sequence because
they are kind of synchronous functions
so this won't allow this to run unless
this is completed so this is kind of
called chaining in jQuery which in which
you could actually do multiple
properties methods assignment when you
are working with a single element you
know that won't change so if I reload
this again then you see that this
typically no change whatsoever it's
still working like it used to work in
the tool the three lines we were doing
before so that's it for this tutorial
and I'll see you there next time don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
