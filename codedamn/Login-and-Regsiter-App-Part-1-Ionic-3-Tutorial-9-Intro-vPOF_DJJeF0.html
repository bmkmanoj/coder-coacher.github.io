Mei who welcome to your ninth ionic
tutorial in which you're going to start
off with a very basic application in
ionic which would be a login application
and we're going to take a look at Dunn's
of things how to add icons and input
fields and making users storage and
ionic
later on as we proceed in the series so
let's get started now again I'm not
going to make use of the same project we
have right now
not a blank project but you can start a
new project if you want to so first of
all let's just get rid of this first
page right here we can just delete that
and right here inside our home what we
can say is right here inside our HTML we
can say something like login application
or just log in right at the weekend
right here create our login fields and
now to create a login fields I'm going
to go to the components section we have
inside ionic right here take a look
inside this inputs one you can see that
the documentation provides you a lot of
information about different kinds of
inputs unless you interact as well so
that you do not have to implement it
every time you are working in your app
so that's quite convenient so you can
see that fixed inline labels are
something like this something like
placeholders we make use of in HTML but
the floating labels kind of is the thing
not really the inline levels yeah
so these labels what they are is pretty
much they follow the material design so
that they just move up whenever you
click this and it's kind of nice so
let's just implement this thing only so
we're going to say something like this
and copy this right here and right here
we're going to instead of this paste
this time so again the code is actually
quite self-explanatory you can see that
we are creating an item ID um actually
and with an ion label with the input
text type text and kind of looks like
the HTML markup only but it is kind
optimized for every device you are
running on so it would make sure to make
it look and feel a bit native as much as
it can't so again this padding just
provides a little bearing to the
container and then we are making use of
the block button at sign-in so if we
save this and we can for now just get
rid of this thing and now what the heck
did I do
just right there we can get rid of this
and this one as well and make sure to
get rid of your page inside the
component the module file as well so
that we don't mess around with the
angular and there we go get save save
and that should be it
so if we take a look now we are actually
putting it in the home right now no not
really
I on list I guess we copied it now save
this thing okay don't say don't save and
where we are I on list
and obviously we're gonna need an ion
list in the first place let's see and it
should reload and give it us this nice
little interface which is which looks
kind of ugly right now because we are
not making use of the floating label
right here floating and floating so
right there and again our button is the
ion button make sure to add that and we
should be good to go so now you can see
that we can do something like this write
our name password and hit sign in so
right now it have does nothing so we can
say sign and as the action name and
right here inside home page I'm going to
create another sign in so we can
actually get reference of these two
values so we can say password and
username like that
and save this and right here we can say
view child user name as the user name
and view child password at the password
you can set it to HTML element as well
and we're just going to encode that so
right here we can just say console.log
you name dot well our password dot Wow
obviously make sure to make you look
this and right here if we open our
console and let it build
we should be able to enter our name and
password and hit login sign in and we
get undefined because this is actually
value not well
so yeah the well word actually kind of
works with jQuery so anyways we're going
to try it again one more time password
and hit silent you can see that we got
our mail and password right here at the
bottom so now we can do something like
if this dot you name dot value is equal
to admin and and this is just a stupid
authentication obviously you do not want
to do that in your live application
we're going to do something like showing
a page or something like that again we
can create an alert right here if you
want to if the user is successfully
logged in so we can again go back to the
documentation and right here at the top
we can go to alerts right here inside
basic alerts you can actually just feed
live in the action as well if you select
this show basically it would just give
you a nice little alert so we can see
that we just need to create this LED
alert and it will just automatically
take care of that so we can again paste
it right here just indent it a little
and we can say and again we are not
inheriting this right now so we can
import this alert controller the load
controller from or actually we do have
that thing ready with us a load
controller right there so we can
actually just get rid of this real quick
and we can then inject it as a
dependency inside public load control as
a lot controller and we should be able
to access that you can see login
successful
are we going to set a message that you
are logged in just that's it for now so
if you take a look again should save and
let it build so now if you write like
admin admin hit sign in you can see that
we get a alert login successful you are
logged in so that is how pretty much
would make a very basic application and
again this is not complete right now we
have just set up the boilerplate for the
application obviously this logic would
fail a lot of times so we're going to
create in the next video we're going to
create a section where we can actually
create an account and then we can login
in using those usernames and passwords
only which are valid credentials so
instead of hard-coding them we would
kind of make use of the storage which
ionic provides us so yes that's all for
this one and if you liked it again and
please don't forget subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one and again I have my patreon
link in the description so if you want
to check that out please do sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
