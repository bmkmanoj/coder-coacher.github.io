and welcome to your tenth tecma script
tutorial in which i'm going to show you
how you can add a default value to an
argument in a function so so far in
equus crypt five order when alergias
which we use currently in the browsers
you cannot have something like this
which i always wanted so if you have a
function like malfunction and it accepts
a bunch of argument arg1 arg2 like that
then you have to explicitly check for
each and every argument if it is defined
or not like if arg1 is equal to
undefined then you have to upgrade with
something like that assign it a value
and do all that stuff so if I just
console.log the arguments object which
contains all the information about the
past in arguments and if i do like if
arg1 is undefined the e fi nd then argue
one is hundred and r2 or let's just
change this to our to actually so if I
just call this my function with only one
argument then let's just see what
happens so if I just change this to 50
let's reload and as you can see in the
arguments object we get only one of only
one value and that is the 51 and this 50
comes in from here so this argument
isn't changing when we are supplying a
value a default value here so what I
want to do is that with my script 6 what
you can do is you can just simply assign
a direct default value to your argument
here so that is way simpler and way cool
then doing all that stuff to get a
default value so this is implemented
already in many languages but I
seriously needed that in JavaScript as
well so thank you at my for bringing
this
and let's just check this out again so
though this object still contains just
the 50 but if I do something like
console.log r1 plus r2 and right reload
this you see I get 150 so instead of
just adding those three lines out there
now we can just do the same thing in not
even a single line in just four
characters depending upon what your
default value is so yeah that's how
really much you set the default value
for your arguments in equal script six
and egg my script six makes it a lot
easier to do that and yeah so that's why
I'm loving it so that's it for this one
and don't forget to subscribe if you
liked it and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
