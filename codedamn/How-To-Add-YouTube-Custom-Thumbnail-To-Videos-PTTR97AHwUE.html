this video tutorial in which i'll be
showing you how to add a custom
thumbnail to every of your video and
thumbnail would be a small word to say
it should be kinda like how to add a
custom image do every of your video the
best examples you can see right now is
in front of you like all these images
are custom images custom thumbnails
which have been added by the uploaders
so and i do have some of them as well so
let's check them out you see that all
these images the part of angular series
actually are nowhere in the video itself
but i have added all these custom images
with the help of youtube so let's have a
look how to do that so to do that first
of all go to
your settings right here youtube /
account then what you need to do is view
additional features
now right here in the Edition features
see the section monetization now it's
probably disabled for you right now if
you do not see any custom image section
so this is disabled for you and there
should be a kind of link here to enable
monetization or start monetizing your
video or whatever it is so when you
click on that then you get an option to
monetize your videos with an adsense
account so you can have a non hosted
adsense account or connect your previous
adsense account with your youtube
account and once you are done your
monetization page would look something
like this your account is enabled and
all this stuff so now once you enable
monetization your videos can actually
have a custom thumbnail and now to do
that you have to just upload a video any
video would go
and i'll just select anything right now
let's say this one for instance and now
once this starts uploading I get a
button here saying custom thumbnail and
this button allows me to select any
thumbnail for this particular video file
which would be presented here and the
recommended size for this custom
thumbnail is 1280 by 720 because that's
the maximum size of image you do would
ever show to its users so that's one for
this video and I hope you enjoyed it so
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
