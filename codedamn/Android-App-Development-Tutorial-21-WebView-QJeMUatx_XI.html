your 21st android application
development tutorial Madame is me hook
and in this tutorial I'm gonna bore you
with with with with with what was I got
to I'm gonna teach you about webview
right so webview is just kind of a way
to access internet from your application
and actually let me just show you real
quick what this does so what you just
like we create any other view you would
just gonna create this like layout width
of mass where and height is much better
than an ID of my browser and then pretty
much you would just inmate activity
lunch hour you would say right web view
is my browsers actually not new it's
actually where do you find you by ID r
dot ID like that and you will just
probably say set not really load URL and
like oh damn car like that right so I
haven't actually personally used webview
ever with my applications but you might
actually just want to make use of it if
if you have builded a really really
sweet web mobile website and you just
want to not mess with Java anymore and
pretty much you just want your websites
javascript etc to take care of the
mobile view as well but right now it's
not working because my internet is not
working right so instead what i can do
is i can just pass in a data text HTML
and I could say that I am or actually
say hello from the web right so for all
those who don't understand what the heck
is this well the
what kinda allow you to you know have
some custom HTML without actually
creating a file and then opening it in
the browser so like this would be a kind
of file scope only but it could be used
for you to create you know just test
your code if you have a small one on
runtime and browsers so you know this is
actually used with this data scheme is
used with the base64 encoded as well so
you have like image base64 and all that
stuff well that some stuff we'll discuss
maybe not later on so you can see right
now my browser says hello from the web
and that's pretty cool actually and what
you can do instead is that you just
create an edit text and I guess I
haven't told you about the listeners for
edit text which would fire when text is
updated are for now what you can just do
is you can create an edit text then a
button right here and you when the
button is pressed you just get the text
from edit text and then load it as a URL
inside this my browser's so that's kind
of assignment for you and just paste
your codes and the commands and if you
just face any problem they'll let me
know as well so that's it for this
tutorial and in the next tutorial I
don't know what I'm gonna do but it
would be super cool so that's all for
this tutorial and if you liked it then
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
