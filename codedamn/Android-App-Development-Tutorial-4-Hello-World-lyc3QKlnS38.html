are welcome to your fourth Android
application development tutorial and in
this tutorial we run our application
before even coding so as you can see on
the right hand side of our studio inside
design as well you can see that our
hello world is already there so you
don't have to pretty much do anything in
Android to write your first hello world
program just have to create a blank
activity and that's very much it so if
you don't see this thing or you know
it's something like this then what you
have to do is just click on this preview
right here which is written in vertical
just click on this and it would be like
that and my team is device default for
now so it would just fall back to
whatever device you're running and
that's pretty cool and what you have to
do in order to test your application is
that you know this is sort of just a
container when you just could you know
complex applications like you have
functionality like click and something
then this probably just show you just
show you a raw image of how your
application looks but not the
functionality so that is why we needed
an emulator and pretty much where this
is where genymotion comes in play so if
you have installed a you know virtual
device with Android studio then you
would probably see it right here inside
this Android virtual device manager we
just go ahead and create virtual device
itself but if you have gone with
genymotion that's then it's pretty good
otherwise it's fine as well because
Android studio has so well equipped AVD
manager as well which is Android virtual
device manager so for gain emotion users
what you have to do is just go to start
and right genymotion
launch it and we will just launch in a
second
just click on your device click on start
so that's that's pretty much what you
have to do on any motion and the rest of
the stuff has to be done with an
studio and Android studio will
automatically detect that you are
running an Android device genymotion so
what you have to do in Android studio is
that you have to hit this play button
will just say sit one up or it says
press shift + f10 to run up so you could
do just shift or f10 or just click on
this button so when I click on this
button you can see that it shows me
connected devices under connecting
devices it shows me unknown my phone so
this unknown my phone is because it's
not linked with Android virtual device
manager the AVD one
it's the genymotion one but it still
shows ad it would still work so just
select your genymotion device and hit ok
now wait for your application to build
greater would just compile your java
code just create an APK out of it then
you could just probably see all of the
status messages here only it's right now
just building your application into an
APK then it would install it on this
phone because this is actually a
simulated phone on your pc so you can
see that says installing APK so you're a
big ear will launch anytime now and help
it go so as you can see we had chosen
the device default so for this device
the default one is the blue for this one
right there and then the text is great
and this is white the background one and
pretty much this is our very first
application which says as hello world
and that is how you pretty much create
an application with android studio
without even starting coding so if you
just go to menu you could see that your
first application is installed just like
any other application and when you click
on this you know this screen launches
which is an activity well we'll just
discuss about activities later on but
that's a start so congratulations on
coding your first application and yeah
that's all for this tutorial and if you
like that then don't forget to subscribe
