ninth jquery tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be continuing with our
event methods in jquery which we left in
the seventh one so let's continue with
this part in the scripted cheers let's
remove this and document dot ready
function and now the document is ready
to be manipulated with jquery and let's
go ahead and use the selector my input
box dot change now i told you about gear
up and key down function but this change
method could be used to detect change
with not only one state or one kind of
element but very a vast range of
elements you could use for example if
the state of any element changes from
one state to another then this even foot
fire so let's say on change of my input
box i want to alert
you just changed so let's reload this
let's change the text down here and it
says you just change and if you notice
then this even fires whenever I focus
out of this input box and this is
because this event basically waits for
my input box to return the final output
and let's say I've got this and let's
say I doom a hole and I do you just
change and I put a space and died mohan
and I remove this and click outside the
box and as you can see that even does
not fire now this is because it does not
detect any change from its initial state
which was mailed to its final state
which was Mohan typed and removed so
basically change lopes this and doing
this thing as same so this is how change
event works in jquery the next thing i
want to explain is you too after one so
after after is a method which accepts
any HTML or string let's say be hello
world I have I'm just born so let's say
I want to insert this HTML after this
input box so i'll do a widened name this
might be so i'll just do this like this
so let's reload this and i get
p inserted just after this input box
because i'm using my input box after my
pee then we have before one as well that
would insert this before this box so
let's see and as you can see it's
inserted before input box then we have
insert after insert after difference
between insert doctor after and after is
that insert after would accept the
second parameter or second parenthesis
parenthesis as the selector one and the
first parentheses as the content you
want to place so it says this insert
after this so what does mean is insert
this text or a bunch of HTML strings
after this input box so let's refresh
this now we get the same result we got
with the after but by switching the
positions of selector and the string
similarly we have answered before to
work with let's reload we get the same
results the next thing we have is I
guess let me remember yeah so let's
learn about next thing which would be
selecting another element and why the
heck do I have
oh I'm working with a dot HTML so that's
why I'm thinking that I don't have these
elements down here why do I have these
elements and this and what we're sharing
the same script file that's why they
were executing similarly so nevermind we
have this new file down here and let's
create a spam tag now let's say I want
to insert something in the span tag but
would not like to directly select the
selector of this and do something like
this because that would be too
mainstream so what we can do is let's
select this input box and we would click
Next or basically type next and we would
do dot HTML and what took place in HTML
you are
you are just modified
very so this would basically go to this
input box next would select select it's
very next sibling and the next event
methods would work as if we have
selected this element next to this let's
reload this we get your just modified
baby inside the span tag so we are doing
next to select the very next element to
this box input box just like next we
have previous now previous is PR EV
let's do with span now
are instead of HTML i loo well now while
would basically insert this string
inside this input box
let's reload this we get your just
modified baby with chicory pretty good
so now we have the next thing
okay so let's say we have the span tag a
lot of spandex on here let's create a
list you will
ally item let's copy this by typing you
can copy so let's say I want to style
these UL tags so I'll select the ally
tag and would want to a place on CSS and
i would type CSS and would open a curly
braces down here and close a curly
braces down here with a bracket
obviously and down here would go map
property with value just like normal CSS
but both binded inside your quotation
marks so i'll say let's say i'll give
background black just like you do with
your CSS do here color white no syntax
change in the commands same just like
you type in your CSS so let's reload
this and I get this input Friday sorry
the list items as less style
CSS applied to every single Li Adam so
what if i want to just select the first
li item so to do that we have a method
or even handler call eq now eq what it
does is it would select the elements on
the base dr. indexing so li e q0 stands
for selecting the very first airline if
you one would be one two three four I
like that so let's give it zero Alice
reload and as you can see now this style
is only applied to the first la instead
of all the LS so let's give it one two
and you can try on and it would work as
I said to you
okay so let's discuss something more
let's give eq 0 and let's use another
method called siblings so now we have
siblings down here now what siblings
would do is it would select the siblings
of this Li which are the Allies
themselves and now let's control of
these
let's see what happens
the console if I you check then you get
0 1 2 3 LS these are for eli's we are
started from this this is the selector
and we have 0 1 2 3 so siblings
basically returns you all the siblings
of a particular element and my siblings
I mean the very interesting adjacent
elements to your selector for example
the siblings of UL there are no siblings
to UL the siblings of body would be head
and there are no siblings for the HTML
so if you look in a treat I play out
then this would be like this head and
body are siblings then you l is the
child of body then L eyes all these
allies are the child of UL then all
these allies are siblings among
themselves and then ul and HTML both
don't have any siblings so this was
another tutorial on even methods in
jquery and there are many more so we'll
be discussing more in the upcoming
tutorials and as we move forward we
would learn how to use them the
production sites and how can we do eat
these methods to their maximum
efficiency so till then stay tuned and
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
to receive latest videos on this topic
so I'll see you then in the next
tutorial thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
