your 32nd Android development tutorial
my name is Meho and in this tutorial I'm
gonna show you what
Wally's are so yes I know we have been
continuing with our AB development but
for the newsfeed I would need to make
use of something known as Wally's to
transfer data from server to our Android
application for instance right now we
will just host our files on localhost
but typically you would like to host
your news API on a real website right so
for that you need to have some
networking sort of API sort of library
associated with it so that you can
easily parse objects which ever you
receive them whenever you receive them
or you know if you are really interested
and even customizing how the news when
the news is loaded and you know all that
ops optimization stuff so you can do
that pretty much all of that stuff with
this wali networking library and it's
super easy and super cool to use and
will be up in just a few moments so what
I'm gonna do right now is I'm just gonna
pretty much show you how this library is
working for is simple just a simple
thing right so I'm gonna show you that I
just get this down a little bit okay so
ListView let's say this is just 400 dps
I just need some space for a button
right so there's a button and I'm just
gonna say that this is lower the page
right so in the text I copied this ID
and go to my main activity dot Java
right and I just say for now that button
my button
or let's just make use of the same is
button find you by ID odd ID'd button
and just import that and say button dot
said on click listener new on click
listener and then what I want to do is I
want to make use of ivali
write a Wally would allow me to perform
a simple get request or a simple post
request or you know a JSON request as
well if I want to but for now I'm just
gonna perform a very simple get request
to get the source code of a website and
before actually setting up that you need
to include a dependency because Wally's
not included as a package right now so
just go to your build.gradle file and
while this well I guess I could just
change this to 24 now because I have
installed 24 SDK so I'm gonna add depend
on no commas there compile calm dot
Android dot Wally I guess it was Wally
and it was 120 Wally
okay so just synchronizer project and
okay so looks cool now let's just hop
over to our main activity and what I'm
gonna say actually is that I'm gonna
create a request queue now what this
request queue would do is as it would
act like a kind of a queue in which your
Wally would be placed whenever system
resources are free or you know your
request is feasible to do so just go
ahead and write request queue and it
will just automatically take care of all
the imports Q equals Wally dot
new request queue right there and you
have to pass in this but since we are in
a click event so we need to pass and
main activity about this because the
click events this right now and does not
refer to our activity this right so the
next thing is that you need to have a
request so you need to say this is a
string request and then I'm gonna say
this is my request equals new string
request and the string request is pretty
much what would be the expected data
type of the return of the request right
so I want to say that this has a request
dot method dot get right so we have a
request method of get that means we are
performing a get request you could have
a post request as well then I want to
pass in the URL so let's just say this
is google.com only for now let's just
split that on few lines so that it's
easier to see and the next thing I want
is a new quick response let's see if we
can get it yep looks like that only but
a bunch of errors popping over so let's
see what they are okay so let me just
write the code first so this is an
override function and what I want to do
is I want to this pretty much display it
in the log log god I might tag and then
I'm gonna say that this is just
responses response right so it would
just log in to respond so what the heck
single question cannot be applied to URL
oh okay so yeah we need a error listener
as well so new response dot error
listener right and then what it's gonna
do is it's another anonymous class so I
guess it should have automatically
completed that but let's see if I can
find generate override and says on error
response right there so you can see now
I would just say the same thing here as
well so error would be the error thrown
by here and the final thing you need to
do is you need to add this to your queue
right so you have right now just the
string request in my request so you
would like to say that Q dot dot add
just say my request okay so that's how
you pretty much build a basic very basic
Walli request and yeah so let's see if
it works
looks like okay so I don't have a JDK
here right 1.8 right now so let's just
fall back to 23 and yes yes yes I got I
guess I remember to add forgot to add
actually permissions as well you need
permissions to internet obviously so
intranet right so you need to make sure
you add this into your Android manifest
otherwise your program would not work
because you need to specify what sort of
permissions your Android require and
this is the same permission which is
displayed when you're installing your
application from play store like this
Apple access to your phone contacts and
full activity access and all that stuff
so you add all that stuff here so you
can adjust bypass that otherwise and
what would not even grant you access to
Internet at all so yeah so yes what I
want to do is change this to 23 only so
maybe we'll change this to 24 when my
Java JDK is updated to 1.8 so for now
let's just keep it to twenty three point
zero three let's see if you're good to
go
or actually I haven't synchronized it or
I wouldn't do it for me yes I guess it
has done so let's see how this looks
like on console as well because the
actual stuff is done by the logger
logger will okay so let it build
here we are so let's just go to edit
filter and right here in your tag what
we have oh we have at the tag is my tag
so in edit filter just go to my tag
because right now the logcat logs almost
everything what's happening on your
phone or your emulator oh so now it's
just logging my tie right yep
so now okay so it looks a bit messy
anyways just click on load a page and
see what we have got so you can see that
in the response I've got the HTML source
code of Google and it kind of looks
messy but it's okay for now so you see
that this thing works at least and then
using this thing I'll leave instead of
the string request we'll make use of
JSON object requests and then we can
pretty much make our code work with our
newsreader API which we are getting from
a PHP file which I showed you earlier so
yeah so we'll be implementing that real
soon and that's all for this tutorial
and if you liked it then don't forget to

I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
