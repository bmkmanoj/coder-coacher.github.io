your 14th Android application
development tutorial my name is Mei hole
and in this tutorial they're gonna
continue a little bit more with relative
layouts later on you're gonna take a
look at evens if time allows us to do so
so let's get started now first of all I
would like to fix this application or a
little bit which I told you in the last
tutorial and that is these fields are
kind of misaligned so that doesn't look
actually nice so you could easily fix
that by just setting a width of like 20
DPS and it's waiting less I guess 100
let's just change this to 140 so I would
just set the same width on both the text
views so now can it makes sense to me
see that these two are of equal width
and just we need a little bit of padding
as well so you could just change this
margin to 15 DPS
and then you can add a padding as well
so you could say Android padding left is
let's just say this is 10 DPS for now
and could even change that to 15 if you
want to and just copy it right here and
pretty much your application is done so
things are now aligned and it looks okay
for now so that is pretty much for this
layout and what I want to discuss in
this tutorial is how relatively out
would actually work so let me just get
rid of all of this and get a fresh start
now I want to discuss about the possible
directions so if I open paint okay take
it easy okay here we go so what happens
is that if this is your screen right
there
then you could have directions like the
you could just place your element in
relatively out on the edge
top edge of your relatively out you
could say that you want your element to
be on the right edge of deal it
relatively out to the left edge of the
relative layout and mind you that I am
talking about the layout itself not a
particular element or you could say that
the element is at the bottom edge of the
relative layout now let's just say you
have another element on the screen right
and let's just say this is your element
okay wait a minute
okay so it looks like there's something
well anyways so let's just say this is
another element on the screen and now
apart from all those four direction
which you earlier had what do you have
access to is that you could have four
directions more with this element right
here so you could say that you would
place your next element on the right of
this or on the left of this or on the
bottom of this or on the top of this so
kinda as many elements you are you can
see that with no element you had four
options to place the next element with
one element on the screen you have four
plus four options that is you could
either align it with layout or with this
and you could actually align it with
both you would just see that in a minute
you could actually make use of these
properties and then the other ones as
well so you have kind of access to a
properties at a time then with three
elements it would be four four and four
that would make it at twelve so that
kind of goes on so let's just take a
look at how we can make that work so
make sure you're walking on relatively
out and save button align wait a minute
this should be wrap on tenth and why is
it red
okay wrap content I don't know
well anyways this is my button and what
I can say that this is Android layout
now when you type layout you would get a
bunch of properties right there you
could see and select any one of these so
I'm gonna say that this is central
horizontal and I'm gonna set this to
true now what that means is that it
would be horizontally centered in my
layout right here within my relative
layout so I could even say like Android
layout align parent align parent top
equals true and that wouldn't kind of
make a lot of difference because it's
already on the top so I could just say
that it is it has some text so that it's
kind of nice to look at so I'm gonna say
that I am and but if you change that a
line parent top to align parent bottom
here we go and we will see that the
button immediately moves on to the
bottom of the screen but it's still in
the center because of this one
so you could exploit this feature of
relative layout to create custom layouts
and you could just create another button
which would create itself from fresh
start so if I just remove these two I am
cooler than previous so now you can see
that the next element starts from the
top left corner of the screen but you
could even assign the cell ID and I told
you and ID what it would do is that it
would particularly mark that element so
that you could actually work with that
later on or you could just place
elements around this so I'm gonna say
this is B 1 and for this hunk I can say
that Android
lay out to write off end off left off
start off and pretty much you have these
things so if I say like to write off and
I specify an ID of b1 and what happens
is that it plays this element right here
to the right of this element now think
in two dimension it's not kind of like
this button would move here and then
this would be on the right because if
they are linear then you are not working
on a two-dimensional screen you are
actually working on a two-dimensional
screen so for now the right only means
the right not in line with that
particular element well if you want that
to be in line with the particular
element you would say that Android
layout line parent to align parent
bottle to true you would get the
expected result then again you could
create another element which would be
like you could actually give this an ID
of b2 and then what I can say that this
is a line to be too I am much more than
everything and I can say that this is
layout to left off b2 and I'm just going
to remove it for a while so now you can
see that it doesn't care about this
button right here right so you see that
it only cares about this thing right
here it knows that it has to be on the
left of this thing but not this one now
again you could make use of something
like an where lay out a line parent
right or parent actually bottom to true
and then you would just see that it
overlaps on that particular button so
you would like to avoid these sort of
situations so you have to manually
decide how to make that but it could a
layout
with that particular setting you are
having and you could even make use of
like layout central vertical instead of
just throwing it on the bottom you see
that now it is in the middle I would say
- I am cool button to be Center or
basically say this to be a line parent
top to be true oh wait a minute
Alliant parent top and you could see
that very much I'm spanning three
different buttons on the skin screen and
this is on the right of this but this is
on the left of this button so if I
change this from me to do me one you
would see that the button kind of
shrinks because it needs to be on the
left of this button so that sounds
pretty much you could play around with
relative layout and it kind of gives you
control over your code but it's not that
effective if you want like a particular
grid type layout which kinda allows you
to make use of grids and if you have
ever used like bootstrap for HTML for
front-end you would notice that
bootstraps comes with grids type of
system and that is what particularly
makes it popular and pretty much I guess
that's it for this tutorial and if you
like that then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching and I'll see
you that in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
