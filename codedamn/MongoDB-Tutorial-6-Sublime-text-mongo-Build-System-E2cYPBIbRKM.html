Miho and welcome to your sixth MongoDB
tutorial in which I'm gonna show you how
to set up sublime text with your MongoDB
and not kind of loading it like loads
file and load and like that because it
kind of doesn't you know give a feeling
off like you're doing something good
because moreover as your code gets more
and more complicated with objects and
documents written on so you would need a
text editor obviously because command
line is not a very good place to edit
things it's just like you're writing one
liner or editing one lines one line
actually so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna straight forward add a build
system to sublime text which would allow
me to pretty much transfer or basically
pipe the code which I'm gonna write this
in my script to Mongo behind the scenes
so what I'm gonna do is go to tools
right there and say build system and
create a new build system right right
here you would see all of this stuff
actually a single line only so what you
need to do is change this or actually
just get rid of this and say this is
select row to be sourced ojs right shell
to be true right and make sure you don't
forget a comma right there and see the
command which should be there is now you
can actually specify your whole path to
Mongo but since we have already had that
in our path the environment variables so
we can just write Mongo and we'll be
good to go then you need to pipe it to
and what to pipe is a file which you are
currently working alright so that is how
pretty much you create a basic build
system as well so that's a bonus
tutorial for you so I'm just gonna say
this is ask Mongo and save it now go to
your script go to tools build systems
and change the build system from
automatic tomorrow right now what I'm
gonna do is let's say
says like our spring is hello from
sublime I'm gonna say print shrink and
hit ctrl B to build it you can see that
we have been shown the manga shell
pretty much similar to this thing right
there but inside sublime because this is
a build system now so it kind of you
know exits as well from the build once
its done cooling so it's not kind of an
interactive shell you cannot execute
commands right here so that is how
pretty much you set up a build with
Mongo and you can just run it multiple
times or actually rather you could just
say this is math dot random so that you
kind of believe me a bit more you can
see that every time a random number is
generated so each time there is a new
request so you can pretty much do all
that stuff and now you have sublime text
a blip linked with your MongoDB so now
what you have to do is in your
JavaScript code just try to your Mongo
code and hit control B and you'll be
good to go so that was all for this
tutorial but you would kind of need the
Mongo shell still because of some
commands like you cannot just comment
out all of your code or create a new
file for testing out just a simple thing
like creating an object or displaying
something so you know that kinda Mongo
shell would be still useful but we will
be mostly working with sublime so that
was all for this tutorial and if you
like that then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
