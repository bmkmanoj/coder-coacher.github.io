ninth angularjs tutorial and welcome to
the controllers tutorial and controllers
as we have been discussing so far are
kind of interesting thing in angular and
controllers actually mix up your
application in angular Cheers
so what are controllers exactly the
controllers are not more than
traditional JavaScript objects created
with angularjs so from our JavaScript
tutorial we know that a simple object is
an object literal created with like my
object is this thing and if we do like
console.log type of my object then it
would obviously return object without
any doubt
but angularjs controllers actually
control the data of your application you
have written in JavaScript with
angularjs so you may wonder that
somewhere we need to attach this
controller to the HTML as well well yes
for that we have got an angularjs
directive called ng-controller now
ng-controller gives a unique name to a
part of your HTML way through which you
actually make use of the MVC model of
angularjs and let's take a quick look at
what controllers are and how they work
so to create a basic controller what we
will do is is okay so let's put the HTML
first and let's say I create a div with
ng controller as I told you we need to
assign this a controller to work with
JavaScript and a little bit of spacing
here let's say in the ng-controller I
give
um what'd you say
let's say languages so here what we
would write is let's say select your
favor way def ABO URI t even Wow
favorite language
LAN
what is happening today okay so select
your favorite languages or maybe just
one language and let's say button let's
say bhp then button
javascript button c++ button java and
the list continues so we have got a
bunch of languages here and down here
let's create you have selected let's see
my favorite language now many of you
would complain that i haven't used this
kind of variable with ng in it anywhere
in the code and that's the reason i was
telling you that we don't need ng in it
very much
while you're coding angular so let's
make this on the browser so it looks
like kinda doing nothing right now and
let's add some controllers to it okay so
controllers how we cool the controller
in angularjs is just like creating a
variable in javascript let's say app
lication
and
this should be equal to angular dot
module mo d ql e now angular is
something which comes this object comes
from this file here so don't ask any
question that I haven't declared
anything like angular and its property
module it all comes from this javascript
file loaded by our script tag here so
angular dot module what this module
actually means is it would take another
tutorial to explain what module is but
simply explaining that it cannot create
a module of your application which you
are working with and don't worry we will
be discussing about angular modules soon
but let's focus on controllers for now
and in module we have to give whatever
the name of our app is and currently set
to blank so let's give it a name let's
say my language app and the same name
should be here in the module and one
more thing you have to do are the second
argument you have to give a blank array
and this is because in here you would
load the dependencies of your module so
when we are coding like and the 30th or
40th toriel of angularjs then we will be
using all make use of this
dependencies and what it would do is
like let's say you have is separate
script tag which contains some of your
other modules which you have created in
angular and you want to basically get
all of the properties and whatever you
did in that module into this module so
we can basically do that by writing like
my module here the name of your module
but currently since we don't need any
module loaded with our angularjs
application we'll just set this added to
black now we have application as an
object and if you do a type of
application you'll get object has logged
in so no need to do that and now we'll
define a controller of this application
so let's stripe application dot
controller cont ro ll ER and controller
would accept the argument and the name
which we supplied here so languages is
our controller and languages it is so
similarly we would pass another you can
say if function or directly a a D now
I'll be using array and the reason is
that in the first value it would take
something called scope now let me write
the code first and then I'll explain you
what the scope is so
yeah looks good so this scope a dollar
sign and a scope is inbuilt
variable of angular and we have to use
that and the reason why I am using a
scope here and scope here as well and
not directly like this thing is that
whenever you are working on production
sites then you usually compress your
JavaScript code with software's
available on online and what the
subjects do is that they compress and
rename all the variables to some
different values so what happens is
angular is always looking for a argument
with a variable scope now let's say your
JavaScript compressor renames this
variable do something like this to
attackers so that attackers it is hard
to debug for the attackers so now your
angularjs itself doesn't know what the
heck this means but if you have supplied
a argument here with scope in quotes
obviously your compressor won't change
this value so angular would
automatically understand that your
reference scope here so as long as you
are not going to compress your code in
angular you could use this without any
square brackets or anything else so
there's an anonymous function scope and
this controller attaches all the code
here to everything inside this
controller
so now we have access to whatever we
were setting before with ng in it so
let's say I write scope dot my favorite
language equals you have selected for
default I would like to have none so now
here on this button I would like
something to happen whenever this button
or this button or this button is clicked
so so far we have what have you have
been doing is we have been attaching
JavaScript Handler on click JavaScript a
lot like that but with angular angular
has got its own even handlers and we
have got ng click now this ng click
would kind of run your JavaScript code
whenever this button is clicked and
since this is an angular directive it
would folk work a first work on MVC
model and would go into your controller
look for anything available and
similarly execute the code so let's say
I give it a function PHP which will be
declaring here and to this button let's
just break this down a code a little bit
so it's easier to read
all right so now in the JavaScript one
let's say I give ng-click
as JavaScript now notice that these are
functions because I am using parentheses
to call them ng-click
C++ and finally ng-click should be Java
all right so we have got we have defined
some of the functions here and
application controller is our the first
one setting the scope of my favorite
language to none and what does that mean
is I'll show you let's reload this page
and you're okay so let's take a look
here
in the console we have got
all right so there's a typo here a ngu
lar it should be let's reload this
okay so I guess I get them with my code
and let's reload this now and we have
got none here so we have got some
ng-click even handlers here but nothing
defined here so let's do something here
so let's say scope dot and starting with
bhp since it's a function
let's say whenever this is called then
scope dot my favorite language should be
modified to be HP and similarly let's
just copy and paste this over and over
for JavaScript C++ and Java
so for whoa wait a sec this should be
Java and there should be C++ so this is
C++ this is JavaScript and this is Java
so what we expect expect now is that
when I run it in the browser then by
default I have got you have selected
none but whenever I click on these you
see that the data is automatically
modified on the basis of my click and
let me explain this code again from the
starting we have created a controller
with div ng-controller languages written
some basic HTML
attached a even Tabler of ng-click which
is an angular click directive to every
button created a controller created a
module first application angular module
my languages app and set the
dependencies to empty application define
the controller languages same as here
and supplied it with a function scope to
get and access the view of the MVC model
then we are setting scope not my
favorite languages to none at this
starting then we are modifying this to
some other values whenever a particular
function of this ng-click directive here
is called and that's it that's pretty
much what our application is doing so
that was a very basic and simple example
of controllers in angularjs and I
welcome you all to angularjs from this
tutorial so that's it for this tutorial
in controllers and we'll be working with
controllers a lot harder and Broadway in
future tutorials so still then stay
tuned with me don't forget to subscribe
thank you for watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
