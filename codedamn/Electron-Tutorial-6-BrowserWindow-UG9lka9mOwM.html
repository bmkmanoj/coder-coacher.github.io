sixth electron tutorial in which I'm
going to show you what browser window
module is and how we are making use of
it to show this index dot HTML file and
some more options we can pass along with
this browser window to customize its
look and appearance so first of all
let's just jump to documentation and it
has a very rich documentation on github
and you can see with the content as well
so that kind of is a lot of information
so let's just start with the only
information the only stuff we require
right so you can see that it's processes
main that means that you cannot access
this browser window module inside your
render process right okay next thing is
that you can create something like
frameless windows it has some events
diagram color and all that stuff but
what we are interested mainly right now
is these options ok so right now we are
passing no option for no argument rather
instead browser window but we can do
that what we can do is we can say with
is let's just say 1005 is the 500 let's
see how that window looks like and the
once you have done that what we can do
is a electron dot and you can see that
we have a thousand by 500 width and mind
you this is the full width of the
application not the browser width and
you can just verify that by hitting this
control shift + I or you can rather just
go to this one as well but ctrl shift
and I control shift is a shortcut so you
can just do that right so you can say
window Todd wait I remember this was in
a width or something so you can see that
it's 984 it's not
exactly thousand so there's some sort of
margin or something so anyways so what
we can do is first of all let me just
get rid of this dirty ugly yellow
electron and say something like go damp
why not and then we can create a style
of CSS file we can apply some resetting
ourselves now we can then say
text-align:center and then finally we
can say for this for the sake of this
example display flag right
hundred V good and what is justified
content central a line item center there
we go and finally for the day we can say
color black font size three room one
family Calabria I guess I have on my
computer and we can say this is
hydrolysed black yeah that should get us
studded color right that's it so alright
so let's just see what's happening we do
not have any styles of dice for body oh
okay obviously got not including the
style Shadia style of CSS and you can
see that we get this code down in black
in the center of the screen and one
hundred hundred VH for the applications
obviously for this window only right so
now we can take a look at some more
options in here so if we take a look in
the documentation you can see that we
have something known as used content
size which is the width and the height
and if you set it to false then you can
actually customize the width and the
height of your document with CSS only
you can do that but I'm just going to
leave it as it is right now then we have
minimum width minimum height
a maximum with maximum higher which is
quite self-explanatory then we have
resizable right now you see our
application is resizable right and since
we're making use of CSS so it doesn't
matter what we do our godown will always
be in center right so you can just
disable this thing by passing and
resizable last false and again just
launching the app and I can see that I
do not get any option or any that cursor
hint that my window is resizable right
again then we have maximized or
minimized able windows which do not work
on Linux as positive so that we have a
closable focusable always on top then we
have all these options
fullscreen fullscreen above and then we
have this title option you can specify
title here or in your index dot HTML
file you can see that it's hello world
right now but if I relaunch it you see
we get hello world - which is the same
title in our index.html file right then
you can have icon as well which is going
to click this icon the small little icon
you see here as the default one and what
this show is is that sometimes you might
need to do some work in the background
so you do not want to actually launch
your window so kind of makes it headless
right so you are just doing work without
or running anything in the background
without user knowing again this frame is
kind of cool you can just specify it
false and what you would get is a
frameless window which would look cool
for applications like if you are
creating some sort of installer or
something and the colors are mixing I
guess I can actually come and drag it
right now but I guess I can do that by
moving it with that so
see that this application is window
frameless and kind of looks cool if you
are creating I don't know some so any
sort of application this one looks
better than windows framed but again you
have to create if you do something like
this you have to create your own stuff
or moving this window like creating a
little area here so that a user can drag
stuff which we can take a look later on
that's not the concern for now right
then we have this parent which you can
make use to specify a parent window and
if you do specify one what would happen
is that the child windows are always
above parent windows right so what we
can do is create another instance let's
say when two which is like 500 by 250
half the size and for this we can simply
say something like golden calm only
right and what we can do is specify its
parent as the wind right and if we run
this again you can see that we get
another window but the URL isn't
launched swear this without quotes right
and
okay I see that the URL isn't loading
right now and I actually figured out
this is because on my computer I have a
map go down and actually start up code
I'm not going to localhost only so I
have been developing go down the college
side locally on my computer so I just
mount this domain back to my computer
itself so my url won't work for now so
let's load example.com first say and
that's the salic phone dot and i can see
that we get example.com loaded now the
difference is that you can see that the
child always remains on the top instead
of going out of focus or going to bottom
right you can see that you can just
overwrite both the windows but the child
would always remain on the top but if
you just remove this line you can just
get another another window just like we
have hello world - we can just get this
one so again there are a lot of other
options right here PC
background-color:transparent then we
have web preferences which we are going
to look accordingly as we proceed with
this series right so if you are running
Chao if you do not want to run
JavaScript on an instance which you're
firing then you can just disable this
one and everything else right so we have
then these these events right so you can
write an event something like so we can
just write and even closed and or we can
do say when dot-to-dot point closed and
then we can define a function here and
say that console dot log
when two was closed and inside our
console if I close this you can see that
we get when two was closed so you can
attach all these evens accordingly on
focus blahh responsive and we're gonna
take a look at how to pretty much make
use of them later on as we proceed with
our apps so that's all for this one and
if you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
