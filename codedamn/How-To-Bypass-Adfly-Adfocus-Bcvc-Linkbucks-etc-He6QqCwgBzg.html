video tutorial in which i'll be showing
you how you can bypass ADF dot ly or any
other URL shortener legs with no time
wastage at all so the first thing you
need to do is is to visit this website
then lockerz.com hit enter type dead
lockers calm and you'll be presented
with a page something like this so
either you can do like let's say if you
have one link let's say this one or okay
so i'll just go with one and just click
on dead that button and you see that you
don't even have to wait even five
seconds before the link appears and you
can actually decode multiple links as
all together as well so just click on
this link place all of your links to see
i have placed five links but obviously
they are same but they won't be in your
case so this should technically take
around 1 2 3 4 5 25 seconds for a normal
user or maybe 30 because of the
connection
time for a normal user to decode all of
these links but let's see how fast this
extension can do one two three four five
six you see all of your links were
decoded in just six seconds and not only
this this site has got and chrome
extension as well so just click on this
link right here it will take you to this
chrome extension URL just download this
extension I already have so I have this
extension right here you see added to
chrome and just visit any of our URL you
want to bypass so I'll just lose it this
URL ADF total west / 5 X are and i'll
just make you see how that works so i
have installed this extension and you
see that it automatically pops up within
a 1.3 sick without waiting for five
seconds there so i'll just click on
unmask link and i'm on the google com
home page so that's it for this tutorial

revised envision would be go to the side
