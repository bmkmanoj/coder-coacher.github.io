this is me whole and welcome to your
first tutorials for this mini series for
angular 4 and PHP and the let's take a
look what we have done so far we have
created a script PHP file which looks
nice and fancy and we are making use of
upload here a service for hosting our
images which is quite awesome because
these guys are hosting our images and
providing us back the images as well
with a lot of api's without any
headaches so let's just see what we can
make use of right here so we have this
quality filter which kind of increases
the quality of the picture which is the
default quality so I'm just going to try
it out right now in one of my images
then we have some progressive loading
which might be handy if you are loading
kind of a big image or fullscreen
website or anything like that if you
have a splash page or something so that
might be handy to do and I personally
feel that progressive loading like this
progressive loading strictly speaking
because this is basically loading
progressive loading is kind of cool to
look at baseline loading looks like you
are working in 1980s but anyways it's up
to you then we have a lot a lot of other
things as well so let's take a look what
we can do and yeah so let's just hop
back first of all let's just get angular
ready
and by dad what I mean is this getting
the gallery ready so we haven't take a
look at what this gallery looks like so
let's just get rid of this and let's say
this is a I'm not really any ID we're
just gonna say ng if should I be visible
I don't know that's the best name for a
variable but it should get the point
done so we're going to say that
is your modified images or rather lists
a gallery why not and we can create some
images right here and we'll just come
back to that later on first of all let's
just know when we can actually show this
gallery so what I want to show this
gallery I want to make sure that I have
got this data back from the server so
what I want to do is somehow have method
in this gallery component which I would
want to call from here and that
component would trigger or actually
switch this variable to true and then
finally we would see this component so
how do we do that well that is pretty
straightforward if you think about it
what I can do is actually create a
reference of this gallery and we can
just get rid of this injury from here
and let's say I call this gal why not
and what we can say is we can pass this
reference right here just like that so
now we can do is actually make use of
this input decorator which would
actually allow us to reference to that
particular component so we just write
input and right here I can write gallery
as a type of gallery component now let
me just go ahead briefly and before
actually going a hairless import gallery
component I guess that should be what it
is called gallery component gap from
gallery gallery component
and that is it and we need the input as
well so input there we go okay so what
the heck is going on here well first of
all what I did is inside our app
component I created a reference a local
reference to this this component right
here and I passed it as a property name
inside the app file uploader component
as gallery
now inside file uploader component type
script file I'm accessing the same thing
as an input which would be of type
gallery components so that angular
inserts it correcting gallery reference
inside this gallery variable and that's
how pretty much you do this I guess I do
not have this input decorator covered
right now in angular tutorials but by
the time you're watching this I'm
probably sure there is a tutorial in a
playlist for them so yep okay I'll just
create that real soon so once we have
this gallery reference what I can do is
inside the SUBSCRIBE data I can save
this dot gallery now right here what I'm
going to do is call any of the methods
of this gallery component I script right
now you can see that the it shows me ng
on init method because we already have
already or rather how should I say that
we only have this method so I'm going to
get rid of this and say got some data
from the backend and I'm actually I know
I'm worst case one of the worst person
in naming variables and methods you
would ever encounter so yeah that's a
little bit verbose but let's just keep
it that way
so I'm going to say that what this does
is actually triggers this should I be
with able so I'm going to stay should I
be with both it's false but right here
I'm gonna
which the flag could screw just like
that
and we can just throw get rid of this
right okay so this pretty much switches
it back and what I can do actually stay
and just got some data what was the
method name yep on the back end right
there okay
so now if we take a look in the browser
I upload an image let's save this one
and we wait a little we see gallery is
life once we have got our image uploaded
and response from the server as well now
what happens is that this response this
data is actually a kind of response
returned so now what we can do is
actually convert this data what we are
getting into a JSON by simply doing JSON
response something like data or JSON on
it now this is an inbuilt method it's
not like you can do this in traditional
JavaScript
it just works right here inside this
response type of data so now if we
upload an image and take a look wait a
few seconds we get the unexpected token
s at the JSON and that should not really
be the case so let's take a look what we
are getting back and yes obviously
because this is not a valid JSON well
how can we do that well what I need to
do is simply just echo this out and not
just what dump it right so now if you
try to upload another image console and
there we go we get some got some data
from the back end and there we are with
this we have this file no not really
aren't we console logging that
well okay so we had just the JSON
response so what I can do is they taste
on this launch dot file because
essentially that is what we are getting
from the request you can see that we are
getting this object which contains only
one field that is the style I'm just
passing this five field into the gallery
component this method so I'm going to
say this there's a UUID of type string
you can just specify that and be nice we
can just go ahead and type boolean here
as well
it makes typescript happy so what we can
do is now we can say something like this
dot UUID is UUID
and i can just create another UUID here
as blank awesome now what we can do is
say ng a thirsty something and we can
make use of their API
something like this and I can say
something like this and I can just echo
out the UUID which we have right here
with a 320 or let's say 300 by 300 print
and I'm just gonna omit these parameters
for now okay looks fine for me what does
this want cannot find name file well
okay so they're gone automatically well
that's nice now let's just go back to
our file upload and let's just select
some handsome pick let's just see what
we got oh we have in there well okay so
if we take a look our script as written
as a UUID and inside right here you can
see that we are serving from upload cure
CDN with a size of 300 cross 300 and
yeah that's pretty much it how we can
get our gallery set up and running and
in the next tutorial I'm going to
show you how we can set this gallery a
little bit up so that we can display a
lot of images with different effects so
yeah that's all for this one and if you
liked it then please don't forget to
subscribe thank you for watching I'll
see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
