Mei hole and welcome to your fifth
tutorial for ionic framework and in this
tutorial we're going to take a look at
the basic file structure which ionic
provides us when we started with the
tabs as the boiler plate so if we take a
look right here you can see now we have
a hell of folders right here with hooks
noir modules resources SRC and ww
mostly we would be just working with the
source folder but we would need to work
with these resources Android and iOS as
well once we are you know kind of just
done with the main application and we
are looking to enhance the application
by adding the icons the launcher icon or
any kind of other resource you want to
add to a specific platform so right now
if you take a look inside the source
folder inside the index dot HTML file
this would be the file which would be
served to the browser right now on this
local development server and I on add
this component is responsible for
showing your application again this is
all angular for stuff going on here and
finally if you take a look on this app
and this app modules you could see that
this would be the actual main module
file of angular which is presented to
the browser and again this is the
similar thing which you will have seen
in angular for applications as well and
by the way if you are not comfortable
with angular for right now I have the
link in the description which is another
YouTube playlist for angular 4 on this
channel only and you can refer to that
and you would be able to get a taste of
it and how to work with angular a little
bit at least so yeah again so you can
see that we right now have home about in
contact as big tabs and inside
declarations where are components what
directives would go we have this about
page contact page home page tabs rates
so something is going on here we have
this page thing attached to every of
this component so angular or actually
ionic consists of something known as
pages
and you can create a page something like
this only and presented as a tab or
maybe as overlay or anything like that
so ionic makes use of this concept of
pages which we're going to take a look
later on not right now
so again we are importing the browser
module for making use of the browser
only the browser APs because that's what
pretty much ionic does and then we are
making use of this ionic module for
route which would be used to customize
our ionic application if we want to
customize we can just pass in an object
in here we're going to take a look at
that as well as we develop applications
will I on ik then we are bootstrapping
the ionic and again these this entry
components is something similar which we
have seen right there inside
declarations now the reason for this is
that angular pretty much would not know
when your page is kind of switched or
you know if you are performing any sort
of other action like displaying a page
as overly so ionic was not would not
implement this thing for the
declarations that angular would come to
know about a component is changed or
updated so ionic what it does is that it
tells angular to keep these components
ready in use so that we can actually
make use of this components anytime an
angular does not you know take some time
to actually load that into the memory
then we have some providers here again
which we would take a look at later on
in the series when we add some things
like maybe like login so we will add a
user service here and say providers so
yeah that's pretty much it for the
module part and we can see in the
component we have this root page or the
root page any which is just a tabs page
and what the steps where this root page
is used is inside this app dot HTML so
this ion navigation is basically
responsible for showing this whole stuff
and we are binding to this the root
property as root page so if we take a
look what this root page is right here
inside our app component you would see
that we are assigning this root page to
the tabs page and then finally we take a
look what this tabs pages inside pages
tabs you can see that we it consists of
all the tabs home about and contact
right here so if we go to home home dot
HTML which is the first page being shown
to us you can see that we have nailed it
down to the code which is responsible
for the output so we are going to say
instead of welcome to ionics let's just
say welcome to ionic version 3 and this
is gonna be awesome
something like that it's safe and it has
hot reloading on so you can see that we
get the output as welcome to ionic
version 3 and this is going to be
awesome
so again our home is home dot HTML is
just the home page and you do not need
to worry a lot about this pages sort of
thing because we're going to take a look
later on how to work with them
and there are a lot of other things with
ionic as well we're going to not go into
all those things at one go because that
might be a little bit overwhelming we're
going to just take a look at the things
we would require as we build
applications with ionic and it would be
pretty much similar with angular as well
so yes that's all for this one and if
you liked it again then please don't
forget to subscribe and I have my link
in the patreon as my link in the
description for patreon as well so you
might want to check that out as well so
that is all for this one and again see
you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
