NATO and welcome to your third quintana
tutorial now this would be a quick
tutorial where I would just show you how
you can replace this email sort of
authentication with a username one now
again there are a lot of ways to do that
but what I'm gonna do is a hackish way
and kind of not recommend it if you want
to deploy this on the live site but
would kind of give you the idea how you
can make it to work and I will just
present you another view of how you can
make it work right so what we have right
here is that we require the user to
actually write a full email address
right now instead of their username so
instead of this what we can do is again
allow them to write the user name only
but append any domain.com to their
username and just keep it to something
like a top-level domain which is not
able you can I guess there is now
available these days but again just keep
it's a xt8 whatever which is not
available so that the Google actually
does not send any email quality mail to
any person so yeah that's it and now
what we're going to do is actually
pretty much do nothing because we have
the fields still pointing to sign up at
the username and password so now if we
take a look we could register with a
simple username only instead of writing
full email address like AOL empty tea
and maple MVT only just you and we would
see info as register and now for the
login purpose again we want to append
the same domain before sending it to
logging so that it kind of makes sense
to the firebase as well and yeah that's
pretty much work as you would expect now
the other way which I would recommend is
that making use of database so for the
database part what we can do is actually
right here we can create
something like mappings and then we
could create an array of or rather we
can discrete an object with a username
mapped to the actual email address which
it points to like something like this so
we can create a lot of mappings like
this and then when the user sign ups
sign ends rather with the username we
can pick it up the email and then
authenticate it using that email address
and this is a longer approach and would
require some coding but this is a much
cleaner and better approach because this
only not only allows you to get the
actual email address of the user but
provides you the option or provides a
user option to actually reset the
password later on as well because
firebase again out of the box provides
you with the functionality to reset the
password by writing this not fire dot
dot I don't know what this is reset
password same password reset email and
there we go just the email how cool is
that so yeah you could do that and again
I guess for the login path what we can
do is sign in with Mayville mvt may hole
MPT only and hit silent and there you go
we are sorting and again we can just get
rid of this domain activate whatever
this is so yeah for the most part that's
it and that's all for the story and if
