your second node.js tutorial and which
will be writing an official HelloWorld
program
well we already did wrote a hello world
program in nodejs in the terminal but
let's just look hard to do that in a
text editor well there are many text
editors in the market and I personally
use sublime text for windows you have
seen that in my other tutorials in which
I use Windows operating system but for
bit Mac I would prefer this Adam because
over sublime text this is free so
sublime text is like a month trial but
this is equally good as sublime this
beautiful as well and it's free for
lifetime so I would recommend you for
the cylinder but it's up to you you can
use any editor you like so to write your
hello world program first of all I'll
just open your finder just create some
space for your node put a folder or you
can just go to your text editor as well
just create a new file I'm just going to
say it script one ojs and right here
what I'm going to do is just write the
simple program just like before so as
you can see this is a simple java script
which is just the old home javascript
just write node script 1j s
at the moment you do that it will just
compile or acara interpreted this your
file with node and it will just show you
hello world and if it does then congrats
you're on the right way so you can you
know just do the basic JavaScript as
well here because hey notice just the
JavaScript out so work so just right
let's just trust out again as you can
see simple plain JavaScript so that's
all for this one and in the next one
we'll be starting off with some real
node.js programming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
