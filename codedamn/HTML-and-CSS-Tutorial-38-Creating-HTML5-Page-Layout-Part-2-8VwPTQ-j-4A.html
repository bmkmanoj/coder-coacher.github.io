your xxx HTML and CSS tutorial and I'm
shooting this tutorial in full-screen
mode because we need to work with a page
layout design we just can't work in a
small little gun sized screen so make
sure you watch this video in HD to see
what's happening and I'll just zoom in a
little bit if it helps so now we have
got this and I would be using inspect
element a lot in this miniseries so you
try to understand what I'm doing with
each step and I'll try to explain so we
wanted the logo to the left of the ad
banner but currently because of the
block level these two are displayed in
separate lines so I would like this to
have placed on the left and I guess I
didn't explain you about floats and
floats are basically a kind of way to
organize or basically or to place your
elements on the screen and floats is
also a very difficult concept in CSS if
studied in details so I would have I
promise I'll
separate series for the splurt CSS
property but for now just understand
that we would be using float right here
float left
and what does float left right here is
doing is it's saying that div ID logo
first of all shrink yourself to the
minimum width which is which is just
like happens in your display inline but
there's a difference don't consider this
as display inline so what happens is div
ID logo is now strength to its own width
and it gives space for other block level
elements as well so block level elements
won't appear in the next line pan
instead they would just float with this
element and float left would keep on
floating elements to its right unless
one specified left to its right just in
this case unless we add a clear and this
clear property let's say I write clear
right then nothing happens because we
are applying a float left and doo-doo
clear a float of left we have to use
clear left or clear both so this clear
both what it would do is it would clear
the floats of this and you can apply
clear on the same element which you have
on the float one because this is already
floated so this can't be cleared at the
time setting of the float so let's say I
want this to be float left but I want
advertisement to have on the next lives
so I'll just go ahead
the advertisement rule and I'll just do
clear left
and this clear left would mean that
clear all your floats which are assigned
on the left so we would be using this
trick in a while I'll show you why
so now we have got this header ready and
we have got some Styles ready as well so
I'll just copy and paste these styles
and we just don't want fear right now so
we have got this float as left and I
want advertisement to be at flight so
I'm just to float right so now
advertisement is on right logo is on
left and it looks perfect
okay so now we have a 728 by 90
advertisement with a logo on the left
and now let's just shrink the header
width to a little bit so this content
right here is centered on the screen and
just not taking 100 percent of the width
so what we can do with what that is we
can go ahead with the header selector we
would specify a width for this let's say
maybe 960 pixels and we would suffice
margin:0 auto and this margin:0 auto 960
with 960
the banner size collapses so I'll just
go ahead with 1 0 6 0 so margin:0 auto
right here says that this is equivalent
of margin top zero margin bottom zero
which we understand pretty well but what
about Auto so margin-left:auto means
that all the margin from left and
margin-right:auto means all the modules
from right so when both sides are
pushing this element then this is
centered so remember that thing to set
an element in the center of the screen
we make use of margin left as Auto and
margin writers Auto which is
which can you can write in the short
form as margin:0 auto which says that
margin top zero margin left auto margin
bottom zero and margin-right:auto and
also remember that this margin:0 auto
would only work if your element is block
level and by default all lives are block
level so this is working but what if I
change this to display inline then you
see that neither does it follow width as
I told you in the inline verses inline
block and nor does it follow the margins
what about inline block so now it's
fallen width but not the margin so the
elements have to be block to follow the
margin:0 auto the auto world nor the
value okay so now enough of talking
let's just copy this
and let's just give it a margin of 20
pixels so there's a distance from top as
well so now we have got this little head
already and now you hover over this then
you see that there's a little bit
difficulties and what that is is this
header kinda doesn't look nice in the
covering section so when I hover over
this you see this red bar is not
covering all these two elements at all
so what's the problem
the problems are float the float:left
says that float everything to left float
everything on my right and I am on
floating or left float right says I am
floating on right and float everything
on my left but this continues for every
element down the tree and since we don't
have any element but the closing parent
so the parent is also kind of floated
left and I promise I'll explain all this
floats in the separate series which
we'll have after the series of floats in
CSS but just remember now that we have
to clear a float it is a very good
practice to clear a float when you have
basically achieved your desired result
to do that let's create a property clear
and
we'll just write clear boots right here
so now what we can do is we can go ahead
and type your div class clear and
disclose the state so what happens here
is when I reload this and over over this
okay so I guess advertisement
oh we are still on 37 bye-bye okay so
now when I hover over this you see that
we are now having a nice little header
which covers both of these elements so
clear is right now acting here as that
clear all the flutes which are currently
set in your siblings
so the difference clear would clear all
the sibling floats right now okay so now
when the floats are cleared and we've
got a nice trip head already we can give
it a padding of bottom 10 pixels and one
on the border bottom of three pixels
solid I like to color and I'll just make
use of the color picker and this is a
really nice tool if you want to work
with various kinds of color just type
any color any color you want in any
property and click on this square and
you'll get this color chart as BAM and
these results are real time you see that
these colors are changing and this color
picker tool is also very useful so let's
say if I want to have the border color
of this D so this would do min and would
allow me to select a color and when I
click on this you see automatically the
color gets assigned to the border so
let's just make use of this color
or I'll just go with a little crash type
so now let's copy this
okay so now we have got our very first
header ready in HTML and CSS and in the
next tutorial we'll be continuing with
this html5 layout page and we'll be
building some other interesting things
to build this web page so till then stay
tuned and don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you then in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
