your 35th HTML and CSS tutorial in which
we'll be discussing about some more
pseudo selectors in CSS and let's have a
look at some more CSS pseudo selectors
right away so first of all it's great a
form to have some nice little input
fields to work with and I'll just go
with input type email input type number
and input type summit for now
now let's just give it a Br
to each one of those
let's check this out on the browser
looks good so now in the CSS file what
we can do is
we can make use of some special css3
selectors which have been working with
coordinance
with the html5 validation api so let's
have a look so first of all to do that
let's wrap this this input field inside
our style of CSS with the attribute
selector and I hope I have taught you
this in the past
now we have this input type evil
selected right here and now the sudha
slicker we would use is invalid so I'm
not invalid let's just start with valid
I'll show you what invalid is so now
let's is this again for the number one
so now let's give it a background
of green and color of white soon Alice
reload this I'll explain you what we are
doing here so while it and let's just
type something
let's just type one two three four five
okay so what you're seeing here is for
subtext we are getting the Queen one but
for some text we are getting the white
one and why is that so the Queen one
signifies that my input is valid so
nothing nothing in the input field is
validating as a valid email address
maybe some fault in the html5 API but
when I type a invalid email address
right here like this then the color
changes to white and once I write it at
the rate sign and DF dot-com then it
changes to green and the reason is that
it's accepting this these invalid
characters as well because html5 API as
just their testing for a string add the
rate string dot string so this is the
simple test for html5 and that's the
reason why you should not rely on html5
validation because it's worse so
for now we have to you know use this
validation for the teaching purpose but
don't ever use html5 validation at all
you go ahead with PHP the backend one
are the JavaScript one so now let's see
if I enter a invalid email address which
is not in the format of string a dearest
string taut string and then what happens
so the background chase changed to white
but one side view the other it's signed
and write some text then the diagonals
again changed to green same in the case
with numbers when numbers are typed then
the background is clean but once the
alphabet is typed or some other special
character then the background changes to
white and why's that
so this valid pseudo selectors only
works when the html5 APR the validation
API would say to the CSS that yeah this
input field is now valid
so this valid would apply all these
properties only when your input type
whichever it is becomes actually valid
from html5 and similarly we have in
valid and invalid would just do the
opposite of this let's put a background
of red let's reload this and I'll just
type some random email address and as
you can see the back of this red unless
I type a valid email address and
similarly the background is red unless I
remove this text and type some numbers
all right so next thing we have got is
the empty pseudo selector and let's take
a look at it what it is
so let's say
I have a deer right here and some be tax
this is like one another be another P
this is life - so now in the style of
CSS or I'll do is I'll just live line
height of every P - 30 pixels so let's
reload this and now you see that okay so
let's just copy this piece of code again
okay so now you see that we have got
three P three P's right here and let's
go ahead and give it a minimum height of
let's say 10 pixels so that we have got
a minimum height let's reload this and
now the problem is by mistake what your
CMS turd does is that it inserted the
blank piece and this is a very annoying
problem in what face if you ever worked
with that because what press by default
inserts a lot of B tax automatically so
now what you want to do is you want to
get rid of all the speed tags which are
empty and to do that we have got a CSS
selector pseudo selector which is be
empty and this empty would work with
everything so so I'll just give it up
I'm not a background actually I'll just
do display:none do it so now when I
reload this then what happens is every P
which is empty or which does not contain
and
content in it gets this the CSS
properties applied but would also have
the spin on which technically removes it
from the Dom tree so this is about empty
one
and now let's just take a look at not
CSS selector and not would basically
select everything except that particular
class ID or element you give so let's
say I have got some dates right here
live class but if content one let's just
copy this line
two three four let's just give it
my deaf too so now let's go to our style
of CSS file let's say select every day
every element div
not
my div now this means select every div
every elementary which has not the class
as my div so it would select this right
here this thing so I'll just give it up
the background of thread and when I
reload this then we get content 1.1 in
the background as red and if I do like
might have to
reload this then all these forget in
background best friend because all these
four are divs and do not have the class
as my to do but what if I had a class
right here as my to do as well in the
quadrant one when I reload this now then
this line gets no background because it
has content this line has the class has
might have two so this code would ignore
this line so that's pretty much about
CSS selectors pseudo selectors and
that's it for this tutorial and I'll see
