this tutorial in which will be working
on how to remove the background noise in
your video file and boost up the audio
in your video file with the help of two
tools called ffmpeg and goldwave now
these two tools would basically help you
to extract the audio out of your video
files clean that audio a little bit and
insert the audio into the video file
again and get a fresh and new and
completed video so to begin with we have
this ffmpeg tool which is a command line
tool and it's really simple to use so I
assume you're using Windows so go to the
site ffmpeg dark with download section
and click on this Windows bills the
windows nose and just download this
ffmpeg gid whatever this is 64-bit
static if you're alone 64 bit OS and
32-bit starting if you're on 32-bit OS
alright so once you're done with that
you'll get something like this this one
this RAR file and inside it you will get
have folder
with some files and I've extracted this
ffmpeg right here and what you have to
do is just double click on this FF
prompt don't bat and just minimize it
for the wild
alright so now it's google gold width
now this golden wave is a software which
would you just used to extract your
audio and basically clean everything so
ffmpeg would be used to insert the audio
and the video so March the audio and
video files together and go away would
be used to do rest of the task actually
you could do moves to your audio with
ffmpeg but you can't actually kind of
clean it so it's not that much good tool
for working with audio to stuff so we
have gone goldwave for that and go to
the official site goldwave calm and you
should have no problem while downloading
this
alright now go to this download section
and download anything and install it so
you'll get an installer file with this
and once you download it to launch it I
will just go to my start of windows 8
and as click on the icon so now it has
launched as well and we have got the
ffmpeg as well so I'll show you now the
video file we need to edit so carefully
listen to what I'm saying in this small
video file and will be boosting up the
audio as well as the cleaning up the
viral noise so listen to it
our I'll just launched it in windows
media player
so you can barely hear me what I was
saying in this video alright it's time
to boost this a little bit so go to your
goal wave here interface click on open
and open your video file though it says
open sound but it would work perfectly
well with your video file so double
click on your video file and it will
open something like this so we have got
this nice little chart of video and if I
play this then you can see that this is
pretty much same audio which was playing
under the video ok so our first task is
to boost this audio little bit to go to
affect volume
maximize volume and don't modify these
settings because hundred percent is the
maximum boost you can give to your audio
without actually clipping it so if I
play it all right past this is just a
demo video so it looks kind of much good
now but we have got some background
noise in the background so alright let's
play it alright cast this is just a demo
video okay so we have caught background
noise background buzzing noise and to
fix that I'll zoom in into this profile
a little bit so click on n n n and you
can actually see the profile washing
right share and like to do select all
basically I'm go to the front
and a little bit more in and let's
select a portion of say this one and
select the kosher which has got some
noise only the barrel race All Right
cast this is all right you see that the
ocean I have selected has got only the
background noise in it
you see ah there's no noise of this not
any voice of mind in the background so
that your this goal with software would
know that remove all the instances all
the waves of this particular noise in
all the video so I'm go to edit I'll go
copy this now this copy means that copy
this basically kind of sound path into
your clipboard and now I'll just do out
and i'll just select all angle to affect
filter noise reduction all right and
here use clipboard because we have just
copied the sample dummy of track which
we want to remove so if i check here
output noise only then when I will play
this then it will just show me what it
is going to trim out of the audio
all right gasps this is just a demo
video so you see that inside noise ah it
is all streaming out my voice as well so
I'll just reduce it a little bit the
scale percentage so that it only
excludes the noise and not my voice all
right Cass this is just a demo video
okay much better but still my voice was
there let's see if we go can get much
better and just select a wall up to 16
times if you want to get best results
and maybe 15 would do the job all right
let's try to do this okay and let's play
this oh I guess I guess I didn't uncheck
that box so it basically just use that
so we were on 15 16 times all right past
this is just a demo video and sounds
much much better all right so we have
trimmed all the background noise from
that and let's play this again all right
past this is just a demo video with low
audio and will be boosting up this audio
and tutorial you are seeing right now so
that's what what is I'll see you then so
now you can clearly hear me what I was
saying in that particular video so now
you can see without basically degrading
the quality of the sound we have boosted
the sound and also removed the
background noise so the next thing is
that we want to save the sound file and
would like to merge these two videos
together let's save it go to file save
for and this would pop up just click on
ok no need to worry and select valve now
one thing I should tell you that I'm
while working with ffmpeg commander I'm
going to tell you now you should know
certain combinations that WMV would go
with audio file of wav or mp3 you could
also select mp3 and just edit it right
here and mp4 would go with mp3 and so on
so you can check the description of this
video for complete instructions while
working with these audios so you would
know then
that in which format you have to save
your audio but in most cases mp3 would
do the job so save it with let's say
audio audio mp3 in the same folder and
let's listen to it we'll see all right
past this is just a demo video with Luke
alright looks good and now it's time for
this little bad boy ffmpeg to work now
currently if you view then we are in the
directory of C users may hold extra
ffmpeg and all this but we want to move
into this folder so i guess i moved the
complete dietary back so i'll just do CD
see users male dextra this folder is
ffmpeg tutorial and now we are inside
this folder all right
okay so next thing we need to do is we
need to work with something called this
line in ffmpeg add this in line you can
find in the documentation and what it
will do is basically you have to write
ffmpeg I now everything followed by a
dash stands for a input file and this
means that you are going to give it a
input file which FF impact has to work
with let's say you want to work with
dummy with WMV
right here same name and then I want to
work with audio not mp3 as well now this
map is something special and what this
map does is it would tell the ffmpeg to
map everything in this audio to this
video from zero from ratios we are from
0 &amp;amp; 1 to 1 that means complete audio of
this video should be replaced by this
audio right here if you don't include
this map 01 then what it will do is it
would kind of overlap the audio or it
would insert the audio after the audio
of the video so let's like a map once
and then we have got codec which would
just copy the codex which are mp3 or WAV
or whatever and then we will write copy
finally and with the filename let's say
new file dot W we and all you need to do
is now is rent press Enter alright so it
did a job and we have got this new file
dot WMV right here ready and let's
listen to it now
alright casts just a demo video with low
audio and we'll be posting up this audio
and tutorial you are seeing right now so
that's all for this I'll see you there
so you can see that how better quality
of the sound is now as compared to this
original video which had such low audio
while audio level and background noise
as well
and you know real serious constant
problems and it will fix that later on
so you can see that we not only boosted
the audio but also remove any boosted
background noise as well so i hope you
liked this tutorial and that's all for
this one and i'll see you then next time
