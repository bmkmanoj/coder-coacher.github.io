javascript lesson in this lesson we'll
be learning how to transfer the Dom
using JavaScript API
now as I told you in earlier tutorials
the document object model or simply
referred as Dom is the code you actually
see in inspect element section now
basically if I open the browser
okay so
right now you are seeing the simplest
document object model tree now this is a
tree which contains HTML as root element
then head and body as child elements and
all this document tree is accessible
within JavaScript commands okay so let's
start with simpler commands first
supposingly will have a divided e
contents then we say we have
like this we have a divided contents and
the inner text is my contents here Knapp
supposingly you want to get the contents
inside this div and make it a lot so
first of all we'll create variable C or
any name you want then we'll use the
keyword document dot get element by ID
element sorry my ID
okay so now what is actually happening
here is I will tell you
now we have a div with my contents here
this is a dick then we are doing with
JavaScript that is documented get
element by ID now what JavaScript is
doing is it says to this document that
give me an element whose ID is contents
and then we are using a property inner
text now what inner text does is it
returns the text inside the selected
element in the JavaScript now for
instance right now the C variable stores
my contents here now we have another
property right here which is inner HTML
now what is the difference between inner
text and inner HTML that is if we have
text like span this inner HTML will
contain all of this my content span a a
a span and here but the inner text will
remove these elements which is spanned
and the open span and it will simply
return this string okay now let's try to
alert this
and see what happens
as you can see JavaScript sees my
contents here the next thing I want to
tell you that in JavaScript we can
actually access the class of class
elements as well supposedly we have you
will list with la class a
okay so we have la classe a
with every
opening and closing la attack and
supposingly
we have contents like content 1 1 10 to
1 10 3 4 10 4 and content 5
ok so supposedly we want to modify the
contents of the third Li now what we'll
do is using the same previous C variable
we do document which gives us access to
the document elements and you do get
elements by class name now what it does
is it returns an array of elements with
all elements having similar class names
for example right now C is a kind of
array now if we can try to console.log
the typeof c then you should see
something like this
or checked because arrays are considered
objects in JavaScript
there's no datatype adding JavaScript
arrays are also considered objects in
JavaScript
therefore content control that log
typeof c returns object ok so now we
have object or array of elements right
in the seat variable we can have access
to any of the content li content using
the index now supposedly I create
another variable first element then we
do C 0 now as you know that indexing
starts from 0 in programming languages
therefore first element c 0 will give us
access to this first li the first li and
now we can do here as we did before like
in a text or inner HTML or whatever you
want and then we allow it first element
and you will get content 1 as you can
see here ok so this is about
simply getting like get element by
classname and get element by ID getting
an array of elements or like that but in
JavaScript you can actually use if you
have ever done or seen jQuery code
before then jQuery uses something like
this as a selector like this this is
much simpler and easier to read as
compared to JavaScript code but
javascript also has some cool methods
like this and those are I'll show you
right now we have documented query
selector in JavaScript which works
similarly as of jQuery one supposedly I
have
these two tags these two depths then in
JavaScript I do variable C is equal to
document dot query selector div dot
innerhtml
now what is does is that query selector
grabs the first occurrence of the
element only the first prints of the
element for example if you have a
thousand is right here with different
contents then document dot query select
row will return only the first div with
all its property attached to Dom for
example if we try to alert see right
here then we'll see ABC only but another
property in JavaScript which is
documented query selector all returns an
array or kind of object in JavaScript
now if we try to do
okay let's type of C
then it should return an object as you
can see okay so if we do document it
query selector all div and we use the
index at zero and then do then you will
see ABC and would see one you would see
the EF as you can see
okay this is about modifying and
accessing drum but we have something
called create element and create text
nodes inside the document object which
allows you to create and modify the
elements on the fly that means you can
actually create elements after your page
execution or after your page has loaded
for instance if you want to append a
table or let's say a div with some
contents with the help of JavaScript you
can do something like this first of all
we create a variable which holds the
element we have to create traditionally
we do document dot but now this time we
do create element now what this method
does is it will create an element in the
memory for now because we are not doing
anything with this element right now and
it will keep it in memory with the help
of variable C now if we do document or
create element if we do C dot
No okay we have to create another
variable seedot
oh we know we do document dot create
text node I was a little bit confused
right there great text node and in the
parentheses goes your contents you want
to display in this div tag so right now
let's say the step to hello world
as born the chalice with
let's do C dot append child D I'll
explain what's happening here
okay so now what we are doing is we are
creating a document dot we are creating
a new element it within the variable C
with variable D we are creating a text
node with the contents hello world are
born with JavaScript we are appending
the text node inside the element C and
then finally we are appending the child
the we are appending the C variable the
element inside the body now you would
question that why have I used directly
the document or body and now not
something like this document dot get
elements get element by ID my body and
given body an ID now both will work
actually
but the DOM and the JavaScript native
API has actually an object property
directly body which allows you to access
body without any doing this stuff this
is because you can only have obviously
one body in a document so
let's try this code in the browser and
as you can see we get a code with hello
world I have born with JavaScript the
next thing I want to tell you is you can
actually modify the CSS with JavaScript
as well for instance if you want to
modify the CSS of these two deaths or
let's do with the first step because
doing both of them would involve looping
which I am not taught yet so okay so
let's grab this element into the
variable C with the help of query
selector we have a variety of options to
use
this gets us to the first step and then
we do see dot style dot the property
here the CSS property you want to modify
when stands if we want to change the
background of the text that means the
background which appears behind the text
and we do it like black then what
happens is we have actually change the
background of this element black if you
refresh this you will see the background
becomes black and even in the Dom you
can actually see that the CSS has been
applied with the help of JavaScript we
can do anything with this like you can
change the color as well to white so the
text is visible as you can see then
the next thing comes is the child nodes
now let's do some nesting now
okay before doing this I would like to
explain you the dorm structure using my
simple drawing which you may not like
but I guess it's the best thing make you
understand so
how do you make a square in paint I
don't know
that's embarrassing
oh yes okay okay so supposingly we have
a root element right here this is a root
element and then we have its sub
elements like this
and
the tall one is root element then these
are these two are its child and these
two themselves are called the siblings
these two are siblings this element the
root element is the parent of both of
these this is child one and this is
child 2 I am just trying a simple dawn
tree this is child one and this is child
two then you can continue the storm tree
down a very long chain
then we have child 1.1 child 1.2 child
2.1 child 2.2 now these two are siblings
as well but these two do not have any
direct relation ship with each other
these two are siblings
these two are siblings but they do not
have a direct Dom relationship anywhere
to modify if you are here right now in
the DOM and you want to modify this
element then you have to go to the child
one the parent element choose the
sibling child to and arrive at this this
child 2.1 or you can do child one go to
its parent route then select this child
and then go to child 2.1 but you cannot
directly jump from this element to this
element if you are currently located in
javascript or this element I'll tell you
what do you mean by currently locating
on this element in the future tutorials
but for instance just remember that your
JavaScript code is currently modifying
or currently have the control on this
element then you cannot directly jump on
to this element without any reference
okay so let's close this and create a
nested
stuff now supposingly I have another
span here and have Dex load one
a negative here text load too
okay so now we get
document dot let's give it a ID one
get a lipid one and we have to get the
let's get the spandex node and remove it
okay so what we'll do is we'll create
another variable let's say name a D and
we'll get C dot
okay no we do not need to create the
variable we can simply do with this
because creating a variable would create
more of us we can simply do like C dot
remove child C dot child nodes and what
is the childhood it's zero if you want
to remove the dev one then you would
have to give one here now what it does
is it grabs the element dividing one and
it removes the child node which is at
the index zero pretty simple to
understand
okay
Lord zero I don't know why it's not
working let's try to do
seedot get
spread
okay no maybe childhood is not supported
in Google Chrome but yes it is supported
in other browsers but if we do see that
removed I'll see that gray cell to spam
then what it does it it removes the
child by selecting the first pan in the
element other things I want to tell you
that we have a property or a kind of
function in JavaScript which returns
true if you have child nodes inside a
selector for example has child nodes
returns true if you have child nodes
inside that particular element for
example we have child nodes right now in
the one divided it would alert true as
you can see
but
if we remove both of them then
so loading true
let's see
as you can see false but if you remove
all the child loads right from here then
the childhood functions return false
because dividing one is currently the
childhood itself of the body and HTML
tags so I guess this tutorial was a bit
longer from the usual ones but I hope
that we are clear with document object
model and the transversing of Dom in
JavaScript in the future tutorial will
use these commands a lot in our programs
because this is very important in
JavaScript so thanks for watching this
