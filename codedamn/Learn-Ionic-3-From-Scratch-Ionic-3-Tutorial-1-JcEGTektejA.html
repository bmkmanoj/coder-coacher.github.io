Mei hole and welcome to your very first
tutorial for ionic framework well
ionic is pretty awesome and if you have
never used that before you're going to
love it because what ionic does is that
it takes your HTML CSS and JavaScript
code and it puts you on Android iPhone
or rather iOS and Windows and whatnot so
you would write your application in
actually JavaScript HTML CSS all that
stuff we do to make websites and then
ionic would put it on all the platforms
and out of the box ionic provides you a
lot of components and styling and
whatnot
so you can just pretty much get started
with your application without actually
going into the hassle of first of all
gathering the styles and images and
markup and all that stuff so ionic is
great but again at the end of the day
ionic is just an application running
inside webview of your phone so if you
are planning to make an application
which is kind of heavily dependent on
graphics and kind of like 3d stuff doing
so I on ik would not be the best choice
for that and also ionic heavily depends
on three at least heavily depends on
angular 4 so if you are not kind of
angular guy or you cannot like it then
ionic might not be the best choice for
you again but otherwise if you are
building a basic app or even a moderate
app like login functionality and you're
anything like health tracker or maybe
anything like char application as well
ionic would be the best choice for that
for you to get up and started real quick
so in this web series we're going to
take a look at how to develop
applications with ionic and instead of
some other things as well like doing
authentication with firebase with the
help of firebase and other uses of
firebase we can make use of with ionic
which will
we would take a look later on as we
proceed with the web serie so yeah
that's pretty much it for the intro part
and in the next tutorial we're going to
take a look at how to set it up on
Windows and Mac as I am using right now
and yeah we'll just get started from
there only so that's all for this one
and if you liked it then please don't
forget to subscribe and I have my
patreon link in the description as well
so if you want to support that would be
great I would really appreciate that
so yeah that's all for this one and if
you again liked it then please don't
forget to subscribe thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
