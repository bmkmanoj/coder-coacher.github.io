your 17th Android application
development tutorial
my name is mijo and in this tutorial I'm
gonna show you how to create dynamic
views with your Java code and then
append them on runtime actually in real
time in your application activity so
first of all let me just get rid of all
that stuff which we have from the past
tutorial I'll just get rid of these two
attributes as well and inside our main
activity dot Java what we can do is that
we could actually create a button
dynamically and then append that so it
might be useful in some situations like
if you are receiving some data from
back-end or you know you are just
creating a fun application where you
just want the user to tap on the button
and then some text displays start off
well in case actually we could develop
such an application so actually let's
just do that so I'm gonna say this is a
button where the wrap content and wrap
content only add word text let's just
say this is create a new button and
let's just give it an ID of first button
so that it's easier to track and then
I'm gonna say that button first button
is fine view by ID odd ID the odd first
button right let's just move that out so
Java stops complaining about that right
there then I want to explicitly typecast
it to butter okay then our dot
oh wait a minute this is all right so we
mess up on find byd here we go okay so
now I want to say that first button dot
said onclicklistener
new here we go and what I want to do is
that I want to append a button so I need
to actually create one and how do we
create one I'm gonna say button second
button is equal to new button and then
the application context so I'm gonna say
this is main activity not this now you
could have used only this right here but
what would happen is that this keyword
if you have you know used any other
language which makes use of this keyword
well obviously most of them it makes use
of that and the context is pretty much
clear then this is right now targeting
this this class even right now so you
need to append the button to your main
activity right so you need to target
main activity dot this not just any
other dish so once you are done with
that you need to set how your button
would look like because right now it's
just raw piece of information it's just
a simple button in memory allocated so
I'm gonna say second button dot set
layout
parents and this is just parameters a
short form for that and then again we
need a class a new linear layout no not
that and actually we are making use of
relative layout right so we need to have
new relative layout dot layout
parameters right and inside here what it
would do is
it would require you to write
relativelayout dot layout parameters and
it's kinda confusing I know dot match
parent right and again the second line
would be the same pretty much and here
we go now what the heck is going on just
give me a sec and I would just make
things clear once we are done with this
so finally I'm gonna say to add actually
I need to give it an ID Android ID
equals ID equals my layout I'm gonna say
right here I could just target it
relative layout my layout equals now
then I'm gonna say that right here
it's my layout equals fine view by ID r
dot ID dot my layout and typecast it to
relative layout and then finally I want
to do my layout dot add view and this is
a method and then it would accept second
button as an argument so all the code is
quite self-explanatory I guess I'm just
need to make sure I'll write find you by
ID there and pretty much what is
happening here is that first of all I'm
just creating a button with this
mainactivity interface then with my
layout I'm just getting the particular
layout this one right now and then
second button is under setting some
layout parameters which again makes use
of this new relative layout dot layout
parameters because we are making use of
relative layout then I want to set
relative layout that layout parameters
match parent and this would be the width
and height of that particular element so
you know that match parent fills the
whole parent so it would probable if
we'll the whole screen so let's stop
just straddle out in the browser are not
really the browser but the emulator
first so let's see how it looks like and
it's installing and launching so what we
need to do is click on this button and
you would see that it actually filled up
with another button but not really
because yes it has it so the button is
kinda not 100% translucent no it we call
that opaque actually so the button is a
bit kind of translucent so you can't see
a little bit outside that but you know
you get the idea that how to create a
dynamic button then what you can do is
that there are a lot of other properties
associated with this button or any other
view which you are gonna dynamically add
so that is how pretty much you basically
create a button and you could just
change this to some other stuff like
wrap content our good old friend so that
it kinda doesn't suck so that is all
pretty much for this tutorial and in the
next tutorial I'm just gonna explain a
little bit more about these properties
and how to make them work nicely and if
you like this then don't forget
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
