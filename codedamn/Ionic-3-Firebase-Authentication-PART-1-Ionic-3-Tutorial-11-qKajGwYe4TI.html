Mickel and welcome to your eleventh
tutorial for iron development and this
tutorial we're going to take a look at
how we can implement login functionality
in our simple login app using firebase
now firebase if you are not familiar
with this this is actually a tool a
great project from Google and it
consists of a lot of tools which you can
just use straight away out of the box
without configuring any sort of servers
or any kind of hassle like that so
technically you could create now apps
just with JavaScript which would take
care of your authentication part as well
without even touching server code and
the free tire of firebase is also
extremely helpful and extremely good it
would be quite sufficient for you and
you would probably not hit it at least
in your demos so yeah for the most part
it's more than enough for even small to
medium projects and you can then
therefore expand as you need
so anyways getting back to the project
what we want to do right now if we take
a look inside terminal we're going to
say is ionic serve it should start our
project and we had just created a very
basically out of register and login only
so if you take a look this firebase
would allow us to add a project so let's
just add a project first and let's just
say this is let us say this is something
like test project and here goes our
ionic apps so let me just change this to
India not Indonesia but India right
there and let's create this so if we
just create a new project for us right
and to make use of firebase in our eye
on exposure to do is actually make use
of this angular fire now this angular
fire do is essentially the wrapper for
angular 4 right so you wouldn't need
this you wouldn't actually take
need this to work with firebase firebase
does provides its own JavaScript SDK
with right here but you would need this
if you are working with ionic because it
kind of provides a wrapper to make
JavaScript of SDK JavaScript of ionic
look more like angular one so we're
going to do this right here so I'm going
to go back to terminal and set a new tab
we're going to say this thing which
installs firebase and angular fire
firebase gives us the core dependencies
required for firebase and angular phi2
would add those two would add the
angular sort of stuff angular wrappers
around it so it's done and now if you
take a look the documentation is
actually quite rich we in the straight
go to the dogs and right here inside
install and setup we can see that right
here Ceaser's - first of all install
angular CLI we're gonna just skip that
thing now it saves us to actually export
something like this now what this is is
essentially this requires us to make use
of some sort of API keys and values and
all that stuff so that firebase can
actually know what communication what
database we are communicating to so
right now we have this configuration but
I'm just going to copy paste this right
here inside my sublime project and say
if I go into a hat and app module right
here if we take a look
and pasted right here always say this is
something like this right so now if we
go back right here and to initialize
this if we take a look it saves us in
our engine module we're going to do
something like this so we're going to
say inside our energy module inside the
imports ones not in the declarations
we're going to import the angularfire
and we're going to make use of this file
based authorization and we can just get
rid of this and we can see that it's
right now we're just importing the same
object which it is doing from another
file so you can just separate this as
well it doesn't matter so next thing we
have to actually include this
angularfire module so here we go
and this should get us started now this
comes because we have already installed
that from the command line right here
angularfire - so this is now available
in our angular app and
want to optionally provide a firebase
name so we are good with that
for the authentication but you can see
that it requires us to load the
authentication module or the database
module accordingly so what happens is
that inside firebase if we take a look
you can see that we have got a lot of
tabs right there
and once the tabs is the authentication
tabs right so what this is is
essentially this makes it extremely easy
to set up attend occasion on your
website so let's just say if you want
people who sign up with their email
passwords over there for or with the
Google account Facebook Twitter github
or even anonymous logins so you can
enable all of or any of these and I'm
just going to go with email for now
email password pair which would allow us
to just send the email and password to
Google to firebase right now it will
just create an account inside its own
authentication table or sort of the the
database that firebase uses the no
sequel database so right now you can see
that we have got no user right here and
we would need actually the automated
because we're going to make use of this
authentication where we can do that with
database as well but firebase
exclusively provides authentication
stuff so we can just make use of that
why not and we're going to go again here
and paste the angularfire auth module
and then we're gonna just import it
right here has the angular files module
and this should be available throughout
our app now okay so the next thing is
that we have to just inject the
dependencies now and make use of that in
our code
now for the most part you would see the
same code again if you would which you
would make use of inside somewhere right
here you can see that it has got a user
authentication Docs as well and right
here if CC then we just want to import
this angularfire odd and we can go to
first of all let's create with just a
functionality so we're going to go to
just about TS and right here let me just
adjust it right there okay so we can
just import that thing and with that
being done what I want to do is actually
import the private fire and let's just
say this is angular fire OTT
and if we save this we can see that this
right here tends to stuff a lot of
functions which consists of one of the
signing with pop up as well but we're
just gonna make use of something like
we've injected this and right here
inside we just a user we're going to see
this dot fire dot dot now you can see
that it gives us a lot of functions and
one of them is this create user with
email and password now what this would
do is essentially accept two arguments
which is the first one is email and the
second one is password and it would
return you a promise now if you are not
familiar with promises then I would
suggest you watching one of my videos I
have the link in the description I would
paste the link and you should be good to
go but essentially if you just want to
take a look at a quick look what
promises are promised is actually just a
fancy way of doing asynchronous coding
right so it saves you a lot of headaches
and probably bug is good as well if
you're doing a lot of asynchronous tasks
something like this like you're
registering and login logging in and
even if you are making use of firebase
extensively in your applications like if
you're developing real time applications
then promises would come handy though
firebase actually works on observables
as well but anyways right now what what
the main point is that if you pass in
something like this dot user dot value
or whatever we have email well you know
dot value this dot password dot value
okay so what this does is that this
would fire this then function whenever
we are done with that so we can say this
actually doesn't return anything as far
as a member or we can still check for
the data just the data and we can just
say something like console dot log got
data and something like this and then
finally we can catch an error if there's
any because probably there would be
because again we are not implementing
any sort of email functionality right
now email validation functionality so it
would probably throw an error or we can
just say got an error and we can just
log per error as well okay so finally
what we can say is
yeah at this part if we see then our
user is registered so if we save this
and go back to our ionic app and
actually what you can do is if you want
to make it look fancy you can this open
ionic lab as well and it will give you a
nice little interface with all that
icons and UI that you want to do take a
look at if you are kind of an Apple fan
or just Android fan or whatever so we
can just click on this register we can
say something like male MVD as we
username and the password being the same
and we can just inspect element' it
right here and just open it right there
so that it doesn't make the screen
smaller so if I click on register you
can see that we got an error
our tase us that invalid email address
again we are writing this as username
but the firebase expects us to write an
email address so let's just write an
email address and hit register you can
see that we get a would register with
user may column PT at the regime and
calm and mingle empathy we got the data
and yes we get the data lag yeah okay so
now you can see that we have got all the
information regarding this but don't
worry we do not need to do anything with
this because firebase wants it does that
it would automatically register and
login the user so now if we go back to a
test project and refresh this list you
could see that our item is added and
it's super easy and super convenient to
create applications like this if you do
not want to worry about all the backend
handling stuff at all that so ok 50%
done but what about the log and not
login pad well we would similarly
implement the logins thing as well we
would just need to send the data back to
firebase and let it do its job so I
guess I will just keep it keep the story
alert
I'm in the next tutorial we're going to
take a look at how we can actually
interactively show user this error
message as well and we can actually log
in and show
custom - but sort of thing as well to
the user so yeah that's all for this one
and if you liked it then please don't
forget to subscribe and I have my
patreon link in the description as well
so if you want to support that would be
the best way you could go about so that
is all for this one again and I'll see
you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
