bootstrap tutorial number 15 in which
I'm gonna show you how you can add
tooltips to your website with bootstrap
the tooltips if you don't know are just
little help messages which you can add
to any word or a collection of word so
let's say if you want to add a tool tip
to like this area word so what you can
do is you can go to your file look at
the word let's just say this is here and
let's say to add a tool tip to this word
and whenever I hover it I want to show
the user a little message so I'm just
gonna and close this in an eh red
because that would be the easiest
approach and the next thing you have to
do is you have to write the title which
would contain the tooltip which you want
to display let's say area of square is
side times side why not this is your
tooltip and to toggle the tooltip what
you have to do is or I'm just gonna show
you first what happens with just a
simple tire so this is let's reload this
page so you see when you hover over this
for a while then you see this little
ugly grey area of square is silent time
side which is the OS default but since
we are using bootstrap this framework
has its own tooltips coded already so
you don't need to do anything so what
you have to do is just right here
data-tooltip and yeah so that's pretty
much it so just write data tooltip here
and one thing we are left again is that
you have to trigger the tooltips with
the help of jQuery so for example like
you added this data-tooltip attribute to
which over the
aah if you want to show tooltip to and
then what you have to do next is right I
just script in your jQuery file and I'm
just doing this in the same file because
there's hardly a line so there's no you
no need for a new file for this and this
is the document already function and
what I want to do is that if any tag
contains this attribute right here I
want to do tip that tag so thus tooltip
is the method I guess this is in this
file so I'm just gonna move this above
just in case so we are all ready now
let's take a look let's reload the page
and who are over this ok where's jQuery
are you serious now
well that's Cara we're good shrubs
javascript requires jQuery all the
jQuery spreads oh okay I guess I moved
it over jQuery as well so just make sure
you to keep the order jQuery bootstrap
in your code here you go okay now who
were with the area and as you can see
this nice little tooltips pops up over
this area and this would automatically
it just so for example like if you
decide to show the tooltip down the side
of the word then if I click scale up or
down the window then these tooltips
would automatically adjust so that won't
just overflow on your page and you can
customize these tooltips with the CSS if
you want your own CSS because you see
that when I hover over this a new
element is added right in there if you
see in the inspect element the div div
class tooltip and I can get to that
without just leaving my mouse there and
as you can see you can customize this by
just adding your Dave tooltip don't
customize it by ID because that seems
like this is randomly generated or in a
sequence but you get the point so you
can just change the background do a bit
oh I guess we are not supposed to work
on this element yeah so this one's good
so you can change the background or the
opacity of the tooltip or what you
whatever you want to do okay so go ahead
and try this out and yeah so that's
pretty much it for the tooltips I'll see
you then next time don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
