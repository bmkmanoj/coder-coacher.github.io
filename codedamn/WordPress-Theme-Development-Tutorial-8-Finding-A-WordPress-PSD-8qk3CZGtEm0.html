hole and welcome to your another
WordPress theme development tutorial and
in the story we'll be finally looking at
a team which we are gonna develop over
the next few tutorial in the playlist
and the theme would be this honor PST
now this PSD is just for the sharp
development file and pretty much what it
would do is that it would just provide
us with a layout of how your WordPress
would look like and accordingly we would
decide this side and design so this is
how a PSD file looks so you might want
to press ctrl H to get rid of those
lines and zoom in a bit let's say 66%
and I have got this PSD file by googling
and the you could just Google free
wordpress PS DS and remember not the
themes because we're gonna create our
own team so we sort of need a PSD to
work with and that is an idea so that's
pretty much what our final product would
look like but not in Photoshop but on
actual website so it states us the sizes
as well for example the slider should be
1920 by 719 and pretty much this is our
post area which we would make use of to
add some posts and you can see all of
those icons we need right here
the +1 and this comment bubble then we
have or above we have this calendar icon
this card icon search bar icon these for
the slider then we have our logo and
this arrow right here so you can achieve
all of that using any font library sort
of or you can just create your own fonts
out of these icons as well if
you have the SVG images for that but for
this PSD I'm just gonna make use of the
images only so okay so let's get started
with this so yeah before starting off
let me just tell you how I fix this team
comms stuff so you just have to go to
settings Journal just right team carb
here so as simple as that and make sure
you just leave that we host
configuration as it is so you know do
not revert back because that is still
required so we are here and okay if I
just take a look at the about zoom in
our little you can see about pretty much
looks like as a page template so we
could pretty much do that as well and
include all of these links so we are
gonna provide a sort of interface for
the user to actually you know add this
all of this information then we have the
donation single PSD and okay so it looks
like it looks like a post so because you
have this commenced so at least we have
got the PSD for our post area as well so
that's how the sidebar would look like
and all that stuff so we could just get
rid of that up actually because we don't
need to do that much for a theme for a
free theme actually if you are deciding
to launch it then for donations this is
a sort of simple page you can say
sixty-six customizable as well so for
this one what we need is first of all
just go to wp-content themes and pretty
much
just open the containing folder and
delete this my first team and create
let's just say team all-sec honor team
which is from our PSD file and inside
this honor team what you need is
obviously the index dot PHP file then we
need Styles style start CSS I guess and
then we need to have headed headed bhp
we need to have photo dot PHP as well
then I would like to create a folder
which would just say CSS which would
include any other styles which we are
gonna make use of or anything else then
here would go out JavaScript all let's
just say this as chess then what you
want is some icons like I showed you
this one like these arrows or this
person thumbs up and all that stuff so
for that we need a new folder icons and
yeah so I guess that's pretty much it we
need for this team and I will actually
add something if we need it not but last
but not least this function start PHP so
if you just open this themes on our
theme footer functions header indexed
and styles so we could actually just go
to the themes as well and stylesheet is
missing there should be probably
style dot CSS but we don't have those
instructions as well so here we go
once we activate this we've got pretty
much nothing so now we have everything
pretty much ready to be hooked up and
start coding so from the next tutorial
onwards we're gonna finally lay our
hands down to some coding and start off
with our first theme development for
WordPress so if you like the story all
