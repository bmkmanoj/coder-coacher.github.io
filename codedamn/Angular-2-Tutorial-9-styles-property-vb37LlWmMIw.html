and welcome to you're probably ninth
angular2 tutorial I don't remember
numbers very well so in this tutorial
we'll be looking at how to add some CSS
to your components and obviously you
won't take a site like this live on
internet you don't want to see the users
see just a static HTML page kind of so
we'll be adding some Styles to this page
to modify it a little bit but I'll be
just showing you how to add Styles you
can just do the basic styling or so
so what I'll make use of is Styles
property and I would write some Styles
inside an area well I don't know why
they put that it's at an area when they
can actually have a string literal right
here so what I'm gonna do is let's just
say if I want to style this h1 tag
somehow so I'm gonna say h1
text-align:center and be tagged as let's
just say background black color white
why not let's just take a look at the
browser as you can see the styles are
applied but if you take a closer look in
the Dom tree you can see that some of
the attributes have been added by
angular automatically so just keep a
look at these ng ghost ng-content things
right there so if I kind of just get rid
of this Styles at all then again save my
file you can see that there are no such
attributes like ng Coast and ng content
so why the heck in the world would
angular add these attributes when I am
styling these tags well consider this
let's just say I don't have
it's h1 tag not only in this component
but I also have that in my movies
component so let's just say I have
something like top movies trending
well now let's just reload well as you
can see both of these are h1 but
actually what happens is that my styles
are only applied to this this h1 and the
reason is that because the stock movies
trending h1 is not a component of my
shop
so these Styles you can say are
basically scoped so they are scoped that
means that they would be applied only to
a particular controller so if you just
take a look in the Dom tree you can see
that the styles are still in the head
but how they are scoped is that angular
automatically adds some of the tags to
the different components it finds so for
example this h1 is styled a text align
of center but the only H ones which have
been you know assigned this properties
the ones which have the attribute energy
content are gone I don't know what that
means but that's some sort of mapping
that this is my controller number one so
this should be styled only this one
should be styled and nothing else so
that's how basically you include styles
and again you can have some styles right
here for this controller and similarly
you would make use of backticks
and you can write like if you have
another h1 here yes we have so I can
write it just like text-align:right and
as you can see that this one and this
one are both h1 tags but they don't have
anything in common so if you pay close
attention you can actually find the
pattern and this attribute naming so you
can see that this is number one
then this is number two might be that if
you have another module with another
component that might be number three and
then so on and so forth then we have
this energy goes to the root element
maybe something like that
so you can figure that out and that's
how you basically add styles and it is
scoped so as you can see and you can
actually you know you see that this
these two style tags are added you know
under one another so you can actually
make use of the shadow Dom or basically
force the angular tool to make use of
the shadow Dom and if you guys don't
know what that is then don't worry we'll
be probably covering that in the next
tutorial and just to give a glimpse of
what shadow Dom is that it is like if
you have ever made use of input type
text place to placeholder is equal to
some text then if you have ever visited
the storm tree with I don't know there's
some sort of setting right here and able
shadow Dom I'll just take a look there
where that setting is and once you have
done that and you take a look here in
input type text it's placeholder
something then you can actually expand
that input tag as well so that input tag
contains some sort of shadow Dom so
that's what we refer by shadow Dom so
we'll be taking a look at that in the
next tutorial so yeah so that's all for
this one and don't forget to subscribe
