your eighth PHP tutorial in which will
be discussing about something called
conditional statements in PHP in our
condition statements are not limited to
PHP only conditional statements actually
means statements which are used when you
want to compare something so if is a
conditional statement which is present
in PHP so using if you could actually
compare for equality or non equality or
for greater than or less than or
whatever you like in PHP so let's see if
I have a variable number one and this is
hundred let's say I variable number two
this is 100 as well so if I say that if
number 1 is equal to 100 now one thing
you have to make sure is that you write
double equal to while you are comparing
something because double equal to would
compare a thing whereas a single equal
to would assign that thing so if you do
like if number 1 equals 200 then what
would actually happen is that number one
would get the value of 100 even if from
let's save this was 200 then number one
would get the value of 100 and then
obviously since 100 is not 0 therefore
this bracket would evaluate to true and
the scored block would run anyways so
this literally means that you are not
performing any check at all because this
would always run so make sure to use
double equal to sign whenever you are
comparing two things so if number 1 is
equal to hundred then I want to enter in
this code block then if number two is
also equal to hundred then echo
Wow both are hundred if this is not the
case then echo Wow only one is hundred
now can you guess what would be the
output when i refresh the browser well
the output would be whoa well that was
embarrassing
whoa okay so at the first place only it
was not hundred so it never entered this
block so let's reload this okay so now
the original question did you guess that
correctly that both of these lines would
echo eat well yep both of these would
echo because number one is hundred okay
we entered this block number two is
hundred okay we entered this block PHP
executed the statement send this to
browser came to next line came to next
line executed this one send to the
browser Radwell as well so if you want
that only this execute and not this what
we can do is we can place the statement
inside something called else now else
means that if the statement is not true
then do this or basically it actually
makes sense that if this then do this
else do this so we could actually have
multiple comparisons in a statement so
let's see if I have number one as once
you two three and number two as 1024 so
if i can i can say that if number 1 is
greater than 100 then if number 2 is
less than let's make this 26 number 2 is
less than number one then actually we
could compare variables as well if you
didn't know that so if number 2 is less
than number one then wow just let's just
a co bao because i don't have any
message in mind right now so while one
else Wow too so when I reload this we
get only one because both of these are
true because it never entered elder else
Clause because this condition evaluated
to true then the PHP run this command
then it came here then it directly came
here are right here at this point
so that was about if and else and
actually this is not just limited to
numbers you could actually compare
string as well so let's say hello meho
hello meho so i can make use of number 1
equal to number two then echo Wow let's
reload this and you see that it goes
well but what if I don't want these two
to be equal then I want the school blog
to run well we could actually do
something like if number 1 is equal to
number two then this thing else this but
this catalogue awkward so we have one
more operator which is if number 1 is
not equal to number two the attention
the ! is before the equal to sign but
here only one equal to is required well
there is a case when you could actually
use to but for now we only require one
so if number 1 is not equal to number
two then echo Wow and this would not be
a good on the screen because for now it
is equal to one another so you see the
black output so this was the first
conditional statement the if else
actually there should be if else so this
is the first conditional statement which
you have right here and there's one more
the switch one which will be doing in
the next tutorial so that's it for this
tutorial and don't forget to subscribe
