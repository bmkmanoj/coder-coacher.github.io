May Hill and welcome to another I think
its 26th ionic tutorial I'm not sure and
in this tutorial I would be finally
showing you how you can build a signed
apk which is actually the kind of apk
you would be able to put on Play Store
and would share with other people as
well the process from ionic 1 is pretty
much similar and not really pretty much
but exactly kind of because you just
need to create a key store and sign the
apk with your custom key store and use
RSA as the encryption algorithm and all
that beautiful stuff now the thing with
this is that once you sign your apk do
not lose that particular key store and
that but you could have key because if
you lose that then you would not be able
to update your apk on the Play Store
because even if you have the source code
with you but not the key on through
which you sign your apk then Google
would not accept that thing so to
generate a signed apk what we need to do
is write key store Jen key we and you
would find this full complete line in
the description so if you want to check
that out you can check that out and I
will just paste this on the code now
form as well so now you can copy and
paste this key store and then your key
store name let's just name it go down
demo dot key store allies let's just
keep it same
key algorithm is Rs safe key sizes 2 4 8
bits and the validity is just make it
anything you like all right Alice's keep
it 2000 which is what is referenced in
the documentation and that our key store
is not found and the reason for that is
because I'm stupid
it is not key store it is key tool and
let's just enter some key tool keystore
password there we go um a hole Mohan go
down what the hell was the first
question that yep yeah let's just keep
the password same and you can see that
our key store is generated so what do
you want to do next is actually generate
an apk which is the production apk but
unsigned because right now you can see
that the apk which we are generating is
in debug mode is not compressed and the
goal is all not the office cater and all
that stuff so it slows down a little bit
so you can speed things up if you create
an production apk right so we're gonna
do
ionic cordova build this would be a
realties android APK right let us just
build the production APK now mind you
that this one would be a production apk
but this one would be unsigned so we
need to sign it what we did in the first
step is we generated the key through
which we are going to sign this thing
and by the way if you face any kind of
problem in keytool or in jar sign or
which you're gonna make use of in a
moment to sign the apk that means that
your JD is not perfectly configured and
probably if it wasn't configured
properly then you might not be able to
even run your application on phone for
testing purposes so you need to install
JDK so with that being said and our apk
is generated you can see this is Android
release unsigned apk so let's just go to
Android sorry
platforms Oh social login platforms
Android build outputs apk and here we
are we can see that we have Android
debug from some past build and this is
the release one okay so the next thing
is we're gonna make use of jar signer
and you do not need to really remember
all this because I am myself seeing this
from the documentation and I will just
leave that thing for you to copy pasted
directly in the description so jar
signer algorithm as a chip one with RSA
digest algorithm is RSA and this is
actually sha-1 and then we specify our
key store which was go down dot key
store I believe let me see where it is
go down demo dot key store for demo dot
key store and the apk which we have as
Android release unsigned and there we go
so the passphrase for key store was
okay so our key store is not here
obviously it is a couple of directories
back so we would have one directory -
directory three directory for that tree
site directory this gets us here here
here here or rather why not we just got
the crap and do desktop so she'll log in
and like this and hit enter okay
and obviously this should be our Elias
name which we said and that was pretty
much the same thing so one more try I
believe we have a typo here well one
last try and holy smokes we are here so
our apk is signed now we can pretty much
name this signed apk ready to bang bang
or anything you like and you are ready
to upload this on Play Store or maybe
even distribute it so yeah that is
pretty much it for this tutorial
and if you liked it then please don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching and at the last I would just
like to give a shout out to the first
bait Rhian I have and that is job burner
so thank you job burner for your support
and I'll see you then in some other
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
