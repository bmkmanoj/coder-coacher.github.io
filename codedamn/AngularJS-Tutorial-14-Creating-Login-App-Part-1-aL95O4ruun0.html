your 14th angularjs tutorial and this
tutorial will be starting out with a
basic login form kind of miniseries in
angularjs I just realized that there are
many more things you can learn but you
know I just can't go over each and every
specific thing and you know just tell
you what that does and how that works so
we'll be working on with some web apps
and as we go together then I'll just
teach you what everything is doing and
how everything is working so in this way
you will be able to learn more and
quickly so let's get started so to give
you a basic information about a login
form it's just like something like you
can see an input field which accepts
username and passwords and it would just
validate your credentials and would
redirect you a specific page if you're
good in chill smash
otherwise you know it would just show
you an error box all right
so for the time being let's keep the ng
view and let's create a new page let's
say this one as login dot HTML let's
create a quickly create a form
it login or HTML I'll just say ID
okay excuse me guys someone rang the
doorbell all right where were we
yeah so we were talking about creating a
forum and let's give it an idea of my
login and that's pretty much it we don't
need any method because you know we are
doing everything that client-side so
that's where the input type text' name
user name and ID same as well and I'll
just copy this again with a break
all right so you're good to go now we
have got the login page ready and I like
to hook it up inside the controller dot
GS so let's see I want when it's at the
home page the template should be login
and when it's at the dashboard
I want the users to be redirected to
dashboard not HTML now the problem is
that I can authenticate users to their
specific places but a user can directly
access the dashboard without going to
this page now this is the problem with
this routing now I'll come back to this
when we will actually complete our whole
application with just the security issue
so let's say another page when ever or I
guess I can just simply show everything
on the login page itself so now we need
something as a module so I'll just
create
another tip here I'll just say
did I just say a module now this should
be a controller sorry so we need to
create a controller and let's create a
controller let's say login controller
and let's just fill it with a scope
right now we'll add with our
requirements
and let's see
scope dot summit not scope dot summit we
would create this function and this
would fire whenever the form is
submitted so let's read school blood
summit function and I guess I should
just grid everything here inside in this
place right now so that you guys are
just not confused so give me two minutes
and I'll make everything clear to you
all right so here's our button
or I'll just go ahead with a button
and I'll attach I'll bind basically a
click event with this button and if you
remember from your JavaScript tutorials
what we need to do is to attach a click
event we used to create an on click now
this would perfectly work fine but since
our function this function is inside a
controller and it's not a global and I
want angular to take interfere in this
matter
therefore I would use angular's own
directive of the click even so ng click
would fire just like the JavaScript on
click did but this would pass the
control to your view this controller
right here log in control log and
control same things alright so
we need to give this as ngmodel
username remember that we need to get
the value of all these two password and
I guess we could just get rid of the
name one you know I'm used to add this
because name one is required to get data
at the server side PHP so okay
so let's say I'll create our you name is
equal to scope dot username just for
clarity let's keep them int variable
scope dot password otherwise you could
just simply access them with this these
things as well
now let's say if scope dot username
equals something which you have to add
as valid credentials and scope dot
password equals admin as well
whoa Hardman as well then I want
location dot pad and inside the
parentheses what I'll do is and supply
here dash board
all right so I'll explain in a minute
what we are doing here
okay so what we've done so far is we
just created a simple form right here
inside a controller inside they've
actually I could give it around only but
leave it now now I have banded the
username and password to these two input
fields to grab them inside the
controller nothing much new we have done
this all done this before then I've
created a button and attached and even
listener to these this button inside the
angular and remember that this form
right here is never submitted this is
technically never summited we are just
grabbing the information entered in the
form and processing it with angularjs
because if it were submitted then we had
to supply something in the action and do
like return false in the JavaScript to
prevent the browser from redirecting at
this path
all right so now this location thing
this location is another thing in
angularjs which helps you do you know
just locate inside the URL change the
hash values so instead of doing
something like this window dot location
dot hash equals dashboard this would
also work but we have got a better
better alternative to this in angular
and Dallas location docpath dashboard
and this would this do not require any
hash because but automatically knows
that we are working with anglers so this
has to do has to be hashed so as to
prevent the page from loading all right
enough of talks and let's see this works
or not
so this browser
and
let's go to 14 dot html' and as you can
see here angular just did an untaxed
request here to this page and whoa I
guess that was not visible all right so
you see there wasn't a Jack's request so
first of all I'll just try with the
wallet credentials because we haven't
said validation for invalid ones well
this to admin and admin login and we do
not have the dashboard or HTML otherwise
this code works just fine so let's go
ahead and just create a blank dashboard
or HTML welcome user simple as that
reload this again
reload admin
admin enter enter would work
alright so chrome offering me to save
the password no never
so now you see that we are redirected to
the dashboard one and it saves me
welcome user but the problem is that I
can simply go to this URL without
actually login logging in into the home
page so to fix that what we need is some
conditional routing and I can just
simply specify a lot wrong stuff so this
would just add validation for everything
else so now yeah I was talking about
conditional routing now conditional
routing is something which would allow
you to set up conditional route you know
conditional routing just as the name
suggests would allow you to put some
conditions and if they are matched then
only redirect the user to that
particular page or URL otherwise through
them wherever you want so we would be
looking at conditional routing in the
next tutorial and thank you for watching
this one and I'll see you then good bye
and take care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
