Mei hole and in this tutorial I'm gonna
show you real quick how to make use of
get and set in front method members and
not metal members actually just method
and I tread and what they essentially do
is that they actually define what you
have to return or what you have to said
it's kind of like object defined
property which we have in lower versions
of JavaScript which is currently
actually running as well this getters
and basically accessors are you know a
property of a feature of es 5 and above
so anyways let's just create a rectangle
class and make some sites l1 number and
l2 number right and then actually this
should be a semi got alright and then
construct your l1 number l2 the number
right and I say this dot l1 is l1 the
star l2 is l2 now what I can do instead
is I can have an area here as a number
and I can say this not area is either l1
or l2 or this total one times they
started l2 now this approach has a
couple of problems the first one is that
if I create like my awesome rectangle is
new rectangle and then party like 10 and
20 the first problem is that user can
set the area I don't want that
because the area would be automatically
determined by the sides user person the
second problem is that whenever I make
changes to my sides like if I say mouse
from rectangle dot and wanted something
like that and now if I console on area
it doesn't show me the correct one
because area was said and constructor
constructor method right so
to fix this what we can do is actually
we can create a method and set it to
just get ruh
so once we have like get area as a
method and I say return this dot l1
times this dot L - now what happens is
that if I now do console dot log my
awesome rectangle area the first thing
this is not a method anymore because we
are using a get property or you know
using this method as a getter right the
second thing is that since this is
dynamic this returns this times l1 times
this times this dot l2 it would work
even if I change my sides or you know
whatever inside code and then if I tried
reflected it would just work now if I
build this you would see okay so you
would see that accessors are only
available when targeting a Muscat five
and you can just fix that by creating a
type script configuration file here and
just setting your compile level or you
know compliation to es5 or something so
this is not kind of an error for now
this is just a warning
so it just compiled perfectly and you
can see that right here we are making
use of object not defined property
because that's how we define getters and
setters like that and since it does not
have any set function so doing something
like my awesome dot area then doesn't
have any effect right so it doesn't do
anything if you set it to something so
that is how you pretty much make use of
getters and types with and that's all
for this tutorial and the next one I
will just show you how to set how to
make use of setters and that's all for
this one and if you liked it then don't
