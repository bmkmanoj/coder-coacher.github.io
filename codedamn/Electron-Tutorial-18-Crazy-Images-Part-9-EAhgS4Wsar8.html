Mei hole and welcome to your 18th
tutorial for electron framework and in
this tutorial we're going to do a little
bit of CSS and add the buttons or
reuploading or re starting the app and
saving the image right so what we can do
is inside preview window we can see that
this is divide the image preview right
and you can say here useful button and
we can pretty much pay the button like
let's say change and save what we had in
original and stay ok so now actually I
want to change colors a little bit for
our header we have the background as
black let's just make it 3 5 3 5 3 5 and
yeah let's just take a look what do we
have in here electron dot right so we
open a file we get these two buttons
we're just going to take a look at that
later we can actually edit this dumb
button as well this looks extremely ugly
right now so we can say that the
background is actually this one and its
color is slider one right and we can
stay on wait
bold okay looks fine dot go back and
we're going to replace this now let's
just quickly do the change and save
stuff so we're going to search for
change and inside useful buttons or we
can
is a rather for the preview we have flex
direction of row right so we can do for
useful buttons as a aligned items align
self stretch and I guess we're gonna
make use of column here instead of row
but that would probably okay so let's
just break this code so where we are
right here we are gonna copy this tank
for preview this code for moist control
we need this task column we do not need
this now so we can say that we do not
want this or rather let's just reload
this for once
II won and there looks like I did the
wrong one column should be here instead
of there right there there we go alright
so finally right now we can just go to
header or not really header main content
review useful buttons we can stay
aligned self stretch display flag color
wide and for the dead inside them we can
say that
justify contest and for a line-item
Center adding 10 pixels 20 pixels margin
10 pixel background again we can't give
anything you want where this is hash
three five two five three five and color
white could be done cursor:pointer and
there we are so there we go for this
thing right and then finally what we
just need to do is pretty much say it if
and we click Change and for this div ng
click Save so we can go to our script
and finally say scope dot change
function which stays location third path
is hope and scope dot save as a function
where the magic goes right so we're
going to need location here as well so
yeah if we take a look now we open a
finally one we set the brightness we set
the contrast we then be I don't know see
ya
okay and now I don't like it I'm going
to change it so I go back to the main
page and select e to and we're getting a
new file so that is not very much how
the logic for change would go and for
the save I'm going to do that in the
next video because that is going to be a
bit tricky and they will see how we can
implement that so that's all for this
one and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
