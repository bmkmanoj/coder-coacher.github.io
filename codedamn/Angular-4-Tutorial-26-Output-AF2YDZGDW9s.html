May ho and welcome to your 26 tutorials
for angular in which you're going to
take a look at the output decorator and
how we can actually send some values
from the child component to the parent
component using event emitter in angular
and yes that is pretty much limited to
angular for now because that is actually
a part of node and it's not really a
will label as JavaScript so angular
makes use of even the meter or you can
also also make use of observables
something unless observables which we're
going to take a look at later on but
right now we're going to stick with even
the meter and make a use of one of its
method to send some data okay so now
first things first we need to write an
output like that and say something like
or we can just leave it and say let's
say my output value and you need to code
the output and the event emitter so what
we want to do is set this output value
to new event emitter and in this way
this output value would be a new event
emitter and now what I'm going to do is
with my output value I'm going to say
this does my output value dot M it now
what this Emmit would do is that it
would emit the value to the parent
component of the of this child component
which in our case is just the app
component so we can say any value
something like hello from the child and
then finally we can listen for this
emitter inside our parent component we
do not really need to subscribe to this
event or do anything like that to listen
to that we just have to create this
method which would be my output value
which just matches this same emitter
name so we can say something like not
here my output value and console.log got
some
texts and how do we actually listen for
this well to listen for this what we
need to do is just right here where
you're passing this you can register for
it
my output value is an actually my
creative confusion so we can just change
this to Austin method right there so
this value right here my output value
the child component even a meter value
should match if you are not passing
anything in the parentheses so I'm going
to say this is awesome method and
finally we can pass in the event object
so we actually get the data which is
being sent by the user from this emit
method okay so what the heck is going on
here well firstly we defined this output
decorator with my output value as a new
event emitter now this my output value
allows us to emit some values to the
parent component in ng on in it which is
just fired after the component is
initialized we emit a value of hello
from the child and there we are already
listening for this particular value we
are already subscribing or not really
subscribing but just like we used to
accuse of square brackets for echoing we
are using circular brackets for events
and we are listening for this event
my output value and once this is said I
want to call this awesome method with
the event object passed in it now for
the awesome method what we are doing is
that we get this event and we can
finally say something like this and if
we take a look you can see that we get
hello from the child got some text right
here which is what we were expecting so
yes that is how pretty much you would
make use of an output decorator to work
with even emitters and actually with
your angular application and if you're
not cleared about this don't stress it a
lot because we're going to develop a
simple application with both of them in
use soon so it will just clear all the
things a little bit more or maybe you
can just watch the tutorial again it
might help you to understand how this
out
with an input even the meters are
walking and again you can make use of
something like this and then say my bad
output just in case you want to have a
different variable name it will still
work just fine just like usual right so
yeah that's all for this one and if you
liked it then please don't forget
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
