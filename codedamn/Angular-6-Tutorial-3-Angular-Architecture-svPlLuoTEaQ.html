May ho and welcome to your third angular
tutorial angular six basically does not
matter angular is same as angular six
five four whatever you want
so in this tutorial what we're gonna do
is take a look at the overview of what
we have done about the file structure
and a little bit concepts related to
little things we're gonna see in those
files so let's get started
so in this with you we're gonna cover
some of the things like file structure
then how angular actually enters into
your application actually enters into
your source code how browser sees
angular then we'll see how angular is
bootstrapping then we'll come to modules
something known as modules which is the
core foundation of angular then
decorators now I mind you that we're not
gonna go a lot deep into these things
right now because it may overwhelm you
but we're gonna come to these stuffs
later on in the code because they're
very important to fully understand okay
so yeah let's get started so you can see
that I have my code already in place and
if we take a look in the file structure
you can see it's quite messy actually if
we even remove normal use folders there
are so many things going on in source
folder assets environment files some
typescript files as well typescript is
pretty much just JavaScript only it's
the in the hands 2 version of JavaScript
a better one so you don't need to worry
about that if you don't know that what
typescript is then what we have is some
sort of configuration files and yeah
that's pretty much it so we do not need
to understand each and every file right
now we're gonna understand all those
files as we move along with the series
and do things which require those
particular files those particular set of
files and yep so starting from the top
we can leave this e to e folder this is
just for testing you probably never use
this at least in the series then inside
source folder what we have is this app
folder well it's a folder you can see
that consists of component of CSS file
which is blank HTML file then there's
spec file which we can leave for now
then there's a type script component
actual file which consists of a
decorator we're going to come to that
soon and then a module file ok so so far
looks kind of simple we have a module a
module basically is just a way to split
your code into some independent files
which
actually means something on their own
for example a module in your application
could be for example let's say you're
creating a YouTube downloader then a
module in your application could be a
module which let's say fetches the
downloadable links from some sort of API
right so that module can function on its
own so you can separate that piece of
code and you'll call that thing as a
module so you can use that particular
module in some other application for
example you can use the same module as a
pad of mobile app you can use the same
module as a part of so let us say a
desktop or web application and so on but
I'm here what we mean by module is
basically just splitting up the code
into smaller pieces so that it's easier
to organize right so this is the module
file which is the app module which is
the route module which is required of
one at least one module is required in
angular then what we have as our entry
point is this index dot HTML file and
actually this main dot t-- s is the
entry file right so what this index dot
HTML file is pretty much you can see
that it just consists of basic HTML what
we have here but with the exception that
we have something special here root now
we have this a crude what it does is
that it gives angular a place to start
working so whatever angular do it would
do inside this thing so Apple just gives
it a place to start working right so
then we have this main door PS file
which is pretty much the file which
actually
initializes your angular project right
so if we take a look at this main door
ts file then what we have is that we are
importing a bunch of modules here from
angular platform itself then we are
importing the app or dual which we need
to import because we need to bootstrap
this now bootstrapping pretty much just
means your kick-starting it
initializing it so if the environment of
production is true which is the
environment file now this would run when
your angular project is running in say
production mode because then angular
needs to perform certain optimizations
because it's running in production now
performance matters not code clarity
right so that's true then we just do
some performance boosts then we are
bootstrapping the application with this
root module you can name this whatever
you want but it's a convention angular
CLI gives you add module so we we're
gonna keep it that way all right that is
done and then we have is invert the
assistant polyfills is just some
polyfills for older browsers you do not
need to worry about that polyfill just
means that if the browser does not
support a particular functionality which
is provided natively by the JavaScript
engine or by the browser then polyfill
wood will beat the JavaScript core which
mimics that particular functionality so
it's not required for us then styles or
CSS is global style sheet file dest or
CSS we can leave for now and these are
some configuration files okay so if we
take a look we are done with this file
structured thing we are done with the
entry point of application which is this
main door ts file right
we bootstrap our application with this
add module this add module has declared
add component as one of its component
now again we're gonna come to components
later on in the series but what
components really mean what they mean
actually is that you can think about
components like let's see you have a
page then let's say let's see you have a
app a mobile app then in that app you
have a header right you need a header on
every
activity or every page of your mobile
right so what you're gonna do is you're
gonna separate that into a component now
that component is reusable so basically
the use of components is to make code
reusable so if you have a piece of code
which is you can repeat a view a view
which you can repeat a lot of places can
be used as a component so right now
we're just making use of this app
component as main component and all the
components goes into these declarations
we're gonna talk about this decorator in
very deep I am later on the series but
right now I just remember this ng module
is the thing angular depends on so this
is the main thing and we have all our
components but the bootstrap our
application from this app component so
if you understand the flow main the TS
is the main file we bootstrap our module
module bootstraps the component
component runs this HTML file through
this template URL here and includes
these Styles listed here and acts on
this selector which is a brute which is
exactly what we have in our index dot
HTML file here right so everything I
hope everything make sense till now and
the next thing what we have is that we
have covered bootstrapping here we have
covered modules here we have covered
decorators not really but decorators
what they are is actually they just
provide a deep information to the class
or that is kind of a very vague
definition we're going to come to what
decorators exactly are in es7 later on
but for now you can just assume
decorators to be something which
decorate your class which provides some
additional information but does not
change the raw information of that
particular class or function or whatever
you decorate it with
right so you can see right here
component decorator this decorator
is decorating this class right here it's
not changing the class its decorating it
we're gonna come to that later don't
worry if you don't get it right now so
yeah that is pretty much it for this
tutorial and in the next tutorial we're
gonna probably see about decorators only
because I have seen a lot of people are
confused about what exactly a decorators
there's a way definition of decorators
going on in the market that they're just
used for decorating we're gonna go deep
into what exactly these decorators are
and how to actually work with them not
only an angular code but in your regular
JavaScript as well so that's all for
this one and see you then in the next
tutorial and one more thing if you like
