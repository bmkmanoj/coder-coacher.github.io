angularjs toriel and as you have noticed
that in the last toriel as well I was
using the file 35 dot HTML R and this
one as well I'm using file $35 HTML well
actually the last one was the default
tutorial but actually I said to you guys
that it was 30 50 I don't know how
happened somehow this file was already
there I don't know how it hopped into my
computer secretly NSA whatever the heck
it was but anyways actually I edited the
first few seconds of the previous video
as well to remove the part where I'm
saying thirty-fifth tutorials so as to
avoid the confusion but you know I'm a
terrible video editor I got a lot of
things wrong so anyway it's coming back
to the video tutorial let's just hide
this sidebar and let's take a look at
the problem I was telling you guys that
we would have so first of all let me
just open the browser window give me a
sec all right so here it is
there you go
okay so so what we need to do is we need
to do something right here because this
function is creating some problems so
obviously we need to track somehow that
which task we are operating on so if we
are editing this task we need to track
what this task is and to do that what we
have to do is I need to somehow get the
contents of this task and this function
and we can easily do that by just
writing one task dot task message which
we have been using all of these places
here so what it does is it will just
pass the current written task and
remember this this string right here is
the string which is before the edit and
I'll just make sure I'm seeing that
correct and if I just console.log this X
I'll reload as you can see this is toss
to space edited and it says undefined
because at the second time this is not
passed because at the second time this
function calls it and if I write message
here then let's see what happens edited
okay so both of the times it's saying
one of the same thing so okay so now
what we need to do next is I want to
console.log the position of the element
or basically this thing right here
you see so I want the task to position
at the same time when it is edited and
to do that what we can make use of is
the index of method in JavaScript
so let's try that out with this re right
here so let's just say school got tasks
dot index of X all right check that out
at the browser edited okay so it says
minus one and I would like to have scope
dot tasks as well in the console let's
reload again
edited and obviously that is because we
are making use of multiple RS so scope
dot tasks dot task message no that won't
work
I know yeah so no so we need a different
approach to get to the task and one
thing would be to I trade or the array
that would be a bad approach if you have
a small error because that won't consume
a lot of time so let's just try that out
by 0 is less than scope dot tasks dot
length I plus plus and if scope dot
tasks i dot task message I guess that
was it is X then obviously we have found
our element and what I want to do is
tasks i dot task message just update
this boy and with what to update this is
the event so event dot target dot now I
want to get the inner HTML and to do
that I can make use of inner text now
one thing you have to note is that when
this function is called the text is
already changed but this X and this
message contains the previous values I
better just rename this to message as
well so that it looks Cara nice alright
let's take a look now and what I'll just
cause a lot of things here store dock
tasks let's just add some more tasks
again all right
it says 11 to me and as you can see the
task is updated now the only thing we
need to do is to append to local storage
again so here you go
now we have local storage ready and are
we missing anything no I don't think we
are so let's just take a final look at
the application and see task 5 task 6
toy toy this one's done done I want this
to task for awesome buddy reload and as
you can see it works perfectly as it
should now what you can do to this
application or you can consider it as
your homework assignment I want you to
move all of these little tasks these
ones which are striped off at the bottom
when the user reloads the speech so
fetch them accordingly just like I have
and just make use of some JavaScript or
your thinking or whatever you want and
move these tasks the gray crash tasks at
the bottom so that the tasks which are
undone are shown first so that's kind of
your homework assignment you can say
that's all for this video series of this
mini series of adding a task and if
there is a next tutorial well I'm gonna
create one don't worry and in the next
tutorial we'll be looking at some more
awesome things in angularjs so that's
all for this tutorial and I'll see you
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you
