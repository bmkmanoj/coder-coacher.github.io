ninth bootstrap tutorial I'm a whole
Adam this tutorial will be looking at
more on grids which we started looking
in tutorial number three I guess yes so
we looked at the drill number three had
that how bootstrap divides your screen
into 12 equal columns are in this
tutorial we'll be looking at how you can
make use of that now grid in bootstraps
a very powerful feature to organize your
content on web pages easily and nicely
without any fuss going around so to get
started first of all we need a container
now this container what would into is it
would contain the crib now this can be
either a container or fluid container
and the fluid container what it would do
is it would just restrict your width of
the web page okay so now the next thing
you need is a row in your container not
this row what it would do is just like
gollum divides your agent 12 equal parts
all these row would contain would create
a kind of grid would complete the grid
and then it would provide some space for
every element okay Sony you need a room
and then what next you need is is a
column now pay attention here this class
call and this would accept two things
kind of so all of these classes whatever
you write a wild thing here are already
coded in bootstrap okay so now what
happens is this thing right here the
first star what it would take is it
would take the screen size for which you
are programming your dev to be now there
are many screen sizes like that of a
laptop or a tablet or a phone and for
all of those different devices you would
like to have different width of this tip
accordingly for example on a big screen
you might want three dates right here do
bo of 33 3333 percent will but on a
phone you would like or each of those
div to create do occupy one hundred
percent of the width on the screen so to
achieve that you can work here now to
begin with we have something called LG
which is de large and extra portions and
using that you can program for larger
desktops the design for the large and x
jobs and then we have sm for smaller
screen sizes like that of a phone then
we also have md and so on and so forth
so let's first of all try with LG now
all of this these styles would apply to
a screen size f I guess LG contain
screen size of greater than 1200 pixels
so if your screen size is greater than
1200 pixels the styles of call LG would
be applied ok now one thing you need to
know is is that I told you that
bootstrap divides your screen in 12
equal columns so the third parameter
what it is is it is the width of this
div or basically the number of columns
this tip will take it could be either
one or 12 or any number in between so
let's see if I say that this tip is five
ok and I write this this is a really
long text to see how long this there is
I'm just going to repeat that a bunch of
times and again I want it to be of
length 5 now one thing you need to know
is that these numbers right here in
every row should sum up to 12 and the
reason being is that each row no matter
how many rows you have in each row the
sum of all these numbers should be 12
because
ultimately the all the width of all the
columns occupied is 12 so if you have
one with one columns right here then you
need to have 12 now you can have these
different as words you can have this 3
and this one are six and even this one
has one and this one has 11 it's up to
you it's up to you you have to decide
which one looks best for your web page
for now I'm just having this these 2 45
and this one for two obviously since
five plus five plus two equals 12 let's
just reduce the text in this one and
let's just check this out on the browser
okay so we have got some interruptions
from this location bar so let's just
gotta get rid of this right now okay so
now you see that this div is occupying
these three dips are occupying the whole
screen because i had this container of
fluid that what is happening is this if
i consider the ratio of these three
widths then these the ratio comes out to
be 5 is 25 is to do so if this is Carol
let's just assume that if this is 5
pixels wide this is 5 pixels wide that
this one is two pixels wide and if you
see under the hood then you see that
this the call LG 5 contains a width of
forty one point six six six six six six
six seven percent and this is defined
only for devices having a width of 1200
pixels so you see that thing plays an
important part there okay now what
happens if you are on a mobile phone now
you want this to have our your own width
but let's just say if you want this to
still remain at this ratio for around
seven sixty bits
the width of a tablet now right now you
see that this immediately falls to our
separate lives because you don't have
any style defined under 1200 pixels not
for that what you have to do is you have
to code for a medium version now for
that just right call md and your width
the new with here now this style would
be applied only when the device with
matches this medium size this will not
be applied for the larger screens so
let's see if I say that this one is
reduced to three this one is reduced to
four and by doing simple math I guess
this one is four plus three seven and
twelve minus seven is five so we need
this to be 55 plus 49 and 312 so yeah
that should probably work and if I
reload this and resize this again so you
see that when I bring it down to our our
1190 pixels then the ratio changes
drastically so previously it was 5 is 25
is 22 now this is what this is 3 is 24
is 25 knots just 3 this is 4 this is 5
the similarly this ratio is defined only
till nine hundred ninety two pixels I
guess yeah so beyond that we have some
other classes and then so on and so
forth you can decide design your web
page so that was a basic introduction to
how grid works in bootstrap and how you
can create grids now in future tutorials
will be creating some more awesome good
lives and grids as well which will be a
lot more complex than these ones so
that's gonna it for this tutorial add
