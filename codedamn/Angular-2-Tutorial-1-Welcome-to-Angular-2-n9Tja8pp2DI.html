your very first tutorial of angular 2
well this is the hot thing going on
right now and this is the future so
angular is angular 2 is still in beta
but it's open for developers to code and
try out their applications well we have
done angular 1 that is the angularjs the
traditional one
but this angular 2 it is a whole nother
story this is the newest MV star
framework from Google which means Model
View whatever which is the star which
that means whatever so what this
framework is all about is that angular
guys the people at Google they started
from the scratch down and coded this
thing right there this angular 2
framework which is on angular dot IO and
as it says that it is now in beta so
this is available for the developers to
test against any functionality or any
bugs they found and they can put that
and all that stuff well what this
angular 2 would do is that as you can
see down here it says that it is fast it
is mobile compatible it is flexible you
can run angular on server as well and
you can develop Android applications
using ionic framework and angular just
supports that so here are some basics
we'll be covering all of that stuff and
yeah so angular 2 is basically very very
easy than angular 1 our it is SuperDuper
easy to understand and don't just you
know just if you look at this the
scanner looks like scary syntax and all
that new stuff but don't worry this is
super duper easy if you have done ECMO
scripts six of which I have tutorials as
well so angular brings in support for
the ACMA script 6 which is the newest
java script for the way well that active
script 6 is inside is in the beta
version as well so you can Tex
like that to run on your websites but we
have got something known as the
typescript compiler and some bunch of
others as well so we'll be making use of
that to work with angular 2 so we have a
lot to do in angular 2 and most of the
things have changed but the basic core
understanding is from angular 1 as only
so if you are just you know just
watching this video and you have no idea
what the heck is going on what is
angular then I guess you can stick with
me for angular 2 because you don't
actually need to know about angular 1 to
learn angular 2 but if you know angular
1 then that would be like you know just
easy for you to just pick up the
concepts for angular 2 well yeah so
angular brings in a lot of new things
and I'm super duper excited to work on
this web series so we'll be starting off
with angular terrible program in the
next tutorial and I'm also going to show
you how to set this development
environment all of that what the CES is
these TS files and all that interesting
stuff very soon so that's all was the
story --all and I see you then real soon
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
