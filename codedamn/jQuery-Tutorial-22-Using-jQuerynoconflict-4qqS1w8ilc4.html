jQuery tutorial in which we'll be
learning about a special thing called
jQuery no conflict now many times when
you're working on some big projects then
not only work with jQuery but a ton of
other libraries as well so one such
library we have is prototype nodejs
now what happens is sometimes there's a
conflict that design dollar who should
use that and which library commands are
you actually executing so for example
let's say I don't have a script actually
ready right now
because I'm not that much in prototype
tertius but
let's say we have God prototype torches
let's assume I don't have it right here
but let's assume and prototype Dutchess
has some of its methods starting from a
dollar sign and I told you earlier that
where's the script yeah so let's say
prototype Dutchess also has a dollar
sign and I told you that donor stands
for jQuery but prototype in its own
library has defined the dollar sign as
prototype or any other variable so what
happens is now right now what I am doing
here is when we are using just a jQuery
one so it meant the same thing but now
JavaScript is confused that what
substitution it should use for this
dollar sign and this sometimes create
conflicts so in some instances you would
get the check very good running usually
and in other instances you won't so I've
got a couple of fixes for you for this
and let's see what they are
first of all we have a method jQuery dot
no conflict now this method right here
would allow you to substitute any of
your own variable with this dollar sign
so let's say if I create variable dollar
my JQ and I give it a value of jQuery
dot no conflict so now I could
technically use this variable right here
instead of my dollar sign just the
dollar sign and here's the window and if
I reload this I get the inert box and I
got the alert box because this code was
considered valid so that's how jQuery
got no conflict work now other thing we
could use is to pass a function as
argument as jQuery so let's say you have
got a function my jQuery good and let's
say in the argument I pass a sign dollar
and down here I would just do body
toward hide our body dot show or
whatever you want to do with jQuery and
all that blah blah blah stuff
right here I just simply write jQuery so
it would not cause any conflict right
now document that ready function and
what I'll do is once our code is ready
my jQuery and in the parameter I would
pass jQuery as the argument now this
dollar sign would when this function
would be called then the Staller sign
would be automatically substituted by
the shaker variable which has got a very
special meaning because it's a
constructor function so this code right
here is literally same as replacing each
of this dollar sign with the jQuery
keyword so you could use either of these
this would be much cleaner if you prefer
or you could also make an anonymous call
of function passing jQuery directly to
it so these were a couple of methods you
could use to avoid jQuery conflicts with
some other libraries which are using
similar symbols to work with their own
prototypes and their own methods and
properties and that's it for this
tutorial and I'll see you then next time
