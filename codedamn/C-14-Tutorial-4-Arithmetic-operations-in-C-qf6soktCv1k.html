forward C++ tutorial in which we'll be
talking about automatic operations on
C++ now automatic operations as you
might think are just simply adding
numbers subtracting numbers multiplying
numbers dividing numbers and so on so
let me quickly show you a simple example
let's say I have a variable E and I said
it equal to 10 and yes I guess I forgot
to tell you that you could declare a
variable and initialize a variable in
one single line you don't need to do
like int a and then a equals to 10 this
would just work perfectly okay so the
next thing we have is be variable with
20 now I'll see out a plus B and what it
would give me as output is 30 as
expected because 10 plus 20 equals 30
now let's say I want a minus B now I
guess what happen is I'll get I
understand which is true and since it is
a integer data type it could store
negative values as well so we would be
talking about only positive value data
type soon but for now let's just talk
about integers now let's say I do see
out a star B and I run the program you
see we get 200 which is correct C out a
by B what is your guess what we get when
we do a by B now traditionally what we
should get is 0.5 but from the last
tutorial if you remember I told you guys
that and C++ the integer datatype
would just extract out the integer type
and
threw away the decimal part so what we
will get is this let's just it out so
you see that because zero which is
essentially not true because a by B is
not technically zero and to fix that
what I told you guys is to change the
data type to float but we have another
cleaner way to do that and that is
called typecasting which we would be
discussing in some future tutorial but
not right now
now one thing I need to talk about guys
is we have one more operator in C++ and
C which is not a kind of mathematical
operator but it's very useful and that
is the mod now this percentage symbol
over the key five on your keyboard on
PCs would actually give you the
remainder when in number right here here
would be divided by a number here what I
mean is that if I do B mod a we did as B
mod a now this means that whenever B
that is 20 is divided by 10 what is the
remainder store it inside C so if I do
and see right here C out the C then
obviously we would get 0 as output
because when 20 is divided by 10 the
question is 2 and the remainder is 0 but
let's just change it to 21 now what are
your guesses what would be the output
the output would be what the reason is
that when 21 is divided by 10 we get 20
as the part inside the divisor which we
subtract from 21 and that leaves us with
1 which is the remainder so the modulus
is kind of special thing in programming
languages and it is we often use
in your real-life projects as well and
in competitive programming as well so
you should just know about that so
that's it for this tutorial about
automatic operations and we'll be doing
a lot more in the future tutorials so
till then stay tuned with me don't
forget to subscribe thank you for
watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
