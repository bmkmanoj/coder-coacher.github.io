May ho and welcome to your 11th
typescript tutorial in which I'm gonna
show you what function overloading is in
typescript and basically why do we need
that at all because actually you
wouldn't need that if you code really
nice and directly in JavaScript but
typescript does allow you to just
document how your function overloading
might look like and if you're coming
from background like C++ or Java then
you might already know what overloading
is but if you don't know that
well overloading is like calling a
function with different sort of
arguments right so overloading is very
useful in you know a lot of libraries
which are based on the languages and
overloading is extensively used in Java
and if you just do Android programming
then there's an extensive use of
overwriting functions and then
overloading methods of classes and you
know mainly in functions which involve
like drawing on the canvas or you know
other animated functions so there's kind
of a lot of use of overloading functions
but in JavaScript what happens is that
JavaScript is a dynamic type language
it's not static type so your compiled
JavaScript doesn't know that you want to
call this overloaded method instead of
the other one so typescript what it does
is this just pretty much provides you a
layer of ensuring that your code which
is compiled is properly you know coded
you are not calling a function with that
particular arguments which you don't
have as overloaded so that's a straw bit
here and just start without code so
let's say I want to create a function
where the like area of quadrilateral
right so now
could happen is that lets say user can
pass sides like just a single digit
right so this means that user is
probably trying to get the area of
square right then what could happen is
that user could pass the three the two
sides as well which could possibly mean
that this is a rectangle and then lets
us take another case in which user
passes all the four sides right
something like this so this would be a
trapezium right so you know we're just
restricting our example to these three
cases you can see that we do not have
any call to third you know a third in
just three arguments right so what
happens right now is that if we created
the normal way then if I call it with
three arguments which would be
technically invalid for our code but
even typescript wouldn't show that so
overloading just kind of provides a
layer of security above that that you
don't call a function which is not an
overloading definition so how we
actually overload a function well to do
that what you need to do is you just
need to declare this header of this
function multiple times
right so the safe function area of
quadrilateral and then let us say this
is side one odd number then this could
be side one number than side two number
right and then finally we could have
something like side three number and
side four number now again once you're
done with this you actually need to
write the main definition of your
function and this is the one which would
be actually used in York
by a JavaScript code and not all of
these things right so right here I'm
gonna say the same thing
side one number side to number side
three number side for number right let's
just make the marshal okay so now what
happens is that we now need to check
manually if the side to side three side
for was you know undefined or not so if
side 2 is equal to undefined you can
just make you the funda final like void
0 which was used by your compiled
JavaScript it's kind of same and site 3
is equal to undefined you know you can
just apply them side 1 is equal to side
2 equal to side 3 are actually you
should have read and done that the
opposite way so you know that is pretty
much how you actually implement this
overloading so okay let me just show you
that so we have the site to Jean define
side three then define and side 4 is
undefined then I want the side to side
three to be equal to side one because
I'm pretty sure that it won't be
undefined because it's not optional
right and then else if side three is
undefined and side 4 is undefined as
well now this this one right here is our
square case right this one right here is
our rectangle case right so here what
I'm gonna do is say side three is equal
to
I don't know site one I guess on site
two is equal to side side for I guess
slide 4 is equal to side - I guess ok so
now the for the trapezium we already do
have all the inputs so now we are ready
with all of our sites so if it is like
this then I know it is a square then
return side one times side - or actually
we should have kept this as parameter or
something so that it makes sense with
four sites because for evil yeah we just
need two sides for rectangle and one
side for square but anyways so right
here we can just do side one time side
two and for trapezium I don't really
remember the formula with all forgiven
sides it's actually H a plus B by 2 for
the vertical height given but I guess
you need to calculate it then if it's
not given so let's just return negative
1 or in this one for now and if I
compile this code well let's see what
okay so build systems and walking right
now okay so I restarted the sublime text
and looks like it's working now I hit
enter and here you can see that it's
pretty cool but what the heck
I guess the boot these codes are same
why they're same and what the heck is
then the use of this over learning well
I told you that overloading is just a
check on if you are calling your
functions properly and it wouldn't
reflect in your compiled language
compiled JavaScript but it is extremely
useful like if you try to call it like
area of quadrilateral one two three it
will produce an error if you try to
build this one you can clearly see that
supplied parameters do not match any
signature of the call target this is
because you did not include any
definition for the three side overloaded
stuff right so even though your third
argument is your fourth argument is
optional in your main definition but
still since you don't have the
declaration for three argument functions
therefore your compiler and the
typescript compiler shows you the same
room so this is pretty handy in the
debugging stuff if you are kind of you
know you just try to mess around with
things and then later on just forget you
know how the things were earlier so you
know you wouldn't just actually call a
function with the arguments which don't
want to have actually I don't know what
I'm speaking right now you know you get
the idea that what you have to do well
this is how pretty much over how
overloading works and I guess I would
just show how overloading works in and
in the tutorial in the interfaces or in
classes or whatever
because in classes it kind of makes much
more sense than this one this
implementation but it's kind of similar
to do so yeah so yeah one more thing is
that you cannot have something like this
you know it wouldn't work because it
kind of confuses types with that you're
overload signature is kind of matching
with this one so you cannot have the
same argument number so that's kind of
drawback but you know at least you don't
just pass three sides for the area
calculation so that is how pretty much
function overloading looks like and
works in typescript and that is all for
this tutorial
