maple and welcome to your tenth angular
tutorial for which I'm going to show you
what ng4 is and how to get started with
it so ng4 as you might have guessed is
just a way to loop over some I tradable
things like arrays and objects so
nothing fancy about it it's still the
same it was an angular 2 right so or
even if there are many any changes there
not a lot major ones so what we can do
right now is as you know who that we
have this object where the values is
erased so what we can do is change this
to ng ng 4 and again we have the star as
a syntactic sugar and further I'm going
to get rid of all of this so what we can
do is rather first of all change this to
something like this and say that this is
something like this and we can say name
as HTML type as content and then we can
say again we can just duplicate this a
little now we can say the CSS JavaScript
will be back and ready to go right so
now we can do is simply say let language
off my favorite whatever we named it my
favorite line right so then you need to
remember here is that this is not in
this is not this because in JavaScript
we do something like for a and B and
then we I created if you have an object
right but
this won't work for angular it requires
you to write let your temporary variable
of your array or whatever I create able
item you're on right so now we have
access to this language which is just a
single object in this array so what we
can do now is pretty much create a list
out of it
so rather we should just do this in
another list and finally we can say li
language dot name and language dot type
right and plus save this you can see we
get HTML front end
CSS front NGS front end and Ruby back
end just like we would expect it to be
now another thing what you can do is
that you can actually get the index of
the item as well so you can say let hi
is equal to index and sublime text is
kind of breaking out of it so I guess we
do not need to worry a lot about sublime
text this is some problem with the
syntax highlighter so anyways what we
can do now is simply say index or other
eye and something like that and you can
see that in the output we get 0 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
the indices of the element in your array
so again that's really much it angular
provides a bunch of other items as well
just like in this I is equal to index
you could also do like and let P 1 is
equal to even now there's nothing a lot
of things going on here it's just that
it's a boolean
whenever the item which is I trading is
e1
then it would be pretty much true right
so what we can do is you can say ng-if
and stay here even a simple as that
right so if I save this file and take a
look you can see now we get only HTML
NGS and if you take a look you can see
that the zero to one is HTML and the
second one is yes which is the only even
one right and similarly you can do like
for this if the rod and again
this one is not important you can just
name it anything but this one needs to
be odd right so you can do something
like this and you'll get CSS and Ruby
which is the one and the third element
right again you have something first
which would just be true whenever the
first item is I trading I don't know you
might need it somewhere but it's usually
not necessarily right again only the
first one and again you have the last
here and you can again do the same thing
we'll just get Ruby right so that is
pretty much how ng4 works and yeah
that's how you I traded over an array of
objects so that's all for this one and
if you liked it and don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
