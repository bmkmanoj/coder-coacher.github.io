hole and welcome to your tenth angular 2
tutorial and in this tutorial I'll be
quickly going on how to add some styles
using an external style sheet well I
just completely missed out in the last
tutorial but there you go well if you
have a lot of style sheets then this
would make your component file a bit off
you know you just don't want to just
populate your whole component file with
just styles only and that would happen
eventually when you have a lot of files
on your web server and a lot of content
as well so you would probably like to
shift your CSS to one file and just keep
your component file clean so for that
instead of making use of the Styles
we'll make use of the style URLs
property so right here if I just go
ahead and create a style sheet let's
just say this is my style dot CSS and
make use of style dot CSS right here
reload okay it's a C style dot CSS not
found all right any reason why this is
pointing in the home directory Oh might
be so yeah so as you can see what we had
in the style text-align:right so yeah
the styles are applied here again if we
look in the Dom tree you can see that
this style is actually this file is not
actually just used using a link or if
you just take a look in the CS helado
well in the networks it is lines so
there is no file requests going on so
the what we can say is that typescript
automatically just grabbed this style
URL and imported it in your
website so if I reload this again well
that's pretty impressive because on
larger projects it would save you a
bunch of HTTP requests though keeping
the code clean so that's how you
basically make use of the style URLs and
again you can have multiple URLs like
that you can just go ahead and write
multiple URLs and all of that would be
included so yeah so that's pretty much
how this would work and that's it for
this tutorial
as I guest I promised about that shadow
Dom tree thing I'll be covering that in
the next one so don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
