third ionic tutorial in which I'm gonna
show you just the directory structure
and how everything is laid out in ionic
framework and how basically everything
is set it up so I on ik is a very nice
customized framework and we have just
installed it and it has provided us with
a lot of customer eyes ability and a lot
of code as well to begin with so you
don't have to you know just wait for
writing a thousand lines then a
HelloWorld program would appear no
that's not the case with this so
beginning from the start we have this
hooks folder well this is related to
Cordova this program right here which we
installed
well this manages basically to get like
the native API support for the mobile
devices or basically just manages the
bundles and just bundles the packages of
the application so Cordova is you know
you would not like to mess with all of
these files so you want pretty much you
no need to edit this folder in your
project I mean I haven't edited in real
you know in some time so I don't think
you need to hook with this hooks hooks
folder so the next one is the plugins
well these plugins as a say that they
are sort of the ionic plugins but mostly
you see that these are called over
plugins so for this application it
requires these sort of plugins
well the plug-in requirement would
depend from the template to template so
if you have a blank template then this
would be probably like or some sort of a
plugin or two only but if you have a
more complex template set it up then
this would be just would have a lot of
plugins so then the next one is a CSS
folder and this SCS is basically the
sass folder so this right here you can
actually score in your sass tiles
and yeah if you you know if you're not
comfortable with sass then that's not a
problem because you can actually add CSS
into this folder as well so if you just
know sass then that would be a plus
point for you for ionic but if you don't
then that's not a very much reason to
worry about you can actually just
directly go to your CSS as well then
yeah so we have already moved into the
WWE folder well this is sort of the
folder which is like it this folder is
like your public HTML directory if you
have ever used FTB then you know that
public HTML is the folder which is
visible to the user so this is sort of
your public HTML directory for your
application the mobile application so
this is your CSS then we have the images
these are some sort of default images
for this project then we have a J's
folder which just has all of that Java
Script set it up for us for the tabs
template for now and then we have the
controllers the controller's JavaScript
file and we have a services file well
don't worry we'll be just coding that
all of that stuff from scratch so you'll
be you know just comfortable with that
we'll soon then we have this templates
folder the templates as the name says
that they are sort of kind of abuse so
this is the chart detail then tab
account and table charts will be just
going over through the coding section
later on then we have the index and this
is kind of your splash page which
appears the very first time the user
opens your application then we have this
bar bar whatever you you know pronounce
it like so this is just a package
manager for ionic so I don't think so
you would pretty much need to edit up
this file as well then we have this
editor
configuration I don't know what this is
no idea so this is I guess the sort of
sublime text file only because it in the
insult final newline or trim trailing
whitespace doesn't look like that any of
the stuff like gulp or go to our eye on
ik would actually need it then this get
ignore is useless for you if you are not
using it but if you are using it then
this would just simply mean that you
could just XE exclude some of the files
from being watched over or just pushed
to your repository when you just push
your code on the github repository so we
won't pretty much need this unless I
just create a repository of our final
application which will be creating
sometime later then we have this bar
JSON then this is a JSON file which is
sort of just the name of the application
hello ionic then this is private and
developer dependencies then we have this
configuration dot XML
well you might edit a thing or two here
like this email address or your name and
the name of the description right there
but other than that you won't really
much need it at all
then we have the gut file well this gulf
file is actually the gulp is basically
this would require a whole other
tutorial for god well this is the
Automator for javascript like if you
have made a change to your script it
would just keep a watch on your files
and would you know sort of reload the
browser so that your changes are always
life and it does a lot of other things
as well we'll be taking a look at that
later on so these are some of the things
which it is doing like this part of code
is watching on the code then this is
some sort of install thing then this is
git check for version control
now we have the sass one with just I
guess sort of minifides it or you know
just compiles your sass code to CSS code
and all of those modules you know that
sort of things will be just taking a
look at go in some other tutorial then
we have this ionic project as a file
nothing much interesting here then we
have our package dot JSON file our old
friend which would just you know allow
you to keep your dependencies and all of
that stuff you need to know about your
application in a single paste so that's
how very much your application for ionic
is laid out and I really think that this
is a very simple layout system ionic has
provided and yeah so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial and from the next
tutorial onwards or maybe after that
we'll be starting off with writing some
of our first code in ionic so if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
