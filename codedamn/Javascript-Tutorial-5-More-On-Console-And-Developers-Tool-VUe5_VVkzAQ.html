JavaScript tutorial in this tutorial
we'll be looking more on console and
developers too in the last tutorial we
learnt how to write commands to console
in the browsers developers tool in this
lesson we'll be learning more from
console commands and how to use them
first of all we used console dot log to
print a simple message to the developers
tool let me open my browser
here is a browser
and I right-click and inspect element'
it on this as you can see
let me shrink this
as you can see when we consulted log our
code then it shows us hello developer
here now the next command in JavaScript
is console dot error now what console
dot error does is it logs not only a
simple message but a kind of error in
your console when stands if I say
console dot error
unidentified variable X and I love this
and i refresh this then as you can see
it shows in the form of an error like
cross and red text the next command is
called sold or dir
you know what console the dir does is
for console the DNR to understand you
must know what are objects everything in
JavaScript like your dog when you
retrieve objects from here when you
retrieve elements from here our treaties
are treated as objects therefore
supposedly if we have like two deaths
here in HTML we do
document dot
I'll teach this in further tutorials
document.getelementbyid e my tag names
sorry
well now just remember that what we are
doing this we are getting the objects of
these two deaths or actually every div
in this document which are only two
right now and they storing it as an
object in the dev variable now if we do
console dot log div then you will see
message like this like this dev dev item
function named item function which is
not actually very user-friendly this is
not what should actually very user
friendly but if we use tire directory
dir we do consult or dir dev then we can
see a user-friendly way
of doing this like it shows
htmlcollection do that with there are
HDR vacuum
stable elements we get a lot of
information with the diff attached which
is access key aligned attributes base
URL file name child element County nodes
which is further divided like that now
the next interesting thing I want to
tell you that you can actually log your
time in JavaScript that means you can
actually calculate how much time your
script is taking to execute for example
if I want to run this block of code
and I want to check how much time this
court takes to run on my browser then
there is a command console dot time
start and I name it
time check
now what would it do is it will start a
counter right here
I do console dot time and time check
here now what is happening here is it
starts it timer right here it runs this
code as usual to JavaScript and it ends
the timer right here and it will show
this time the execution time in the
console of the developers tool now if i
refresh this page and I see 22 which is
the result a plus is equal to 10 plus 12
and time check says that it took nine
milliseconds for this these two
operations to curl carry on that means
it took nine milliseconds for
initializing this variable to 10 plus 2
12 console in this variable it this is
basically very helpful when you want to
check the execution of the time or want
to check with scripts R Block in your
page execution
okay so the next thing I want to tell
you is there's a function called copy
copy in Chrome and Firefox which allows
you to copy the text to your clipboard
now actually
this function could be exploited by
attackers in various means that is why
this copy function is not actually
available for the developers to use in
their code you can just do this in your
console developer's tool and you cannot
execute this execute this as a
JavaScript on the page
I'll show you like if I do copy one two
three and I biggest right click and
paste here as you can see one two three
I do copy 100 1000 or any string like
that and I do this as you can see it
gets copied into my clipboard
but if I try to run this copy script in
my code here and I do
and I'll refresh this code then it says
the uncut references or copies notified
this because copy is not available to
developers yet because this copy
function if available could be exploited
in various means and could be used to
modify the clipboard of the user however
if you wish to use the copy feature you
can use various plugins like zero copy
which uses flash based options and like
that
so I guess console and developers stool
was clear and I wish that you must have
