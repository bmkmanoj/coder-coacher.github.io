sixth HTML tutorial and now what the
heck is XHTML now which is in front of
you now XHTML is a fancy way of writing
or fancy way of saying to write clean
and nested and proper HTML now by this I
mean that in the second it will I guess
or third tutorial reload a hello world
program like hello world now this is
completely valid in HTML but completely
unacceptable in XHTML and XHTML
basically is kind of writing in a
schematic and systematic manner writing
HTML in a very precise manner so this
document right here is still incomplete
and the reason is because we have missed
out a very important important header
which is the doctype
now doctype is basically the at the top
of any document on the web page if you
look at any side any popular site then
you would find the stock type at the top
of every popular site which follows HTML
standards now doctype is basically a way
of telling your browser that you're
writing in HTML and by that you are
telling browser to parse your HTML
document in which version for example
html5 has a different of type than HTML
for an HTML 3 so let's see how you write
a doctype
just like you write a tag press shift
and you're greater than sign then press
an exclamatory mark which is above your
one number on your keyboard and then
write doctype and that's how you write
doctype and make sure you write this
exclamation mark and this tells the
browser that it's not just an ordinary
tag but some special meaning is assigned
to it and give it a space and write HTML
now this doctype HTML is basically the
doctype for html5 so now let's come back
to this existing reverses HTML now this
document appears to be valid but doctype
HTML says this document should be html5
but we are still missing a thing or two
and that is first of all we would like
to supply this with an attribute Lang
yet and I'll tell you about attributes
in my future tutorial in maybe in the
next tutorial just learn that by doing
this we are just assigning the lang en
that means that we are saying to browser
that this HTML document is written in
English language so this attribute
basically helps to tell the browser that
we are writing in English
and to be more precise the next thing we
need to do to make it a valid XHTML
document is right amid our care said UDF
it and I promise you that I will explain
all these things in my future tutorial
but just learned about for now that this
Medicare said utf-8 just tells that we
are using a specific type of characters
in the in our basically in our document
like if you have ever seen Arabic or any
other vir type of language
I'm not saying Arabic is weird but any
other language used which uses various
styles of other symbols other than your
traditional AEIOU and one two three four
five and your ampersand and your dollar
sign and all those variety then those
symbols won't come under utf-8 so by
this we are just telling that we are
using symbols only belonging to utf-8
and this is kind of a whole lot of
another book so this utf-8 for some
other day so let's come back to this
XHTML was the HTML and now the main
difference as you can see now this is a
valid XHTML document
an XHTML document is just a fancy way of
saying as I told you of writing HTML in
a perfect manner just like you right XML
if you have every familiar with XML if
you're not then don't worry leave it
we'll discuss it some other time
no we have this XML document ready we
will be shooting I would be writing all
my tutorials in XHTML version XHTML way
only because that's the best way of
writing HTML without creating any
confusions for the browser so though I
would be using HTML and CSS for the sake
of simplicity of the tutorials but we
would be actually falling s XHTML syntax
all over our series so this was a short
tutorial on HTML vs. HTML and I hope you
are clear that hTML is kind of
invalid syntax would also accept in
value but XHTML won't so before closing
this tutorial let me give you a short
example let's say this document down
here let's reload this it works
perfectly because it's XHTML now if I
remove head which should be closed then
this would create some problems because
browser would get confused but right now
it is valid as a HTML document because
HTML doesn't care much about syntax but
xst ml cares a lot so basically that's
what I could show you that's the main
difference between XS timolol HTML that
we use kind of procedural way to write
code in XHTML but not in HTML so don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
there next time and stay tuned with me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
