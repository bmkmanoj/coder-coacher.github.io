Mabel and welcome to your 20th Android
application development tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm gonna discuss about
something known as a scroll view right
so a scroll view is a pretty interesting
thing and let's just say you're creating
was boring most boris or you know I
don't even know how to express that
application and it's about you right so
you are creating an application about
yourself in which you are adding a bunch
of activities like your morning routine
then your daytime routine then your
evening what you do at evening and all
that stuff so right if in morning you
write you just wake up then brush your
teeth
if you do and then you just go to bath
and you know probably all that stuff so
what would happen is that eventually you
would run out of space right so you
would just fill this vertical space and
what then well you couldn't make just
your font size smaller and smaller there
would be always devices like Android
watch if you see then you would want to
even able to write a word for that so
you need to find a way to make your
content scrollable at least so what you
can do is you can make use of something
known as a scroll view right so let me
first of all get some text and I'm just
gonna go to Google and say lips this is
just a website to generate random text
and let me just say generate paragraph
and I'm just gonna copy the first one
and right here instead of idle let's
just fill that and right here let's just
get rid of this button and in main
activity as well we need to remove this
code right so here we go and now what I
need to do is actually say something
Android excise 40s be right so just to
make sure that it overflows right and if
I take a look at and emulate you right
now so you would see that once its
installed and launched you would see
pretty much that that is that your
application ends right here and you
cannot move or scroll it down no matter
how hard you try so that's pretty
annoying and moving for a user so what
you can do is you can just wrap in your
whole linear layout in a scroll view so
here we go and you just rub that in a
scroll view and I'm just missing rocket
right and again it accepts some Android
width layout with as much parent and
height as well and the reason is that
it's giving me red it is actually layout
height you see that we are missing this
scheme and reading board so you see that
it automatically does that for us and I
would probably keep it even above these
two one words before using them and you
could just actually get rid of this from
the linear layer do you just need to
include that ones in your root element
so now you see that your layout looks a
bit absurd but don't worry about that
just run your application and you'll
notice that you can now actually scroll
the text right so it's pretty cool you
see the bluish effect which the device
default effect is it's also applied with
your scroll bar so that's a win for you
and what you can instead do is that you
can just not only make the whole screen
scrollable but instead just a portion of
text view which just occupies a limited
height right so you can just do that as
well so let me just get rid of this
first and
and put that again and let's just get
rid of this as well and make use of a
scroll view right here so I'm gonna say
its weight is wrap 110 but height is
lets us say this is 300 DPS and here we
go 300 DPS and then this is layout with
this wrap content so let me just run
that and see now you can see that we are
restricted to 300 DPS or hide right yep
and your content is still scrollable so
that's pretty cool like if you want to
just include a notice and you just don't
want to through a whole lot of screen to
user just make sure that user is able to
read the text right here so now you can
just have some sort of instructions and
then a play button right for if you are
creating a sort of game so that is how
pretty much you make use of scroll views
and work with them and yeah that's all
for this tutorial and if you like that
then don't forget subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
