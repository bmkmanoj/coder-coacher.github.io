to your another iolite tutorial I don't
remember this tutorial number well in
this tutorial I'm just gonna show you
that disable functionality which I was
talking about well to do that we can
make use of is actually we can make use
of ng disabled disabled' and again we
have to supply a boolean value here so
I'm not gonna hard code this but I'm
gonna make use of my timer dot start
button and why not just make use of the
object properties when we already have
an object stop button stop button right
there and if I just go to AB dot GS I
can say scope dot my timer dot start
button is true because I want it to be
false actually because I wanted not to
be disabled and the stop button to be
true alright now once this is inside
this loop right there or basically what
I want is whenever this star function is
fired I want to reverse this thing and I
just want to say that this one is true
and this one is false and then when a
word this is stopped I want to say this
one is true and this one is false just
like it and with here actually as well I
want to say this one is true and this
one is false or actually we could just
move these two right here to this code
because it's eventually gonna fire
itself so looks like it's working and if
I reload this click on start you can see
it works
really well the start button is disabled
and only stop was enabled and once I
click the stop actually on the start
didn't actually I won't you say it false
true here again start stop again start
there I want to stop now that's pretty
cool huh now again what you can do for
this application as a homework you can
say you can just add a third button
right here which just says reset button
and just leave the application like that
and on reset it just resets the timer to
the original one so yeah that's pretty
much it for this tutorial
and if you liked this tutorial then
don't forget to subscribe and as always
