your sixth bootstrap tutorial I'm a who
Aaron the story we'll be starting off
with the project by creating a simple
navigation bar with the help of
bootstrap framework now to begin with
first of all if you go to this example
web page of get bootstrap coms as
examples slash lamb bar you see this
nice little nav bar which is gonna give
you a dynamic feature of you know you're
switching over to different navigation
bars
I'll trying them out we also have a drop
down here which looks kinda nice so just
create your own let's view some nav bar
documentation so on this page right here
you'll see some code now this code would
exactly reproduce this thing right here
but we will not be using the score
exactly we'll be simplifying this a lot
so let me just go ahead and copy this
code and paste inside this notepad file
now I don't worry because we'll be going
off one by one with each line and I
guess I should you know teach you guys
also as well what I'm doing side by side
so this is our nav class lap bar and
I've by default now what happens is that
with the snap tag what we are doing is
we are creating a navigation bar and
with HTML you know nav tag is an allowed
tag now so this class of nav bar and nav
bar default what it does is it says that
this element would be a navigation bar
and these styles are applied accordingly
now we have another style which is for
the dart team which has different class
than nav bar default which we're looking
very soon now the next thing we have is
a diff glass container fluid now I'll be
explaining the difference between
container and container fluid very soon
in this tutorial only
but first of all let me just get rid of
this unwanted code so I'm just gonna
open this file in Chrome first of all
thereafter what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna get rid of the mobile versions
right now because we'll just look at
that later on and if you see okay this
is the current link let's get rid of
this
I guess the drop-down wouldn't hurt and
let's just get rid of the search bar as
well
and I guess we do have a drop-down out
there so this one isn't made it as well
hmm okay so now the cord looks much
cleaner than before okay so now what's
happening here is that this container
fluid is basically creating your new
responsive menu no but Dad what I mean
is
now without container as well the menu
would be responsive but the difference
is that fluid is like it's like flowing
on the whole screen now you know that
fluid cannot give look of you know
flowing so this menu this navigation
menu top menu is flowing 100% and width
on all of your screen if you remove this
fluid then what will happen is that it
will has attained a certain fixed width
so you see now that this gets limited to
fixed width and you can even find that
with that width is 1170 pixels now
container fluid has a class this class
has a style with width of a guest
hundred percent or no width said at all
it's it just has some margin so it takes
all of your screen now if you want if
you are looking to create a full-screen
interface then I'll suggest you to go
ahead with container fluid but in my
case I guess container is good enough
because you know it kinda makes your
things compact now instead of this link
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add here
home and some other sections as well
about contact and what we can do for
this drop down menu is I'm gonna just
explain this in a second I'm just gonna
change this to more okay so now what
happens here is to create a drop-down
what you need to do is instead of just
regular regular Li you need to give it a
class of drop down so that it is
prepared to be a drop down now next what
you need to do is you need to give it an
a tag the text which you need to be
clicked to you know show the drop down
and the xref is hash because we don't
need the user to navigate anywhere else
you can also give here javascript:void
if you want to wouldn't hood or whatever
you want to then a class of drop-down
toggle not drop-down toggle is required
for I guess these Styles you see that
this becomes a deep colored when the
drop-down is active so that does the
thing and data toggle drop down now this
basically tells this bootstrap framework
that this link would act as a drop-down
bit so make sure to include this line
the slider is Guara from important now
since data since data star any attribute
is allowed in such format so this
attribute is perfectly valid even if it
was data like that so you see then roll
button I guess this is not required an
area has pop-up true now it says that
this contains a power book yes it does
and area expanded false now by default
it is not expanded so just give it to
false
now the stack span class carrot what it
does is it'll create a small little this
icon if you see this triangle a little
triangle and bootstrap by default
contains a lot of icons as well in its
framework so it's not just limited to
this triangle but there are many other
icons like
the home icon or the user or many others
which will be using very soon on this
project and you can use as well for your
online websites now all of these allies
are your links inside this drop-down and
as you can see this rules separator what
it does is it just creates a horizontal
line so it kind of looks nice if you
want to have separate sections inside
drop down as well so here you go that's
how you create that all of these links
you can link them anywhere or you can
just remove them as well if you wish so
with that being said you can just edit
your name here or you can just go ahead
with an image as well wouldn't hurt you
see that it creates a nice little menu
of your navigation bar cut up of your
web page and that kind of looks good so
and that code didn't even require us to
touch a single CSS file so far so that's
a plus point of this bootstrap framework
and in the next tutorial we'll be
working on some more elements on the
screen and that's it for now and I'll
see you then don't forget to subscribe
