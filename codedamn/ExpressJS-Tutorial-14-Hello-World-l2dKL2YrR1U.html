your fourteenth nodejs or rather I
should say express chess tutorial this
tutorial will be riding off with a hello
world program in express so let's take a
look
Express is require Express and then what
we are gonna do next is I'm gonna say
app is equal to Express so what
essentially happens is that this Express
would return you functioned so you just
need to get whatever this function
contains and if you just take a look
here this would create application would
be returned and as you can see this is a
function so this is returning us app and
that's basically what it's read on e and
this is yet again a function so this
thing right here is again a function but
create application is the main module
exports which is in the expressed years
main file so now what I want I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna say app dot listened to
and here goes the port number I let's
just keep it to one three three seven
only function this is the callback
function again which would be fire when
this listening is done or started
basically so listening boat for one
three three seven
so if I run this application and node
script fourteen KS as you can see the
node doesn't quit because it has to
listen on this port and if I open my
browser
and will you please just stop jumping
around Chrome localhost one three three
seven as you can see we get this message
cannot get a slash and obviously this is
something done by node and not node by
expressed because node did not have
these fallback messages so you have to
do everything from scratch in node so
this is something which express is doing
so if I write something like that as you
can see it shows me something out there
and if I change a code a little bit and
add another thing after not get slash
now what happens with this is that now
Express would wait for the user to
wizard a URL like this or you can just
write get hello there and then one star
is the URL then you have this function
require or request it sorry requested
and response this function would and one
thing to note is that this request and
response are the same variables which we
made use of tutorial number four so
these two are same one on the same thing
so you could do either do like this
something like this but you don't need
that now because Express is already
taking care of that so what you have to
just do is response dot send hello there
from Express
and while a space out there or if I take
a look and browser and go to what is the
URL hello there hello there alright so
we need to just restart the server right
that just like that
no but the browser hello there you can
see that we go out hello there from
Express and if I just inspect element' a
bit for you guys go to network tab
reload this page you can see we got this
304 not modified code and we got this X
powered by Express which we can just
remove if you wish to we got something
like yeah so that's pretty much all we
have God from Express and if I go to
some other URL you can see this also
sends us automatically 404 not found
code so we don't need to do like much of
the basic setup so Express has already
done that for us and it also saves us a
simple error message cannot get this and
get is basically just this method right
here which we are making use of so maybe
in the post it would just say cannot
post to this URL so that's how you write
your hello world program with Express
and we'll be learning more about Express
in the coming tutorials
so don't forget to subscribe and stick
together thank you for watching
I'll see you real soon in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
