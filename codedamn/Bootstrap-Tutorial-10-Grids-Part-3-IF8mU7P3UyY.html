are welcome to your tenth bootstrap
tutorial in which will be looking at
some more information on grids which we
logged in the last tutorial so in the
last tutorial we just programmed for two
main device views and thatís for a
large screen and a kind of intermediate
screen and this tutorial will be working
on all the other sizes as well so the
next size we have is a call of sm now
this sm would work on 768 anna both so
if i try this out and i say that this
should occupy again let's say five this
should work with sm of three now this
should work sm of what's left for ok now
if i try this out then you see that from
a large screen it shrinks to another
ratio then it shrinks to another ratio
then for a very small screen I guess we
have excess which starts for extra small
so if I change all of these to 12 then
what'll happen is each of these would
occupy their own lines so yeah so that's
what happens when the sum exceeds 12
everything else occupies their own lines
so if you see then these tiles are being
applied and you could even just keep
them at four for four if you wish to god
that's how they'll strip stay all the
way down to any size they are presented
so those were some major break points in
bootstrap how they work now you could
actually create some more
elements and create a little bit of
complex application by setting which
they've is visible at which perspective
so you can just see that and just supply
this thing I'd say that visible LG now
what this would do is it would just make
this div with both only on large screens
so if I say that this div is visible
only to large desktops and if I just sum
this up correctly a little bit I changes
to three out of five just take it back
and reload okay so now you see for dips
one two three four this divisible only
to last desktops as I slide this down
you see that the fourth Dave washes add
this is because I said to distill that
you have to be visible only on larger
desktops similarly you could hook up
some MD or you could sm or XS for like
you can say that hey mobile user I got
you so that makes life got a simple so
you don't have to like bang your head
every time with CSS to figure a way out
and if you can see that this is not
something of these for a lot summing up
to be 12 so this fourth dave is Scott
appears in next slide but as I said you
you should try to keep the sum to either
12 or try to keep a all of these 2 12 so
the I'll they appear in their own lines
so that's it pretty much for the story
ille are the next tutorial we'll be
looking at some more applications of
this grid in bootstrap and probably
would
be looking at something else interesting
so that's it for this tutorial and don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
