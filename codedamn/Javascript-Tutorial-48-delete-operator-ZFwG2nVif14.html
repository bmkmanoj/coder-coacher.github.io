48 JavaScript tutorial and which will be
discussing about an operator called
delete operator and to familiarize you
with operators operators are nothing but
like you use your automatic operators
like + - x --d these things are called
operators which basically work with
which have a special meaning so delete
is not an automatic operator bar is
simply or operator which actually kind
of unset a variable or space so how does
delete work let me show you so let's say
I create a variable lets him by war and
send it 200 and I do delete my war
alright console.log my war so what do
you think what would be console.log
let's see so here's my browser i'll
reload it
now you can see that unconscious our
uncut reference my war is not defined
but if I comment out this statement then
you'll see that we console logs it
console logs as one hundred so what if I
can't so log this operator right here
what will happen then so let's check
this out
let's relearn now and you see that this
returns true and this delete would
return true when you are trying to
delete self set global property are not
global any property and you are trying
to delete global variable now war plays
a important rule here because if you
said my war to war my war then this is
kind of looks like a global variable but
it's not global because Global's are
used without the more key word
therefore war would make this my wire
property of the global window has non
configurable so this would not be
deleted so if I reload this now that we
get false and 100's console.log as the
result so now you can see that if you
type var keyword declare a variable with
a war keyword then that variable could
not be deleted with the delete operator
so some other things where you can use
delete is like let's say you have an
array
my error let's see and don't forget to
remove the VAR keyword that means don't
use VAR keyword because if you use that
then obviously you wouldn't be able to
use the delete operator so let's say if
one in my array and I hope I have taught
you this this simply means that if
there's index one position available in
the area for example it would check for
zero this is zero to position this is
first position so first position yes
there's something in this and therefore
this condition is true then this code
would run but if I specify like if 0 1 2
3 4 if for NRA
then this would not be executed because
there's no fourth element
similarly if there's something undefined
here so for example if I put a comma
right here then this is the 4th element
but this is nothing but undefined so
still if foreign RA would evaluate to
false so let's check our a quick example
let's say if one in my array
ashay console.log yep one is present for
now now what will we do is we'll just
lead not the air itself but the first
element of that array so now if we
console.log this again then what would
happen is we can specify an ill
statement that no one is
now deleted so let's reload this and you
can see now that yep one is present for
now and the second execute as nope one
is now deleted so what it does is in the
first run obviously we have got the
first position as something which is
obviously blank but in second we have
got the position removed because of the
delete operator and if we console.log
the error here my array and console.log
the array here as well my array then
what would you see the difference is
that in here we have got first second
third fourth as defined but this is
sorry this should be 0 1 2 3 as defined
but here it is 0 2 3 so if you remember
from the previous tutorials that arrays
are special kinds of objects in
JavaScript so obviously we could check
them against like if 1 in array and like
that and one thing I have to mention is
that is this would work with objects
exactly the same way so for example if I
specify a property named my property is
hundred
and let's delete this code and if I say
delete my prop my array dot my property
my property and if I can't so log my
array dot my property then obviously we
would get
are basically this should not be here
we would get undefined because there's
no property now my property because we
have already deleted it with the delete
operator if I commented out freeload
then we got 100 as expected since this
is used without variable itself var
keyword therefore we could delete the
whole object at once all right so this
was a quick little tutorial on delete
operator and delete in no means freeze
your memory but it kind of acts to unset
your variables in JavaScript so handle
it with care and that's it for this

thank you for watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
