Meho and welcome to your fourth electron
tutorial in which I'm going to discuss a
little about what processes are an
electron and actually what they are and
how electron works with them
so essentially what electron do is it
kind of uses the same model which
chromium uses and it's browser google
chrome and that is the use of processes
right so if you have ever observed that
chrome never crashes if only one of a
couple of tabs are you know hanged or
crashes right so that is because chrome
launches a separate process for every
tab every extension every process it
thinks it should so that if a process
crashes the other ones or if a process
is kind of like laggy as well the other
ones are not affected so if you do not
use that then all of your thread if a
single thread is running that would be
affected so a similar thing is used by
electron and electron precisely users
main and renderers rinse are en de re
regular processes process right so these
two processes are used by electron to
actually run your application right so
the fine which you are looking at right
now this index dot J's which we defined
in the package to JSON file index touch
is right here main this is our electron
finds our main process file this file
runs in the main process right and
anything you do here is running in the
main process so main process actually
boots up your application your electron
app and then whatever instance you
create like this rouser window all these
are going into regular process which is
a separate process right so main process
actually kind of manages all the browser
window and
even like creating native menus and all
that stuff right so then what goes in
regular process is all that document
object API is and some node API is an
electron API as well so there's actually
a distinction between main and render
and that is that there are some api's
which are only available for main some
are only available for renderer and some
are common to both like communication
API so that your main process can talk
to the rendering process as well so more
or less it's something like if you have
this as your electron up right so
electron first of all would fire main
main process right your main which in
our case is indexed at us right now and
then what did we do with main would do
essentially or might not do it up to our
scripting it would fire some render
process which is more or less would be
fired by calling these browser windows
creating these windows right and these
would be render process and these are
these two are actually running on
separate processes right so they are
kind of not sharing any resource or data
for the moment so that is how very much
electron works under the hood and
provides you a set of aps native ApS to
use in both the processes made on
renderer and that's all for the story
and on the next one we are going to
improve upon the hello world program and
see what actually we are doing in this
script file so yeah see you then in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
