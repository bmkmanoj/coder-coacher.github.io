your 36th Android application
development tutorial and in this
tutorial what I'm gonna do is show you
how you can instead of showing a stupid
toast on clicking your list item you
could actually open the URL of the link
associated with this thing right so for
this we need to make a little bit of
change I just say private string this is
news URL and then we need to get this
one in the constructor as well
so string news URL not desk URL actually
so right here I'm gonna say this dot
news URL is a news URL or well wait a
minute
oh actually we do have that thing well
didn't realize that so don't need to do
anything right there well we do have URL
and we have the setter for the getter
for it as well so it's pretty simple to
do now what we have to do all is where's
the on click function well actually I
actually want to split this code as well
into functions because it's becoming
kind of messy right so what we can do is
I can take all of this code right there
and all of this code right and this one
as well and I could say that this is my
private void let's just say engine and
based all this code and right here I'm
just going to call an engine simple
enough
then we can do the same thing or should
we well actually let's just leave the
blue one as it is because there's not a
lot of code inside this so now what I
was going to do actually forward well
what we were going to do yeah we were
taking a URL and just making it kind of
click about so let's just move this
thing out as well and say private void
add click listener and say that this is
this thing and you could just actually
move it on the top as well if you want
to kind of optimize your code and I'm
gonna say this has ADD click listener as
well so now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna say that my strengths URL first of
all I need to get in this thing which we
are actually clicking so we can just
make use of that thing from right there
alright so I'm gonna say this is news
item current item it's news feed not get
position so it will just give me that
particular item then I'm gonna say my
intent I and I'm gonna launch an intent
because I want to start browser so it's
kinda intent its passing from one
activity to another which is actually an
activity of another application in this
case so this is a new intent and inside
here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
write intent that action view right so
this one is used to final launch browser
with the use of I dot set data and
inside here you have to pass and your
URL so I'm gonna say URI dot
bars and URI is kinda URL URI is Uniform
Resource indicator URL is locator
it's kind of one on the same thing and
then I want to pass in URL well what is
the URL where we have current item dot
get URL simple as that
all right so we are good to go and let's
just see that thing in action so it's
just performing full building install
and it should probably add every build
ok so here we go and I click on the
first one boom nothing happens
um this let's just make the toast that I
am here at least
well well you know what I want to hit
myself with a strong brake seriously
okay so click here boom browser opened
with the story link and it should
probably just open if I am NOT having
issues with night and again yes it does
it's kind of performed her redirect and
here you can see all that good stuff
well you can actually create an app
where you can just click on it and it
just pops down we do have expanded list
and we do have content for that as well
so you can just go ahead and try that
out and what we are left with is that we
didn't make use of these things right we
didn't make use of this time date and
yeah I guess that's pretty much it or we
made not male user and this new
description as well so what I want you
guys to do is I want you to download
this application source code I'm gonna
leave the link for this repository in
the description and I want you to make
changes in this code and especially in
this item dot XML to include date and
time field right here somewhere and
adjust description such that it doesn't
cross them and I want you to try this on
your devices as well and pretty much if
you face any sort of layout issue then
point it to me because right now I'm
just gonna leave this application right
here I'm gonna leave most of the work to
you guys so I have just given you a
start so you can just finish this
application and yes you can switch this
to you are well actually as well where
is it right now as you can see that I'm
making use of a static file instead of
API because on localhost my IPS cards
not working and on the live URL I
restricted it to local host both ad
access only so I might probably change
that to local host only if you want me
to and then you will be good to go to
access that so yeah so let's just just
leave your comments in the description
below well actually you can't leave
comments in description well anyways you
know you get the idea how you have to
proceed now so that is all for this
tutorial and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and as always thanks
