hole and welcome to your second es6
tutorial in which i'm gonna show you how
to set up tracer with your es6 or with
your computer actually so that you can
just start coding in es6 so to do that
first of all you'll need to install node
and to install node just go to node.js
org this is a website then you'll find a
big green button there with the latest
stable release and then what you have to
do is just download the setup and just
execute it so it might take a minute or
two
depending upon how fast you are so once
you are done with that come back here
and write NPM install tracer and with a
global flag now this would install
tracer on your computer globally so that
all of your programs can use that and
just hit enter now it would install
tracer for you but I'm just gonna abort
this process because I've already
installed that so I'm just gonna hit
ctrl C yes and once you have installed
tracer then what you have to do is write
tracer and hit enter then you'll see
something like this so if it appears
then you know that tracer was installed
alright so now we have installed tracer
what next now let's just write some
simple JavaScript here and let's just
link or not yet let's just compile this
JavaScript let's say this was let's say
this was a simple not a simple
console.log but a complex type of es6
program then what you'll do is let's
just open this directory first and
rightly here open the command window and
since we are in the same directory now
it's write tracer see EU are I'm always
misspelling that to dot yes now as you
can see this line not only compiles your
code but actually executes this as well
so what you would like to have is that
you
like to have your compiled code in a
different file because compiled code is
the one which you'll use in your HTML
and you are basically on your website so
to output that if I just write tracer
you can see here in the examples we have
this line right there
so the out flag would just output your
compiled file into a different file and
all these files are the input files
which would be just compiled by tracer
and would be compiled into a single file
so let's say tracer to compiled or Jas
and I want to dot J's to be compiled and
don't forget the out flag right there
hit enter now if you look into the
compiled file then as you can see this
doesn't look very nice and obviously
this is what the heck is this this is
not defined so as you can see that this
is this code won't work if I just
include simply do like script SRC to
compile or cheers because the very first
error that your browser would throw is
that what the heck is this so we need
another ways to make this compile code
work with your HTML file and we'll be
looking about that in the next tutorials
so that's all for this one and don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
