hole and welcome to your fifth
require.js tutorial in which I'll be
showing you about this defined function
you can say and require.js now require
Connor give us two keywords or two
functions you can say which is the
require and define for now so and the
last tutorial I told you how you can
load this custom script after your
configuration file is loaded and if I
see in the network's tab you see that
this file is loaded but since there's
nothing in here there's no response so
let's just fill it with some response so
now let's just say I want to love
something and it works like a charm so
if I want to make use of jQuery in this
file what I want to do is I would like
to make use of this defined function cut
off so this define what it would accept
is some dependencies which it would work
on and then finally a callback function
which would be fired when all of these
files are loaded alright so now for now
I just want check for a dependency and
this jQuery is the same one just you
write here so you have to write here so
if I write just ABC here you have to
write ABC here only because it is
fetching that information from this
configuration file just just make use of
this jQuery for now and the next thing
you have to do is that inside this
function you have to pass an argument
let's just say dollar which is the most
common for chicory and this dollar what
this argument is that whatever this file
is returning to this required years is
being passed as a parameter in this one
and this may seem a little bit weird but
when with in the future tutorials when I
will show you that how you can convert
your normal JavaScript to
you know just the JavaScript sushi you
can make use of in here you'll see that
there's a you know a kind of magic
happening with jQuery but let's just
leave that for the future tutorial
because we are just talking about the
dependency in this one so yeah so I'll
cover that just make me remind about
that if I even forget to do that
tutorial but anyways now we have access
to jQuery with the help of this dollar
symbol which is the default one from the
jQuery let's just say body dot HTML
hello from the other side and let's just
reload this and as you can see we get
hello from the other side on the web
page and voila the chicory is loaded as
well and as you can see in the network's
sources or know that books table only
this jQuery file is loaded by this
require file so you know this is a
lesson Chronos call it was not loaded by
default on the page by this HTML page it
is being loaded by this required years
on our demand of this define so if I
make use of this define and then I make
use of this angular as well then I
reload this you can see that angular is
loaded again as well and you can see
that angular is loaded from the cached
version of this CDN so it is cached in
my browser because you know may have
visited some page which was using the
same file and as you can see that this
file is not used but this is used
because since this was this URL was
available for the require to load so
cached URL is loaded for this or maybe I
should say the CDN URL is loaded for the
angular and the default one is loaded
for the jQuery because the CDN was
available so you know you can just add a
lot of dependencies here and then you
can accordingly make use of all of those
so you can now use angular as well
not module or whatever that is about
angular just check out the angular
tutorials that you'll know so yeah so
that's all for this one and in the next
tutorial I don't know what I'll teach
you but that would be awesome so that's
all for this one and don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
