Google Chrome extension development
tutorial and before starting this
tutorial are to watch all of my
tutorials in full-screen 1080p high
definition so that you're able to see
what I'm doing the things are not just
messy okay coming back to the tutorial
in this tutorial we'll be discussing an
important file in Google Chrome
extension called manifest.json in the
last tutorial or basically in the first
tutorial I told you that manifest.json
is an important file and we'll be
discussing this file in upcoming
tutorials
but this file is so important that I
placed the tutorial number of this file
to number two which you're going to be
watching so manifest file dot JSON file
is actually the core of your extension
which tells this Google Chrome browser
Ranger everything about your extension
the name of your extension it's version
it's language description icons to use
what happens when user who was over they
or extension what happens when it clicks
over your extension and about the new
pages the permissions your extension
requires these sources the storage and
all that stuff
this is the official documentation of
manifest file from Google Chrome but we
don't need all of this because this is
very vast and you don't also require all
of these manifest commands in your one
extension but I'll be discussing the
most popular and useful with you if we
open our extension page which we
downloaded in the last tutorial the
manifest consists here of very basic
commands
first of all manifest version 2 just
make sure that you have to give it
manifest version 2 at least if you are
in 2015 watching this tutorial in 2015
or maybe an year or two ahead manifest
version 2 is Google Chrome's
manifest version which was launched
after chrome 18 before chromatin the
developers used to give manifest version
1 but if you do manifest version 1 right
now it won't work or if you do like a
greater version it won't work as well
gah the next thing we have in our
extension is the name of the extension
and what is the name of the extension it
is the name which appears first of all
on your expecting page when you launch
it on your store and secondly it appears
right here in your Chrome extension URL
now the next thing is description
explanatory the description is placed
underneath the title the version as you
can see besides the title and the
browser action or browser action is
something important browser action is
what that tells Google Chrome that when
I click on this icon then what should be
the default pop-up that means what
should be the default HTML file to show
up and here's we have pop dot HTML now
when we click on this
then it shows hello world a supposingly
if I change the path of this to an
invalid file
if I click on this it will simply show
me page not found as you can see this
webpage is not found so default pop-up
is a file which pops up when you click
on your extension in the toolbar default
icon is the icon of your toolbar just to
default icon and give it your icon
permissions permissions are something
important these are the permissions
required by your extension like the
chrome resources the active tab means
the URL and all that stuff required for
extension I'll have a separate tutorial
for the permissions because as we learn
Google Chrome extension development will
learn what permissions are and why they
are required just for now let's see what
permissions are required for my adblock
so if you want to see the permissions
required by a specific extension click
on details as you can see permissions
here it says read and change all your
data on the websites you wizard
let's see what required by dad lockers
it says the same don't drag me Google
only on the google.com size unlike that
okay so coming to some other and other
commands we have let me see what is
useful here
with accessible resources we learn in
future tutorials what is this because it
needs some explanation was your name is
not necessary update URL not necessary
not necessary storage
content scripts not content scripts in
JavaScript are something which runs in
the context of the browser in the next
tutorial in the next reel I promise I'll
explain the three scopes of scripting in
JavaScript and Google Chrome extension
one of them is content script I'll
explain content scripts as well in the
next tutorial so for now let's leave
content script but it is very important
and chrome URL overrides this basically
this commands help you to create new tab
extensions like if I create like I have
already done an extension let me check
yeah this one so in this extension I'm
using actually this chrome URL overrides
and if you see if I click on new tab
then it overrides my default extension
page or basically the about the new page
and shows a custom new tab page as you
can see the titles also change to fresh
boards and I disable this this is my
default new tab page as you can see
right now
okay so using Chrome URL overrides we
can do much of the stuff then the rest
is browser action and paid action the
you'll need to give only one of those
browser action is similar to page action
icons icons is used here like icons or
icons right here I'll give a comma to
like 64 the 64 by 64 icon is used here
the 16 by 16 icon is used here in the
contextual menu if you right click on
the page and for example this extension
javascript disabled err is using 16 by
16 icon here and 32 by 32 is also use
somewhere I don't know
so 16 by 16 64 by 64 like this you
specify your extension size and here you
specify your path of the extension for
example if I do icon dot PNG and just
reload this page as you can see the 64
by 64 though the container is 64 by 64
but the icon is relativity small
relatively small so it does not fill the
full container for example this icon is
64 by 64
okay so I guess that's all for this
tutorial this much is good for you to
start
as I'll discuss the three contexts of
scripts in Java scar in Google Chrome
extension
