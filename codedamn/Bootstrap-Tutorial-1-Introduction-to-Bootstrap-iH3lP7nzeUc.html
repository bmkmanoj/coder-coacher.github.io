this is me hole and welcome to your very
first bootstrap tutorial now in this
tutorial are basically in this whole
series of bootstrap tutorials we'll be
looking at how you can develop beautiful
elegant and responsive web pages with
this framework now to begin with what
the heck is a framework now bootstrap a
framework is simply a collection of some
CSS and JavaScript files and these files
would help you to code beautiful
webpages online because as you can guess
these files come with inbuilt classes
and plugins from JavaScript beautiful
designs buttons model boxes and so on
and so forth so how do you get started
well before even starting with this
bootstrap series I highly recommend you
if you don't know HTML and CSS or
JavaScript then you should go back to my
playlist and watch all these three and
then come back and I'll be happy to
continue ok for those who are ready
let's go now first of all go to this
website get bootstrap calm and I
probably think by the time you'll watch
this video because it's December 14
right now this bootstrap 4 would have
been launched already so if it is
launched then don't worry because all
these tutorials which I'm making are
valid for bootstrap 4 as well and maybe
by the time I'm creating some tutorials
then when the bootstrap is launched then
I would switch over to bootstrap 4 so
you don't need to worry about that
because currently you can see that the
current version is three point three
point six and bootstrap for is coming
real soon so let's get started now first
of all go to this website get bootstrap
calm click on this download bootstrap
button it'll take you to a page now here
you have two options either the either
the download button or the bootstrap
Syrian I would recommend you to use the
bootstrap Syrian because Syrian as you
should probably know is a content
delivery network and bootstrap would
host host all the files for you and your
website now these attributes you see
integrity and cross origin are basically
just new in html5 and these would just
let your browser know that this resource
right here which you're loading has not
been tampered because if it is then
browser won't run this anyways now just
copy all these files go to any text
editor you like I like sublime and then
just square a simple html5 document
all right so now we have this document
ready and I'll go ahead and paste all of
these files which you brought with
yourself and make sure you push these
link files and the title and I would
just recommend you to get rid of these
as well because you know you can just
deploy them when you are working on so
but it's of no use right now because
obviously I know nobody Stamper in my
network here you go okay so now we have
our very first cut off you can say a
bootstrap layout ready so if I say like
div class container and it will all feel
like HTML because bootstrap is an HTML
framework this is my first container and
if I just open this file somehow in
Chrome
then you see that it kind of looks
strange because okay so it requires
jQuery not a problem
I got this so you can load the chick
where you want as well right here make
sure to append the HTTP because we are
working on file protocol no yeah yeah so
error is gone I can see this looks kind
of strange then you would type this is
my first container in your regular HTML
because if you see if I get rid of this
and these ones as well then you can see
that that's how it looks but obviously
since bootstrap adds a bit of styles to
the document you can see how this
container is customized
and as you can see as well it takes a
bit of time to load this document
because it is downloading those files
from the CDN seems like a bit of problem
with my network yeah I guess there's a
bit of problem here
whoa
okay so you see that this container you
see a lot of styles here all of these
are applied by bootstrap so we just
through our roofers program with
bootstrap framework in HTML and we will
do a lot more in the coming tutorials so
if you like this one then don't forget
to subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
