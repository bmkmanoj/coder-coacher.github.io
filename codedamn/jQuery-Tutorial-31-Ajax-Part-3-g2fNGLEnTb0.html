31st jquery-ajax tutorial in which will
be continuing with our Jack's which we
have been doing past two tutorials and
in this tutorial I'll be telling you
something about get and post a JAX
methods in jquery so let's have a look
at what each of them do so first of all
go ahead and type dollar don't get just
like we used to do okay so one thing I'm
tell you guys which I forgot to tell and
the last tutorial is that we also
specify something else type it's a good
practice to specify that so all of you
geeks which already know about type then
I won't waste your time but for those
who don't know what an HTTP type request
is now for now simply just understand
that HTTP has various types of requests
you can perform and get and post or just
two of them so for just a simple example
whenever you type a URL in your URL box
of the browser to be precise the omnibox
and hit enter then you are always you
are always performing a get request but
sometimes like when you submit a form
like your registration form or your
login form on any of the website then
most of the times you are performing a
post request but it depends on the
website sometimes they do perform get
through twists as well so you can just
consider these to get and post as just a
method of transporting data on the HTTP
protocol so I'll just know
go into deep about these two in this
tutorial because that would stretch it a
lot so I'll just go and would explain
you this something like whenever you
just want to retrieve data you would
probably use get and whenever you want
to like submit the data and retrieve the
response as well you probably use boost
but that's not the case all of the time
I am just talking about the journal
trend so let's start it with get
function now get would accept mainly two
arguments first one is the URL then
second one is a call back since this
function is asynchronous you can't just
do like our response is this thing and
then you can just do your stuff with
response no that won't work because this
goes down here would execute before even
this request is complete and synchronous
HTTP Ajax threads are deprecated on
major browsers because of performance
issues so all of these jquery functions
are asynchronous so for now I'll just
type HTTP google com ad I know guys this
won't work on your PC because you know
in the first tutorial of this exact
thing which is the 29th or 20 years
maybe I told you that I enabled the
chrome insecure or the vulnerable kind
of thing you can see with the flags of
grown WebKit
some security features disabled which
allows me to have cross domain Ajax
requests so if you are getting errors if
you're going to get errors don't worry
because that should not work even on
your product production site because not
only you are not allowed to load files
from the file protocol you are even not
allowed to load files from a different
domain other than your domain now all of
the stuff is done for security reasons
and if you think hard enough then you
will realize that this thing is very
important for security to maintain the
security because otherwise it would
cause a lot of security implications so
but for now I have the access to all of
the security breaches so why not enjoy
that so I'll just pass a data argument
right here and let's say I just done
this into a text area because when I
will load the data into a div tag then
it will pass it automatically into HTML
so I'll just say
text area dot HTML data ok now I could
even play start as text but let's see
what happens so I'll just get back to
the browser
so here this and that is probably not
working with we have got some text in
that so I'll just turn the simple text
and let's see what happens let's reload
this
okay so okay all right so I got the text
so you see right here in this text area
I've got the source code of google com
and however God this I have got this
with the help of a get request and I can
verify you dad for you guys by just
going to the network tabs reloading this
page and this is probably hanging
because the source code is you so you
see that this is a get request you see
here and next I'm going to tell you i'm
going to show you real quick what is
post now post would just work like the
gate but you could actually pass your
arbitrary data here so i'll just show
you we could do that but that won't make
any sense to the google so let's just
say i have data text here just show you
what does that do so right here if you
see then we have on this response
nothing else for the jacks request and
i'll just reload this
and you see that right here I got status
code of four or five method not allowed
because I have a request method of post
now you see that this is doing like
request method post is inappropriate for
the URL that's all we know because
Google technically don't allow post
request from the users so I could just
try to do my own site to show you guys
now let's reload this because my style
is good and nice so it does allow post
request so you see that I've retrieved
my site with the help of a post and the
difference
here you go and the form data you see
that data text is visible now actually I
could retrieve this data at my site as
well if I have some valid PHP code to do
that so that's the technical difference
between or get and a post request and
you could do exactly these things with
the Ajax request as well by just
specifying the type inside the exact
subject but you know just these two
methyls give you quick access to get on
the post request because these two are
the most common commonly used so that's
it for this tutorial and I don't know
maybe what we will doing that what we'll
be doing in the next tutorial that
should be a surprise for you guys that's
it for now and it's late night here so
I'm gonna go to sleep now so that's it
I'll see you then next time don't forget
