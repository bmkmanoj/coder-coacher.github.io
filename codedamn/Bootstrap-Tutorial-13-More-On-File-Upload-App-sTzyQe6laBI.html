your 13 bootstrap tutorial on mijo and
in this tutorial we'll be I guess we'll
be hooking up with some JavaScript API
to weed file on the client-side itself
and display a nice little image so let's
get started now first of all let's just
quickly style this boy up a little bit
and just give it an idea of oh no this
one this one ID of or you can just name
it
file and right here input name equals
file and what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna grab an image from Internet right
there you see I got this from somewhere
and I'm just gonna set some width and
some height on a background of this
image right there you see let's just
check this out looks extremely bad I
don't know what's for that but never
mind and I guess I can't hide this
button while I'm using this image as a
background so we need to do something
else let's just name it div dot upload
button and let's just throw it inside a
upload button make sure you don't have
that already in use alright alright
alright
okay Oh wrong button that's kinda
strange because I'm feeling sleepy and
you know I'm just not paying 100%
attention but don't worry I won't teach
anything wrong all right so now what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna hide this
button just would should be funded
portion of experiment right as well and
wanna just absolutely this boy and of
course the code should always be there
and this upload button it means a kind
of tuning first of all give it a
position of relative so the file button
doesn't just go and crazy dimensions and
then I need a background size
hundred-percent looks good at a height
of I guess
perfect
yep so we have got the dimensions ready
here you go so now we have this upload
button why not just through a course
Russ will add that here you go here you
go what the heck
whoa that strange delicious opacity to
zero and cursor:pointer as well my bad
alright okay so now the next thing we
need to do is we need to work with
JavaScript and whenever the user selects
a image file then what I want to do is I
want to display a small little you know
the view of what his or she's uploading
here right here in the center and to do
that we can make use of JavaScript so
let's get started now I'm just gonna add
a script here only because I'm too lazy
to do anything else and I guess I need
to add it here after the loading of
jQuery okay so what I want to do is I
want when the document is ready which
obviously is by now but why take a
chance I want whenever this file oh we
don't have any ID for this too bad there
you go bro you've got an ID file
whenever this is changed I want to cut
off console.log this because actually I
don't know what I'm doing so let's just
give it a try let's just try this image
I with the console well that isn't very
helpful what I would prefer is test dot
files
okay so that's interesting all right so
we have got all of this information
right here and what I want to do is I
want to make use of a file reader now
what is a fine Widow a file reader is
basically a JavaScript object and this
would allow you to read your image file
binary by binary and this would help you
to convert your image into a base64
image which would be then displayed on
your web page without uploading without
being uploaded to a server so this is
our file reader since this is an
asynchronous we need to add a function
this function would accept your image or
whatever you want to call that now I
want somewhere to receive this image so
what I'm gonna do is I am just gonna say
that this class image uploaded or not
here's the display of your image and
this is IMG SRC black dude ID blank IMG
for now and that's pretty much it
because we are going to populate this
SRC from here so whenever this reader is
loaded I want first of all
this to be visible instantaneously I
just don't want any fix right now so
just display:none this right now and the
next thing I want to do is I want this
boy to have an attribute of SRC
and what SR she C should be sorry it
should be the target don't result okay
and finally I want reader dot read as
data URL and what I want to read
obviously I would like to read file dot
files remember that since we are already
working with file we can just make use
of this so this dot files and since I
have only one you know option to upload
only one image at a time so I just can
make use of this so let's take a look
how that works and debug any errors if
found okay so looks pretty good but
obviously is it the best because a
larger image would overflow with the
dimensions you can just load this one so
seems good but not the best
so we'll be fixing this up again in the
next tutorial so for this tutorial
that's it and don't forget to subscribe
