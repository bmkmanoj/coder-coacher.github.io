and welcome to the 39th angularjs
tutorial in which we'll be looking at
some of the most common directive
definition object properties now hang on
there is nothing fancy about going on
here the directive definition object or
simply the object which I prefer to say
is just this thing we are returning in
this directive so though it might look a
bit of technical kind of thing but you
know it's just simple object which is
being returned here our it is just
called a directive definition object and
so yeah so one property we have already
looked at and that is the template now
there are a lot of properties as well in
here and I'm just going to show you some
of them right now so first of all what
this template did is it just created or
just filled our directive with some HTML
or you can say the whatever you write
the text here the next thing we can have
just like we used to have in routers is
the template URL now with template URL
you can actually supply a file name here
whatever file or whatever you want to
load and it would just fill your
directive with that file now currently
I'm not doing this I'm not showing you
this because I'm on I'm running the
script on a file protocol and you know a
Jack's request don't work well with the
file protocol so yeah so that won't work
pretty much you can see that so you can
try it on your localhost or your on your
own web server if you want to but you
know that would just work so the next
thing is the restrict property not
restrict what it does is for example
right now if I just comment this out and
just create the template only just fill
it with
hello world again so what happens is
that your directive this directive right
here
is reload this directive is you know you
can just add it as an attribute or you
can do it like my first script as a
individual separate tag in HTML so both
ways would work it would work so you can
see that it works with this tag as well
the separate tag with the directive name
and it works with any attribute as an
attribute as well
so like that so you can see that it
works
so in some scenarios what you want to do
is you would like to have your directive
restricted to only the attribute version
or the element version or the tag which
I was saying so what you can do is
inside this restrict what you can do and
just create e that stands for element or
a that stands for attribute now I must
tell you guys this thing as well that
there are a couple of ways I guess more
to you know just load your expression or
your directives in your HTML file and
one of them includes the class one and
the other
either I guess was the comment one so
you you're going to have directive and
then all of your code here now these two
are not so much popular so you know I'm
just not going to cover them because all
of the things we do with the the tag
directive and the attribute directive
would be sufficient for us for now so
yeah so about talking about this what we
can do is if I type restrict this to e
just a comma right here right and I'm
loading it as an attribute so see that
we don't get anything because
I have restricted it to e but if I
change it to a and reload you see I got
the text and if being that on a I change
it to a tag directive and reload you see
that I still get nothing because this is
on the a on the an if you want to you
know just allow it for tag or attribute
you can just like e EI and ei means
element as well as attribute but what's
the difference between this and this is
that with restrict ei you you cannot
access your directive with which the
methods which I told you the couple of
methods which included the comment one
and the style one so you can access your
directive like that if you use restrict
to ei okay so so these were some of the
properties which I have discussed so far
and there are some more those includes
like you know scope the scope is the one
property which I would be covering in a
much detail later on so for now for the
story yeah so that's pretty much it
to begin with and we'll be looking at
some more properties real soon so don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
