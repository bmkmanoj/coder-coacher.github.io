hole and welcome to your ninth at my
script tutorial in which I'm going to
show you the usage of spread operators
so we already took a look at what spread
operator is in the last tutorial but in
this tutorial I'm going to show you what
is the actual use of that so let's just
say you have an array of their languages
as HTML CSS JavaScript es6 why not and
angular let's just say then we have an
array of let's just say several
languages as PHP ASP c-sharp Java rails
like that now I have an array another
are a full-stack languages so I want all
of these languages in here as well so
obviously I won't do something like this
and this obviously because the this
would create two separate arrays so I
need to somehow join these two arrays
and create a single array well and
Atmospheric 5 or the traditional
JavaScript which we do right now you
know this would take a bit of time and
work to do but with es6 this is a
cakewalk so how do we do that well in
es6 what you need to do that what you
need to do eventually just write web
languages three dots and web languages
comma three dots and so our languages
that's very much it if I just
console.log this full stack Lang and
reload this you can see that we get a
full stack array so what's happening
here
well these three dots are the spread
operator and the basically the spread up
sped up
sorry and instead of just outputting it
like an array they opened this array
while still maintaining it as an array
so similarly we are doing the same thing
here we're just spreading up the re and
then this combines into a single array
now again if you want to like if you if
you have another array of war let's just
say computer programming C C++ or when
32 api's or whatever whatever the else
here is so if you want to push this area
as well into disarray and you just
forget to do it right here
so what you can do is you can again go
ahead and write push and then just do
like that so this would push the three
values and the three RS into disarray so
far we just reload as you can see we get
this now you can do the same thing with
functions as well so if you have a
function like arg1 arg2 and then you can
have rest of the arguments so you can
just do like console.log rest and right
here what I can do is or just name this
at least my function and right here what
I can do is I can just call it with any
number of arbitrary arguments given that
I have at least supplied two arguments
so if I reload this as you can see one
and two were the arguments inside this
arg1 and arg2
and three to nine are inside an array
which is the rest re and again if I just
leave it like this
then I'll get a blank area like that so
that's not a problem so you can just
operate with some values
in the function if you like to and
that's really much it what we can do
this operator and it's not only limited
to this but you'll use this quite off on
a bit and ACMA script six so that's all
for this tutorial and I'll see you then
in the next one so don't forget to
