your 20th shake or a tutorial in which
we'll be looking at a CSS kind of
selector which is inert child now if you
have ever been working with CSS then
this tutorial should be a cakewalk for
you and you can probably skip this
tutorial if you already know what any
child is but for those out there who
don't know what is any child and how it
works then this little reel is for you
so in very basic terms a net child is
kind of a CSS selector which is a
flexible one and allows you to basically
work just like the EQ one which we
learned in the previous tutorial but
I'll show you how a nutshell is more
flexible and has a greater advantage
over EQ in this tutorial so let's see
let's create another list best for this
and let's say hey buddy
I am odd
so let's create some copies of this but
we have odd-even
then even I hope you caught the logic
first and I number one is odd and we
have number two as evil and then we have
number three as odd that number four has
even I'm talking about the number of
others here so first a lie which is the
one a lie is even then second alive
which is the two Li is sorry one is odd
then two is even and like that
basic math so let's undo this they got
to go now in the script section let's
say I want to select the first Alliance
so well EQ what we used to do is Li
equal zero text now when we alert this X
we will get the text inside this let's
let this avocat hey buddy I'm hot
because the first one is odd now
similarly it would work with the inner
child
but in any child you have to write it
inside the selector and one thing
different of any child from EQs in EQ
the indexing starts from zero like first
element is zero for EQ then second is
one then third is two and like that but
in any child it works like the mouth
style so in edit the first one would be
the first one actually so a nut child
one is first element and a child 2 is
second element so like that it works
basically you don't have anything like
any child zero so let's see this let's
reload this and we get the same results
hey buddy I'm odd because the first
child which is the first element of Li
is odd so what the heck and why the heck
am i teaching us and the main difference
between this tutorial and the previous
tutorial start of this concept with the
help of inner child we can do pretty
much like a variable selection for
example
let's say let's create some more or less
let's say odd even odd even odd so I
have no idea how many they are
so anyways that ain't important but
let's say if I want to select every
second align down here for example this
one then this one then this one then
this one and basically all the old or
the even Elias basically so how would I
do that is I'll write variable X then Li
and child not follow this carefully in
this to supply a variable argument we do
like use of the keyword n now this end
keyword is very special this end letter
because it specifies two kind of for
example if I supplied to and now it says
first of all the CSS would find the
number of elements the number of
Alliance in the document it says there
are one two three four five six seven
eight elements and
so this condition would run eight times
so in first run and would be what so
this selector would be 2 into 1 which is
2 in the second run second run and would
be 2 then this would be 4 in the third
round and would be 3 this would be doing
to end which is 23 into 6 and this would
keep on running unless Li and child is
greater than the total length so
basically with Li and child to end what
we are doing is we are targeting every
second element or basically every even
element in the Li list so let's see
let's get the texture of this or let's
just apply some background let's just
remove this and will you CSS basically
not the background background yellow so
let's see what happens now
here's our browser let's reload this and
as you can see every second Li element
is having a background of yellow so this
n means that if you just write two then
it would target on the second element
but if you use n then it would target
only not only the second element but
every second element that is all the
even elements if you write to n plus one
now I guess you know now so what happens
here is in the first run it target this
targets the first element which is one
element because n becomes zero that
right now
then it targets the target this targets
basically blah blah blah then it targets
the third element because 2 into 1 plus
1 is 3 so 1 2 3 then into next one the n
becomes 2 then 2 into 2 4 plus 1 is 5 1
2 3 4 5 will go like that
so what would happen if I just use n
here so n would literally mean that
target all the elements so this kind of
statement is equal to this only so
basically
and the child has a greater advantage
over EQ in terms of speed because
Annette child is a dorm API as a CSS
property instead of jQuery and EQ is a
jQuery method so it is comparatively
slower than the inbuilt door method and
any child allows you to have variable
input without using much of the code so
that's how you walk with a net child I
hope you liked this tutorial and if you
have then don't forget to subscribe and
keep watching I'll see you then next
