your very first MongoDB tutorial Madame
Esme hole and what MongoDB is it's a
relatively new york kid in the market
then its competitors like MySQL or other
databases
well this MongoDB is a database it's a
kind of database where you can store
your data but it's kind of different if
you are coming from databases like MySQL
because MongoDB is a no SQL database
that means that it does not need SQL to
run query commands or retrieving data or
insertion data plus MongoDB is way too
fast it's faster than MySQL and as the
reason is that it it is built on
asynchronous working so you know it just
handles multiple things at a single time
well there comes drawbacks with this
much speed but that's kinda not to be
considered if you are you know not to
just shutting down your computer in the
middle of your data copying process or
even after a few seconds so you
shouldn't be caring about that well
anyways what I wanted to tell you guys
in this tutorial is that in this whole
series of MongoDB you're gonna learn a
lot about MongoDB and how to work with
it and pretty much how you can set up a
database retrieve data from MongoDB
using different languages like PHP or
you can just go with full mean stack as
well you can make use of nodejs
you can make use of PHP and pretty much
any language which allows communication
with databases and supported libraries
so yeah so that is all for this tutorial
and in the next tutorial I'm gonna show
you how to set up MongoDB and get
started with it so if you like this then
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching and then I'll see you in
the next one real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
