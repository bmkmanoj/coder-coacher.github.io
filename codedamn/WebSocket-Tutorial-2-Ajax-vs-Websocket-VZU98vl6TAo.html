Mei who and welcome to your second
WebSockets development tutorial in which
I want to discuss a little about what is
the difference between a jacks and
WebSockets and where you might need what
right so let's say that you are in home
with your brother or sister and the
other guy except you is sleeping right
and you want to eat a chocolate and your
brother or sister knows where the
chocolate is kept
let's assume your brother right so now
you go and wake up your brother and ask
him where the chocolate is right so he
just wakes up tells you go to fridge
Annie sleeps right so you go to fridge
and then from there you call your
brother again and he wakes up he tells
you open the door and he sleeps right
you opened the fridge door and again you
call your brother then he wakes up he
says that just look in the last rack or
something and he sleeps so it goes on
four five six times right unless you
find the chocolate now this is kind of
you know not very practical because it
is slow first of all and the second
thing is that you are exchanging
unnecessarily a lot of data like you
need to call your brother a lot of times
actually it's not required when it's not
required
so what sockets do is that they keep
your brother alive I mean just awake
right so they keep the brother awake so
your brother and you have instantaneous
communication not instantaneous
obviously there's always some sort of
delay but it can be referred as
real-time right so you are communicating
with your brother in real time your
brother is not sleeping and your brother
can actually
flight like thousands and tens of
thousands of concurrent Corrections
depending upon his hardware
configuration you know you get the idea
what I'm trying to talk about
so what sockets do is that they keep a
TCP layer or a UDP layer stable alive
and usable for data exchange right
unless any one side disconnects either
the server or the client so what
essentially WebSockets are is that they
allow us to use JavaScript to or
actually yeah
WebSockets allow JavaScript to use the
WebSockets
built in modules to access a WebSocket
online and send and receive data that's
pretty much it and that could do wonders
if you are working on you know the next
big chat application or whatever you
want do have such as a real-time
communication system right so
implementing WebSockets is pretty handy
just have like you do have something
known as like your sock is new WebSocket
and then your WebSocket protocol and
some address where your WebSocket is so
we're going to do all of this
interesting stuff in the next tutorial
so that is all for the story --all and
if you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one real
quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
