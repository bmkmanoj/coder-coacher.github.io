Mei hole and welcome to your 18 angular
tutorial in which we are going to finish
off with our login application a very
basic one implemented using angular and
angular routing and would be
implementing angular service right so
what I'm going to do is hop over to my
command line and I'm going to say ng
generate service let's just name it user
and hit enter so you can see that it
generates a service but it wants me that
the service is generated but it must be
provided to be used right so that is
okay so we can go to this user service
now and pretty much see that it has Gaul
got a constructor for now and what we
can do is we can go ahead and say that
this is private is user logged in if you
click false or we can say fry rate or
let's just initialize these values in
constructor let's just say user name for
now so we're going to say is user is the
user logged and or rather this studies
user logged in is equal to false right
so we can say this has the set user
logged in and return this dot or rather
just set this studies user login to true
and we can against that you get user log
N and just return this dot is user
logged in property right so we have got
the service now what we want to do is go
to our app modules and inside air inside
providers I want to fast then this
service as user user or we have user
service right so we can pass in user
service in here and we can import the
service as well
in food user service from user service
right and now if you take a look then we
have our user service available with us
inside our whole application so now we
can do is go to our login component and
we can say then adding set constructor
we get another dependency which is
private private the user and we pass
this other user service so that angular
knows and again we can just import user
service from user dot service just like
that and it's actually right there right
ok so now we have our user service with
us so what I'm going to do is pretty
much stay inside login user if user name
is this and this I'm going to call user
dot set user logged in which is probably
I think this study user right was the
property name so if we can just close
all of this right so we can just open
the service set user logged in is the
name ok all right so I went over and
created a service but don't worry about
that we'll be learning about service in
more detail later on but we just need a
very simple service right now and what
the service basically would do is pretty
much it would maintain a state for a
user so that we our application could
know that the users actually logged in
and the service would be same inside all
the components if we want to include so
now we can just go ahead and include it
in our dashboard component again so I'm
just going to go with this one and say
why rate users and this is just a
dependency injection to let angular know
that you have to insert this dependency
right here right so we use a risk
correct name and we can just import user
service from user Dalek service like
that and then what we can say now what
I'm going to do next is actually create
a god so a god as the name suggests
actually gods your route against you
know unauthorized access in our case so
what if God would pretty much do is that
it would create it would actually create
a check before the route actually takes
place right so if you have done angular
1 somewhere then you really must know
that you used to have results there you
still with them do have results here but
they are very much gold as gods right
now so to generate a god what we're
going to do is again go back to our
terminal and inside here I'm going to
run it ng generate God and let's just
say auth card we name it right so again
I'm not going to go a lot into details
into gods right now we're going to cover
that as a separate topic but since we
need it for our login applications so
I'm just going to quickly go through
over it so if you take a look at what
angle it has generated for us it's this
odd guard file right so it automatically
implements this can activate method
which is actually fired before our route
transition takes place right so if can
activate returns false for our route
then the route would be stopped so
that's pretty much what's left for us to
implement and before implementing that
what I want to do is actually finally go
to our routes which is in our app module
and right with the dashboard I want to
say
can activate is another property and I
want to pass it with the odds Scott is
that what we have or god god okay so I
added this god but anyways let's just go
with that only now so this is odd God
God and I can just input the same thing
from Oh God God like that and we can
just put a comment there so now we are
ready to rock and roll
into our dad and inside its definition
what I'm gonna say is that to actually
implement a lot of stuff so that we can
implement one more thing and that would
be our private user which is user
session one last time or is that what we
named it user service rate so we can now
just input user service from user dot
service I guess that's what it was
right so now what we can say or rather
not this one not like that we have to do
that inside our constructor constructor
like that and now we can pretty much
access return this dot user dot inside
our user service we can say get user
logged in right okay
so now if you see our app we can pretty
much try to go to dashboard and you
would see that we get an error so we
have to add this rider into provider as
well and there we go so if we now try to
go into dashboard
you would see very much that we got
nothing and instead we are not shown
anything because our route is actually
canceled right from the odd guard so
when it returns false
it pretty much cancels our road so if I
try to reload the app and I do like
admin admin and hit login you can see
that we get your authenticated go back
and if we try to pretty much reload this
app and again go to dashboard you would
see that it does not work it throws us
back to the previous page because of
this god implemented so that is how
pretty much we can create a very basic
application login application with
angular and yes so that's all for this
one and you would find all the code in
the description and we're gonna
implement or we're going to discuss
about services and gods later on in
depth in this angular series so don't
worry about that if you do not even you
know if you have if you are like
confused that what God is used for what
services are used for then don't worry
about that we're going to again take a
deeper look into that later on in the
service so that's all for this one and
if you liked it then please don't forget
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
