toriel in which I'm gonna show you how
to retrieve some data on your node side
from the other side with the help of
post so let's take a look at this now I
would just copy and paste the code from
script 17 here you go Alexis get rid off
this method right there now one thing
you might not have noticed is that this
is the get is the method so this is the
same as I am writing 19 yes as you can
see if I just open my developer tools
and reload this page you can see this is
the same request method as this one so
if I write a post and then pretty much
the same code but would get replaced
with post so what happens now is that if
I somehow manage to change this request
method to post then this code will
execute where this can be any sort of
different code from this one so now we
have two methods defined for a single
page and that is the first code runs for
a get method and the second code runs
for a post method so what I'm gonna do
is I'm just gonna get rid of this file
right there and for the get matter
let's just go to files index and create
a form I'm just gonna say action to
whole bit only and then method is post
alright okay so it doesn't have
autocomplete I guess so the next thing
I'm just gonna create a simple input
type text' name first name and one I'll
just read the user your good name and
then finally we have this input type
submit just be are just VR
anyways alright so if I just run this
right now you can see we get something
like this
so this is obviously on a get request so
okay now the thing is that in this
eventually we are using a very new
version of node and Express so what
happens is that for this to manage post
requests we need to install a middleware
now a middleware is basically nothing
but something that just takes over
control for a while and then sends the
output to your browser so if you have a
server like this then the server's
processing this code then you kind of
installed something known as a
middleware which is an external sort of
code which is not bundled with the
official framework you can say and then
this code the server passes the score to
middleware and this middleware then do
some magic processes discord whatever
and then sends it back to the browser so
that's pretty much it how it works so
now to work with the post response how
to get that what we need is a middleware
and that middle layer is the body parser
and we install that just go to your
terminal get rid of that right NPM
install body parser and I guess we don't
need the safe oh my god I guess I didn't
did a tutorial on this package store
JSON file alright so yeah so I guess we
are missing a tutorial on that so don't
worry I'll just do a package on the JSON
tutorial soon after understand with this
stuff so for now just use NPM install
body parser and hit enter let it install
and let's just assume yeah so this is
installed all right so now we can just
go ahead and make use of that in our
code let's just write lar body parser
equals require body our sir no not the
camel casing there you go now
one more thing I need to do is to do
something like this app that use body
parcel now what this does is is
basically this is that for all the
routing for this Express make use of
this thing right there so this literally
says that when you are managing some
sort of stuff like post or whatever the
supports then make use make sure that
this thing right here interferes so this
is a middleware for all of that stuff so
you just need to make sure you like
Adaline dot use body parser and once you
have done that now you're good to go now
to do that what we need to do is and
it's gotta say response dot end and how
I wanted to end this request dot body
and you might want it to string if I
string if I there you go alright so
let's just take a look no script
nineteen yes and as you can see it
listens add one two three seven and we
are pretty much doing nothing but just
sending the request or body whatever we
receive so if I reload it right now you
can see we get this thing right there
because obviously for now we are just
running on request method get now let me
write something good awesome
and it summit all right so now you see
that I could probably zoom in so you see
that we get an object as a response and
it says first name is code yes
typo there it's awesome now this is kind
of similar to now which what we have
done in tutorial number 18 like that so
instead of just query we are making use
of the body so you can now just probably
create your own login applications and
you can just do something like this if
request dot body taught username is
admin and you know the password is this
and that then do that and this otherwise
just just throughout the user you can do
all of that stuff so basically that's
how your could just make that a valid
piece of code again alright so basically
that's how you get and post the or
actually you get the get and post data
on your server and in the next tutorial
probably I'll be covering the
package.json file most probably if I
don't have any other things in mind and
then we'll be looking what we'll be
doing so yeah so that's all for this one
