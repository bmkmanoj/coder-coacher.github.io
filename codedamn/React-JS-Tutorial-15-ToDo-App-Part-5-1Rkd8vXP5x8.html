Mei hole and welcome to your 15 to react
us tutorial in which I'm going to show
you how you can save your tasks to the
local storage so that you know you don't
get every time the same task when you
reload your page right so we are going
to implement that using local storage
and all modern browsers support that so
that's not a problem now so what we're
going to do is actually first of all
we're going to query the local storage
if there's any data available to it so
that we can use that and if not then
we'll just fall back to a task list so
we can say that the word task is
actually local storage dot get item we
can say stored stuff or something like
that
so if tasks that means there's something
right there that means it exists then
we're going to say task list is equal to
0 n dot first and that now what this is
going to do is that in local storage you
have to store everything at a string so
local storage does set item if you see
its definition actually it's not it's
kind of like key and value your value
would be your string value right it
cannot be anything else like an object
or something local store is just above
string for now so we're going to store
our task at string and we're just gonna
get it by json.parse right so a task
list it's just one parse that would be
good you can just convert it into one
line or as well I'm just preferring
readability right now so okay looks good
so on the first one obviously this is
not going to run because this returns
undefined or empty or whatever so we're
going to fall back to task one two and
three now what we are going to do is
actually when we update these tasks when
we change the state we want to update
the local storage so we can essentially
call update local storage here
here as well and we can just create
update local storage we can say that our
actually we can just pass in the subject
as well why do we need to just query the
state again right that makes sense
so we can just say in local storage dot
set item and obviously local storage
would be available for react as well
what is our key stored tasks and I want
to json dot parse this array get it task
right and there we go or we can just say
console.log save the task right there
and they're all ready to do so if I like
add bring milk hit enter and we get
another update local storage is not
defined because we are listening this
would just write and there we go bring
milk ok unexpected token tea and she
also in position zero not a problem we
can see what we have here you'll see
task 1 task 2-3 oh no no no it's just
one dot stringify sorry it should not be
just on the past 10 true you can see
that we get nothing updated tough yeah
okay class updated something like that
right and now if I reload you can see
our list is pretty much still the same
if I remove some tasks reload unless the
still the same so that's pretty much how
you create a basic app and what I'm
thinking is that it might be good that
the tasks are actually a bit at the top
instead of going to bottom so what we
can do instead is instead of push we can
say this
unchipped as far as I remember now if I
add a task you can see that our tasks
are added at the top instead of bottom
and yeah that's all for this one and
that's how you pretty much create a very
basic react.js app now I know it's just
a skeleton ass no CSS nothing styling
and you cannot take this life but you
know you can just make use of bootstrap
I want to keep the code asked here as as
minimal as possible so that it just
works fine and you're able to see what
is happening so I'm just going to put
this code and I don't know on my form or
something so that you can just copy it
and try it out or you know you can just
copy this code and just use some
bootstrap and all that stuff and post a
link of link of fiddle in the
description so that you know I will just
make this on my available on the forum
as well so that's all for this one and
if you like this then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
