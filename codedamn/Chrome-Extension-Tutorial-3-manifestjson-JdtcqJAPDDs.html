May ho and welcome to your third Chrome
extension tutorial and as you can see I
am back on Windows from my sweet two day
tutorial journey on Mac here and the
reason is that because actually I was
unable to configure microphone with
macbook air so yeah so I got a lot of
feedback that the audio quality and
actually the audio level was low and I
guess to boost the audio I have to
actually place my mouse on the side of
the Mac but the calf doesn't work that
way because then I'm just not able to
type anything and it kind of is very
hard to configure external microphone
with MacBook Air I thought that you
cannot configure that because there's
only one boot on the left side which
just kind of says it's headphone but
when I read online that I've found then
where you can you can just plug in your
microphone and should work and I plugged
in my microphone and it didn't work then
I googled it a bit and I found that you
need a special sort of a doctor to work
with that and all that kind of crap
it took three four hours and finally I
concluded that let's just do this on
Windows so here we are and I have just
pretty much done a gift flown of the
same repository we did in the last
tutorial so we're going to take a look
at basically what this manifesto JSON
file is so what happens is that Chrome
needs some file from sort of files to
actually learn about what your extension
is what resources it needs what its
title should be description this version
and what it's very much doing what's
what permission let's need the the
extension requires and all that stuff
which is kind of basic right so it's
kind of a package store JSON file for
your project if you can link a little
bit so if you take a look in the browser
you see that we have this extension
already in my browser and if you do not
have
this then what you need to do is very
much go do Chrome extensions an able
this developer mode and just load
unpacked extension and just part just
now you get to your part and hit okay
and you would get this hello world holy
moly
right once you get it you should pretty
much see an icon like this in your
system tray and when you click it you
see this is fun because this is fun is
what essentially it says right so we
were talking about this manifesto JSON
file so if we take a look at the docs
which is quite rich and good and its
kind of easy to understand as well but
it's just a little bit cumbersome
because of overwhelming information so
obviously we are never going to make use
of all of these at all at once right so
yeah most of the information right here
is redundant but we're just going to go
over a little briefly what they are so
let's just see so many saves that
manifesto JSON file provides important
information well yeah let's hope and
then it saves us that some things are
required which is this manifest version
- I don't know something happened to one
so they switch to do then there goes our
name which is obviously required for
your extension than the version version
is pretty much something like how your
extensions are you know whatever is your
version of the extension and it's
mandatory to actually update your
version by at least some amount if you
are pushing an update so like if you
start with version 0.1 then in the next
release you cannot go like or maybe if
you start from 0.5 then you cannot go
like 0.4 or 0.3 right you have to
actually increase the version every time
you release an update to your extension
then it says there's some recommended
ones and it says the default location
you can just omit that you can on the
description but it says that it's
recommended to set and these icons
obviously are the icons which you see
here and here all that stuff then
finally we have something as browser
action and browser action is really much
how your extension should
interact with the browser toolbar right
like what should happen when you click
here or basically it's just a high-level
information of what should happen it's
not programming we are not programming
in here what would happen and then it
saves us pick one or none so obviously
do not pick both let me say this
optional information like author
automation and I have no idea what this
automation is actually you have to take
a look at that
so yeah this is just background scripts
and I'm going to come at this background
script section later on then we have the
school settings overrides chrome UI
override and all that good stuff which
we would use apparently in our
applications as we go along then we have
this chrome URL alright and basically
you would need this if you are creating
something like your own new custom tab
or any other thing which chrome provides
a guest bookmarks manager or something
like that but it's majorly used if you
are creating like a new tab for yourself
and that's actually a cool idea and then
we have all of this stuff with some
incognito stuff as well which is cool
and the options page to customize an
options page for extension for example
if you take a look here we do not have
this options enable for this extension
but if you specify this in your medical
JSON file then it would be enabled and
then we get to permissions which is
something important that you need to
specify every permission your extension
uses and then all of the stuff as well
so yeah more or less Chrome extensions
are actually a bit superior to your
regular JavaScript running on the web
page because first of all they have
access to a lot of chrome api's which
are whatsoever not available with the
vanilla J's running on your web page and
chromakey eyes are kind of very powerful
so for example you can break into
iframes
and the modified stuff lie on the live
web site which is obviously not allowed
at all by regulation of script due to
security reasons and there are a lot of
other things you can do with Chrome
extensions so yeah a nutshell pretty
much Chrome extensions are cool and well
I guess we were talking about many first
files right here
so yeah manifest.json file as well is
just a place to start and I guess it
should not be a lot of difficult to
understand what this is so I'm just
going to leave it here so that's all for
this one and in the next tutorial we're
going to get our hands dirty with some
real coding of Chrome extensions so till
then don't forget to subscribe and again
thank you for watching I'll see you then
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
