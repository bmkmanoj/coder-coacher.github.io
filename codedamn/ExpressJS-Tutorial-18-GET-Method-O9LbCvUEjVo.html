and welcome to your 18th nodejs or
rather I should say expressjs tutorial
in which I'm gonna show you how you can
retrieve data to node by the user with
the two most popular methods on HTTP and
those are get and post now I hope you
guys know about these two because they
are the most common and you might have
seen them all the time on internet
because what this get means is actually
that you are just writing a URL here my
website calm and then you are just
passing in a bunch of arguments or the
query parameters whatever you wish to
say that like my file is I don't know
maybe counter-strike condition zero dot
zip and version is Kara right for the
game or not but for the demonstration if
you have a server which just retrieves
these two values and then accordingly
search for database for the same game
with the same version or whatever this
would be here you know you get the idea
so you can just get you can just make
use of this get method to get this now
with post what happens is that the data
is transferred under the hood and the
best example I could give for the post
one which you'll see almost everywhere
is the login forms so any website using
a login form would highly most likely be
a post be doing a post request to the
server for example the example of
Facebook or Gmail Twitter Pinterest or
whatever you can think of all of those
are using post for their login forms to
send the data under the hood because
point number one
it prevents you from just exposing the
data in the URL and point number two if
the website is using HTTPS then it
encrypts your data as well so that's a
plus point so anyways let's get started
now I'm just gonna create a sour again
so I'm just gonna copy this file right
there the script seventeen one and yeah
I should mention this probably that if
you don't want to just write down all of
the code which I do and you just want to
just get the code finally which will be
at the end of the tutorial then you can
just wizard this form URL and inside
under the node.js category or maybe no
just Express yes whatever I named it you
would find all of these files all of
these files right there listed
accordingly so you just don't need to
write any code if you don't want to and
you can just go to this website I have
uploaded all of these files and you can
just pretty much download each and every
file and just take a look and
accordingly whatever you like so in this
application first of all I'm just gonna
get rid of this thing right there and
probably this file system as well so
yeah so now what I'm gonna say is that
all right so this one is index dot HTML
is already this line is returning this
page so what I'm gonna say is that I'm
just gonna send response
end and how I want to end it is like I
want to do a json stringify of request
dot query so let's just see what this is
doing so if I run my notes over no
script 18 yes all right and now with it
the sour you can see
these two curly braces and these two
curly braces actually represent an
object so this is an empty object and
this is represented as a string because
I've made use of this thing right there
so what does this mean actually that
means basically that you don't have any
query string parameters in your URL
let's say first name may hold and Andrew
now as you can see that we get something
like this so this is an object with
first name me--who and last name Mohan
so as you can see this thing right here
I'm sending this thing from back-end so
this thing is already available at the
backend so we have already access to
whatever user is riding here or you know
user is just submitting a form which is
eventually we're adding something here
at the backend so how we can make use of
this well if I just create a simple
application like if I just say what do
you say so if I just say that response
equals hello and then I'm just gonna
concatenated with request dot query dot
first-name send this back request dot
and or basically there should be
response dot and as response all right
so if I just restart this over here and
reload this page as you can see I get
now hello Meho as the message and this
last name is of no use because I'm not
making use of this in my code at all so
you know anything a type here is
being returned as it is so that's how
basically the get method works and you
should probably try to encode whatever
user is writing here into you know you
just don't want the user to randomly
execute some HTML here or rather I
should say anything of which can be just
made to exploit your website because
currently I guess yeah so right here if
you see that we are not mentioning any
sort of return type so I guess it is
falling back to text maybe I don't know
just check this out or you can just set
a response type here as well but what I
mean to just show you guys in this
tutorial is that that's how you retrieve
some data with the get and now about the
post I guess I'll cover that in the next
tutorial so this tutorial was to just
demonstrate how to get data from the
user using this requested query and this
contains an object which contains all of
the information written inside these
query parameters so you can just send
that back on the browser and just play
around and mess with it and once you are
done then go ahead on the next tutorial
and that's pretty much it for this one
so don't forget to subscribe and thank
