final and den tutorial for this website
go down which we have been making
responsive at least you are trying to
make from last 10 tutorials right so
it's at least worth to see on a real
device so I've got my device in here and
I have updated the code as well and as
you have seen that I have replaced this
3 by icon with an image because it was
just giving me a square and I guess I
have told you that in the last video
tutorial but anyway so you can see on my
device it looks pretty good actually in
portrait view if I switch to landscape
view I guess there would be some problem
with the video now but more or less you
should be able to see that as far real
good now right so yeah it looks good on
landscape as well
the menu is working fine as well I can
jump to any section where I want and
again I can hop back to the forest so
that is all and there will be doing
maybe we will be doing another website
if I get to find one so that's all for
this one and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and don't forget to
go to the forum and try out the website
which I have posted and make it
responsive and let's just see you there
unlesss interact with the community
there so that's all for this one and
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
