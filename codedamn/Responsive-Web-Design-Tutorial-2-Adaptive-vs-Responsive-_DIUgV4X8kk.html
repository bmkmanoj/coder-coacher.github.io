Mei hole and welcome to your second
responsive web design tutorial in which
I'm going to start off with the
difference between responsive and
adaptive web design right so you don't
actually need to know about that but in
any case somebody asks you that if your
responsive web designer or an adaptive
web designer which is actually highly
unlikely someone would ask such a lame
question but anyway so what the
difference is actually between these two
terms right you should know the
terminology on the Internet so yes just
our favorite editor and now what
essentially responsive design means is
that when you scale down your screen
little every time the things inside your
website automatically arranges
themselves nicely the grid becomes
shorter and you know everything is cool
adaptive design on the other hand is
like activating a sort of design right
so if this is your website what adaptive
design would look like is that this is a
desktop view this is the tablet view and
this is a phone view now these all these
three are separately programmed and
written into HTML and CSS right so your
HTML could probably just look like is
divided on desktop view and the divide
the tablet view
just close this and again the very
mobile view right so essentially what
you have to do in CSS is just toggle the
IDs as as the weight of the device
changes right so the width is under 650
or I don't know 550 or 720 or whatever
the standard sizes right now these days
you toggle do mobile view you double to
double if you do double to diction of
view and all that stuff right so that is
what adaptive design means responsive
design on the other hand would take care
of the middle numbers as well like 935
pixels right I don't think any standard
device houses for inside of that but
your responsive design would look good
on that as well so your adaptive design
your adaptive website might look
something like this on your 953 pixel
tablet this black this brown or you know
the border which I am drawing right now
is your tablet screen so and yellow is
your website so this yellow website
might look something like this but a
responsive website would look good on
even this weird screen size device as
well so yeah pretty much that is the
difference between an adaptive design
and a responsive design and obviously we
are going to go with responsive design
because adaptive designs are I think
they are sort of you know useless to do
and kind of they're boring as well so
we're going to go with responsive design
and would be adding a lot of styles to
our code and would be doing a lot of
refactoring as well and
yeah I'm excited to start about this so
that is also this tutorial and if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
i'm thank you for watching and see you
then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
