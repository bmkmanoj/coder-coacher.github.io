Mei hole and welcome to your 15 - Angela
tutorial in which we're going to finally
take a look at routing in angular which
is a solid concept and would help you to
create powerful angular apps right
because with routing you can actually
spread your website into multiple kind
of pages like if you're creating a login
application then you can create a route
for dashboard settings user page
leaderboard whatever it is right if you
are creating anything like a quiz then
you can create a route of questions or
languages or whatever it's up to you
right so to actually begin with routing
we're going to refer to the
documentation itself it is actually
quite rich and good to read as well you
can just go ahead and go with the
documentation itself and you'll be good
to go but still we can just follow along
with what their documentation stays so
first of all it saves me to set a basic
tag so that we can pretty much make
angular clear that we would be always
wrestling from this route but right so
you can go to your where we have the
indexed or HTML and set the basic drift
to slash here and once you have done
that the next thing angular says is to
import the two modules which is the
router module and routes so again you
need to import that because as it says
it's not included in angular course so
angular tries to keep all of its
specific parts of the application as
much modular as possible so that even if
your app does not need routings then it
doesn't miss it unnecessarily use that
right so now what you need to do is
import these two modules by that and
then what we need to do is do some
configuration and for configuration
first of all we will need to import
this into our module itself so that it
is available to all the components and
directives which we talked about in the
last last tutorial I guess so
this router module dot for route takes
in an object this is a takes in an array
actually of a Prout's which is an array
of objects which pretty much defines how
your route should look like so if you
have done angular one then you might be
able to relate this with something like
we used to do with route provider dot
when and then there goes our routes like
dashboard then we used to say something
like template URL and then controller
and all that stuff so on a similar thing
this app routes would be similar to that
when block which we had right so it
would be very much just like this thing
here given here and we can just trim it
down to just one road for now we can
bring it down so you see that for a very
basic use case we have just this part
and the component the path defines the
path for something like localhost /
dashboard for this part we would just
very much go with this thing right here
right and for the component we could say
this is dashboard component and we can
now actually create this dashboard
component by going here and saying ng
generate component and then dashboard
right so when you do something like this
then it will generate a component with
the first name first letter of the name
as capsules the component name I am
referring to and then adding a component
at the end of it so if you take a look
now we get this dashboard and this
dashboard components file contains the
class name as dashboard component which
is exactly with what we have written
right here right so this is basically
our very simple route now we can take a
look at - per component on HTML which
the safe dashboard works so now if you
go to our app and go to dashboard right
here
you would see that we get an error
because we have to include the router
outlet which is something like div
ng-view
which we used to do an angular one if
you can relate so this router outlet
would pretty much go in into our main
component which would be our ya app this
app component of the steamer and we can
say something like router views and we
can just go ahead and say router on flit
and that's very much it so now if we
take a look and go to dashboard hit
enter you can see that in router views
we get dashboard works and remember that
your app would always bootstrap the app
component so that this hello world would
still be there if you just want to
remove this what you can do is very much
just remove it from here and for the
route you can actually create another
component and inside here we can define
another path which would be very much
like this thing that is basically
nothing or just the localhost port
number four to zero zero and we can just
say this is home come from it and we can
say something like generate component
home and just reload it and I guess we
lost our changes again so what we're
gonna do is quickly clear that again
part is nothing component is home
component and we go to home component
and we very much stays like we'll be
having here and then our component could
pretty much just consist on the starter
outlet whether all the view tag or you
can just pretty much the stake
and place it inside your HTML as well
anything that suits you right so you can
see that we get dashboard works there
and we get hello world here perfect
right so that is how pretty much we
create a very basic routing stuff with
angular and it's super easy to get
started with you see that we just
completed this tutorial in just I don't
know we haven't even scroll like ten
percent of the page so that was a very
basic and brief introduction to routing
in angular and in the next tutorial I'm
gonna show you how we can browse across
route rather than just you know going to
hard-coded URLs because you see that it
takes some time right now just take some
time because it's compiling the code
right so it might not take that much
time when you actually deploy it for the
production but anyways we're going to
take a look how we can actually navigate
from this page or a particular component
to another route right so that is also
this one and if you liked it then please
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching as you as you there in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
