Mei hole and welcome to your 30 second
tutorials for angular and in this
tutorial we're going to take a look at
children in components and we're going
to do that real quick so you see that I
have removed that user slash ID one here
that's out from here because what we can
do is right here we can very much just a
controller or children rather what I was
thinking so children here we go and then
just like this array we have for the
main routes the children would be the
array of all the objects for the user
world so we can say pass something like
name and we can say this component as
the user component and we can just get
rid of this component from the parent
length or you can just keep that as well
but then this component would
instantiate the children component so if
it doesn't make sense to have a
component for user because if it does
not matches then you just want user to
not show anything then you can just go
ahead and make use of the component in
the children only and then again you can
create some other parts as well but like
name and then ID something like that and
you can say some other form of component
to it like I don't know if we can just
say use a component for now and we can
pretty much just instead I use a
component we can say I guess I do have
this thing right but we can pretty much
just console.log which we are doing
right now okay so what we can do is take
this and take a look in the browser
so if we go do something like users mail
MPD you would see that we get the object
as name a whole MVD and this children
right here this child right here is
fired right and if I go my whole MPT /
wife we see that we get the ID as well
and now in this case are this route is
being fired right so that is how pretty
much you create a very basic children's
array inside your main route and that's
all very much you would work with it so
yeah that's all for this one and the
next one we're going to discuss about
what your path match actually is and
it's a bit interesting to look at if
you're looking it for the first time so
yeah that's all for this one and if you
liked it then please don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
