May ho and welcome to your ninth
reactors tutorial in which I'm going to
discuss what events are in react and how
you create them well we have done even
in JavaScript jQuery angularjs angular 2
and all that stuff and react pretty much
provides the same sort of things as well
for the events so you can click create a
click event or you know anything like
that so let's just take a look at how
you can create a clicking on update some
counters and all that stuff so first of
all instead of just returning a simple
h1 we can do it can return a day right
there and we can actually say that this
pan has this counter or actually this
textaid counter and then we can say
button update counter right so we can
now create another maker where we can
say update this counter and we can say
this dot set state I actually we just
need this same line right there and
let's get rid of the set interval so now
we can assign this method on click
that's how you do that on click and then
right here just the method name you want
to call not the parenthesis no do this
ok now there is a slight problem in this
code which would make it not work unless
you see what happens for now so what we
get in here let me just get rid of this
enough well-well-well on
Kotoko are we missing something here
I'll obviously again okay so again we
can just get rid of that then right
there so now if I click on update
counter button you can see that I get an
error cannot read property set state of
null
now why does that happen well that
happens because in es6 the es6 stuff
does not auto bind this to this
particular class right so by the time
this onclick even handler is called that
this keyword is no longer pointing to
the hello planet class right so you need
to somehow make sure that update
discounters when we you make use of this
in update this counter method then we
are actually referring to hello planet
and that particular instance and not
just you know anything in the universe
right so we can do that by saying this
dot update this counter is this dot
update this counted bind this now this
might seem stupid at first but this
actually makes a code work and we see
you can see it works and the reason why
it works is that we are inside the
constructor this refers to exactly what
we need in this update this counter
method so we lock this method right
there to make use of the disk Ewood as
the same thing which is this right there
in the constructor I know it might seem
a little bit confusing but essentially
what we are doing is that we are locking
this method right there to make sure
that whenever made we are making use of
this keyword then use the reference to
this class instead of you know anything
other so this is one sort of way to fix
this problem the other way is the es6
way well this is available for es5 as
well well in the es6 what you can do
is you can actually call another
function which calls this function later
so we can do a flat arrow function call
it right there and you can just put
curly braces there as well if you want
and you can call this function right
there right so what happens now is that
an es6 fat arrow function rotation what
this is interesting but this was
introduced for is that it uses dis of
it's calling scoop right so it does not
make you note this which is actually
which actually three when arrow right
now which we just saw this makes use of
the disk pointing to this class right so
this is another way to fix the problem
and again if you see you can see that
the counter just works fine but again
you can just make use of that inside a
constructor only and again you can just
pretty much if you are in a hurry you
can just bind this thing right here as
well this was just fine because the
actual problem is when you access try to
access this inside this method right so
if we check now you can see if it works
again but again I would just recommend
that you just put if you're making these
or bind this then put it inside the
constructor because you say a little
overhead because when you recreate or
when react recreates this component then
it would have to create this function
again and again and buy into this so
that kind of just saves an overhead so
we can just do that again if we just go
back a little right there okay
so that's how pretty much you create a
very basic event handler and in the next
tutorial what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you how you can pretty
much pass data from child to parent so
that's one for the story land if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
