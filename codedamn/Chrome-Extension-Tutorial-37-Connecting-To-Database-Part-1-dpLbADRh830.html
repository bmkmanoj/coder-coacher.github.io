and welcome to your 37th Google Chrome
extension development tutorial and which
we'll be doing and basically we'll be
creating an app which would allow your
extension to exchange information from
your remote server and you can do that
in a couple of ways you can either
create your database or you can read or
write from a file now before starting
this mini web series of how to set up
your own database and retrieve data from
SQL and JavaScript and all that stuff I
highly recommend that if you are
following my tutorial and after
completion of this four or five
tutorials how many these tutorials would
be required I don't know exactly but
after you have developed your app if
you're going to deploy it for commercial
purpose or you are launching your
website then I would highly recommend
you to get your application tested by a
certified pen tester and you know
ethical white hat hackers because
usually the websites which allow the
direct interaction of user from the
server and and you know like updating
your SQL database or reading writing
files directly can probably make your
site vulnerable to a lot of attacks so I
highly discourage if you can find an
alternative without doing this but for
people who really want to do make their
extension interact with your server side
like this extension is a good one for
the person who is looking for like
getting some information from the user
and then storing it on his own database
that is fine because this is a bit risky
because you know the files we will be
using in this extension can be used by
attacker to send arbitrary data to your
server
by modifying what
every cent so keeping that in mind let's
start with the series so for the series
we'll need a couple of things to set up
first I'll be doing with the database
integration in this one because it is
kind of popular and you know it makes
sense to work with so for that I'm gonna
use localhost for this extension but
obviously you would be using your own
server online but that should be pretty
much same as long as you are on Linux
hosting because PHP myadmin I guess is
level on Linux hosting only ok so first
of all launch Sam now this little panel
will allow you to have MySQL which would
be our database and a patch which would
be used as a PHP server to run on your
computer now go to localhost and ok so
it is PHP my admin now PHP myadmin is an
interface you would usually see as an
icon in your cPanel if you log in into
your cPanel if you go down in your C
panel you will see that it is it is
something like manage your MySQL tables
or you know open PHP myadmin something
like that but the interface is quite
same because I've worked with Hostgator
and GoDaddy and they both support that
so I know that so first of all you need
to create a new database so click here
to create a new database now this
database would be the database which
we'll be using in our Chrome extension
to interact with so let me think which
application we should create for this
Chrome extension and I guess what we can
do is
we can create a simple evil
extension you know just suppose that you
have a website and you have launched
your new ebook but you need to collect
some email addresses you want to do some
email marketing and you want to collect
email addresses plus you want to install
you want users to install your own
extensions so that you can monetize that
extension as well and moreover collect
the e-book as well collect the email ids
of the user as well so what we can do is
that will create this database as email
ids and leave it as it is now since our
database has been created click here on
the email ids and right here you have to
create a table now a table is pretty
much where your all of your information
would be stored and for this I guess we
don't need more than one table so here
what I'm gonna do is I'll type user info
and I guess I should have not entered a
space out there let's see if I can get
rid of that
okay let's just do this once more again
because um space might create problems
while we are doing the database
programming so let's just start again
email ids or let's just name its ids and
here i'm gonna create a table
information okay so now we have four
rows but I don't think we need four we
just need to I guess so
I'm gonna keep both of these as name and
type is text and this one is email
that's it and I guess we could create an
auto increment field as well which would
be the ID and this AI would
automatically increment this so that you
know if you want to delete any email
address or you want to do something else
then you can do that now I have chosen
this kind of team like of collecting
email ID because it cannot be exploited
yeah it can't be exploited but you know
it's not very efficient for a hacker to
spend a lot of time to exploit this
because at max what the attacker can do
is that he or she can flood your
database with a ton of fake emails but
you could eventually put a restriction
on how many calls from an IP address is
being made or how many calls a how many
connections a JavaScript file is making
with your PHP file now let's leave that
for
another tutorial let's keep the first
things first so we have integer type of
ID and this is AI that is automatic
increment and I guess I forgot that I
had a zoom feature in this one okay so
that might look better now so now let's
just click Save I'm sorry if you guys
are getting a headache might just get
rid of that so now we have created our
table and since it says MySQL returned
empty your set result is zero rows now
what we'll be doing is basically we
would be creating a PHP script as well
so PHP would act as a bridge between
your front-end and back-end database so
we'll be with Chrome extension calling
or sending some data to this PHP script
and I've been thinking about that how we
can you know let the PHP script
recognize that this is a valid or a
legit request and not a fake request
from attacker so we can add some extent
limit that your application may not be
exploited so that's it for this tutorial
and in the next tutorial we'll be
starting off with the application so if
you like this one then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
