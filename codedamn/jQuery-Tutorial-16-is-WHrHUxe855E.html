tutorial in which we'll be discussing
about a very useful event method in
jQuery which is is now is method in
jQuery kind of returns a boolean value
every time we execute this so for
instance I want to check dividing let's
say let's give it a class divided or
difference basically my Dave let's check
if you have class
in the script or chairs we have link to
this document let's say
my days
dot is
my did
so this may seem stupid and you may ask
that why the heck I'm checking the class
itself that it's equal to class and it
would be obviously true but what if I do
something like this and if is mad if now
this makes some sense
let's go so lock this so that it's
easier to evaluate here we have our
browser let's reload this console and we
get true
let's try to tamper with this glass that
should be good let's reload and we get
false so this is is kind of very useful
because it will return a boolean value
every time the condition is matched for
example let's say suppose let's create
an input box input type checkbox' and I
hope you know this
let's give it or maybe there should be
well so let's reload this and we've got
a check box down here now let's do from
jQuery stuff and to practice input we
could use either input because there's
only one input on the document but to be
more precise we can use type check box
and we news is now checked
chec KVD so by this by using Scotland
basically we are moving in to CSS CSS
properties kind of and basically we are
checking if this input box is checked
then do something down here we'll do
like like if this input box is checked
then do something but for now let's just
concentrate box is checked it's going to
love this this we love this and
eventually we get false because it's not
check right now and now let's apply the
html5 attribute check to it and we get
now true because it's check now as you
can see by using some certain even
handlers like input it would not change
function now we can do fire this event
every time we want to let's see what
happens now it's real of this
false true false true false truth as you
can see this even is firing every time
this input box gets changed so pretty
simple is keyword and
using this we is we could check for an
element for classes or IDs or pretty
much anything this world s would return
a boolean value every time so just
memorize this method because you're
gonna need that a lot of times trust me
it's very useful in jQuery and very much
required and it saves your life so
that's all for this is tutorial I'll see
you then in the next time in the next
tutorial with some new concepts in
jQuery until then stay tuned and don't
