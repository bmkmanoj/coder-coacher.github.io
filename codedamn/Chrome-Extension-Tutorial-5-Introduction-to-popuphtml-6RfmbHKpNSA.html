Google Chrome extension development
tutorial and in this tutorial we'll be
looking at something called pop-up dot
HTML file which we already downloaded in
tutorial one or two I guess in the
manifesto JSON this file is declared as
default popper now this is a kind of
regular HTML file which you can code
with styles or scripts or whatever you
like to but with a couple of exceptions
now what they are I'll tell you right
now these files actually load up when
the user clicks on your button in the
toolbar just like regular html5 file and
you can just expand the size the height
the width font size colors etc with all
that CSS you want to do now what's the
difference between this file and a
regular HTML file in a Chrome document
is that this file has certain
permissions which are basically superior
to the the regular HTML files this file
right in here has certain more
permissions like road loading
restrictive documents from sites like
Reddit and Facebook and where you cannot
actually access the page directly so to
demonstrate that I have a jQuery file
which basically just knows the jQuery
file right here
and I would perform a get request do
read read it I don't know what that was
okay so I'll perform a get request to
the site credit and once we do that I
get this error that XML HTTP cannot load
this page this header is not present so
that is why so this header is basically
okay the headers are basically if you
don't know these are some kind of extra
information which comes from server to
the browser so if you don't know head
about headers then only to worry you
will be not going deep into headers in
this series just for this tutorial for
sake of understanding so these are
headers and as you see there is no this
header present right here so we cannot
load cross-domain documents with the
help of jQuery for example reddit can
load itself but we cannot load reddit
from another domain as you can see the
XML request is successful on reddit.com
itself but it is unsuccessful if we try
to load it on a different protocol or
domain
so what I want to tell you is that that
under this extension we can actually
load such documents and basically loosen
the strictness of browser this error
popped up because of browser block this
xml httprequest so we can actually
stop the browser or say that please
allow us to access this page because I'm
an extension and the browser will allow
us access so regarding this application
I created one extension recently for my
client on reddit itself and that's why I
was telling you the story which
basically retrieves the first page of
Reddit this is the extension and if I
click on this
as you can see I get the first page from
reddit if you try to view the source
code of this page
then right here
in the pop-up J's file
let's see
and this pop-up doji is fired right here
I'm just doing a simple get request with
the mobile version of Reddit you will
wonder how it is allowing me to do get
requests with an extension but it is
blocked on a regular HTML page so let's
try to open the manifest file of this
reddit and I guess this folder down here
and this is the manifest file of my
extension and what it says in the
content security policy is that allow
this file read it's static to access the
this page and run scripts from it but
what is more important that in the
permissions section we have all URLs
defined so basically you cannot access
any URL with the help of JavaScript or
jQuery or any other library in your
extension especially unless you have
this permission defined to show to user
so this was the first difference between
a regular HTML file and the Papa file
and the second difference is that you
cannot run inline JavaScript in a pop-up
file for example
I guess I told you this thing in earlier
tutorial as well I don't remember but
nevermind we have got this inline
JavaScript and if I try to show this
then as you see the alert box does not
appear and console.log would log an
error as you see refuse to execute
inline script because it violates the
content secure policy so basically you
cannot execute inline scripts in
JavaScript you have to load every file
locally or with the help of URL in this
pop-up dot HTML file the rest is almost
same you have access to a couple of ApS
in this pop-up dot HTML file as well and
the rest is almost same and you can use
any file like jQuery or your own Java
scripts and type content here style with
CSS JavaScript jQuery and all that stuff
you do with a regular HTML file so this
was a quick short tutorial on top of the
HTML file and and the next tutorials
will be creating a cool extension would
be starting off with basics of extension
and how they work and we'll be looking
at a lot more so stay tuned with me and
