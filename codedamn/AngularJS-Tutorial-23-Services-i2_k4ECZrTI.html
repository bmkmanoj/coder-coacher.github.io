angularjs tutorial I'm a hole and in
this tutorial we'll be learning about
something called services in angularjs
now so far what we have done is we have
learned things like directives and how
to create login apps filters etc in
angularjs the services and factories
which we are going to learn in the next
tutorial are something which you should
know when you are learning angularjs and
they are actually they will allow you to
have data in different controllers if
you have like let's say you have an
array of employees you are getting from
your server-side languages like you have
any gso and file or any PHP file which
generates a JSON response and you want
to display them inside your website with
the help of angularjs so what you will
do is you will get that data from the
server with HTTP angularjs service which
we learnt previously and then you will
manipulate it somehow and you'll display
that but what if you have like a lot of
controllers then it would not be
feasible to do an HTTP request in every
of the controller what you like to do is
you would like to have a single HTTP
request done and then store it somewhere
we what we call that as a service so a
service is pretty much like creating a
function in one elegies and then using
it anywhere but when in angularjs
services are singleton now but that what
I mean is that only one instance of a
service is created and the reference is
passed now this would seem a little bit
complicated but by the end of this
tutorial I promise you guys that you
will be honest you will understand what
I am trying to say here now let's start
with services so first of all include
your angular JS file
and your script and once you are done
with that good your script let's start
the coding all right so first of all
let's create our application is angular
dot module and let's create our
controller first or okay let's create
the service first because we'll need to
include something in controller to make
that work so to create a service first
of all you have to write the name of
your module which on which you are going
to create that service so for instance
this is right now an application so
application dot service now the service
would obviously won't be available to
other modules if you have in your
application so you know services are
embedded in modules and you can have
services going over from module to
module so application dot service there
you go here you would write your the
name of your angularjs service let's say
it's create it on random numbers random
let's just create the name as random and
then as a function which would act as
your service now what we are going to do
here is we are going to make use of the
disk keyword because this keyword points
to this service right here which we are
working with so this means random and we
are going to learn how we can award this
with the help of factories in angularjs
probably in the next one so using this
keyword what we are going to do is
alright so first of all let's just get a
random number from math dot random and
let's just make it a little pretty by
flooring it down don't forget to
multiply by ten so that you don't get
zero always
now I'll make use of this dot generate
as a function now this would be a
function and what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to return the lung now this
number variable which I have declared
with war is the private property of the
service and I can't access it anywhere
outside the service but I can access
properties or values associated with
this with where ever I will include the
service so this is a thing you could
note so now let's just create an
controller application dot controller
let's just pick out which one is our
controller here you go at one app lets
us create a function now here we'll need
to pass a scope as you know but we'll
need to pass another thing
pass another thing now since you are
working with your own service and
angularjs is Guara
you know requires you to explicitly
mention what you are going to use in
your controller and which you are not
going to use then you have to pass the
name of your service with the scope or
any other dependency like HTTP right
here so I'll just include the name
random of my service if you don't do
that then you won't be able to include
or use your service inside your
controller now okay over to HTML now
let's just create a little obligation
button unless silent ng click of
generate random
and the squid should greet random number
and right here with a br we are just
going to do let's say a random number
here and here what I'm going to do is
I'm going to tell angular that this
function is actually gonna do pick up a
random number from service our service
and it's going to assign it to the
random number scoop so now how you can
go on a service is simply just include
the name of the service and then its
function or property or whatever it is
if it is function then don't we're going
to use the curly the two curly brackets
to run that function execute it and if
it is just like property like this dot
name is hello then you can just exclude
this that's some obvious things so
alright so our simple application is
ready now let's just take a look at the
browser all right so we have got this
button generate random number and when I
click on it you can see we get 0 and 1
and why not in but if you remember from
the first few minutes of this tutorial I
told you that application sorry the
services in angularjs are singleton and
now I'm going to show you what does that
mean so I told you that services are
singleton now this can be best proved by
clicking on this button again so you see
when I click on this button it doesn't
generate any more random numbers now why
is it this so now I'm gonna explain
gonna explain this and simple words here
so when the angularjs ran and when I
clicked on this button first time what
angularjs did is it ran the service
first time and it kinda just passed the
reference of the service here this here
is right here so what happened is when
this function was called the first time
the way first time angularjs run the
service and then pass the reference of
the service and created a reference of
the service obviously and pass this
passed it here now when I call this
again then instead of running the
service again that means instead of
running this whole good again
angularjs what it did it that is it past
the past service which it created the
previous one to here again so if you do
like random number two let's see if we
have two random numbers here random
number two then what would happen is
since angularjs services are single done
that means they would just create an
instance in just one instance and would
just continuously pass the references of
that when it is called what would happen
is you will always get same two numbers
because a unique number is created the
first time but not every time so that's
how angularjs services works and this is
really gonna be a handy thing you could
have if you have like you're getting
some data from server and you want to
display it on in different controllers
but you don't want to just copy and
paste the whole good again and again so
this was all about services and
angularjs and in the next tutorial we'll
be looking at similar thing called
factories in angularjs and in the next
tutorial after that i guess i'm gonna
show you a little differences between
two and we have something as providers
as well in languages which I think I'm a
grower in the next three or four
tutorials so that's all for this one and
I'll see you the next time don't forget
