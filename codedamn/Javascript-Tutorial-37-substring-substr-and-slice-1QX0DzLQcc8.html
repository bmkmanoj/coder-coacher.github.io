JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
we'll be learning about three methods of
string called substring sub STR and
slice so these three methods are
basically used to extract a portion of
string from a very long string so for
example let's create strength or my
string in string light like yeah I'm
wearing a black Titian so this is my
string and let's console.log the
substring of this string as i told you
this is a string method so it will take
the string
metal which is sub strength and in
substring the first parameter is the
starting index value that means start
from zero index the zeroth character and
just slice till the tenth character is
reached so this would give us zero one
two three four five six seven eight nine
and ten but dent is not included so it
would give us till nine so it would give
us I am
learn so that makes no sense actually
but who cares so substring does not
consider the character add the last
value of the second parameter so that
means that it would include the
character at the first value that is I
would be included but the second
parameter which says tent the 10th
character or basically the eleventh
character would not be included which is
I so let's see it action and we get I am
learn
the next thing is the substrate SUV STR
so how it is different is that this
method down here takes first parameter
similar to substrate that is the
starting index position but the next
parameter or the second parameter of
this method is the number of characters
to move on
for example the tenth position of index
is at I and we say okay so you are at I
and move four characters forward so it
would give us 0 1 2 3 so it would give
us this string and if we see it in
action
let's refresh this we get ing so what
happens here is we are at 10th position
which is the I 1 and we say through
JavaScript ok move four characters
forwards so 0 1 oops so 0 1 2 3 so it
moves four characters forward and
remember to count from 0 so substring
accepts the first value as the starting
index and the next parameter as the
number of strings to move forward
the next matter we have is the sliced 1
and the substring and sliced 1 are
almost similar methods with just a few
minor differences so slice would also
return the same thing accepts the
initial index the last index of
character does not include the last one
and just like the substring method so
you see that substring and slice work
pretty much same but the difference in
substring and slice method is if start
of the starting index is greater than
the stopping index then the substring
method would swap these two for example
if we do 10 and 0 that is the start are
the 10th character and end at the 0 at
character which is going backwards but
it does not actually go backwards but
swap these two values so if i refresh
the console now then still we get I am
learn but with the our slice method this
does not happen so it wants to add these
two values it would give the same order
and if we refresh this we get nothing
because going backwards is not possible
in slice so and there are a couple of
more differences in substring and slice
but all the time you could actually use
these
in place of one another so this was a
tutorial on substring substring STR
basically and the slice method of this
straight so in the next tutorial I don't
know we'll discussing what we'll be
discussing but it will be awesome so
I'll see you then and don't forget to
