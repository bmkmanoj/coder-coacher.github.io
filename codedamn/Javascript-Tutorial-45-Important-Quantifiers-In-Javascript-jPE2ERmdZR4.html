45th JavaScript tutorial and it's a kind
of regular series part and in this
tutorial we'll be looking at some useful
quantifiers in regular expression and to
basically give you an index of this
tutorial we will be discussing about
Star Plus question mark
a curly brace is set the number of times
to repeat and all about that as well a
couple of things about that and all that
stuff so died in your seatbelts and here
we go
so from the last couple of tutorials I'm
using some operators like this plus one
and we have got I guess it's star one as
well I use that but never mind
so now let's get started with these
operators I'll just keep them so I
remember that I have to go through all
of these let's create a string my shrink
and let's say that
let's see I have got a couple of cars
in my house
and let's see if I want to
get the scar wood our cars wood or
whatever it is I don't care if I've got
one card then I'll use the word car and
if I got two cars then I'll make use of
the word cars and different people would
use different sentences like this should
be this could be I have one car in my
house or I have got three cars in my
house and I've got in Carson my house
and I had these cars in my house and I
don't care about that what I need to
know is if the word supply this cars
then you have over one car and if the
word is car then you have exactly one
car and we ignore the case that I have
no car but anyways let's get started now
let's create a regular expression and
right here what you do is we supply the
word cars not this cars were technically
right now just match this cars would but
what if I had
car only right here I want this to match
car as well so what I'll do is I'll put
a little question mark right here in
front of this S word as literal so what
does that signify is I now have made
this s to be optional for the user to
enter and by that what I mean is that
whether the sentence has s or not this
would match are basically past the
regular expression
so now let's read a result and I'll show
you what it does my string dot for a
game no not match should be big X and
here we go let's console.log
simple enough let's reload this and
they've got cars as the matched sentence
are matched regular expression now let's
say I move s from here and let's see in
the browser now if I reload this now we
have got car as as matched as well now
if I remove any further character from
car then this would become invalid
because our was never optional in this
regular expression similarly if I make
like our optional right here and s
mandatory then this will match this this
match this but this would not match this
so let's see this would match this this
would match this as well but not this
boy
we've got knowledge so how could it be
useful for example you are checking for
let's say dates in your web application
let's say today is 23rd fib now let's
say I want to have our D as optional so
what I'll do is I'll type D and I'll
just do our D and a question mark like
that so it made D as optional as well
and are as optional as well so if I
reload this I get two okay so this
should be plus actually now let's reload
this and we have got 23rd and this will
match our D without
our D as well 23 but not if we haven't
got any digit at all so
oh I realize that I have to explain Plus
as well but I just used it in this
regular expression so okay so let's
learn about plus as well so plus star
this star and plus are very closely
linked to each other but with one little
difference this is much a expression and
expression it should be Co or more times
but this is much an expression one or
more times and 0 and 1 are the major
difference between these two so let's
say I use the same program
I've got Rd
oh no let's say okay so let's make it a
bit simple that'd be a bit complicated
for you let's say I just use the word
today and I say alright is drink this s
would denote any string which currently
is today and let's apply a global filter
to this and let's reload this and we
have got all the elements separated so
now when I add the plus sign in front of
it so it would say match any string
which is any separate character one or
more time so this would say okay I've
got you got you got you got you and got
you and I reload this then I'll get only
one element having today itself Anna you
star then also I'll get same result no
difference but when I make use of
like when I trim my string to zero
length then something different happens
which explains the different between
plus and the star now we'll get null
with the plus but with nothing the star
now the reason being star would actually
match zero or more times so star here
says I don't care if you are even zero
times in the string which is true for it
right now
I would evaluate you and would return
what I found so star goes to the string
and says and finds that there is no
string so it would return only a one
value of empty set and plus would say I
would only execute this code if at least
one character is present and when goes
down to this my string it found none and
it would throw a kind of error not an
error basically it would just return
null so that's the major difference
between star and a string if I make use
of string right here then you'll see the
second element as empty because this
would first of all match all these then
element because a empty element right
here because we are making use of the
global flag so the next thing I would
like to tell you is about something
called the Scala versus something
related with these curly braces let's
say up God let's say a a BB BB CC CC DD
DD every alphabet four times first four
first four and let's say I get E and I
want to match a only three times so this
would write now return me for is
separated by like this but I want it to
run only three times so I would like
this this to return instead of this four
so I reload this I get a three times as
a single element now this is a kind of
range now if I make use of a a here as
well then I'll get a a as another
element and obviously if I remove the
global tag then I'll only get the one
because this would dominate as soon as
it find one occurrence of that so let's
get the global on one thing we have got
is to get the exact end number of times
of a specific character and similarly I
can use like the s1 to make it the
application of more dynamic so I got all
the possible three combinations in the
other so a
the first one then a BB BB a a sec CC
and DD D you could actually verify that
so now let's keep it simple let's move
to a now let's say I want to match it
exactly in time so what I'll do it is
pass the number three but let's say if I
want to match it at least three times so
I'll put just a comma and nothing here
so this literally means that go to the
strength regular expression and start
finding from the starting and match it
at least three times not exact three
times but at least three times so this
would return for as well five as well
three as well but not the two one so
let's reload this and we get the four
one and the three one so if you notice
the difference then when I remove this
coma and trigger this then I get only
three is in the first occurrence so we
have four continuous is but once I put
the comma then this says that the number
of is should be at least equal to three
consecutive is and they could be more
but at least the base limit should be
three
so that's how it works and in the next
thing we could provide kind of not more
debt so if I put like five so what it
means is that at least there should be
three years but not more than five years
so this would match all the is which are
three consecutive is four consecutive is
five consecutive eaves but not six
consecutive days so let's do it like
this a a three are we have got three
consecutive is then some pipes so that
they are not consecutive then let's say
for some pipes basically any character
would go and just using pipes and five
is and finally I would write six years
now so now let's reload this
okay
what you've got three but at least three
but not five so
let's see
well that's weird let me check
yeah okay so we need not to give space
in this here you know regular
expressions are already cheeky and this
should work as well now let's look at
the browser
and we have got the said this night said
which has three is four is one two three
four five years and one two three four
five years but not the sixth a because
as we said included at minimum three at
most five but none above or below that
so a quick revision would be just the
one value would supply exact amount a
comma would do at least amount and a
value after comma no spaces regular
expression is very strict about that so
after a comma just the number which
would specify the top limit so bottom
limit three top limit five and both are
inclusive so these were I guess one two
three four
these were basically five and six so
these six were I guess some useful
quantifiers in regular expression which
you should know by depth of the concepts
because they are seen in many regular
expressions and people often get
confused about this so I hope your
concepts are clear for these six at
least out of here not that you're free
to comment below your problems are I
would answer them in the comment section
below
