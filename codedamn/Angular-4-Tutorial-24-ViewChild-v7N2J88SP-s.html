Mei hole and welcome to your 24th
angular tutorial in which you're going
to take a look at what a view tile is
and how we can make use of it to get a
reference to an element inside the dom
and probably read some of its value in a
nice little way so what I'm going to do
is actually inside our app component or
rather this HTML file let's just create
an input something like input type text
and yep that is it and let's just say
you understand the user value to the
server
every minute right kind of like saving
the value if you're creating some sort
of blog system or something like that
I'm sure there will be some other ways
to achieve that but the dirtiest way I
can think of right now is just setting a
timer of set in the world and then
checking it every minute and sending the
updated takes to the server irrespective
of what the user has done so we can
implement that and to do that what we
need is actually a reference to this
element right here somehow in our method
so our method right here inside this
component would probably look like send
to server and then we would magically
somehow get the data of the user from
something like that and then we would
just send this do server using this to
be module which was going to take a look
later on so how do we post in post let's
get this data well we can actually
reference add a reference to this by
making use of a hash symbol let's just
say my input file or my input text like
that and then what you can do is inside
your app component you can actually
write something like add the rate view
child and then my input text and then
the variable with which you want to
reference it so I would just say input
text
okay and then you can finally just
import it from the core and that is it
pretty much now what happens with this
is that you actually create a reference
to this particular element with this my
input text as a local variable a local
template variable and then we can access
it using the input text field or the
property of this class so we can say
something like this dot input text dot
native elements infuse consoles but log
data dot value right here to see what's
happening then we should see the value
of the data so finally what I can do
which would be not the best practice
inside constructor I'm going to create a
set interval which just fires send this
but send to server every two seconds
like that you can do this is ng on in it
as well if you want to we can just move
it at the top for the sake of clarity
okay so now if we take a look in the
browser inside console we get some
errors and the reason probably is
because this is undefined so we are
actually losing context of this so we
can do is instead of doing something
like this we should probably file this
as a satire of function so that we can
see and obviously we want to call that
as well so now if you take a look then
we get a blank value let's just write
something like hello world there so you
can see that we are getting our value
every two seconds and actually you
should not be placing this in
constructor but after the view is ready
but since we are waiting for two seconds
it
automatically kind of gets the view
ready by that time but we'll take a look
at the lifecycle of a component later on
for now this thing works and that is how
pretty much you would get a reference to
a very simple element like an input type
text and access it using that reference
in your methods right so that is also
the story oh and if you like that then
please don't forget subscribe and thank
you for watching and see you then in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
