and welcome to your third typescript
tutorial in which I'm going to show you
how to set up typescript on Windows real
quick with sublime text and node package
manager so first things first you'll
need node to work with this and if you
haven't installed node yet just go to
node.js org and it will show you the
latest stable release it has so
currently it has 5.6 stable and just
click here and download the setup and
once you're done you'll get something
like this so this is the setup we should
get just double click on it and install
it by next next and I've already done
that so I'll just cancel this out and
make sure you pause the video in between
if you are just having a some time to do
the steps because most of the things I
have done so I will be just skipping
over those but I'll be showing you how
to do that so next thing you have to do
with open your CMD command prompt and
right here just write npm to check if
node package manager is installed so as
you can see it looks installed now what
you need to do is write NPM install
typescript G now make sure you add
exactly the same thing NPM install
typescript and dash G so that it
installs typescript in the global scope
so once you have done that just hit
enter again and I'm not gonna show you
what happens next because I've already
installed this typescript so I'm just
gonna quit here yep and once you have
installed this it might take a minute or
two the next thing you need to do is to
configure sublime text with your
typescript now to do that just open your
open up your browser go to this package
control dot IO and you can get this link
by googling this typescript plugin for
sublime text now what you need to do
next is that just copy this path right
here
CD slash the columns app data sublime
text 3 packages and go to run now you
can get to run by either just going to
start and typing run or hitting the wind
key and our
now paste this right here the sting and
click on ok.now once you are in this
folder you should probably just see only
these three folders I am seeing the
fourth one as well because I've already
installed typescript plugin so you
should see only these three and once you
are here just right click anywhere and
click on this get pass here and yes to
get get bash when what you need to do is
just go to google and write get four
windows and this is the URL which you'll
get get - for - windows not github i'll
and just go here and i might have some
problems with internet connectivity
right now I guess no okay so it was
working but alright so once this page
opens just download this kit and what we
need is the git bash right there so just
download and install it it's simple to
do
just like node so once you are done go
back to your directory right click and
you'll see this option get bash here and
just open it now the next thing you need
to do is just copy this line the second
one right click copy go to your folder
again or get I have to open right there
right click and paste again now hit
enter and as you can see it shows me
this that distinction path type script
already exists because I've already
installed that but for you it will show
a bunch of installation lines or
something like that so once you're done
with that to check if your type script
is perfectly install or not just go to
your CMD again and right TSC if you see
something like this on writing TSC then
your typescript is installed in a
computer and for sublime just go to your
sublime text preferences package
settings and you should see this type
script right there so if you see that as
well that means your
trip is set up right so that's all for
this one and in the next one I'll be
showing you how to set up typescript a
bit better for the development purposes
so that's how you just basically merge
all the files together and get going so
