third bootstrap video tutorial at me who
added this tutorial will be creating or
just gonna kinda explain you a grid
layout in bootstrap now I currently out
at bootstrap was necessary because
bootstrap allows you to create something
called containers and in containers you
can have elements in HTML just like you
regularly do have but with bootstrap
what happens is that these containers
are resizable now previously I guess and
moots trial versions to point something
these containers were fixed so the
responsive design was not possible with
these containers but when mutrah tree
and mutrah 4 as well these containers
are now flexible so you can have
responsive designs with these containers
now what happens is actually this
bootstrap framework what it will do is
it will divide this right this white
thing you see right here this page into
twelve equal parts so you see that each
of your column would be twelve equal
divider in twelve equal parts so if I
just check my screen width right now
let's just say I check window dot width
so you see it's 1600 pixels and if I
just divided by twelve then I get this
number right here so I'm just gonna
demonstrate you how this will work by a
simple HTML droid
say this off position:absolute top:0
left:0 bottom 0 right 0 just in case I'm
just gonna create an empty div 12 times
right here so 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
all right well I guess I can do that
once more here you go
the nice way alright so inside style
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say this
should be positioned as absolute or
relative float:left with
one six zero zero I guess it was so I'm
just gonna take up to three decimal
places and hi it should be 100% and yes
no I guess we need a bottle as well
black that should be good don't forget
to add box-sizing otherwise it will just
calculate your border in the width as
well so let's just see okay so we got
our what diff under that this is because
of the scroll bar right here so let's
just get get rid of this scroll bar
right here to do that we can just
slightly increase the width so you see I
got rid of the scroll bar okay so what
the point is that now you see these 12
columns 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
now these 12 columns are just like your
12
bootstrap columns instead I have
hard-coded these 12 columns with a
specific width which is very close to
the 12% width of the screen but
bootstrap what it would do is it would
just flexibly record this as 12% of any
screen so you see that for my screen R
and for this resolution the minimum
width of a container of bootstrap is
this this one right here you see these
distance between two black borders this
is the minimum width an element would
have on my screen on my resolution on
this current resolution of 1600 by 900
pixels so this is how great works I had
for example if I just compressed my
layout to like a 960 pixel not my school
Arbeit the layout of my webpage so my
webpage is set in the central central
power of the screen that these twelve
columns would be squeezed to that thing
again
$1 to say if I say like if I do like a
wealth of like 960 pixels then I check
out what is the weight per 12 teres 80
pixels and I just resize this to 80
pixels you see that my twelve columns
squeezed to 80 pixels so now the width
of any of this element is 80 pixels
instead of 133 pixels so this thing is
right here is dynamic and it's achieved
by this bootstrap framework right here
you have and you don't need to worry
much about that but you should know
about that and I just wanted to show you
how this grid layout is working and
finally we'll be creating some awesome
websites with the screen layout and with
bootstrap obviously so stay tuned with
me and don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
