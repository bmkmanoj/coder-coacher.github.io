JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
we'll be looking at double is equal to
vs. triple is equal to comparison in
JavaScript so in my last or maybe in my
all previous tutorials I had used double
is equal to sign very often in the if
statement to compare things so basically
what's the difference between these two
so you understand the difference let's
create a variable string num let's set
it to 10 now here 10 is a string and not
a number let's create another variable
num with value 10 as usual and here 10
is a number so that's right if statement
if string num is equal to number
then I want to alert yep else
hello nope
pretty simple and as expected you would
expect that it will show no because 10
is a string and your num is 10 here is
numbered so let's see what happens this
is my page and i refresh that and some
pricing lee i don't know what happened
somebody something happened but this
show yep but why why did this showed
that string num is equal to number but
the both one is string and the second
one is number so why did this happen
basically the double is equal to
operator this operator is used to
compare the values by the values that
mean that then we do if string num is
double equal to num that means that it
is actually checking whether the value
of string num is equal to value of
number well which is num so the single
equal to sets the value the double equal
to checks the value and the triple equal
to checks the value as well plus the
datatype if we do type of string num
a type of this console of these two
this one as well
guys like Rome hear this and if i
refresh this you in the console.log we
get the first one our string as expected
and the second one as number the double
equal to sign checks for the value it
doesn't care whether the value is a
string or a number it just checks for
the value and the triple equal to checks
for the datatype as well and the value
as well so as you can see the alert is
now nope so always try to go with triple
is equal to unless you want to just
compare the value basically triple is
equal to is a strict comparison and you
should use this often instead of just
double is equal to but double double is
equal to works most of the time but when
you are like validating user data or
something like in which the data comes
from the client side then it is better
to use strict compulsion to validate
against the value as well and the data
type as well so this was a short
tutorial on the double is equal to come
operator versus the triple is equal to
operator so I hope the difference is not
clear to summarize things up the single
is equal to sets the value double is
equal to checks the value and triple is
equal to checks the value as well as the
datatype
so this was all about this tutorial and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
