fifth bootstrap tutorial at this
tutorial is not a tutorial actually I'll
just be talking to you guys real quick
and shot so that won't last I guess even
30 seconds or a minute now now I just
want to say you that I just realized
that bootstrap has a lot of things for
you guys to know and this would kind of
become cumbersome if I went over each
everything each and everything like yard
this is button add this is a leg this is
how you create an icon in bootstrap so
all that would get a little kind of
boring so what I've decided is we all u
@ly would work on a project and that
project would be a simple website which
will be created with all the bootstrap
and that against so we'll be doing a
simple project on bootstrap where we'll
create some awesome sliders toolbars no
images would be used obviously except
for logos and sliders we might and all
that things like all the content areas
pretty much all like that so we'll be
starting off with that in the next
tutorial and in this tutorial I just
wanted it to keep that much only because
you know I just wanted you to give a
brief that something awesome is coming
so that's all for this one I'll see you
real soon in the next one so don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
