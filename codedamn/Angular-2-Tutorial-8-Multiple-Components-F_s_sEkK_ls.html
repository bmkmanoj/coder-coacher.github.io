hole and welcome to your eighth angular
2 tutorial in which we'll be creating
another component for our web
application so so far what we have done
and yeah I have made a bit of changes
here if you can see I've made this
selector to my shop we changed the name
of the class and in the index as well I
have changed this to my shop and in the
main dot TS as well I have made a bit of
file name changes right there you can
see so yeah so I guess you can do that
yourself
if you even don't want to do that that's
ok but you know that - in between most
modelling me I don't know why so I just
made some changes well yeah so where
were we so we were discussing about some
components here and so far what we have
done is that we just created a simple
component with this template you know a
bunch of HTML right here and then we
added something like that so let's just
say you are creating a website online
where you know you're just selling your
old games or you're just selling some
movie CDs something like that so you
want to have a web shop you can say so
what would you do is for your main my
shop component is that first of all you
like h1 welcome to my shop and then you
will say that we have the following
movies available right now you just add
a list here there are a bunch of things
here now you can do that but it would be
a little bit nice and easy to read if
you can just split your whole
application into different pieces and we
call those pieces as component because
that's why angular 2 is here because if
you just do something like this on your
own then obviously you can do this thing
into your main page only and completely
avoid angular
but that's not what we want so what I
want to do is so what so what I'm gonna
do is is that I'm gonna create another
component here or sorry another HTML tag
here which would have another component
so let's just say this is my movies now
this is a completely invalid HTML tag
neither does angular know about it not
as your browser so we need to do some
things with this well first of all let's
just hop over and create a component for
this and I'm just gonna copy this thing
right here let's just say this is
component dot what should be this my
movies not es and change the selector to
my movies the template too
let's just say this is an unordered list
let's just say this is Deadpool to have
that as a lowercase and then we have
let's just say inception interstellar so
we have got this component ready right
here a simple component and let's just
see in the name of export class to let's
just say my movies component well you
can just name it anything compo any ng
but I just named it my movies component
so yeah so alright so it looks good now
this component still doesn't know about
this file right so we need to include
this
or import this file this one into this
file so let's just write import the
class name my movies component from and
change the path to component not my
movies just omit the extension so as you
can see though we are in the same
directory I'm not doing something like
this and the reason is that because you
know that the typescript engine has a
default location to look for for example
if you see this angular 2 slash core you
can easily see that this angular 2
folder is nowhere in this directory but
still this includes this file so how
well that is because this component this
local path when you don't include this
period and a slash it looks for this
directory node modules and then angular
2 so it is currently pointing to this
directory known modules so you should
better do inform the typescript compiler
that you're walking the same directory
if you have included this thing right
here so when we have included this
component this my movies component now I
want to include this or I want to make
it work with my movies so if I just try
to run it on the server as you can see
it's up and running but you can still
see that we don't have the movie list
available and the reason is that though
you have imported this component let's
just say you have a bunch of components
here it might be the case that sometimes
you just don't want to use a component
or you have just included it by mistake
or you know the component has actually
no real use on your web page so angular
doesn't want to just fire off every
component on your web page and you know
you just scratch your hair and I have no
idea why this thing is running or why
this is not so to make it work what I
want to do is I want to add a directive
as well here so if I add directives raw
body and instead re if I add this class
name right here we just instructs
angular that if you find any directives
which match which has you know the
components said in this class name and
that is this thing right here so
indirectly we are referring here that if
you match any directive like this then
make use of this class right here this
component which is imported here so
let's just take a look in the browser
and now as you can see we have got this
list off you can say another list of
movies right here on your web shop so
that's how you basically create a simple
component and include it in another
component and work with it so that's all
for this tutorial and in the next
tutorial we'll be looking more about
these components only because components
are very fun to code in angular 2 and
yeah so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial and don't forget to subscribe
