JavaScript tutorial in this tutorial
finally we will be moving out of the
console and taking hands on to some HTML
and practical real-life examples where
we could use JavaScript so this tutorial
is about event attributes now what are
even attributes in JavaScript we have
certain tags like div or
input or even body like that supposingly
I have this div and I want when user
hovers over this Dave then they get
certain information regarding about this
div or anything you want I want when the
body loads user have certain information
what the site is about in an alert box
like that I want when the user scroll
down the window
I want to display user something I want
to do like any pop-up box or alert box
or anything you want so we can use even
attributes in JavaScript to achieve such
things body coming to body we have an
even attribute which says onload now all
load here is an HTML attribute but it's
also a JavaScript attribute which is
fired by JavaScript now for instance if
I write body on road alert then
when I will refresh my browser page then
I'll see a JavaScript alert and this
alert occurs when the body is ready and
is loaded these are this onload is right
now it drivers should event attribute we
have certain even attributes like
onmouseover and onmouseout and like that
an html5 adds tons of attribute tons of
even attributes to javascript but it
could be out of the scope of this
tutorial to discuss all of those
attributes but I'll be discussing most
of the attributes with you for instance
let's create a function a simple
function
not defy
and let's do console dot log
I be
or what
let's create a input box
so when they refresh this page let's
remove this we get an input box now in
this input box let's add a JavaScript
event attribute on mouse-over let's say
this to run our function
now what happens is when we hover over
this input type then a function is fired
this energy fire function which console
logs that I am being forward and as you
can see in the browser we get I am being
covered again and again whenever we
hover over this input type box the next
important even is onmousedown
onmousedown
is fired when the click is being hold
when stands when I click it but doesn't
release the click then this whole event
is on Mouse top so let's say I am being
Mouse down
it sounds fun okay so when I click on
this but doesn't release my mouse click
then this event is currently Mouse down
and as you can see the console it is
load and then third thing another time
let's do it and you can see am big
monster on his console long to hear the
next important event we have is on click
on click is very important because this
is used many times in many web
applications when stands this even fires
when we complete the click
it is not like onmousedown because this
event is fired we're a full clique gets
complete for example clicking on the
button the input type box and releasing
the in click this when the click is
complete as you can see the next
important thing we have that on key up
so let's do
on key up now this is a keyboard type
event which happens when we press the
key now on key it occurs when I release
the key as long as I am holding the key
it will not occur or it will not fire
actually but as soon as I release the
key the event occurs if you pay close
attention then you will see that I am
pressing the key M right now but I'm not
releasing it and the event is not firing
actually but as soon as I release the
cave the increment here occurs as it
shows that the even has fired similarly
we have another event on key down on key
down occurs when the key is pressed down
instead of waiting for JavaScript to
release the key understands when I press
the key M you can see the counter
crushes and incrementing added
tremendous red because I'm not releasing
the key M right now but as soon as I
release it the even gets over
the next event is on wheel this is an
HTML a kind of html5 and JavaScript
event which fires when we have
the scroll what you say this the wheel
on the mouse which will happens which
this even occurs when we move the wheel
of the mouse on the selector we have
here right now we have input for example
if I move my feel of the mouse on this
input then you can see the counter
increments and being clicked wherever it
is I mean mouse wheel
the next event we have is onmouseout
onmouseout now what it does is
when we have
for example I entered this area
I entered the city and I'll leave this
area with my cursor then the even fires
ambiguous Odin for example I entered
this and I leave this then this event is
fired this even could be used to stop
your visitors from leaving your what you
say the website by the following trick
for example you can add this even body
onmouseout you notify and this function
could trigger that while leaving so
early
for example if we refresh this we get
out of the body then this javascript
event alerts while leaving so Valley
cool isn't it
the final I have to tell you is the on
double-click like like on click it is
similar like on double-click and
similarly it fires an event
when I double-click it then only the
evil would fire the next important thing
I would like to tell about these events
is you can actually supply a parameter
in parameter for instance I'll do a key
right now and here as well no not here
this now what happens is this D
parameter contains the values sent by
this input box for example if i
console.log this parameter and comment
out the alert statement so you can see
that the a parameter actually sent this
Dom node values which we can retrieve
with JavaScript further example if we
have Val live set to
let's say one two three four
okay and we refresh this and we
double-click here we have this value
here console dot log
he thought value
as you can see we get what the value
instead of the whole HTML node so this e
value could be used to show dynamic
input output to the user for example you
could use alert to generate that you
just entered this value
and it's as simple as that
as you can see this is dynamic so there
are many attributes regarding event in
JavaScript and in html5 in fact html5
adds a lot of attributes you could use
like all load on wheel as I told you if
you are interested you can go to Mozilla
developer Network to have a look on all
of them but mostly you won't be using
all of those but only these few which
are on Mouse move Mouse down click
double-click Mouse out ki aapki down
like that for user validation so I hope
