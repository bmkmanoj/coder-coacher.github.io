25th HTML and CSS tutorial and I would
be teaching you some more HTML tracks in
this tutorial because I guess I left a
couple of those in my previous tutorials
so they are really simple to learn and
not to create a much of first let's
start with the tutorial so first of all
we have the samp the sample tag which
would kind of create a sample of a text
and if I reload this now you can see if
I create some normal text versus the
sample text you can see the difference
in the font and the font size has worked
so pretty much you could do this with
CSS and I don't know why I'm teaching to
you guys this tutorial but you can
consider it as a kind of formality for
those who still are HTML geeks and would
like to prefer HTML over CSS commands so
now the next thing we have god is I
guess KBD
now cavity would actually act like you
are working as keyboard font so there's
no difference in KBD and samp if you see
just two different tag names but with
same CSS code so you could basically
interchange and use them just like we
have be
just like we have be and we have a
stripper similar tag name as strong so
both of these are same do the same thing
but I don't know why the heck w3c
created multiple tags for similar
functions but who cares so yeah so I
have got a interesting tags so one thing
I would like to tell you about HTML is
that HTML if you ever noticed then HTML
is not it's not kinda interested in
preserving your spaces if you ever
noticed that this is a very interesting
thing
so if you write hello and give a hell
lot of spaces and write world right here
and you reload this document then what
you get is is a hello world and what the
heck is this why don't we get all these
visit our spaces I wanted now this is a
special feature of HTML which says that
you do not have to reserved spaces while
you are typing so one things we have for
this is used the entity and BSP and I'll
teach you entities in future tutorials
so for now just learn that this
ampersand sign &amp;amp; nbsp followed by a
semicolon would just create a space
which would be a strict kind of space
would which HTML has to follow to
reserve so now hTML is kind of reserving
these spaces so what if you wanted a lot
of spaces so what you will do something
like this and you will get this result
but as you can see these spaces are
still comparatively low as compared to
how ugly it looks so this is kind of a
very ugly thing
and one thing we can do is we can do
like this and we can wrap this inside
attack called pre now pre is a tag which
stands for pre formatted and pre would
actually
conserve your white-spaces Han in this
tutorial I'll show you how you can do
make your dip dye also conserve white
spaces and we'll look at that let's
reload this and now you can see that
your right spaces are conserved and this
is also conserved because these are two
tabs right here so if you remove these
and now let's reload this so you'll get
like hello world and it looks much
cleaner and efficient than that nbsp
think so now let let's see you can
create or how you can conserve your
white spaces inside div go to dev open
curly braces and in the property we have
got a property called
white space now white space actually
would allow you to customize how your
white spaces are handled in this element
and they've got a bunch of properties
here but to conserve these pieces what
we'll do is we'll use the pre as value
now let's reload this and now as you can
see the white spaces are preserved just
like it was preserved in the pre tag so
basically you eliminate the need of pre
now but most of the coders would
especially good free if they are
interested in kind of saving the white
spaces bigger instead of doing it the
CSS way because it's quick and it's
cross browser obviously so
that's how pretty much some DS some of
them's more HTML tax work and as I told
you in my earlier tutorials the most of
the HTML tags the most of the tax
function which HTML do could also be
customized with CSS but with the
exception of some tags like your table
tag and the components inside the table
TR TD because they are kind of difficult
to code with HTML and I guess I should
teach tables in the next tutorial so see
you guys then and don't forget to
