Mei hole and welcome to another
screencast in which I'm gonna show you
real quick how you can set up your own
custom ecommerce webstore online but
then I guess 15 minutes so let me just
show you what I did do this thing so
this is a domain host it somewhere on
internet and I have created a kind of
e-commerce site within around ten
minutes so you can see that within ten
minutes with WordPress and WooCommerce
what you can do is something like this
and this is just the result of ten
minutes work so if you put in like an
hour or so then you might be able to
create extremely beautiful and organized
stores where you can drive traffic and
convert them into customers
right so ecommerce is the perfect
solution if you are trying to sell
anything like any digital product or
maybe some ebooks which you wrote or
even if you are kind of started to think
of an athlete's marketing stuff you can
kind of create an e-commerce out of it
you can put others product but the only
thing that would be missing is that you
won't be able to put an add to cart
feature because you want to redirect
them to the original seller space but
anyways you get the idea of e-commerce
so setting up your own custom store was
never so easy we're gonna do that within
10 minutes and I'm gonna show you how so
we'll be making use of WordPress as the
base for our e-commerce and then we're
gonna make use of the plugin known as
e-commerce which converts your WordPress
into an e-commerce solution so you can
see that if I pretty much was it this
thing I want to purchase this cartoonist
belt it's $55 well fine
I'm just gonna purchase two I'm gonna
have to God and you see that two bills
have been added to card and we have
another item at
addition right so we have all the stuff
we can proceed to checkout and finally
we can enter some of our details it just
verifies the card we can enter our
information you can pay by bank transfer
or PayPal or you can add even more
options inside WooCommerce you can
proceed to PayPal and even complete the
transaction you can even sell digital
products with it for example if you want
to give a person a URL when the purchase
is complete so that they can download
their ebook or whatever kind of a poster
or whatever you are offering then you
can do that with this thing with
e-commerce right so yeah that said I'll
let's just start working alright so in
order to sell in order to start selling
stuff what you need first is somebody to
host your servers now again you can go
into highly technical solutions like
setting up your own server instances on
cloud and performing all that stuff
installing WordPress manually but if you
are willing to just set up your store
and focus more on selling stuff getting
visitors converting visits into
customers then you might want to let
other people like this hosting provider
to handle all this stuff for you so
right now what we have is in motion
hosting and I'm personally using it for
the score down test as well and a couple
of other projects as well and what this
in motion hosting is is that they will
host servers for you for your website
and they are promising the support is
extremely good and you can actually
transfer your website as well if you are
running on some other hosting provider
or maybe you have a domain registered
somewhere else you can bring them here
and they would be happy to help you the
support team as I said is extremely
quick and good so you might want to ask
them a question anytime and they would
be happy to help so I'm gonna make use
of in motion hosting for this tutorial
and you can see that for the business
hosting plan which is the perfect plan
for as of now it's five point or rather
we can just say six dollars a month but
for code dams visitors what you can do
is with this link the IT dot ly / in
motion discount and what this would do
is it would give you a humongous
discount on all of these plants right so
you can purchase business hosting for
about I think so you can see that you
certainly got a discount of fifty six
percent on the original price so the
links are in the description if you want
you can use the discounted link
otherwise if you are happy to spend some
money it's fine as well okay so let me
just login into my account so once you
have purchased hosting at in motion and
got your login details login credentials
as well you would be able to see
something like this so once you see this
what you need to do is actually install
WordPress on your main domain now mind
you that I am already running WordPress
on this main domain so I guess I would
need to create a sub domain so that I
can demonstrate that for the tutorial
purpose how to set that up so let me
just create a sub domain real quick here
let's just go to the cPanel
there we are so finally what I want to
do is install WordPress so I'm gonna go
install popular software install
WordPress write down my cPanel password
and you'll be able to see something like
this so let's just switch it to HTTP for
now just go with WP testing the
directory is fine let's just think this
is our e-commerce solution for selling
ebooks and you'll get best ebooks here
for the best price something like that
and you don't want it to be multi-site
well that's a story for another day so
let's just keep it to admin admin for
now and we can just say my email address
here English and you can go with this
however you can customize this later on
as well for Advanced Options you might
want to just want to leave it default
and this install partial string must be
greater than forty one two three there
we go and we'll just install WordPress
on your domain okay so it will just
install within a couple of seconds it
took around 20 seconds here so you can
see that our WordPress is up and running
here's the dashboard so the another
thing we need to do is add a plug-in
here and that would be WooCommerce
install it activate
and you would see pretty much like this
so this is a nice interface set up your
store for the first time so let's go so
what you want to do is for your paid set
up this would create these four pages
and that's fine for us
because that's that should be visible on
a ecommerce website so the store is
based in India that doesn't really
matter unless you're shipping products
so you can pretty much say any state
here I'm gonna keep it USD so that we
can use paypal for the transactions and
yeah
Alissa's continue fine for the payments
we can use PayPal stripe beep PayPal
standard you can use bank transfers you
can use C or D as well if you are
shipping products obviously this doesn't
make sense on digital products right so
I'm just gonna leave that and finally
you would get this storefront as the
WooCommerce theme well there are a lot
and a lot of WooCommerce themes
available in the market but if you want
to begin slowly and nicely then
storefront is the best one you can just
activate this and you should see that
your store is ready awesome so you can
allow these guys to improve and you
might want to create your first product
here as well so if you see your website
right now it might look kind of ugly but
again there's a lot of things to do
right now you can see that it looks more
like a wordpress blog only so first
thing you need to do is go to the
settings and inside reading you would
need to change this thing from a latest
post to a static page and that would be
let's just keep it to shop maybe you can
also create a welcome page here
so once you do that since we do not have
any products for now we won't be able to
see anything right but we can add a
product let's just say this is ebook how
to make money online 101 write some sort
of description here as well after
dismissing all these guys description
goes here something like that you can
put some product image and you will be
good to go
so you can now publish this thing and
you can put a price as well here
obviously for your product so what do
you wanna do is for Product data the
general price would be let's say $10
sale price is $5 and this is
downloadable we can add a file here
let's just say this is secret we can
just refer this us what do you say go
down comm / let's say we have a secret
endpoint view source dot JSON which just
gives you all the source code of code
down so I can sell it for maybe a
thousand dollars right so yeah and on
the limit you can set that download
expiry you can set that and all that
stuff so just update this and you would
get your product ready so if you reload
your e-commerce solution now you would
be able to see something like this
obviously if you add an image of product
here you can do all that stuff now
obviously I have prepared this site
already so you can see that right now
what we have for this view Commerce
which is a silly logo I prepared in
Photoshop and by the way this is just
the WooCommerce logo itself that ninja
so once you do a little bit of stuff you
what you can do is inside this add new
you can organize products into
categories for example we have this axis
of reaction figures and all that stuff
so inside access theories if you take a
look
you can see that this is on sale so I'm
gonna add it to God and you can see that
we get our cart in here and by the way
right here what we are making use of to
get these awesome buttons is now again
mind you that this is the pre done
website the new one is this one so for
the new one what you want to do is go to
add new plugins what you wanna do is see
the installed plugins and you what I
have here is that you can see that we
have this WooCommerce cart tab and by
the way I guess you can get that right
here as well somewhere so you can use
this customizer as well to add your logo
and all that stuff I did that logo thing
from this customizer only so once you do
that you should be able to customize the
suppose you can customize a position of
sidebar add or remove widgets you can
create a subscription type of thing
within your e-commerce solution and once
you do all that stuff what you want to
do is install this cart a plugin will
just in displays that Add to Cart button
you can install this product sharing you
can install this sticky Add to Cart you
can activate all these guys separately
and once you do that you should be able
to see your products something like this
once you add those products you would be
able to pretty much go into these
products let's just say you want to
purchase egg TV I don't have any idea
why would you purchase an egg TV for $80
but if you want you can add to this to
card and you can see that your card is
always sticking around here you can
click here you can view all the stuff
you can check out you can view your car
and all that awesome stuff so that is
pretty much it how you can set up your
own e-commerce online web store within a
few minutes and obviously there's a
always always a chance of improving upon
this thing and you can see that we are
making use of everything stock right now
stock teams stock plugins everything and
yeah so so now even if you receive a lot
of traffic your view Commerce or rather
ecommerce store would be able to handle
that because you're hosting that all in
motion and these guys take care of your
website so your server would probably
not hang up upon a lot of requests as
well so try this out try to sell your
own things and let me know how it goes
in the comment section so that is all
pretty much for this one and if you
liked it then please don't forget to
