Miro and welcome to your 11 angular 6
tutorial in which you're going to take a
look at what services are in angular and
how to use them so let's get started ok
so in this tutorial we're gonna take a
look at what services are why would you
actually need services creating some
services using command line and what is
injectable decorator and how to inject
services in a component to actually make
use of so starting with what services
are now sometimes what you have is that
you need a place to store all your
methods for example let's see you are
creating a login website which our site
which requires registration so what you
want is a service which validates your
login details for example you might need
that function to be called from various
places for example from your login form
or when you are let's say changing your
password when you're already logged in
then also you need to verify the user
and so on and so forth so what services
is it is a singleton instance of a file
you can say which can be injected into
multiple components right so these are
services
why services well the what actually
answers the why but anyway what we have
is that whenever you want and let's just
say you want to get some data or perform
some operations on data for example
you're fetching some data so you want to
shift that task to services we do not
want your component to call HTTP api's
and the fetch data and display them all
at once
that's what angular's styling guides
such as to do right then we're gonna see
how to create services using from online
and other stuff so here we have our code
and this is the code from the previous
tutorial so there's the terminal so to
create a service what we need to do is
write NG generate we can do is just
write ng g as well add a short form but
I'm just gonna put ng generate service
and the name of your service so let's
just say this is my records hit enter
wait for command line to complete its
execution
you can see that we get created service
dot PS file and service don't expect or
PS file alright now what we have here is
inside app we had this record service
and record service dot because service
dot d s file right here know what we
want is we actually create a function
something like let's say get data now
what I want is that I want to just
transfer whatever data we had in here to
the service so let's just cut this and
turn these records like this inside the
service now what I want is we have movie
Travis inside our app component we need
records right so what I'm going to do is
create ng on in it lifecycle hook and
I'm gonna say this dot records
is equal to
something right now what I what that is
we need to inject this particular
service into this component now how do
we do that
well there are multiple ways what you
can do is you can make a service
explicit
to a component only or what you can do
is you can inject the service into your
ng module right here if you see
here inside these providers if you do
that what would happen is that your
service will be available to every
component which requests it right so in
most cases you want to do this but let's
say if you are creating a service
specific to a component which might not
really happen very often in that case
you can inject your service directly
into component as well but here what I'm
gonna do is inject the service by
writing something like this get rid of
this
import the god service from our record
store service and inside providers I can
add the service now once I do that I
have successfully injected the service
into any of the components that request
it now what I want is that I can just
say inside constructor but they start
with gods it's blank or rather we can
just write the calls here only and right
here what we can say is we want to
inject the service right so to do that
what I'm gonna do is inject it privately
private and right wait service name now
we need a name for the service to happen
right so I'm gonna write this as my
first service and to let angular know
that I actually want this recall service
in this my for so is variable we need to
give a type to this using typescript and
you're gonna say the type of this is
reco service
now what we have is that cannot find the
name record service now to fix that
we're gonna import this service from our
because service right here okay it looks
good now what we have is that this dot
my first service would give us access to
the service object right and now we can
just call this get data method right
here and we should be good to go
for example if we take a look the data
is same just like it was in the previous
example and to show that these services
are single term what we can do is
actually create another component which
would update let's say some value inside
the service and then another component
can pretty much get that value so those
two values would match so this is a task
you can do as an assignment yourself
what would you have to do I'll repeat is
that create another component which
injects the same service just like
following this module store PS approach
you have injected it you just need to
inject it into your component now the
other component updates some sort of
property of the service right here with
some method and previous component would
automatically reflect that because they
are this is a singleton service that
means it only has one instance running
at a time so we're gonna take we're
gonna discuss about how this dependency
injection di works exactly really soon
but for now Alyssa's for the sake of
clarity let us assume this happens
magically in the backend background so
yeah so yeah that's all for this one and
we're gonna make use of services as well
in almost every application we make so
this is an important concept and yeah
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
and I'll see you then in the next one
