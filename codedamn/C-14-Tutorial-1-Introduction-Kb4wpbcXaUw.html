your way first tutorial in C++ and in
this tutorial we'll be looking at what
C++ is and why you need to learn that
now you probably know what C++ is and
what it do but if you are extremely new
to C++ then let me give you a quick
intro to what it is and how it works
and more precisely why you need to learn
that now if you are from a web
programming background that is you know
kind of rough idea of what JavaScript is
or you know what PHP is then it should
be pretty much simple for you to grab
why C++ is used on your computers to
program software's but if you're
extremely new then C++ is a computer
programming language that is used to
program your computer itself so a quick
example would be like when you open your
calculator in Windows then using this
you could actually perform some
automatic like adding numbers
subtracting numbers and this was what
computers were made for initially but
eventually we just invested our time and
resources in this field and now we
actually program things in computer so
you see a lot of things like notepad
plus plus text editor if you ever use
then this application has the name
notepad plus plus because the developer
coded this application in C++ and he
liked the plus plus symbols so he just
used them in the application name as
well so now you know why it was Wireless
notepad plus plus and not just notepad
so that was a stupid example you can say
for C++ but in this tutorial what I want
to teach you guys is how to get started
with C++
now there are a lot of ideas online
which would help you to compile your
code and execute it but I would simply
prefer you to download some offline IDE
to work with because online IDs are not
real labeled but they would help you to
write your code anywhere if you are you
know just testing why a good section is
working or not working so first of all
let's download an IDE
I'd recommend code blocks so just Google
code blocks and open the way first link
code blocks dot org now currently it
looks like this but it may change in the
future so you need to figure your way
out now go to downloads and click on
download the binary release these are
the stable releases choose your
operating system
mine is Windows 10 but it doesn't show
Windows 10 yet because we understand is
recently launched so Windows 8 would
work as well so here's the thing you
need to download not this one
this one right here so what is the
difference is that this one doesn't come
with the compiler the compiler is the
software which will actually convert
whatever you have written in you know
simple C++ language into your binary
code which is more like of a CPU light
thing
so the CPU would understand what you
have actually returned after the
compiler converts it into a suitable
format so this doesn't come with
compilers so this is for somebody who
already has some compiler in their
computer installed but just want the
interface of code blocks so go with this
one this comes with GCC compiler which
is the most recommended till the date so
go and download from Burley OS or
SourceForge
and when you're done you'll get a file
this is around 110 mb/s I guess so I
don't need to download this because I
already did that so when you're done
launch the setup click on next next
buttons as usual and when you found done
you'll get a screen with something like
this so this is our IDE main screen and
once you're done and you are right here
click on file new and empty file now
here is where we would write all of our
code so I guess that's all for this
tutorial because I want to teach you
guys hello world program in C++ in the
next video so don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
