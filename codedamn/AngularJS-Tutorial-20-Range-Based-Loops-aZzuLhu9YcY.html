your 20th angularjs tutorial in which
will be discussing about something
called range based loops in angularjs
now in the last two tutorials I realized
that I'd then discussed about range
based loops in ng-repeat
back in the doctoral five or six I guess
so we'll be doing it right now
so what range based loops are in
angularjs they're pretty much similar
like we used to work with injury bead so
I'll screed Li ng repeat and earlier
what we used to do is we created an
array of elements and then we did like
person in persons and then we used to
echo out that with two curly braces but
sometimes you don't need to use any data
from the loop you just need that task to
run multiple times for that let's say
you want a range based loop so what you
can do is you can do ng repeat I or any
variable in my range and let's say you
echo I here and a br so inside your
controller dot GS we need to make sure
that my range is actually available in
the scope so let's create a variable to
our range equals to 10 and for I equals
to 0 is less than clinch I plus plus war
my range equals to this
so my range dot dot push I alright so
now we have God the my range added ready
with number zero to nine and now let's
say the scope dot my rage equals to my
range
okay so let's reload the page and as you
can see we get zero one two three four
five six seven eight nine as the numbers
echoed but what if you want it to just
run one or two times or number of times
which you can count on your fingers so
for that what you can do is you can just
create your arrow here only just do it
like like this and it would work
similarly
there would be no change but let's say
you want this to run a thousand times or
ten thousand times then what you do now
this loop is also expensive when you are
running ten tens of thousands of times
because this would create a lot of
memory usage so what we can do is well
we don't actually need any practical we
don't actually basically I haven't seen
any practical use of running angular
loop tens of hundreds of thousand times
but this is pretty handy way I found it
myself so I'm going to share you with
your guys so to do that what you can do
is you can create something called range
as new array hundred and what it would
do is it would initialize an array with
hundred elements each of being undefined
or null I don't remember it is undefined
with this even now so there would be
hundred elements in all and since we
want this to be the range
we'll set here I in range so whatever
you do right here now don't make use of
i because i contains null now so it's
not a wise choice to make use of i
because i isn't an index loop anymore so
whatever you do right here it would
repeat 100 times on your webpage but we
have a problem when you will reload this
what would happen is the loop won't work
at all and in the console you would see
that whoa this should be range in the
console you would see that we get this
error ng-repeat
duplicates this dupes is actually
duplicates so what happens is ng-repeat
is not designed to work with duplicates
now since this new array contains
hundred duplicates each of being each of
being undefined 100 times then we need a
fix to this now one fix is to make sure
that angular works by the track index
and not by the elements so by default
angular tracks the loop with the value
inside that particular thing but now
angular is tracking it with index value
of that so when I will reload this then
you can see that I'll just shrink this
one a little bit then you can see that
this is hundred times printed this
whatever this is written so that's
pretty much handy if you want to work
with loops because it's much cleaner to
use when you don't care about the
iterating variable you don't need to use
that so in that situations you can use
this fix so that's it for this tutorial
and in the next tutorial we'll be
discussing something more about
angularjs so till then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
