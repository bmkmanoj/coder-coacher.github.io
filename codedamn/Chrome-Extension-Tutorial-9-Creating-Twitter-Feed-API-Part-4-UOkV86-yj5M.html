Mei hole and welcome to your ink
tutorial I guess for Chrome extension
development and in this tutorial let us
continue with our extension so right now
we are just console logging the stuff
instead of this what we can do is we can
just resolve this promise by saying name
description and links so it will just
create an object with something like
name with a value of whatever is passed
in inside this name variable
similarly for description and link this
is just a es6 way of doing that so we
are resolving this and now we want to
create the check if exists function so
we're going to create a check if exists
info right and I'm just going to return
the info itself we're not going to
create the definition for this right now
let's create the chrome notification
source so for the chrome notifications
first of all we need to have this
permission of notifications from the
manifest and then we can say chrome the
notification let's create and then we
want to pass them first of all the ID of
the notification if you want to pass in
any then the options and then the
callback so for the callback we do not
need anything right now for the ID what
we can do is we can place in the link
which is the info link right here
because we can make use of this ID to
redact the user when the user clicks on
that notification then for the options
part we have to create some sort of
options so we can say let options is
this notification would be a side basic
and the title would be of the
notification would be info dot main for
the message it would be info dot
description and the icon URL I'm going
to just keep it to icon let's PNG as
well so this is our object for very
basic notifications and we do not want
to show any callback
right any call back so that should not
be a problem for us so again we have got
our thing ready and by the way this is
synchronous so we do not actually need
to have been right here but still
anyways so now we have got our
notification shown to user we want to
save that but first of all let's just
take a look in the browser so if we
reload this you can see that we get this
notification right here which looks kind
of cool so if you kind of dig a little
what you could have done is that you
could actually just take out this image
as well and that the icon URL to that
particular image so that would kind of
look even better so try it out yourself
if you can and if you want any help then
I'm always there you can just leave a
comment below and I would be happy to
help so yeah that's all for this
tutorial and in the next one we are
going to finally implement our check it
exists and we're going to save that as
well once we have shown the notification
so again that's all for this one and if
you liked it then please don't forget to
subscribe and if you want to support
content like that then please check out
the patreon link in the description that
would really help again thank you for
watching and I will see you then in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
