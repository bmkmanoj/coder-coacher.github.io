and welcome to your second bootstrap
tutorial in which will be discussing
some more things about bootstrap and
from the next tutorial on words will be
finally getting our hands on with
bootstrap coding now as I said in this
tutorial we'll be discussing some more
things about mujra we'll be looking at
some of the examples which are provided
by the official website and would be
discussing the same so if you go to the
side get bootstrap chrome / getting
started you'll see a column right here
examples down here if you see and if you
look here then you will see that there
are a lot of you can see specific
examples to a specific topic for example
if I open the boot SWAT team right here
now you see here we have got a lot of
buttons toolbars drop downs and all of
these things exclusively made by this
bootstrap team right here are you all of
the stuff you see right here is just
made by the use of the already coded
bootstrap CSS files add JavaScript and
nothing else all of these sliders and
these text boxes these panels Will's if
you say that formally and all of these
progress bars alerts navigation bars
dropdowns all of that and there are tons
of examples here's the Jumbotrons the
navigation bars the custom components
are all of that for your websites don't
worry we'll be taking look at all of
these one by one in future tutorials but
in this tutorial I just wanted to show
you some of the examples with bootstrap
and why bootstrap is useful and yeah not
to mention if I just like let me just
open the spin yep so this Jumbotron page
bootstrap websites
mostly responsive so you know it's it's
just depends on the developer whether he
wants the website to be responsive or
not but i would highly recommend you to
create your website if you are grilling
with bootstrap to be responsive because
responsive websites is the most trending
thing these days because they will just
get you free from coding you're another
mobile version of website like doing
like MDOT your website calm you'll be
just you know just saving some time
there so if you just dock that on the
right or left and you resize this you
see that the content adjust accordingly
or if you don't want to do that you have
got another tool in chrome which is the
toggle device mode and if you just click
that button right there just unlock that
from the screen and you just play with
right here let's say apple iphone 4
excuse me just reload this so you see
now that i'm actually simulating an
iphone 4 here inside my chrome browser
and this circle you see the dark one is
actually kind of my touch so that's how
this website would behave idly on an
iphone 4 and that's how this menu would
look like and if i resize this that's
how this would scale down or up
according to the screen size so that's
pretty much it that's what ever i had
for you guys for this tutorial and from
the next tutorial we will be taking a
hands-on to bootstrap coding and would
be coding some awesome websites as well
so that's all for this tutorial and
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
