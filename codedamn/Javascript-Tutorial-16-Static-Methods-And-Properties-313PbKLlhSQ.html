16th JavaScript tutorial in this
tutorial we'll be looking at something
you call static methods and properties
in JavaScript in the last few tutorials
we learned about what the prototypal
inheritance model in javascript is and
how does it work and what are the
benefits of prototypes and how do you
inherit the properties and methods of
one constructor function into another
unlike that in the last tutorial we
learned about private and public methods
and properties in the constructor
function of JavaScript but in this
tutorial we'll be learning a simple and
interesting concept which is actually
based on the prototype chain model which
is static methods and properties in
JavaScript to understand this first of
all let's write a constructor function
and let's name it my function
and let's create two properties or maybe
just one and in the next method let's
return the square of this number okay
down here let's create a object of this
constructor function
now in previous tutorials what we used
to do is supposingly if I want to add
any new property or method to this
function so what we did is like we do
object dot ABC then we console.log isn't
it it returns me hundred don't no need
to check it now previously we used to do
this or we also did like this my
function dot prototype
not ABC equals
let's say 200 then also it will echo or
it will just print out 100 because it in
the prototype chain the object or ABC
property is much closer to the object
object obj object then the my function
prototype dot ABC so this method right
here is closer to this properties closer
to this object therefore it doesn't go
up in the prototype chain to look for
this however if we remove this then
object obj dot ABC would echo out 200
what if we don't include the word
prototype what happens if we just simply
write my function d EF is equal to 300
now what is happening here let's see if
you console.log this object the d EF
let's see what echoes on or outputs on
the browser
and as you can see the second one
echoes as undefined but why it is like
undefined why does the keyboard
prototype make so different if you know
right now if you have guessed how it how
and why this is echo echoing or printing
undefined then I am pretty sure that you
are clear with the basics of prototype I
prototypal inheritance in JavaScript but
don't worry if you are not clear or
don't know why it echoed undefined
again while echoed basically undefined
instead of 300 then don't worry I'll
show you right here and yes we're good
to go
okay so
okay good now what's happening here is
in this code
first of all we are using my function
prototype ABC now what happens here is
this is
this is my function
I function
constructor function let's say this is a
constructor function and when we do this
my function dot prototype the ABC so
what happens is supposingly this is the
prototypal shade of this object with
various objects in between for instance
the first one being
last one being object itself I like that
so when we do
my function dot prototype dot ABC what
happens is
this constructor function adds the
property ABC to this prototype shade so
when we do like my function dot
prototype ABC this is okay I have got a
prototype chain tell object and let me
add this anywhere in this prototype
chain so it creates a property ABC right
here ABC and sets it equal to
200 okay so just like any other public
property created with that this keyword
we can now access this ABC property with
the help of any of the objects or
instances created of this constructor
function for now we have I guess obj now
when we create object function then as
usual when we do obj dot ABC then first
of all it locates this ABG ABC property
within itself and it says no I don't
have this property so what it does is it
goes through the constructor function
and constructor function looks in the
prototype chain its own prototype chain
and found finds the ABC property and
returns it to the object and object then
finally console launch it but what here
what's happening here my function dot d
EF now when we call something like this
then what happens is this d EF variable
is created local to this constructor
function
okay so it's similar like creating body
EF here it's just the same thing so this
d EF here created EF here created is a
static method basically you do you
cannot call it as a private method
because it cannot be accessed in we're
in this constructor function it is a
static method which is not linked into
this prototype chain this this property
is not linked into the prototype chain
therefore when object goes to the
constructor function and constructor
functions looks into the prototype chain
it does not found find this object it
does not find this object until object
object actually then returns null then
null is passed all over this on
basically undefined then undefined is
passed all over the prototype chain
until the object console logs the
undefined so how do I access this this
property basically to access static
properties we have to type the method
name itself for example the method name
right now is my function so when we type
the method name itself then we can
actually use the static property if we
try to console.log now
let's see as you can see 300 prints out
so to access static property we have to
call the property with the method name
itself now this property can not be
actually inherited by any new other
created objects for example if we create
another object with object 2 let's say
new new my function still still this
property would be undefined
because it is a static property only
bind to the constructor function so I
hope this tutorial is clear for static
properties and methods similarly just
like you create static properties like
this you can also create static methods
like supplying a function I hope you got
me
so similarly you can create static
methods as well so I hope this tutorial
is clear about static properties and
methods in the java script of
constructor functions and using the
prototype chain so in the upcoming
tutorial I guess I'll be finishing off
this advanced JavaScript 10 tutorial
series and we'll be starting with some
really cool effects and what you say
modifying DOM and using basically
JavaScript to show user interface
interface and programming web and all
that interesting stuff so don't forget
