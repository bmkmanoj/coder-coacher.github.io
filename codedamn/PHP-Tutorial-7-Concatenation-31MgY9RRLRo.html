seventh PHP tutorial in which will be
learning about something called
concatenation in PHP na concatenation in
PHP means literally joining two strings
together so let's see if I have first
half of a string as hello and second
half of a string as world so either I
can do echo first half echo second half
but that would be a little tedious so
even that would work fine but we usually
concatenate two strings two or more
strings when we have a lot of strings to
echo that saves us lines as well as type
actually so to concatenate what we do is
we make use of full stop the full stop a
little dot here on your greater than
symbol so this dot actually means
concatenate the two strings so first
half concatenated with which second half
gives us the same result as we were
doing two in two separate lines echo
first half and it goes second half so
this concatenation is actually really
useful to concatenate a lot of things
like you could actually concatenate some
HTML here as well so you can see span
how re you I am in a spell and you will
actually close that then you can
concatenate another variable this is a
variable or actually this is not defined
so we won't use that so you could pretty
much to concatenations here as well
like that I'll when you will reload this
you see that we get hello world from the
PHP code and this one is HTML we wrote
so concatenation would actually help you
to save a little bit of gold and time
when you are writing short programs but
a lot of code a lot of time when you are
writing very long scripts in PHP so
that's pretty much how concatenation
works and I'd be using a lot of
concatenation in my future tutorials so
especially made this tutorial on
concatenation so as to divert all of
your attention to this important thing
which is generally missed by most of the
people and then they face a lot of hard
time when they are debugging they're
good for errors so that's it for this
tutorial and i'll be teaching something
more useful in the next ones so don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
