express tutorial in which I'll be
extending this application a little bit
to make it kind of a more versatile one
so so far what we have done as we just
created this simple response for only
our homepage
but let's generalize this response for
any page so let's just say you have a
lot of files and you don't want to add
each of them by a name by name so what
we can do is we can make use of
something called as regular expressions
to work with so yeah so that would work
as well so if you do like app not get
and then as you know that regular
expressions are included in to the
limiters you can just choose these two
as well if you like to but I'll just go
with the slashes and I'm going to say
that the name of the file should start
with anything except a new line should
contain one or more characters and
should end with that as well so that is
just a regular expression to match a
name of a file and then once that is
done I want this function to request our
response and I'm gonna say that response
or basically this thing right here so
and right here what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to say request dot params 0 I'm
just going to console.log this as well
for you guys so that you can see what
this is and plus dot HTML and this is
the root file all right now if I just
create
another file here file to dot HTML this
works good and if I start the server
scripts and team J s go here run and if
I try to just go somewhere or not
somewhere first let's just go to the
valid URL file - you can see this shows
me this works good and in the console we
have this zero as file - so request dot
parameters shows me that this is the
only parameter which is the name of the
file and what I'm gonna do is that if
like a user with it's a URL which is not
valid it shows me a very bad kind of
looking at so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to first of all check whether
the file exists or not and if it exists
then I'm just going to send that file
and if it doesn't then I'm just going to
throw a 404 not found file to the
browser so to check if a file exists we
are going to make use of the file system
which we have looked upon and last
tutorials couple off so I'm just going
to say file system is require FS and
right here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say that if FS dot start
synchronize and right here what I'm
going to do is I am just gonna say but
dot join
and right here request Brahms zero and
dot HTML and don't worry if that doesn't
make a lot of sense right now I'm just
going to explain that real soon
so if that is true and we need actually
or one more thing here so I'll just say
is file and yeah I would like to have
this here all right so now if that is a
file then what I want to do is I would
like to do this thing right here else I
would just like to do this thing again
but I would like to throw out the 404
file like that and I'm just going to
create a new 404 hey there what are you
looking at so let's see if that works
and not really because I haven't set the
reset the server let's just reload this
again alright so it shows me a lot of
tress there and what else can we do I
guess we can just throw this whole thing
into a try block so what I'm going to do
is let's just get rid of this whole
thing I'm just gonna say try to FS
if FS dot start synchronized and again
we would require this thing part dot
join files that I need your request dot
Barnes 0 then dot HTML dot is file catch
error and I'm just going to say throw me
a 404 all right so now let's just take a
look ok alright so now we have been
shown a 404 not found file because this
file doesn't exist so if I now open try
to open file to dot HTML file
- I still chose me alright so I just
console.log this thing right here try to
go on so or just right here so if I just
console.log this thing right here do
fire rerun this code
filed all right so we have got a slash
problem here so I'm just going to append
that directly all right so now yeah so
all right so finally we have God this
works good and that took us a whole lot
of time and a few bugs as well but here
I am to demonstrate what I've been doing
so far again and that's what I have done
so if I just get rid of the slide so
what we are doing in here is that this
regular expression just matches any file
any file name that begins with one or
more characters so this begins with one
or more characters indeed and it if it
does then it tries to run this code
because this code throws an error I
would just simply not do without this
try block so if it is a file indeed then
I would like to throw this file else
catch an error catch the error
console.log it if you like error and do
send this file so if I again restart the
server and go to file - it says nothing
because it works file 2x it throws me an
error but it is silent error and it
doesn't work doesn't appear on the
document well there would be some good
ways to just you know just check whether
a file exists or not but this is I am
just having just I just used the most
simple way which you can make use of to
check a file with this file stream right
there so that's how you create just a
simple application web application and
now you can just have any new file like
my about me dot HTML
you can and just write your own story
here and you can just run that on your
server as well without any extension
like not HTML or whatever so that would
completely fine so you're free to go and
experiment with this code and I would be
just posting all of this code yet I'm
still you on this URL clan code down
calm and I'll be leaving the link in the
description so if you just want to
download this application code you can
go ahead and check out the description
the link would be there for the download
and this is by the way the code dam form
where you can come and discuss your
problems about programming and ask for
support so that's how I put this one and
I'll see you then in the next one don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
