your 39th JavaScript tutorial now in
this tutorial we'll be discussing about
and I'll be introducing you to regular
expressions in JavaScript
now regular expressions are if you don't
know what they are let me tell you that
regular expressions are kind of pattern
they create a base pattern which is
basically used to match a instance of
string in another string so basically in
regular expression what we do is let's
say I have a la JavaScript as a string
in JavaScript now I want to find the
word love I want to know whether this
love is present in the sentence or not
not kind of present but basically I want
to create a kind of pattern which
matches love in the sentence so what
I'll do is I'll create a regular
expression with the expression as love
and I would run this regular expression
against the sentence now you'll say ok
so why the heck do we need regular
expressions for that we can easily do
that with
your index of and last index of methods
so the reason why we need regular
expressions is because regular
expressions are kind of dynamic so about
that what I mean is let's say I have a
string with a valid email id bar let's
say me whole MPD other and gmail.com so
I want to create let's assume that
basically we are getting this email ID
from somewhere on the client as an input
so let's say I want to validate this as
a valid email address so since we don't
know what the client would enter what
would be the email ID and what would be
the domain name and what between the
top-level domain so we can actually use
the traditional index of method so to
create a regular expression first we
would need to identify what is kind of
dynamic input from the user and what
would be the fixed input every time so
if you
pay attention in this email address
right here then what you'll find unique
about this is every email address would
have a at the rate side at the rate side
okay and every valid online email
address I'm not talking about localhost
so every email online valid email
address would have a top-level domain
and top-level domain is the domain
extension I should rather say and as you
know that every email address has some
sort of limited cash set and by that I
mean that you're only allowed to few
letters numbers and dashes and I guess
that's pretty much everything and I
guess we also have plus signs in there
for some email providers but not symbols
like you have like the pipe symbol or
the under each symbol or the hash symbol
you're not allowed to use that in email
address so let's say I want to create a
kind of pattern now we have this pattern
that we have the other is signed we have
the top-level domain
separated
submitted by a dot and we have a email
address that is some sort there are some
sort of limited character set so what
she do in regular expressions is that we
would create a kind of pattern
containing all these three literal
information in the form of information
that computer understands and we would
match every string against that regular
expression so if that string matches or
if that string actually passes the test
for regular expressions for which we use
a couple of methods known as test and X
DX EC then we can say that yeah this is
a valid email address but if that
doesn't then that means that user did
some supplier some you can say malformed
input in the box and we just
counterfeited a attempt for let's say
you can say kind of hacking to your site
so that's how regular expressions were
basically so to summarize we have
regular expressions which actually
create a base pattern for you on which
you can throw some strengths from
dynamically created users dynamically
strings rated from users and you can
match those string against your regular
expressions and since regular
expressions are dynamic so we can create
regular expressions for emails your
telephone numbers
and your URLs your I don't know let's
say what you say that I don't know
whatever you can create almost anything
for a regular expression like you can
create that if the username is less than
four characters and contains only
alphanumeric characters and do not
contain anything else so we have regular
expressions for that so that's all for
this tutorial and I hope you are well
introduced to regular expressions and
this would be kind of a again a mini
series in regular expressions so I'll
see you then in the next tutorial and
