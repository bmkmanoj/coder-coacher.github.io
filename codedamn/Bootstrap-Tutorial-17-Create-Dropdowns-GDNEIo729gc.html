tutorial number 17 of bootstrap and in
this tutorial I'm going to show you how
to create a drop-down and you have
already seen a drop down before if you
don't remember here's how a drop-down
looks like so we have already created
this drop down in the navigation bar but
let's just take a look at it formerly
that how we actually could it so let's
just go underneath this div and yeah so
let's start coding a drop down so for
the dog drawn I'm sorry that drop down
you need a div or anything else are you
will would also go just like we made use
of here but I'm just making use of dip
right now and just like this we have to
add a class of drop down right here and
here you go and obviously closing div
and then what we need is we need to
toggle this drop down somehow in this
case in the menu case we made use of
this a tag so let's just make use of
this a tag on LI let's just copy this
thing right here just paste it so you
see that I'm making use of a href hash
and you can just change it to JavaScript
avoid to avoid the jumping of age class
drop down toggle you can just get rid of
that because that's not really required
data toggle drop down this line is this
you can say this attribute is required
for the drop down to work so don't omit
it and this is not required okay and
this text is what would be your
drop-down so let's just say open drop
down and this carrot this would add a
little triangle icon like that something
like that or the down one to your
drop-down you know just in front of this
open program takes so it looks like that
it is some kind of drop down
okay so the next thing we need to do is
we need to create a list which would be
shown when this link is clicked and
that's pretty simple but you have to do
is you have to create a you will of
class drop-down menu and just follow it
strictly a lie a href whatever let's
just say this is drop down item one I
guess I missed the closing type don't
worry drop down item two why not just
crop it again and again and wine I'll
just close all the bits and make html5
happy okay so here goes 3 4 5 all right
so we are set now the next thing we have
to do is to just check it out on the
browser let's just reload this and down
here you see if I click on this open the
drop-down you see nothing happens but
actually something has happened if you
scroll down here you see the drop-down
opens now this drop-down is opening down
so that kind of looks jaggi and makes
the page jump a bit so you can even make
this open upwards or you can you know
just apply some styles on this to make
it a button so let's see if I switch
this a two button let's just say and we
don't need the edge of now and I add a
class of button buttoned primary
let's check this out and as you can see
it looks much better now and to make it
the drop down to make the drop down open
on the top what you have to do is you
have to make use of the drop down menu
and dash then the class and with that
you can toggle the left and right
positions of your drop down so if I add
to the see you will let's just say it
drop down menu right and if I go to my
page and click here you see the
drop-down appears here instead of here
now this is useful if you are having
like a full-width button so if you are
having a width of one hundred percent
and you don't want the drop down to have
a one hundred percent width but you want
to toggle the position from left to
right then you know in that case you can
make you love that add about the top
what i was talking is that you can make
use of the drop up class and here you
see instead of drop down just change
this to drop up so that gaara makes a
lot of sense because a drop down is you
know just you can imagine it drops down
but a drop up we'll just go up and don't
worry you don't need to change all of
these classes right that would work
fight with the drop up as well so yeah
so that's pretty much it for the drop
down and drop up as you can see and
that's how you basically create a simple
drop down menu and donnell that so
that's very much it for this tutorial
