eighth Google Chrome extension
development tutorial and from this
tutorial onwards it will be kind of a
miniseries going on for the development
of a new Google Chrome extension so the
idea that came to my mind is to create a
kind of extension which allows a user to
share any text or any image or any page
or maybe a link as well to their Twitter
account immediately without going to
Twitter and opening it and all that
stuff so what would be the purpose of
the extension is the purpose the
extension would do like the user would
select the text or any link or anything
I would right click on the text just
like these three options will have our
own option coded down here in this menu
and once the user clicks on this one of
that option then a pop-up box would pop
up here somewhere on the screen then the
text would be automatically filled in
for the user and just user have to just
click on the share button so the idea is
pretty much simple and I hope that with
the help of this miniseries we'll be
able to learn more about Chrome
extension and how the Google APs work
for the Chrome extension so to start
with I have deleted all the unnecessary
files we had from our previous tutorials
in Chrome extension this updated
background sorry manifesto JSON file
which has only one background script
background Egeus and this persistent
false
now what this persistent false actually
means is that if we don't include this
line then what happened what will happen
is this background script would keep on
running in the background and would eat
unnecessary chrome memory so just two
free resources and keep the browsing of
the user fast we can add this
persistence false so that this
background script goes to sleep when it
is not referred for example when the
user is browsing normally clicking links
then this script is not required
this script is only required when the
user right clicks on any selection or
anywhere on the page so this persistence
false will help the user memory to be
free so this tutorial was a short
introduction to what we'll be doing in
our future tutorials and how we'll be
completing this extension and I will
start the coding of this extension from
the next tutorial so don't forget to
subscribe and keep watching my videos
