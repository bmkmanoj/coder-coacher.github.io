JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
we'll be learning about an operator call
instance off now I think I should have
taught you this and the prototype
section of videos but never mind better
late than never and about this instance
of keyword or operator this instance of
operator returns true or false if the it
returns true if the variable we are
supplying on the left hand side is an
instance of or is a object which belongs
to the object on the right hand side let
me show you an example
first of all let's create a string
stored in food this new string and we'll
do like any string right here anything
will do we just console.log this
and we'll do foo and stands up straight
so if you remember from the prototype
section now we are calling the
constructor of this drink and we are
assigning in the parentheses the
parameter as JavaScript so it creates a
new string and remember this is not a
primitive value this is a string value
right here if we remove the new keyword
right here then this would be a
primitive value but with a keyword new
this is a string value as the browser
let's reload this and we get true as
expected
now if we remove this new keyword now
what happens is that we get false now
why is that because if I create another
variable string with JavaScript and now
let's console.log these two separately
consoler the first and console the bar
then
what happens is if I reload this then we
see two different things here first of
all we are seeing first in the Fuu
variable we created a new string with
the with an object now string right here
is an object in the Fuu but bar in the
bar we are just assigning this string
function and passing a string so this
function right there creates a primitive
value so obviously this thing is not
equal to this thing so if we do bar
instance of string then obviously it
would return as false now in the
production sites basically when you take
the site's life or your client sites or
anything or your own side we don't
usually use instance of regularly but
yeah it is yeah it is useful to keep in
memory or know what is instance off and
how it is used so I just taught you how
to use instance of let's to take and
look on another example if you want then
we have a number one
then we create a separate number like
this and this is technically equal to
this sentence only because we are new
not using the constructor function so it
creates a primitive value only so we
have like food instance of string and
then we do bar instance of okay true
false as expected now basically we use
instance of keyword to check whether or
to determine what is the data type of a
variable for example in languages like
in oh sorry languages like C and C++ we
use data types like int or care like
that to store the values but in
JavaScript we have keyword var through
which we could create any variable and
the variable can hold any value so using
instance off you can check whether the
value is a string number or object of
any of your constructor function you
have created like that so this was a
short tutorial on instance off and
thanks for watching and don't forget to
