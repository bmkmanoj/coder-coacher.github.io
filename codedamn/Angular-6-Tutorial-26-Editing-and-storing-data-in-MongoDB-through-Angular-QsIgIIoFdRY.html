Mabel and welcome to 26th angular 6
tutorial in which you're gonna take a
look at how to make a text field
editable on the front end on angular and
reflect changes in Mongo on some machine
so let's get started okay so in this
video we're gonna see how the user can
actually update the code assigned to it
with the help of simple interface we're
gonna expose through angular so first of
all for that inside our code what we're
gonna do is inside a dashboard
components HTML file you're gonna say
something like input type text value I'm
just gonna echo this out an ID of my
code something like this I'm going to
strap it and divide II controls
something like that and right here we
can say something like input type
'button value update code and on
clicking I just want to update code with
the event being passed just like that
alright now inside a dashboard component
what I'm going to do is write update
boot with the event coming in I'm going
to get the value first as event dot
target dot parent node dot query
selector and then I'm gonna go with my
code dot value I believe this is correct
if you take a look even the target gives
us this parent node gives us this and
query selector my code would give us
this all right after this so let's just
say we had this dot user dot update code
let's square this method real quick but
subscribe
scroll subscribe data I'm gonna say if
data dot success is true
alert your code was updated otherwise I
lower some problem
alright now let's just create this
method real quick in our user service
and say update code get so so value I
had we're gonna say you returned this
dot HTTP POST I'm gonna say this is a
code status something like this this
would be API code and then we've got a
personal value right so I'm just gonna
pass in a value like this let's just
create this quote status here interface
code status gives us a status data dot
success right so this should be success
here and data dot o success here yep so
there we are simple enough
and on the backend part what we're gonna
do is actually this is becoming a really
messy so what I'm pretty soon through
this mess API slash code gives us
request response which should be an
async but for now let's just console log
requested session dot user and request
dot body dot value just see what we are
getting right and what we can do is just
go to here login may will etch the red
one dot-com one two three one two three
four five it's some it and what we have
here
sort of error if we take a look
you
you
you
okay looks like we are not running this
over so let's just start node Mon
indexed Archie is like that yep so now
let's try one more time its summit you
can see we are successfully logged in
now if I remove this success here and
update the code this request is sent we
do not get a response as expected but
inside our terminal we get the email ID
of the user signed in and updated code
so let's just contain this in our
database as well so what I'm gonna say
is user dot find one
what we have is email has requested
session dot user so first of all we can
just say
or we can just say user as a wait user
defined one if there's no user response
dot JSON we're going to say success
false message invalid user and
withdrawal otherwise what I want to do
is user that update email should be
again requested session dot he user and
what I want to do is actually just
update the code so I just want to set
the code to be value which we have with
request or body dot value right now let
me just take a look real quick if that
is actually the case code is yep so once
that is done what I want to do is just
oh wait this and response toward JSON
success is true and that is it pretty
much so let's just go back here clear
the cookies because the server has been
restarting so many times
we are redirected to login May 1 at the
rate they will each other at 1 calm 1 2
3 4 5 8 summit I remove the success I
update the code I get your quote was
updated fair enough I reload this page
and you can see that our code is updated
so this is basically how you would
expose something some sort of interface
to update user details to let users
update their own details on your angular
front-end with Mongo and node and
similarly you can create a similar
interface for updating passwords and you
know you can do pretty much everything
now you can create a user profile page
and you know imagination is your limit
so that's all pretty much for this
tutorial and I'll see you then in the
next one
