and welcome to your fortieth angularjs
tutorial in which we'll be looking at
link property of the directive
definition object now in the last
tutorial I discussed some of the common
properties but there's a special
property and it's kinda interesting and
fun to write with and that is the link
property now the link property basically
works with the Dom of your page so it
controls how your view is you know
modified so let's get started with a
simple example so we already have this
my first script and then let's just jump
to the script and inside the return what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to add
another property notice link and I'm
just going to supply it as a function
let's just name it link function now
this link function let's just create
this link function and we would we
create this with credits right here so
link function okay and what this accepts
is it accepts three arguments the first
one is scope the second one is element
and the scope is the scope similar which
we make use of here the element is the
element it returns the reference to that
element on which this directive is
applied for example if I have like give
my first directive and this then this
element contains the reference to this
day right here then the third one is the
attrs or the attributes now this
contains all the information about the
attributes the additional attributes
like the class variety or whatever here
it is so inside here what I'm going to
do is simply I'm just going to say
element which is the element right here
dot bind
click and we can make use of this thing
right here because angular by default
makes use of a library called JQ light
and as you can see this is from JQ light
only the bind one and if you are using
jQuery that also there is no problem
because you know JQ light is just a you
can say a subset of jQuery so on click
what I'm going to do is obviously this
is the traditional JavaScript and just
wanna say element or just alert element
dot inner HTML let's try this out okay
and let's just add something here
oh no okay
we already have the template so this is
not required so let's just reload this
and we have added gone off a click eewan
right here okay let's try this out
and as you can see it returns undefined
right now or just console.log that first
to see what properties are a level so we
get the div and inside the zero okay so
it kind of return some array
oh yeah so surely it would return the
array so if I do like element zero then
how does it look like so it now kinda
works and if I add I wonder if I add
another element right here and remove
this then let's just see what happens
okay so right now they are sharing the
same scope which we will be looking at
how to make them isolated but that's not
the concern for this tutorial so let's
just get back to the work and right here
we can just do something like that okay
so that Ghana
works okay so now let's try to do
something interesting with this link
function and to do that let's just say I
want to modify the text inside this
whenever this is clay so right now we
are just console logging this but what
if I want to modify the text and to do
that let's just make use of some code
let's just get rid of all of this code
right here okay and let's just create
this code a bit of code from scratch so
I'm just going to say function link
function and scope element and either of
that work either you can type dollar or
without daughter so that would work
because eventually what is happening is
this these three arguments are being
populated by the compile function of
angularjs but we don't need to worry
about that all right here what I'm going
to say is scope dot name is hello world
and I'm just going to say scope dot
change name is a function
name scope dot name is name or let us a
new name alright so now let's just
create a directive definition or check
so turn restrict RESP our ICT ei or
whatever and the next thing you would
like to have is the length property
obviously link and this link function
the next thing is the template for now
as you say this is hello world or just
let's just say this is current text is
name okay so what is happening here is
that we are first of all creating a
scope dot name property in here with the
link function and we have created a
change name here as well the next thing
I can do is I can just bind this ng
click change name span tag okay now
let's just try it out on the browser and
see what happens so that's reload scope
is not defined oh okay
see see current text is hello world and
when I click on this the current text
okay so context is let's just say
hey there answer though as you can see
it changes to hey there so far so good
but what happens when you have the
multiple controllers or the multiple
elements with the same directive now
what happens is when I click one it
changes everybody so what what is
happening here is that all of these
directives are sharing the same scope
now this is something I would like to
cover in a separate tutorial so I'm just
going to end my tutorial right here and
we'll be doing that in the next one or
