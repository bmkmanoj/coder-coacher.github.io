your 16th angularjs tutorial in which
we'll be learning something about hdtb
service in angularjs now HTTP service is
nothing but a fancy way of saying that
to retrieve data from servers and remote
so as you can see so it's kinda like the
XML HTTP object we have done in
JavaScript so let's just start with it
and as I write the code I'll explain
what I'm doing so first of all let us
create a controller and this application
should be about let's say
mmm some people living in the town their
names and there you can say age
so let's grade people as the controller
name and in the controller dot GS let's
grab this data first say angular dot mod
2 this should be made up main app and
since we don't have any dependencies
from now so let's just leave that area
as blank and the controller right here
is people
so we need to create an anonymous
function right here and to pass the
scope obviously now here you need to
pass the HTTP object as well since this
is a core service of angularjs by now by
the version of one point 3.14 therefore
we don't need any dependency for this
HTTP object this would work just fine
by including the angularjs main file
itself so we're good to go so now in the
goal so now in the this function right
here we have access to both scope and
HTTP services so let's get started now
and before actually getting started we
need something else rather so let's
create a new file here and in here
let's write some raw data for our
application
so let's create a JSON out of this
database GA Suen alright
and now
let's add something like the gods
inside this
I'll just your name
is Moo
edge
18
then the next record
name
um
J
age 18
then the next one any of these rákóczi
go it's up to you name Alex
age 27
the final one would be name
anonymous
age
so I'll record the last one looks kind
of fancy but this is just an example of
dummy codes here so let's now just
implement it with a tab
so let's now just return out to our code
let's use the HTTP service to achieve
this day than to display it nicely in
our document so to do that first of all
let's create some container kind of
thing to actually work with so I'll just
create a list here and I'll just say for
the h2 names and age of programmers in
the local area and now what I'll do is
I'll make use of the ng-repeat directive
which we learned long back in I don't
know maybe it's second or third tutorial
but you can always look back into that
so what I'll do is I'll do L I ng repeat
now this would repeat Li as many times
as the condition it inside this is true
so I'll write the condition later on
so now let's write a condition itself
right now so that it's easier to work
with later so to start with in ng-repeat
I like to give it a temporary name of
the data we are grabbing from angular
scope so that's right for person in for
sons and I know both of these are not
defined right now but we'll be doing
this and would be defining this inside
the controller just in a minute
and when this happens then I want person
dot and the databases name and a column
should be good and then I want person
dot age if I spell it right yes
so our ng-repeat
is ready to work with and now let's hook
up the controller finally so let's get
to HTTP now and how do we work with that
so to do that first of all right HTTP
GET now this get would initiate a get
request with anything we supply inside
the parenthesis that URL here so there
would be a get request to that and since
right now we are working on localhost so
I'll just do a local host URL and this
is angularjs I guess and the file is
database dot JSON so let me just confirm
this one's in the browser if this
actually works
yeah so you see guys this is working so
we have got our file ready so now the
next thing I need to do is this HTT we
get when gets successful I need to add a
method to it which is dot success and
this method is fired whenever there is a
200 ok response or some kind of data is
retrieved or basically you know when
this request gets completed so on
success I want something as response
obviously in the anonymous call so in
the response what I need to do is now
this one's in the tricky part
I want this person's to be filled by the
scoop since this was undefined right now
and we do not need to define the person
because this is just a temporary
variable iterating over persons again
and again so the main purpose of the
score is to define somehow persons now
what I'll do is I'll pass on the scope
dot persons equals response dot whatever
the response parent is which is records
this time so now what's happening here
is that first of all we are initiating a
get request with angular HTTP service
and then on the success of that request
we are getting a response from the
server and we are just injecting the
scope
that person's with this response dot
records and this records should match
this word way tune all right so now
let's see the things whether they are
walking or not here's the browser window
and let's reload this alright so now you
see that we have got a nice pretty list
of all the users names on each of the
programmers in the local area so you see
that if I check out the console and
reload it once more in the network area
we see that there's a get request to
database JSON and in the headers request
headers you can check out that it has
been made by angularjs page the
reference this one so this get request
by the HTTP module is listed here inside
the network area so if you reload this
you'll see that the this tip downloads a
little later because there's some time
took by angular to actually initiate a
get request and get the response data
and fill all of that stuff so you see
this is a kind of very simple
application which is repeating itself
again and again so I could actually
create a search bar here as well search
box here as well which would kinda give
me an option to filter out the listings
on the basis of names and age
respectively or whatever I like it's
kinda critical kind of dynamic filter so
we'll be looking upon this in a couple
of tutorials but for this tutorial
that's a
for now and I'll see you there next time
