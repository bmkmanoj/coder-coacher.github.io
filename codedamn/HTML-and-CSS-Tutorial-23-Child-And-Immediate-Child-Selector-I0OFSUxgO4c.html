23rd HTML and CSS tutorial in which we
will be looking at some advanced CSS
selectors in CSS now till now we have
been doing some simple CSS selectors
like element name then its properties or
maybe like element ID then its
properties or element class then its
properties but now let's see some
advanced CSS selectors more advanced and
way better than these so let's have a
look so for that let's create some
elements in HTML let's align one
let's give it up B and I do Alice
through it another death line three all
of this inside another day so okay so
these all three deaths are the children
so first of all I'm explaining you the
relation in HTML all three divs
if I indent it a little bit then it
would be good to understand all three
deaths these death be added if these
three are children of this div the div
which is superior to these
these are siblings among themselves
there are no brothers and sisters in
HTML there are just siblings so div and
B are siblings P and Dave are siblings
and if than they were also siblings but
these two and these two are immediate
siblings and these two are siblings but
they are not immediate siblings so as I
told you these three are children of
this div and div is children of body so
what does that mean this div or this B
or this div is the grandchild of the
body element so in HTML the chain of the
elements or the Dom tree basically works
just like we have in our regular life
like your parent and then the
grandparent and in grant grandparent or
your children and siblings and all that
so that's how HTML as well works so
elements placed together would be
siblings the element above all those
would be the parent of all those
elements then the element which is above
that would be the grandparent of that
particular element where we started from
and since hTML is again superior to this
two body basically then HTML would be
grant grandparent of this P or this div
or any of these two deaths
and as you can see head and body are
siblings so that's all about
relationships in HTML and let's start
with our CSS selectors now so I told you
this because it's necessary to know
about these relationships in HTML and
the Dom tree layout so let's say first
of all I would like to select every div
inside a div so let's see if I have it
there right here and let's say it's a a
b c so i want to select this div which
is inside a div but it's not actually a
stand-alone live itself like this one
so to do that what I do is I would like
div and add if again so what does that
signify is look at a div anywhere in the
document and then locate another div
which is inside this div so this means a
space right here without any special
symbol or character means a div inside
another div so this is kind of nesting
layout and you could do it any way down
to whatever you like but this would be
like locate a div create a div inside
that another day another day another day
another day
live and another div so all these dips
and close them one by one two three four
five six seven
I guess that's it one two three four
five six seven we need one more
no we need one less basically because
seventh one the top most would be closed
here so in this particular code we are
targeting div let me indent it a bit we
are targeting div with this this stiff
then a div
then it div then it div
then it is then it is
and then finally add if so let me verify
this will target this then this three
four five one two three four five six
seven six and seven so in this code
whatever right here would we implemented
would apply all the would inherit all
the CSS properties applied here so
basically with this line we are
targeting this div and as you can see
this is a hell out of big nested tree
all the way down to div this div so
anything right here would not be styled
but everything in this would be styled
so now that's how you select a child
inside an element and now let's take a
look at something different
okay so now let's say I want to okay so
let's say I have a b-line 3.1 and it div
inside this line 3.2 so let's say I want
to target divs inside this div as I told
you with this example but what I want is
I want to target only the children of
this div element and not the div we have
got right here so what does it signify
is that I want to target the topmost div
topmost basically you can see the
positive in the document and the image
child live of that so I make use of the
greater than sign which we used in the
HTML closing tags as well the same
symbol right here and now this targets
only divs inside a div but now we have a
got a problem here so what's that
problem is since this is locating a div
anywhere on the document so this style
also visits this Dave right here since
this div is technically same as this day
for the HTML browser for a kind of
striper purse so it says okay so you are
a div so this div is treated as the
first parent this tip is the child of
this div again
so the styles would apply on not only
best if not only then stiff but also on
this stiff so how do we fix that so to
fix that we need to find something
unique then and what's unique that this
div is underbody and what we can do is
image it not the image it but the
children of body which is a div and it
div inside that so what does about are
we targeting now we are targeting body a
div inside this the AMIA the children
the image children of body and the div
inside this now it would make a huge
difference when I remove this now
because or once I remove this then
inside body its targeting all the disks
right here this means any div inside
body which is technically same as this
situation right here so now let's do
some code let's say color green and now
let's apply some styles on the div
itself so that the changes are visible
and here's our browser let's reload this
and now we have got some drastic stuff
right here let me see if I can resize
this for you
and let's resize this a bit as well so
here we have it so here's the CSS now we
have color green for every immediate
child of body which is a div add a div
inside it as well so line 1 let's see we
have got body we have got Def and we
have got immediate they've child so the
statement is successful for this step so
green color is applied line 2 is blue
because it's a P okay so okay so what
happened here is since this color is
applied to this div now understand this
carefully we are using div to apply some
properties on every div of the document
so what does that signify is this color
blue is also applied on this div and
this div as well but since we are
supplying a custom property for this div
the children of the div therefore it
ignores this normal diff property and he
narrates this children div property and
I will tell you the criteria of this
inheritance of properties in my future
tutorial because this is kind of complex
thing
so now let's understand that why is P
green as a P blue as well so this Dave
actually contains
blue see our color CSS so since this
contains blue so it would pass down blue
CSS property to every of its child just
like when you're born you have got some
certain properties or some certain
characteristics and features like your
parent so what happens here is the
parent div would pass on this color blue
correct a stick to all of its children
and this B would inherit this
characteristic from its parent div and
since there's no CSS applied on B tag it
has no none of its custom properties
therefore it was you it would use this
color blue property directly to line two
so that's why line two is blue now
coming to this step we have got line
three a screen because this also satisfy
the condition we have got body we have
got Dave and we have got the image a
child div now it doesn't matter whether
the child is at first position or at
last position or anywhere between those
the thing that matters is the child
should be immediate child one so that
means
it should be immediate child of the what
should say at the image a child of your
tip element of your body and then the
div so now line three is green because
it's body and div as well
so line three is green because satisfy
its condition and now we see that line
3.1 is green but the tag name is P so
just like I explained you here div every
difficult the color blue but this div
got the color cream so it's child
instead of inheriting its grandparents
characteristic which is away from it a
little bit generations it inherited its
parent characteristic which is green so
this B is green because nothing is
applied as a style on this B element
and then once again we have the div as
color blue so this div is blue line 23.2
is blue and this div is obviously blue
because that's simple enough to
understand
so that's allowed the child selector and
your immediate child selector in CSS and
in the next tutorial we'll be looking at
some more advanced CSS selector or and
how it works so till then stay tuned and
