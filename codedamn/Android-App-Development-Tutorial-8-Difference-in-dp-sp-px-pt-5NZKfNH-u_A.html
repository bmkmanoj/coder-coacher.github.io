may hole and welcome to your eighth
android application development tutorial
in which I'm gonna clear off the
differences between pixels points DP SP
and all those units well in the last
video I made use of pixels here as well
as DP as well as SP here so what the
heck is all that difference all about so
if I make use of DP you would see that
pretty much nothing changes but I get
about over here it says that I should
use SP instead of DP for text sizes well
why is that so well this is because SP
means scale independent pixels well what
this actually means is that scale
independent pixels are similar to DP
which is the density independent pixels
but SP would depend on the user's
configuration for the phone as well so I
guess there's some sort of option and
settings if I could just find settings
here we go then what happens inside
settings is that you could actually
choose how large the font should appear
to you so I guess it's inside
accessibility or something like large
text so what happens is that now user
wants to see in a bigger text so if you
use make use of deep in here then your
text won't scale up so that's not the
kind of behavior you would want from
your application which kind of doesn't
obey the user in most of the cases users
would have the normal text and for text
DP would be equal to SV but just in case
you just want to make your application
more user friendly for the people who
have enabled this large text or you know
who just have some problem sort of
seeing in the smaller text feels the
and you should probably make use of SP
for your application and doesn't hurt
for any other thing you can make use of
DP because now you know the difference
between DP and SP then for the pixels it
is actually the worst unit you should
not probably use it for the mobile
devices because pixels actually
correspond to the actual pixel size on
the screen so if you just choose pixel
here it would really really really would
be variable from one phone to another
and depending on the type of resolution
resolution the phone has so this is a
very very variable sort of unit and you
could see that it also says that avoid
using pixel as units use DP instead but
for DP actually it would say you that
use SP instead so here you are finally
then we have point as well which is sort
of pixel only because it just says that
it is I I guess one one by 72 width of
an inch of your device so if I make use
of 32 point so one point is actually 1
by 72 eighth inch of your device so just
take one inch cut it into 72 parts and
then copy and paste those 32 parts and
that would be the height of one
character right here so if I just change
this to 72 points you could see that is
pretty much what a inch would be on the
screen so from this one to this one the
height of this edge or height of this e
whatever so that is how pretty much
points work and again to summarize this
tutorial you should make use of SP with
the text so as to support those which
have enabled their custom text size for
applications and yeah other ways you
could just make use of the DP one that
will work fine too
so that's all for this tutorial and if
you liked it then don't forget to
