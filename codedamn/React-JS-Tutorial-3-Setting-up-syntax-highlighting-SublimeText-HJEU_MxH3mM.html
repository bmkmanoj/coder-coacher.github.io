react.js tutorial and who's this a
little tutorial on setting up syntax
highlighting with sublime text for
reactive right and this is react to SX
just don't mind that it's just the same
thing so right now as you might have
guessed by now that anyways so right now
as you see you're seeing that we are
making use of plain HTML in react in
JavaScript files and I'm just explained
that in my components video which is
probably the next one but for now just
let's just see that if you Ness this
thing which we probably going to be in
the next few tutorials then it would
kind of look ugly because there's no
sort of syntax highlighting and also
we're going to make use of es6 so it
kind of would suck if sublime is not
simplex highlighting that thing properly
so what we can do is we can just
download the stable sublime as a package
for sublime text and you can just go
ahead and references go to package
control and put install package and
write babel and hit enter i will just
install the package for you and if you
read the docs you can see that setting
out the default syntax instructions all
instructions are here so it's installed
right and now you just need to go to
view and then syntax view syntax as
babel where is it here is it just
JavaScript now you can see that it looks
pretty good right on the syntax
highlighting is on and it looks pretty
good so yeah so that's all for this one
and since we are not going to make it
with JSX probably I'm just going to
stick with GS so we're just good with GS
only so that's all for this one and if
you liked it and don't forget subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
that real quick in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
