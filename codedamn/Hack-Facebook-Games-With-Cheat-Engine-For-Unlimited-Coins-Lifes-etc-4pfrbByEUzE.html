tutorial and in this tutorial basically
what I'm going to teach you is how to
hack a Facebook game to increase your
lives coins or anything do whatever
value you like so for this tutorial I'm
using this game in front of you which is
jetpack joyride on Facebook games and
we'll need couple of more things to
proceed with our hack and those are
first of all we need a calculator which
is inbuilt in windows at least and we
need another tool called cheat engine
6.4 so to download this cheat engine
what you have to do is go to cheat
engine arc and just click the first
download button the big download button
on their home page I've already done and
installed this so just follow the next
next next procedure while installing
this and you'll be good to go
this is the button to start your
download currently I'm using 6.4 and the
game is jetpack joyride so the concept
behind this hack is we are not actually
hacking the game but we are actually
hacking the plug in the flash plugin
which this game is using so as you can
right click the see and see that this
game is using a doe flash player of
Google Chrome and you could actually
implement this hack on any site which is
using flash as embedding the games so
let's start and let's hack this game so
I'll just play a dummy round to collect
some coins and it may look slow right
now because of the low FPS but it won't
be that much low when you will cry to
yourself so you could actually choose
any game but I am choosing this as a
dummy run or basically a dummy game to
show you how the heck would work I just
collected some coins 27 coins and let's
end the game now
awesome now as you can see you're dead
not exactly
so the next thing we need to do is open
the task manager of Google Chrome member
to open this press shift and escape
together
on your Chrome browser and you'll pop up
with the thing like this
locate your plugin shockwave mine is the
last one and remember the process ID
which is triple four zero remember this
ID will need this now and now go to your
calculator click on View switch to
programmer and type down your ID mine
was triple four zero I guess and change
this to hex and I get one one five eight
the results will vary if your process ID
is different now go to your cheat engine
open your cheat engine 6.3 have and
click on this small computer icon which
says select process to open and search
for this string the hex one for your
process ID that is one one five eight
and your process list and as you can see
- right here one one five fail open this
and down here search for your total
coins that means the total coins you
have right now
- 231 if you see 231 and I'll just do
231 what I'll do is first scan so I get
all of these values down here in this
plugin
the next thing select all of these now
click on anywhere on one of these and
press ctrl + a to select all of these
and click on this small down arrow now
this enables us to edit all these values
again click anywhere on these all of
these and click on or tap on ctrl + a
and double click or basically
change regard value now changes to the
number of coins you want for example I'd
like to have nine eight seven six five
four three two one
or maybe to make sure not to be greedy
and
keep it to a small value not that much
small but basically not a very large
value because flashbacking won't be able
to handle very large value and would
eventually crash and I'll show you what
would happen if you type a very large
value and click on ok.now just like a
magic we have nine eight seven six five
four three two coins in this game and if
you want to verify I can click on the
stash
it's taking some time because we have
recently modified the plugin but let's
see
I click on the stash
ah bingo we have nine eight seven six
five four three two coins in the game
and with this you can enjoy your life
but what if you choose a very large
number which the flash bag and can't
handle let's see what happens
change your god value let's see I put a
hell lot of large number and click on ok
ok so that was larger than this good
handle but let's board even larger let's
click ok let's see
so let's click on stash and we have
these number of coins okay maybe that
the plugin just updated to the latest
version and I think in the past when I
try to do something with
this then eventually the number of
points keep kept on increasing and then
finally the plugin crashed at a certain
type as you can see now the system has
overflown and your game won't work
anymore
because this is because of some unsigned
or signed 32-bit integer or like that
programming stuff if you want to know
more about this then you're free to
check my programming tutorials and I've
talked a lot about this stuff down here
so this was a tutorial on modifying the
Facebook game to your number of coins
you want and now you could actually do
hack any game or Miniclip or on Facebook
or whatever game you like so enjoy guys
