May ho and welcome to your second
WordPress theme development tutorial and
in this tutorial I'm gonna show you
pretty much how to set up WordPress on
your local machine so that you can just
start off with your team development
because you know if you were thinking to
buy a server for just team development
and pay rental charges per month or
really well that's kind of expensive and
it does not require at all when you can
have WordPress on your computer itself
well to do that I'm gonna make use of
this zamp
now just go to google and type zamp
download you can just do that and you
land on the same page at which I am on
well that's a bit different but anyways
so once you are here a past friend Stark
slash index dot HTML just choose the
appropriate version for example I'm
gonna go with this exam for Windows you
might want to go with Sam for Linux or
for OSX or whatever operating system you
are on and you can just download this
Sam for PHP seven as well I guess I
probably have this one only so once you
are done with it well you would get an
executable file and because I already
have installed Sam so I'm not gonna
download it again but what you have to
do with that executable file is just
open it and just click on next next next
and for Linux I guess you have to make
use of terminal to make it executable
and then run it from terminal and for
OSX I don't have any area so you guys
might know it better than me because I
haven't tried you know OSX very much for
now so the next thing once you have
installed Sam is you just open and I
remember that or Linux it's actually
comes as lamp instead of zamp so you
might want to take a look at that
because all your right download is
something known as lamp on Ubuntu and it
was pretty much similar to zamp
and it had a GUI interface as well
so anyways you get the idea how to
install it so once you have downloaded
it what you want to do is run this a
bash module now this would give you
access to PHP and this MySQL module this
would be our database which WordPress
would be using all right now once you
get this green border around pull of
these that means these both are running
on your localhost but if you sort of get
our red background or text in red in
here that means probably most probably
that your port number 80 or 443 is
occupied by some another application and
it probably would be Skype only because
Skype works on port 80 or port 443 or
might be you how you are running a game
which is making use of these ports so
you might want to change the ports right
here you can just go ahead in the
configuration I guess in services and
ports you can just change it right here
and pretty much you'll be good to go or
you could just exit those applications
for example only because once you start
Sam and occupies these ports then when
you start the other applications they
would automatically search for some
vacant ports available so that might not
be a problem well the next thing once
you have started is just go to localhost
and see how the thing is working so if
you go to localhost it would redirect
you to slash dashboard and if you see
something like this then congratulations
you have installed Sam correctly and if
you don't then probably there's a sort
of problem with your installation or
while starting your module so you might
want to check that out well once you're
done with this then go to wordpress.org
and remember this is dot-org there's a
site comm as well because both of these
sites are different
is a free website which doesn't actually
allow you to pretty much install plugins
and do a lot of stuff because it runs on
their own soul so we're gonna make use
of wordpress.org instead of com
so just click here and download
WordPress and just download the latest
version of WordPress whatever it is and
just let it download so once it's
downloaded just open the zip file and go
to the directory in which you want to
install WordPress in this case it would
be actually your C Drive
zamp seven it would be seven if you
download the PHP seven one then go to
your htdocs folder this folder contains
all the files which are public so
anything you place in here can be
accessed using localhost and right here
just create a new folder which says WP
let's just name it WP only so this WP
folder and you could actually pretty
much just get all of that content
instead of that WordPress directory
because we are already in what WP folder
so now you can see we have got a bunch
of stuff but we are missing a thing
right now as I told you we need to have
database to add WordPress so just go to
local host PHP my admin' and using this
interface you can create a database for
your WordPress installation just click
on new here and write your database name
let's just say this is WP let's just
name it something else let's just say
this is WP only sounds good
and creative now you don't need to do
anything just create a blank database
what pres would automatically take care
of the stuff now just go to your WP gone
you'll find a file named
wp-config-sample.php so just edit it
with any text editor right here we need
to make a little bit of changes so DB
name is WP username would be root for
our case as you can see right here it
says me.you are connected as root with
no password which corresponds to default
MySQL privileged account so you can
actually change this as well but a local
host I don't think you need to unless
you are extremely careful
so the abuser would be root and password
would be blank host would be local host
care set utf-8 is code only it don't
change this if in doubt so okay then for
unique phrase here I don't need we need
to I don't know we need to change this I
don't think so
so actually we are pretty much done here
but the one last thing we need to do is
change this WP config WP config actually
instead of that wp-config-sample.php
again let's just go to localhost / WP
which is directory of WordPress so now I
can see we get a nice little WordPress
installation dialog box right here
select your language which you want to
install then it gives us some sort of
steps so let's just say my site title
would be go down WP tester user name
versus Amy hole and the password you all
know this so there's no need to worry
about let's just name it root only and
confirm use of weak password yes I do
confirm it your email let's just give
the authentic one
and pretty much we don't need this
because search engine won't even you
know index are a local host so just
click on install WordPress and give it a
few seconds right now it's just waiting
tables and so it saves me now success
that WordPress has been installed so now
login with me who has the username and
root as the password login as you can
see I am on my own WordPress which is
set up on localhost on and this is not a
live website at all but it behaves
pretty much just like one so that's a
very great thing about WordPress you can
just test it on your computer itself
without purchasing expensive hosting and
once you are ready with your website you
can just take this whole thing live on
your server without any hassle so for
taking it live actually you just need to
copy files to your server and for
database you can just export your
database from here and and then import
it on your server so that's some job for
some other tutorial but for now we are
done with WordPress installation and
from the next tutorial onwards they're
gonna very much start off with WordPress
theme development so if you like this
