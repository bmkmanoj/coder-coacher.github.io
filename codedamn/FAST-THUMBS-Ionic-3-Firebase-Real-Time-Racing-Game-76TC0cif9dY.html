is May ho and welcome to this quick
screencast which is actually not a
tutorial but just a way to promote one
of my applications which I've been
working on these days to actually take a
look at what firebase and the ionic look
together so this is fast terms and it's
built on the top of ionic 3 which uses
angular 4 and firebase as the real time
database and it's kind of you can think
like a application which you can make
use to compete with your friends on the
phone and test out who has got the
fastest typing speed now this is
completely new right now I know it would
have tons of bugs and tons of
possibilities of adding new features so
I'm open to all sort of suggestions so
if you check the link in the description
I would just paste the link there so
please go ahead and try this out and
essentially what this app is is that
will just allow you to login and
register and then play accordingly so I
can just log in with one of my account
and just like that and it's sign-in and
you could just justify a new account
right here something like may whole MPD
to other regions or well that's actually
not any email right now but I'm just
going to go with that and it's signup so
I have not added the functionality to
actually verify the email right now but
that doesn't mean you could enter
anything right so just go ahead and make
sure you try that out properly so just
create a room you can see that after is
a room and I have joined myself so if I
join a room and enter metal MBT mail and
PT rather just because this guy is Mable
mpt2 so you can see that the host peer
gets the stock one you can start the
match and it would synchronize in real
time so there we are and we can start
with writing something like this
obviously this would be a little slow
for you because you would be using
mobile phones so you know you pretty
much get the idea and then you can type
the other back and type as well real
time and the text would be same for both
of you right so you can just go ahead
and try your thumbs out and this is
available on Android only right oh sorry
I do not have the Apple Developer
license right now so yeah please go
ahead and try this out and I would love
to have your feedback on this one and
yes that's all for this one and if you
like to support content like this and
free applications like this then please
go ahead and was it my patreon link
which is again yet in the description
Ollie so you can just go ahead and check
that out so again that's all for this
one and if you liked it then please go
ahead and rate it on Play Store that
would mean a lot to me so yeah I'll see
you then in some other video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
