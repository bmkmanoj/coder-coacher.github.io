javascript tutorial and in this tutorial
will not be discussing anything about
javascript or any of its staff or
operators or functions on any of its
concepts but i found this awesome very
awesome and very advanced JavaScript web
quiz online on this URL right here so
this quiz is basically a very high level
and advanced quiz in javascript which
helps you do understand the basic
concepts of javascript and if you get
the answers wrong in the first time then
don't worry because this quiz is meant
for like people appearing for
competitive exams or entrance exams in
javascript so basically i will help you
to solve these questions with the proper
explanation that why was the answer so
tricky and as this guy david sheriff
says here warning might hurt your
feelings okay so let's start the quiz
and in this tutorial i guess i'll be
covering around four to five questions
but tutorial because of time so I
doesn't make the quest boring actually
so let's start the quest quiz and we
have the question one here and we have
twenty questions in all
okay so right here we have a function
inside a variable very variable name and
function name are same and we have
console.log this pretty tricky so what's
happening here is first of all we are
creating a function inside a variable
and we are just comparing the function
with itself so basically this function
is similar to this we don't need the
function name inside a variable because
we can actually call this function with
the help of variable itself so what we
are doing here is we are just calling
this function itself in this function so
this calls itself because who is the
function name and inside the function we
are calling the function itself so if I
call this function down here then as you
can see this function console logs
itself so basically if we write this
type of food then when you call this
function we get the function because in
the console log we are just calling the
type of this function which is itself a
function and obviously this function
equals to itself so what should be the
answer yes you guessed it right it
should be true
okay coming to the next question let's
clear the console and let's see what we
have got here so we have this function
right here with function name a a return
statement and an object as a return
looks very innocent but actually what's
happening here is the JavaScript engine
converts the new line after the return
statement into a semicolon so this
function is basically treated like this
and every other goal here and if you
look back into my playlist in some
tutorial I guess a couple of tutorials
back then you hear me saying that I told
you that after a return statement in a
function nothing gets executed below it
this is an exception with hoisting but
after it done statement for example if
you write eller down here then this
function would not be executed so
basically what's happening here is we
are this function is similar to this
thing right here
so what's happening here is
we are just alerting type of a and look
carefully how we are alerting this so if
we remove the parent this is from AAA
let me rename this a now this would
alert this thing would alert function
because AAA right here is a function but
what we are doing is we are calling this
function by using the parentheses so
basically what we are doing is we are
alerting the type of which is returned
by this function and what this function
is returning it's returning undefined
okay one thing I want to tell you is
that return false is not equal to return
and what is the difference between two
when we use simply return false then it
returns us the boolean value or return
true or anything return XYZ then it
returns us that particular value but by
default if we use just the simple
statement return instead of returning as
false this statement returns us
undefined so basically return undefined
is equal to return ok so this statement
would actually turn us undefined and
obviously now we are calling this
function and alerting the type of the
value returned by this function and this
function is returning us undefined so
here we have the undefined we got it
right
ok we have this next thing
so if you go to my prototype section
you'll understand what this is and we
have got a number object down here and
as I told you knew the keyword new is
used to call the constructor function
and since here we are not using the
keyword new here so this basically
creates a primitive value so basically
you are a is one and barbie is number
one and a is equal to B and it would
turn as true as you can see but if we
have done be with a new keyword then it
would have called a constructor function
and this would be an object instead of
simply a primitive value so now
so now B is not equal to a this would
return as false as you can see so
obviously this converts it into a
primitive value and 1 minus 1 is equal
to 0 and this would return is true we
can verify here in the console and yeah
okay now we have this question right
here now in JavaScript true is
considered as one false r0 and basically
if we do integer conversion of bullion's
then I don't think in any other language
we have basically we basically get any
error in the integer conversion of
bullion's and in every other language we
have false equal to zero by default and
true anything except zero but basically
if we do the integer conversion then by
default true is equal to one so
basically what's happening here is we
are just doing 1 plus 0 is greater than
2 plus 1 and if you do simple math we
get 1 is greater than 3 which is false
so the answer should be false you got it
correct congratulations and we have the
fifth question down here and I guess
took eight minutes so we'll be doing
this one at the last question but this
tutorial and i'll be covering the next
five in the next tutorial ok never mind
coming back to fifth question we have
this function down here function bar and
we have this whole lot of function and
alerting type of bar now this looks like
that we are just doing return foo and
fools down here undefined and type of
bar should be hardly fine but if you go
back to my previous tutorials a couple
of tutorials back you'll see me teaching
a concept in JavaScript call hoisting
now here's where the hosting is coming
into play and what's happening here down
here is this code this function down
here is similar to
this thing
or basically to be very precise they
stick so why is this like this thing so
basically this concept is known as
hosting in JavaScript and these two
functions right here are exactly similar
to the interpreter of the JavaScript so
the interpreter of the JavaScript
considered this function written as this
function and this is because of wasting
if you want to know more about this
wasting concept then go back into my
playlist and you will see me teaching
you this and now what's happening here
is we are creating a variable foo and
assigning it a function and down here we
are calling type of typos of the bar and
obviously we are calling the bar itself
so it returns the value returned by this
function and we are actually alerting
the type of value returned by this
function and what is returned by this
function is a function itself which is
foo so this would log or basically this
would alert the type of as a function
so I have done five questions of david
share of squares with explanation the
complete explanation and if you find any
difficulty in any of the concepts of
these five questions please feel free to
leave a comment down and ask me or ask
in the comment section that what was the
confusion and why was the answer your
answer different from mine so this is a
way interesting kind of quiz and I hope
you enjoyed this tutorial and the next
tutorial I'll be covering question
number six to ten so keep watching my
