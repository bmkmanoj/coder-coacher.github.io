the 18th tutorial of bootstrap in which
I'm gonna show you how you can create a
simple form with the help of bootstrap
CSS files now let's get started now
bootstrap already includes a lot of
predefined styles for your forms which
makes it easy beautiful rather to code
forms so first of all write your form
attribute obviously then a class now
assign it a class of form for example
now what its gonna do is it's gonna
create a horizontal level of form so
this is your first input let's say this
is 2nd distr this is 4 this is fifth so
by default what happens is if you type 2
inputs and just leave them they were
just you know kind of stack up in a
single line but the form horizontal kind
of creates a horizontal layout for your
forms so yeah so now the next thing you
want to create is a form group now this
would just create a simple container for
your you can say your a single input
type so that you can just keep all the
labels which would you use for your
input and your you know just anything
you want a health text in place so just
write a label and inside this let's just
write your name and with this label I'm
gonna write an input of class form
control now this is a predefined class
and bootstrap and I'm just gonna show
you that as well in a while just add
this as a text
why not and just you know that's pretty
much it for this and we can add another
field yeah your email address and even
change that to email if you want to
doesn't make any difference so you see
we have got two horizontal form layouts
right here and as you can see these are
in a separate line so if you inspect
element this you see the form control
makes it a width of one percent and all
those tiles so whatever you want to make
these in same line
now obviously you have the option to
modify the CSS but why play with CSS
when bootstrap already provides you with
such options remember the lesson from
the grits yeah so we are making use of
some grits now so let's just say let's
just enclose this or rather let's just
provide a class to it only as you say
this is a column and let's just say for
small screens and I want to give it a
bit of that's a three maybe and for this
input we have to enclose this in Entebbe
cuz this input is already having a width
of 100% with this so you know we can't
clear on with that and inside the stiff
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
right call SM and nine obviously because
these two should sum up to twelve
let's reload and as you can see this
looks kinda wake because I guess I have
provided too much weight for this name
so let's just reduce this to 1 and this
1 to 11 let's reload again and now it is
too low
how about 2 we are good to go
kind of you can say and to make this
centered vertically vertically centered
what you can do is you can make use of
this control label now what this does is
I'm just gonna show you so you see that
it not only centers you know vertically
but it aligns in a better way with the
input as well so similarly we can do
this for the second form group as well
and your email address
this is email let's just keep the
settings same for this and see what
happens you see that it automatically
assigns with the possible weight so yeah
so that's it for the farms and we'll be
creating some more forms in the next
tutorial so don't forget to subscribe
