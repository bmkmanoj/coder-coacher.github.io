your 25th jQuery tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be discussing something
about a drop-down menu
now before even that I would like to
tell you guys something that I would not
be teaching you each and everything in
jQuery but we would be doing like all
the stuff we cover in all the examples I
would be explaining that to you because
if I do like going from one thing to
next to next to next that makes things
much harder to understand and you know
you won't be able to cope up with this
all this stuff so let's get started and
whatever I'll be teaching you with my
examples from now I'll be explaining
that nicely so to create a drop-down
menu first of all what we need to do is
to create a basic structure in our HTML
itself so let's get started with a drop
down menu so let's see this is now
iodine navigation and basically you can
have a now ID a nav tag in HTML 5
because nav is a html5 tag so we have
got a navigation let's style it with you
will Li item 1 Li item qu
Alai hm3 a line item for now remember
that we are talking about drop-down menu
so the first thing you need to do with a
drop-down menu is to do something like
this inside your li itself create a ul
and this is perfectly valid do not worry
in HTML standards as well so inside your
li item itself created you will and just
give it a glass of child so that we can
distinguish between the you will the
parent ul and I could just give it a
class of parent as well so I can
distinguish between the parent you will
and the child yard so inside the child
ul let's give item to point one item to
point to atom two point three
Adam do point for Hegel and same with
one more with item five
and we actually inside the list itself
you'll class child
and I guess I copied that
No all right so here what we have got
till now is I just created a simple
navigating navigation tag create the UL
class parent which contains all of the
allies the main LS which have two
displayed when the first time the user
opens the page then I have got some LS
and in the LS which have got the
drop-down menu I have created the UN tag
inside the Li tag itself so let's see
how this appears right now on the
browser so here's my browser let me
resize this for you a little bit here
you go let's reload this and this looks
very ugly I know but we could actually
customize it with CSS a little bit so
the first thing I'll need to do is to
set all the default margins and padding
to zero so that we can reset the CSS
then we need to set the Li list item
list style to be none so that it removes
all the bullets from LA I hope you guys
know that
because I thought all the stuff in HTML
and CSS section all right now what we
need to do is you in class child
now you will class child should be set
to display none and the reason is that
you should actually not have any of the
child displaying from beginning itself
because we want some user interaction to
show the child you will elements and
instead of just doing with 0 and hide 0
asset display:none because it is much
cleaner and self-explanatory type of
code to work with I let's just copy the
march Laswell here in the CSS you could
also make a separate CSS file but for
this tutorial I'm just going with the
inline internals CSS stylesheet and the
list style item as well
all right so we have got our basic
structure ready and now
we need to do is you need to make a
little bit amendments to the code so
that it looks nice and now we have to be
careful when we are working with allies
because we are actually working with
allies in this section as well and in
this section as well so obviously I
don't want these to follow the rules of
these because these two are different
things so what we can do is we can
reference the direct childs of Ally with
the UL got parent now you will look
parent selects this and this is the
immediate child selector so now we are
referring to all these allies but not
the allies inside the UL dar UL dot
child all right so now I'll just give it
a float of left and what we have got one
two three four five LS so every sure
everyone should have a width of 20
percent padding of ten pixels and I
guess I should just give a box tiling
here
so that everything aligns perfectly all
right now the background should be
actually something which is easy to
recognize
like this across but right
one pixel solid so that you know we are
just able to
distinguish one item from another looks
perfect
all right so we have got our HTML and
CSS ready for the stuff and let's get
started with jQuery finally so just one
last thing we can actually give it a
cursor of pointer as well so that it
just makes a hand with it so here's my
jQuery script from the previous tutorial
let's remove this and here you go let's
get started so first thing we need to do
is to add an event to this and the event
is click are basically the whole event
so this is the parent and first of all
let's just start with jQuery a know if I
haven't taught you about this this is
just the shorthand of document already
do I think I have alright so now what I
need to do is anytime parent Li the
direct child of the UL class parent is
clicked are not click sorry over then I
want to function and since Hoover
accepts to function therefore I need to
have two functions the first function
fires whenever I'm you know the element
is entered in the state of being forward
and the second function is fired when
the element is in the exit state of
being forward so this would fire when
the user takes its mouse over the
element and this would fire when the
user withdraws his mouse from the
element so when the user is whole ring
we want first of all you will charge to
display it block obviously but if you do
that it will just appear like a sudden
thing so what we can do is we can make
use of this dot find ul now I have a
couple of things here to explain to you
guys dot charles so don't worry if you
don't understand you will the child and
we will just set it to
I'm sure with a delay of 200
milliseconds so let's just see how it
works let's reload this and I guess I
don't got the box-shadow model here
box-sizing sorry
box-sizing border-box let's just focus
again all right so item to add a you
will class child and let's forward with
it alright so here you see that this
event is fired whenever I am hovering
over the item to which has a ul Flash L
R none of them fire when hoovering else
because they don't have a UL class child
so this looks kind of not so good right
now but we can obviously customize it
with CSS so what's happening basically
over here is first of all we are with
this event which is string a whole
effect and whenever this is forward this
thing is forward then we are using the
dis this keyword inside the jQuery
construction now there's technically no
difference between this and this but the
difference is that jQuery returns
everything as an heiress so this is
technically equal to this with a index
of zero though obviously there would be
always one element inside the
constructor function of this but since
though we need to use this thing right
here to refer to the
exact same thing of this but in most of
the cases this will also work so I
promise you guys that I'll explain this
thing inside the this tutorial of jQuery
because it would take a whole another
tutorial to explain what is the disk
keyword though I have done it with
either guest JavaScript but jQuery is a
bit different so for now just remember
that this is just referring to the
element which we are holding right now
so this that find now find is a method
which is accepting an argument which is
a yet another a selector and see this
kind of selector now inside this which
refers to this thing right here it finds
you l dot child and it sets it to show
at 200 milliseconds delay now what it is
doing is see if you carefully see then
it increases its bit from zero pixel
right here all the way down to here and
that is why you see that the text
appears from left to right in this
direction see carefully you see that the
text appears from left to right
direction so to fix this thing what we
can do is while animating the UL class
shell jQuery and image both the width
and the height so one thing we can do is
we can set the width of this to be
hundred percent with an important now
what this would do is it would not allow
the Chi query animator function to
change the width but only the height
and I'm doing this because this would
make the animation effect much more
cleaner and smoother so let's see this
now if you see that it looks much good
than the previous one much better I
should say than the previous one
because it just drops and drowns again
so let's add the counterpart of this
whole function and I guess I was
supposed to have two parts of this but
you know we could just cover it in the
one part itself so why I have that's
alright so in the counter part of the
whole function which means what happens
when the mouse user takes a word from
the mouse we would still refer to this
not find you will the child and what we
can do is we can just hide it simply so
that wouldn't make any difference and I
could just make it a little bit slower
for you guys so let's reload this again
and over over item one nothing happens
over over item two it slowly appears and
slowly disappears whenever you hover
over again and again again again and you
can do that all day if you wish to all
right so I guess you guys can now do the
CSS styling yourself because that's not
much difficult to do the only thing that
was difficult to grasp was the concept
of this you will how you achieve this
thing and since I've applied a little
bit of padding here that is inherited by
the thing as well so what I can do is
I'll just move pairing dog with ten
pixels so that fix the problem and
padding-bottom obviously
no doubt
here you go
and you all got parent Ally
it should be like this perfect now the
next thing I need to do is - oh so the
padding bottom is actually applied at
the bottom so we don't need padding
bottom for now just a padding top and
this thing the UL class child should
have its style itself you can apply all
the styles to the change background
color to make it unique and do all of
the stuff and actually you could fix the
starting problem as well with the jQuery
whore effect you could just remove the
padding whenever the item is on the hole
so that's how you do this and that's
pretty much how you can create a simple
basic horror effect drop down menu with
jQuery so I look forward to your
response on this video and I'll see you
then next time good bye and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
