Chrome extension development tutorial
and will be finally launching our
extension life on the chrome store now
follow this tutorial and you'll be able
to launch your Google Chrome extension
on your store would be available for the
world to download your extension so
let's start cool background isn't it
well this is a scene from inception if
you have watched it here but anyways
coming back to the team
open your location of your Chrome
extension - this one just three files
and quiz create a zip file down here
extension there you go put these files
in yourself now
I'm placing this fire extensions it on
down here and go to chrome developer
dashboard so just google this I don't
remember the URL it would be first link
to pop up now let's close the sublime we
don't need it anymore here you go we
have Chrome Web Store developer
dashboard visit this URL
chrome.google.com/webstore slash
developer dashboard so if you have a
right that's not this URL first time
then you'll see something like this
because you need to pay a $5 fees USB to
Google to become a chrome webstore or
Chrome extension developers so I have
already done this in my another account
so I'll be using that account to upload
this extension but you have to pay this
price to Google for the first time
otherwise your extension won't be life
and my I have done this in this account
I hope you didn't solve acid okay so
I've been my extension developer fee in
this account and I'll be able to upload
my extension as you can see I'm already
uploaded two extensions so let's add a
new item click on this button a new item
choose your save file mine was this one
on the desktop and click on upload
pretty simple
whoa staking ears through load 26 Kb
well that's embarrassing
anyways
let's see when it will be done oh that
that's so much time to upload 26 Kb
well we are done now it will redirect
you back automatically it would ask you
for a description right any description
Twitter social toolkit share your links
images your L pages anything on your
Twitter account instantly that's it for
now
and we need to upload an icon let's go
back to the path will we have stored no
this is my video tutorial spot here you
go we have this icon down here uploaded
and here you go you have the icon ready
this upload screenshot I guess it's
optional maybe let's leave it for now
let's leave all this and in the category
let's give it a developer tool or maybe
social and communication would be good
items free you can change the price if
you wish to and leave all the rest to
default this should be public so that
anyone could be able to download your
extension publish okay
language is not selected very well
where is language man yeah there you go
extension is English based in English
language let's go okay
and here you go your extension is live
on Chrome Web Store so you can actually
upload your own proof picture for the
slider your extension is live on the
chrome store so this was a tutorial on
publishing your extension on chrome
store and you can download this
extension from this URL if you wish to
and in the next tutorial maybe I will be
teaching you something else
but that would be cool so I'll see you
then in the next tutorial don't forget
