and welcome to your second required
shoes tutorial in which we'll be looking
at how to setup required GS for your
project now so far what we have learned
in the first tutorial is just that what
is required Cheers
and you know that's pretty much it so in
this tutorial and in the further
tutorials we'll be really looking at how
to make the best use of required shoes
for your projects and how it can come
very handy even you have a lot of
JavaScript files to handle and you're
working on a big project as well so
let's get started
now to first of all what you need is you
need to download this file require.js
from their official website and to do
that just go to the require.js official
page which is required just org and just
click on this download link right here
because latest release and for me it is
two point one point two two and just
download the minified version or with
comments or whatever you like so that's
it and then the next thing you have to
do is do just add a script SRC require
two point one point two two J s and
another thing we need with required GS
is the data main attribute and what it
does is it would accept a path as a
string and it would basically load the
configuration file of your required
cheers application which I'll be showing
you in the next tutorial what that
configuration file actually means so
let's just go ahead and simply create a
folder right here let's say J s do that
and yeah so yeah okay now what we can do
is I can just new file here just say
this is config ojs configure Cheers
good enough and then in the data main
attribute just right J s slash conflict
now what happens is in requirejs most of
the times you won't require to add a dot
J s to the file name because obviously
it is designed to work with JavaScript
files only so it already knows that this
should be a file if it is not ending
with a directory symbol so that's some
common sense and that's how you just
write the data main attribute and the
next thing you have to do is to just
initialize your required GS and to do
that just write a simple script tag and
inside this write require config
function and all of your code here
alright so what's happening here
so what is happening is that first of
all your page would cut off load this
configuration file which is this file
and once it's ready once it has been
loaded in the browser all of this code
would run here and what would go in this
configuration file we'll be looking at
the next tutorial so that's all for this
tutorial and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
