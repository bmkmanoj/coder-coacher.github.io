Mei hole and welcome to your 16th
angular tutorial in which we're going to
learn about what router link and the
router link active directives are in
angular and how you can use them in your
routes right so router link is pretty
much going from one route to another and
let's just say for my dashboard or what
we have here or the hello world which is
the home on you home route we create a
list of h.res right
which the first one stays dashboard and
for the dashboard we create a drift back
which just goes to home right
if you save that and just go ahead you
see that that pretty much works but that
is not a very angular way of doing stuff
right you cannot make use of variables
in here and actually it's a bad practice
as well so instead of doing edge drift
what we're going to make use of is the
router link which is provided by angular
to work with internal system routes now
remember that you cannot use causal link
to link to external websites for that
you have to make use of H ref your old
friend but for internal system routes
you can make use of router link and
again we do not need these square
brackets right now because we are not
passing in any variable so you can just
make use of that square brackets if you
are referring to any variable and we are
getting this error because of
thing I don't know so we go to dashboard
we go to home you can see that it's
pretty smooth as well because angular is
not really reloading the page which it
was doing with EDF right so it sure if
it's the wrong way to do internal
routing with angular
now with rattling we also have router
link active which is just the angular
way of letting you know that the user is
in fact on this page right so if we can
do in order to create that is the first
of all create some routes which we can
from our app component app module rather
and let's just create one more route
let's just say this is a login page
let's see on this login component let's
just save it we can go back to our
command line you can say ng generate
component login which creates a login
component for us you can see everything
is important and should be running fine
but looks like we just have a typo in
here and there you go so now we have the
login route setup as well so let's just
place some links in all these three and
then let's just go ahead and say this is
the whole dashboard and login and what
we can include now is something like
router link active which gets the class
name so let's just give it active right
and I'm just going to go ahead and paste
this again and again you can make use of
square brackets with this if you have
any dynamic sort of thing going on and
then finally what we can do is go ahead
and paste the same thing in dashboard
component and login component as well
now I'm going to go back to
style dot CSS right here because this
this style sheet is global actually and
everything you do right in log in
component dot CSS or home component of
CSS would not be global right it would
be restricted to that particular
component only so to add any global
Styles like I have right now which is
that spawn families Calabrian some sort
of manual resetting you have to go to
the standard CSS files to add global
size I'm just going to say this this
color black for now text decoration
text-decoration:none
and let's just say form size is 20
pixels and why not just say display
block you can see that we get these
three links and I guess or we didn't
change the text okay so this should be
home and there's nothing like home
logging right so now if we go ahead and
very much paste this right so now if you
see inside your inspector you would see
that the class active class active is
applied on this a tag but not on these
two right they do not have the class
active with that so to make it a little
more visible what we can do is say a dot
active is color red and it's safe you
can see that home it becomes red and we
are on home if I click on dashboard you
can see this dashboard becomes red and
so does this home now why does this
happen
well this happens because you're rather
link active pretty much matches whenever
your URL matches this slash now this
isn't actually exact matching so right
now if you see this URL for the home
only
it matches the slash but for dashboard
for dashboard it still matches the URL
right for the home
so if I click on login you can see that
the dashboard one is gone but the home
still remains so to fix that or actually
to make it more intuitive what you can
do is you can include something known as
well to link or rather just on this year
so we can say router link active options
and we can make this they exact is true
right so what this would do is again we
need to make use of these square
brackets now because we are writing an
expression in here so what this would do
is very much just match this route only
if it exactly matches it right so we can
just do the similar thing on all the
routes because we just have the same
thing right now right so now you can see
that dashboard glows when I click on
dashboard home glows when I click on
home and home does not go back when I
click on dashboard right so exact
through actually and we actually need
exact - only for this route because this
is a bit ambiguous right so if you were
having something like slash dashboard
slash ABC then this dashboard route
would be active as well for / - would
slash ABC right so it kind of makes more
sense if you have another route right
like if you have a page like a b c d e f
g h i so the router link actor would
apply this active class to a b c d e f
and GHI all three rounds right so that
kind of makes sense to do if you are on
page like that but for just solo page it
would pretty much apply this style
active class on every route right so
again we can just fix that by passing
around rolling active options exact is
true so yeah that is pretty much how
routes work and rattling actor works in
a nutshell so yeah that's all for this
one and if you like this
