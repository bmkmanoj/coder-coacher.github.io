Google Chrome extension development
tutorial and in this tutorial we'll be
writing something called Google Chrome
URL overrides what are these actually
they are pretty cool and if you follow
this tutorial carefully then at the end
of this tutorial you will be able to
create your own new tab pages that means
whenever a user clicks on new tab then
you can show anything you want here or
your own history pages you can customize
the history page using a PS of Chrome
and your own bookmark pages so to do
that first of all we have to declare
certain things in our manifest or JSON
so that we can ask for permissions from
Google Google Chrome basically to do the
actions so first of all go to manifest
JSON and write Chrome you are
overwrites
put it anywhere make sure the syntax of
the file remains correct down here
specify the pages you want to overwrite
or basically page in Google Chrome
currently you could only rewrite three
of the pages those are history page the
bookmark manager and the new tab one
important thing to note down is for
extension with one single extension you
can only rewrite one of these three
pages that means with one extension you
cannot rewrite two pages or three pages
or like that so with one extension you
can only write one page so let's go
ahead and type new tab right here okay
in the second value what we have to
provide is the HTML file or any file we
want to show when the user clicks or
user opens a new tab so let's say I
create new tab not HTML right here let's
go ahead and create a new tab file
or why not copy this contents and just
smooth the script make sure you give the
title you want to because this would
appear in the new tab
let's give it my first extension let's
save this here in the path which is
mutant our dot HTML okay we are good to
go now go to your extensions
and just simply reload your extension
and voila now we have permissions to
rewrite the new tab and now if you open
your new tab and as you can see it does
not show me the traditional new tab of
Google Chrome and I have rewritten the
new tab with this HTML document now
whatever right right hand here would
appear down here automatically as in a
new tab so you could actually do wonders
right here you could show your
creativity launch it on Chrome store you
could also place your ads I don't know
it is allowed or not but it could be a
good way to monetize and you could do
much other stuff right here and like
showing the recent newsfeed of user by
authenticating using codes to Facebook's
and Twitter and like that embedding a
search system but you can actually make
it pretty cool and better than the
traditional new tab system so that was
about new tab and
the other two pages we try we can try is
the bookmarks and the history one so
first of all let's try the history one
and if I reload the extension okay so I
should also explain you when should you
reload the extension and when should you
not reload the extension and it would
work pretty fine so you have to reload
the extension whenever you make changes
too many fans JSON okay so on every load
this file does not the Google Chrome
browser does not read the manifesto JSON
file on your every click on earlier
every load it just reads it once when
you reload the extension and store it's
in the memory so whenever you make
changes to this file you have to reload
the extension however if you are working
with then static files which are just
used as it is
which are just used odd as it is right
there
then you need not to reload your
extension so now we have supplied
history as new tab page so let's see
what happens if we click reload and was
it the history page as you can see the
history pages override overridden by our
new tab dot HTML page and obviously you
don't want users to see just a simple
freaking hello world message on it their
history page and you would like to
customize I'm sure actually what the
browse and for those we have a lot of AP
as in Google Chrome but I won't be going
in those ap as right now if you are
interested then you could go to google
chrome developers Network
look at those APL and start building
your own history and bookmarks manager
so recently I developed an extension for
one of my friends
I don't think I have installed it
let's see you have the extension
installed
no I don't have I guess but actually
what X what that extension does is that
whenever you click on the new tab it has
got a permission set here as new tab so
what it did is that whenever you click
the new tab right here then the
extension name was basically quotes so
whenever you click the new tab a random
quote appeared here with the author name
in very big font size and those were
really such inspire inspiring quotes
actually so you should also create some
of those extensions like those and you
could actually customize this page just
like a normal HTML page you would do so
you no need to explain it right there
and you could go and link your style
sheets file and script files and do
wonders with these override permissions
and make sure they're fast because users
don't like their new tab page to be slow
actually which is already offline so try
avoiding any connection with the live
internet and keeping all the stuff
offline so this was about chrome URL
overrides and in the next tutorial
know what we'll be discussing but as I
told you in the earlier tutorial my next
tutorial would be awesome so stay tuned
and thank you for watching this tutorial
