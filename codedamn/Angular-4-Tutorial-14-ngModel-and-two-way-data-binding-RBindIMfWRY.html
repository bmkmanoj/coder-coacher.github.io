angular tutorial in which I'm going to
show you what the two-way data-binding
is an angular and how we can work with
it to reduce our code and make things
less cumbersome so what I'm going to do
is first of all get rid of this and this
one as well right so we're going to say
hello and then we're going to write user
name here right and finally we're gonna
create input type text which phase that
is value is let's just do it the ugly
way first value is user name right so
that would pretty much display the value
user name every time we reload our app
so we can say username is equal to go
down right and if you take a look in the
browser you can see that we get hello go
down and like that and nothing happens
right now that's fine so how do we
create a logic that when we update the
text in here the text also dates here
right so the first thing is that we need
to update this username right here so if
we can do that if we can update this
value whenever if we can update this
username whenever the user type some
value then this would be automatically
handled by angular so do that what we
can do is the weekend listen for an
input event and whatever that happens
what I want is change user name and we
can pass them the event which just
happened so right here we can say change
user name the function which gets an
event and right here we can say if this
stock user name is even the target
--top' value
okay so that looks obvious and if I
write something now we get change
username is not a function and change
user name well I don't think so we have
any error oh I guess I don't save the
file okay so now if we take a look you
can see that it works but such coding
for you know this is this is quite a
small logic for angular to handle and if
you have used angularjs
then you might remember that this could
be very much done without even touching
the script file with ng-model right and
the similar thing we have with angular
as well and that is kind of doing a
two-way binding so you can see that the
square bracket means make it it will
label to the view the circular brackets
means that we're going to send this to
the script so how about combining both
of them so what we can do is instead of
doing all this garbage and mess we can
simply create just username right here
and right here we can make use of the
square brackets and on a circular
bracket and we can say ng-model
just like we did in angularjs and then
simply we can say this is username so if
we save this and yes obviously because
we need to we are making use of this
custom direct rip ng model and it's not
present by default so we're going to
move back to our app module and inside
imports are going to import something
known as forms modules which contains
this entry module directive and we can
just import that wrong from modules
and it's actually presenting angular
form right so if we now take a look
again and let's just see what's
happening okay so now if we type again
you can see that it pretty much works
the same way but without a lot less code
and a lot less ugliness right so
ng-model is one way to do a bind data
right so you can create your own
directive as well if you want to but
right now for demonstration purposes I
guess ngmodel would be a best example so
yeah that is how pretty much you can
actually try to create a two-way data
binding between the view and the script
where the pin user is doing is
immediately reflected reflected on the
screen as well or at least in the
variable and yes so that's all for this
one and if you liked it then please

then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
