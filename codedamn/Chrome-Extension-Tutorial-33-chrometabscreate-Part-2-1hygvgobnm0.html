go down calm and welcome to your 33rd
google chrome extension development
tutorial in which will be looking at a
useful way to make use of chrome tabs
that create a PR in the last tutorial
are made you guys aware about an API in
Google Chrome extension which is chrome
the tabs which you can use to create
goals to the main page or on which the
user is right now so let's say whenever
user clicks a button here you want to
open a new tab instead of that old Baba
dot HTML here and actually I have done
this with my extension that lockers if
you see then you see that whenever I
click this icon a new tab opens instead
of just the old one so to do that what
you have to do is type cruel dot browser
action dot on clicked dot add listener
now what this is just doing is it would
just add a listener whenever your icon
is clicked in the toolbar so this would
be function and simply we would write
this much good and actually we don't
need any call back here so now this
application looks more dynamic kind of
so if I reload this extension and
okay so I guess we have a problem here
we don't have the browser at all so I'll
add browser action here default title
that's it so let's reload this again and
as you can see we got an icon now
whenever I give this icon you see that
google com gets opened so you see that
this is a Gareth more dynamic way of
using chrome door tab should create a bi
and if you see then inside this URL you
could even like right like chrome dot
extension dot get URL and your file
filename here so for example but i did
in deadlock restored back round what I
did is I when I created this extension I
added the same line this same line and
inside this what i did is URL chrome
that extension dot get URL which would
get a urls something like Chrome
extension or whatever your extension ID
and hear your file which is a valid HTML
URL to serve to the browser and hear
what i did is i passed options dot HTML
so whenever somebody click this he got
Chrome extensions this an option store
HTML page opened so that's one way of
using chrome dodd create a bi and I
leave up to you what you can make use of
this API and that's all for this
tutorial and then the next one will be
looking at some other aps within chrome
de tat so don't forget to subscribe and
