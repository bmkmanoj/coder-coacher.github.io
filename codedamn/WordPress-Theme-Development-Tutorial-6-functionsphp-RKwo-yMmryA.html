hole and welcome to your sixth WordPress
team development tutorial and in this
tutorial I'll be giving you a bit of
hint what functions dot PHP is in
WordPress and again it has a special
file just like index or header or footer
which do have special meanings for
WordPress framework so first of all just
go ahead and create a simple functions
dot PHP and make sure you have the same
name function stop PHP and not function
dot PHP or any other file so once you're
done with that just go ahead and create
a PHP opening PHP tag and one thing you
might want to know is that if your file
only contains PHP code then it doesn't
need to have a closing PHP so if your
code is just in PHP then you can just
pretty much do anything you want to do
without actually closing the PHP tag so
this one is fine as well but this one is
fine too so here we go now what we want
to do actually is that currently our
website looks really bad and even
second-class toddler can't create a
website better than this so obviously
you want to add some styles to your
website and one of the way you can do
that would be like adding a link rel
stylesheet' href then all the way
locating your style somewhere and even
if you locate it then in style dot CSS
now I've got a lot of problems with this
not considered this let's say you
install a plug-in which compresses your
website requests so that your website
loads faster and there are tons of
plugins like that on WordPress which
compresses your resources like CSS
JavaScript on the fly and pretty much
serves them in a very small size to the
users so that
you know your website loads faster but
the thing is that when you heart goods
things like these this is a hard-coded
stylesheet then not only plugins can
detect this actually there's a couple of
more problems as well well the first one
is obviously that plugins which you are
using cannot detect that you have
inserted certain styles scripts secondly
let's say you are already making use of
jQuery script script SRC let's just say
some where you found jQuery is and let's
just say another plugin actually wants
to make use of jQuery as well so if it
includes its own jQuery library then
WordPress doesn't know about that you
are already working with jQuery so you
would your website would work with two
versions of jQuery so again there are
some sort of problem so you know you get
the idea that hard coding isn't
WordPress kind of thing because what
press is meant to be dynamic so what we
can do instead is that inside function
start PHP you can actually register a
script or a stylesheet or basically a
resource which you want to load on your
website so to do that what you need to
do is simply click function let's just
say style sheets this is a simple
function you can name it anything you
like and it should say WP e and queu E
and Q style then this is style and the
next thing would be get stylesheet URI
notice that it is you your URI not URL
and this is Uniform Resource I guess I
forgot what this I stands for for eldest
was locator but for I guess this is
indicator or something like that well
anyways so this gets stylesheet URL
would
returners the style dot CSS again a
special file so this is a handy function
then the next thing you want to do is
actually call this function but you
don't simply do something like add style
sheets no no this won't work with
WordPress you need to register this
function so that WordPress could decide
the appropriate place and time to add
this style sheet to your document and
again this function start PHP is a
special file as I told you so what press
would take care of everything you write
in here automatically so you need to do
add action then what you have written is
WP &amp;amp; hué style and the function name is
add style sheets so that's pretty much
it and let's just close this out
function and reload new source and
reload again oh this should be actually
scripts instead because you know
resource is considered as a script for
your page so reload now and you can see
that this thing is automatically added
by WordPress to your team so if you open
this file pretty much you get nothing
because it's still blank
so what you can do is you can actually
create a comment right here and what
this comment would hold is the important
information like team name this would be
let's just say code WP team then you
don't need a semicolon right there
author it's me let's just only do I just
capitalize the first word literal
actually then you have author URI and
what I am doing actually with all of
this stuff is not just regular
commentating but actually this style at
CSS this stuff is actually fished in
here right here you can see it
automatically changed the name of the
team to code damn WP team instead of
that my first theme which was previously
appearing so for all of these themes you
can see that 2016 would be somewhere in
the style of CSS right written right
here 2016 so author URI you can just
change this to your own website URL or
something like that and then finally you
can give it a version of let's just say
I'm doing 1.0 so reload and again you
can see that it automatically pops up
with information like code number blue
key 3 by code damn it links my side down
here if you can see then I have this 1.0
information and pretty much you can even
add image for your team actually but
that's not something you would do from
the stylesheet so that's something for
another day but for now let's just focus
on our style sheet so now as you can see
that our style sheet is being loaded so
let's just do some styles so I'm going
to say in margin:0 padding:0 - every
element okay so the refresh won't work
for now ok so you can see that it's
working pretty cool then I just want to
get rid of this and in bold I want to
say PHP login for name only
and as you can see and what you can do
is right header right here and close it
in a header tag on Li and for header you
can say 30 pixel padding text-align:left
only border bottom background could be
blue
not really but something like this and
the color should be wide and for body
for now we can do this font family
caliber II but you can change the font
actually if you want to so here goes my
styles and for these post sections what
you can do is inside your index dot PHP
you can say for every post article class
post so that you can just differentiate
between articles and target them as well
so you can say H ref class title yeah
pretty much that's it so for the titles
you can say that a dot title is color
black text-decoration:none yeah so you
can add style sheet right there and for
header you can even do something like
divide II my section and why not just
write remain here and change this to
section so again this is starting a
section I remain so you need to close
that in footer
so let's close it right here so if I
reload and for section ID mean I can say
pretty much that this width would be
margin would be zero Auto for now or you
can just make it 20 pixels if you want
to and then again paste your code in
here then for section ID mean for a
single article post you can say margin
bottom is 20 pixels and border bottom is
1 pixel solid similar color and starting
bottom stand pixel margin bottom is 10
as well so here we go so if I do face
this code right here and if I create
another post let's just say I'd go to
Lipson calm and create some dummy text
and just copy this right here paste it a
new post title goes here and just get
rid of some of the content publish it
see it on the live website you can see
pretty much I get a new post so there's
a sort of dynamic thing we have the blog
and with the style sheets equipped you
can do wonders with your website and
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
