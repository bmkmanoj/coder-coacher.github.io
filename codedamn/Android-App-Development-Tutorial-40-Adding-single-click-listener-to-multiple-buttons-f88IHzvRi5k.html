Mei hole and welcome to your 40th
android application development tutorial
in which i'm gonna really quick show you
how you can implement the basic
functionality with these buttons and
some quick listeners and the best
approach for this one would be to add
the click listener method to the buttons
right here in the xml so that you just
don't have to go through each and every
button as an ID and then pretty much
register a click even then override that
in your activity and do a lot of stuff
when you can just do like android or
actually not this button actually i just
want to start with one android on click
and just say the method name let's say
this is number pressed right so this is
my method name and i'm just gonna copy
this to here then here three and four
five six then we have four seven eight
nine then first 0 as well so here we go
and in my mainactivity.java what i can
do is i can just create a public void
and then my number pressed method
actually and then this would contain a
view which would be very useful for us
later and what is it that is actually
yeah don't need that
the oncreate I will just create a new
method for that and for now I'm just
gonna log I to custom tag and then I
would just say that view V or whatever
let me just cast it to button first
because I'm pretty sure that it would be
get text it should be there well let's
say this is button V equals button V
right and V dot get text oh I guess I
was just missing this button input and
then I want to just convert it to
strength so that Java isn't offended and
yeah looks fine now if I run this on the
emulator so let me just configure this
one as well to what this was custom tag
right there okay now okay so here's our
app and now if I click on like one you
can see that I get that particular
number which is exactly what we need and
it doesn't do anything for other buttons
because I haven't added any sort of
method associated with it
so that is how pretty much you add a
click listener for buttons various
buttons like that because it's just
three liner code and if I just do it
dynamically inside Java only would be
kind of you know a big one code because
you need to do a lot of stuff manually
so yeah so that's all for this tutorial
on the next one I would actually
implement what we can do with
click on or basically the top of these
buttons so yeah so that's all for this
tutorial and if you like that then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then and the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
