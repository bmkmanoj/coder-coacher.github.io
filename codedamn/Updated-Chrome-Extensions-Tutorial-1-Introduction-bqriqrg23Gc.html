Air which is cool I guess but anyways
that's not the topic of this video so
what we're going to do in this work here
is for which this is the introductory
video is now we're going to cover
something known as Chrome extensions
development and I have done this before
but I realized that I have received a
lot of remarks the audio is horrible and
it truly was because those were some of
my first videos on code dance so I
decided to recreate the series with some
better content and we're going to take a
look at some more api's like other while
creating maybe something like a screen
deck stock capture sort of application
that would be cool I guess so we can
just take a look at that I will recover
a little bit more about Chrome
extensions what we can do with it and
some more API is to explore all the
possibilities are endless
so yeah that's it for the introductory
part and I probably guess you know what
Chrome extensions are if you're watching
this because if you don't then I guess
you might want to go to the same page
which I am on right now and read a
little bit about to the Chrome
extensions I guess it's on the way there
and not really in dev tools not
something extensions only just try this
extensions page yeah you can see that
there is a little bit of introduction
about Chrome extensions so you can go
ahead and read that if you want to or
you can just hop over to the next video
to get started with some real stuff so
yeah that's all for this one and if you
like that then please don't forget to
subscribe and again I guess I might have
some sound issues because this is the
first video on this MacBook Air and for
us to see how it goes like so yeah
that's all for this one and if you liked
it then please don't forget to subscribe
and thank you for watching I'll see you
then real quick on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
