fourth shell script tutorial and this
tutorial I'll be showing you something
called developers tool and console in
JavaScript no basically it's not a part
of JavaScript but it is really helpful
in debugging the JavaScript code every
modern browser like Google Chrome and
Firefox already come equipped with it
this is a Firefox extension called
Firebug which you can download to get a
similar developer tool like Google
Chrome but I myself prefer Google
Chrome's developer tool because I'm well
aware with its features I'm shooting
this tutorial in full-screen mode
because in this tutorial we'll be
looking at Chrome's developer tools to
launch the developer tool click the
right click on anywhere on the website
and click on inspect element
I'm using
Google Chrome 41-point 0.227 - version
maybe this would update when you're
watching this tutorial but the method
remains relatively simple it just needs
you to right-click on anywhere on the
page and click on inspect element and
here you can see the shortcut for this
as well ctrl shift and I on Windows
computer once you do this you have this
whole lot of code I don't have much
school that the style is generated by
some of my extension right here qapla I
have developed myself I won't be making
you understand all these tools because
they are not necessary for the
development purpose right now they are
more of like testing and kind of speed
test and time loading speeds and how
much time the document is taking to
execute the scripts like that but the
console the console thing is important
now console is pretty much like
everything written inside the script
tags console is your command line as
well as it it will show your output of
JavaScript for example it could be
simply a calculator if you do like 10
plus 15 10 star 15
and you can write all the JavaScript you
do inside this script to tags within
here like for example you are a is equal
to
hello
in the world
and we can do a plus B and it shows us
hello world we don't need any document
or write or window please because
console is a developer tool we don't
need to do document dot right here if we
do document dot right here it gets
executed as a normal script as the
script itself we have written in the
file of the page like hello world if we
do this then you can see hello world
appears on the top it executes on the
document page now supposingly now you'll
ask what's the use of console for
example like you just want to take the
value of
the prompt now prompt is a function in
JavaScript which shows a dialog box and
takes a value from him sir what is your
age
supposedly we take this value in a
variable C and I don't want to show it
to your users but I just want it for
development purposes for the future
developers to see what is entered by the
user here so I would lock this inside
the console to do a console log you
simply type console dot log and C now
what would happen here is it will show
an alert box here with the JavaScript
asking the user to submit a value it's
simply console logs the value entered by
the user for example if we reload this
page we get a dialog box what is your
age for example if I enter my age 16
then as you can see it console logs the
value entered by the user so console log
is a useful tool in debugging or storing
the value behind the hood which you
don't want the front end users or the
normal users wish to not use these tools
to see console with using console log
you can execute scripts on any side
yourself on your machine example if I do
alert right here then it will show me an
alert this is helpful and saves time as
we do not need to go back to the file
and make certain edits and we can just
copy right copy all the JavaScript code
we have written here if you have ever
used elements in this developers tool to
modify the CSS of the
GSS of the document then you should have
seen this that you can modify the CSS
directly on the elements itself and then
copy them in your file
similarly javascript console is used to
directly execute the scripts on the
document page without any need to go and
edit the file again so that's all for
the tutorial remember that you open
console.log by right-clicking and
inspect element and you lock your own
commands to control by typing console
dot log example the last example we can
use this 10 + 15 and if we refresh this
it doesn't matter because we are not
doing anything with this body we get 25
logged as it is so thanks for watching
