this tutorial number 16 I'm a hole and
in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how
you can use popovers in your webpage
with the help of bootstrap now popovers
unlike the tooltips which we learned in
the last tutorial are kind of more
bigger you can say bigger than tooltips
and they are you know kind of more
appealing to the user than a tooltip
because they can stay even when you you
know just take your mouse cursor off the
link which you want to show the pop-up
on so let's just create a popper world
so let me just choose the world here
let's just say let's go with this word
so to create a popper where again I'm
just gonna make use of this air traffic
you can make use of any time like span
or whatever you want to do I'm just
making use of a because that makes the
word blue so that it is distinguishable
from the other words so there you go
let's just add a data pop over again
just like we did in the tooltip one and
what else let's just say title as my
first pop over and in the content if you
want to add the content you need to add
data content here so yeah so you need to
follow this you are free to use your own
here because that would be initialized
by jQuery but make sure to use the title
as this and data content here so the
content would be like anything you want
to display this would become clear in a
bit so let's just say I just display
this is a little message here you go so
let me just get rid of that a tag and
the next thing obviously we'll need to
initialize that why our script
and instead of just removing that what
you can do is to copy it again right
here pop over and instead of this
obviously right pop over at all of these
methods you don't need to worry about
them because they are coming from this
file which you have included and since
this is a bootstrap file you know that's
a part of framework so let's reload this
and go down and as you can see this one
and when I click on this you see that it
jumps on the top because I'm using a
ashraf but you see the first popover
appears so to fix that what we can do is
instead of this edge ref you can write
JavaScript void and should pretty much
fix up the problem as you can see or
else
what you can do is make use of span tag
or whatever you like so you see that
this toggles the pop over and you know
you can just take off your mouse
anywhere you want and to close it you
can click on the link again so that's
how you use popovers in bootstrap and
yeah so let me see if I missed anything
and I guess yeah so you can make use of
another thing called data placement now
this data placement is the position of
your popover so let's just say if I do
it like top ok now when I view this on
my browser and click on this again you
see firstly it was appearing on the
right side of this link but now it
appears on the top and similarly you can
customize it for various positions like
left or bottom or right which was the
default one it's up to you so yeah
that's how you use it and one thing you
can see now that is when you click
outside this pop-up doesn't go away so
that's kinda you know a bit not user
friendly because obviously this makes
sense that
you click outside something then this
should close automatically but this
close on clicking the link for me so to
fix that what you can do with I guess I
reloaded the page
nevermind so to fix that what you can do
is you can go to your jQuery or not
check where your guess scooty your link
here and just say data trigger and the
value here would be focus and I guess
the files didn't load up correctly okay
so what focus does is that let's say I
click on this and I click outside here
so you see now the pop-up closes
automatically but if I change this focus
to hover and then I reload this again
you can see as I hover over the link
this pop-up appears and disappears so
this kind of behaves like the tooltip
which we have right here you see and
let's try to make use of this data
trigger with tooltip who knows it might
work let's say data trigger what make
use of their focus yeah so let's just
try
okay so this works with tooltips as well
so you can customize the tooltips like
you can do it with pop-ups here so you
know the functionality is quite you know
open to the developer you can choose
whatever you want you can make it focus
or you can make it on homework like this
so yeah so that's all for this popover
one and I'll see you the next time don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
