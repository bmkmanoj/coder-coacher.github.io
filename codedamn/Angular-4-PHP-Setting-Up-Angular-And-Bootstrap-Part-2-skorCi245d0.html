second tutorial for application
development with angular 4 and PHP and
in this tutorial
first of all let's set up angular
command-line now if this is your first
time with angular 4 I would actually
suggest you to just go ahead and watch
the angular 4 playlist first I have I
should have that link ready in the
description because you know you can
just follow along but you won't be able
to understand a lot of things because
the primary focus here is to develop a
real application and not really into how
angular is working so if you are
extremely new with angular 4 or you have
never heard about it and you're like
what the heck is going on and I used to
learn about I used to know about
angularjs so you should probably check
out the angular 4 playlist first to get
a taste about it and when you are ready
you are free to go here and follow along
with me so if you are somebody who is
coming from angular 4 or has a little
background then you can just pretty much
go ahead and start a command line here
I'm just going to go with the windows
default and if you do not know about
angular CLI but are comfortable with
angular 4 I guess it's not time to
switch to angular CLI first of all
because it follows the best practices
for your code and secondly it's a lot
easier to get started with so for
instance what I'm going to do is write
ng new and I'm going to say this is my
new application name so let's just say
we say this is upload images and hit
enter now obviously you would need to
have this angular CLI installed and how
you do that is by NPM which I can show
you by doing something like writing NPM
install add the rate angular CLI and
then a global flag for globally
installing it and once you do that you
should be able to write things like ng
and any command right here
so yeah and for obviously for NPM you
need to install node.js first so you can
just go ahead and go to you know just or
dark to download and install that okay
so we can see that it's taking some time
and let's just wait for it to complete
actually I'm my netbook speed isn't that
bad but I don't know with NPM it takes a
lot of time and all the time so I don't
know it's something to do with NPM or if
it's their repository I don't know let's
just wait okay so we were done I guess
five minutes ago but anyways so once you
are done with that you should see some
sort of success message but I close my
terminal so yeah so what I'm going to do
is go to sublime text and right here you
can see that we have our project open so
you might want to open it as well in
your text editor whatever you're using
and we could probably just get rid of
this index dot PHP file for now and what
I'm going to do is actually go to this
folder again a man window right here and
I'm going to write ng serve so that it
starts a local development server for us
to see life changes and we can just
minimize that and for now what we see is
that we get our structure and what it is
the app and app component right here you
can see that you have our main module
and we have this HTML file which would
be pretty much the same file which would
be displayed right here right so we
would just get rid of all of this and
what I'm going to do is actually create
some components
so for that we would need to actually
fire another terminal so that we can
work with two and I'm going to say ng in
grade and get component it is and let's
just say we create a file uploader which
would be kind of an uploader for the
user to upload the file and we can
create gen grade component header and
let us finally create another component
component let's just name it gallery now
what this would be is that we would be
displaying a header which is pretty much
common and then we would be displaying a
file uploader which would be the upload
button for now at least
and the gallery one would be visible
when the file has been uploaded and
processed and we send down links from
PHP to angular to actually show to the
user so images would go into gallery so
there we go and we should see all of our
components ready and right here inside
our component book we can stay is inside
hello if we take a look we have the
selector at half header so we can say a
header and right here we can say a file
uploader if that's yep uploaded and
finally you could say gallery but
obviously we want gallery to be
displayed only when we wanted to so we
would just add some conditional spin
string right here but as of now if we
take a look we see all of these three
works okay so the next thing is actually
adding bootstrap to our application and
for that what I'm going to do is go to
get bootstrap bootstrap and just go
ahead and make use of their CDN consumes
we are not actually going a lot into
bootstrap I just want to pick up the CSS
files because we would be probably just
making
use of a couple of CSS classes so we
just need to have the stylesheet for
that and you can just go to index and
paste it right here
doesn't matter for a simple application
like this one now we can just get rid of
this integrity and cross-origin check as
well because I'm pretty sure that my
network is been tampering with the CSS
file at least because hey I guess I can
trust my network that much
so we have our bootstrap ready now and
being loaded as well so if we can do is
actually inside our header component or
rather the header component HTML we can
say that this is something like it works
or rather we would just say and I guess
bootstrap is not working we'll just take
a look at that let's just say this is
upload images and get magic like I don't
know what that means but that will
actually strike me right now so we can
see that bootstrap is not loading
probably or is it Oh actually we are
using the theme we need to actually get
the raw one and let's just make some
quick replacements here and I can just
leave that but I'm just going to get rid
of that because it makes little bit too
long because the URL already is a lot
longer yeah so now looks like the
bootstrap is on and our header is on as
well so we can just center align it
where is it so we can say h1 class text
entered
like that and there you go and similarly
inside our file upload a component what
I want is a very basic button so we can
say something like Spain class button
button default and I can just say
something like go upload images but we
actually need to trigger this on
clicking and let's just make it Center
as well again I can just say this is
this class text enter and it should be
centered now we can actually map the
upload button right here so let's just
do input type file and actually that
will create a problem because yeah we'll
get this ugly button as well so what we
can do is we can actually make this the
label and what that would do is that
will help us to trigger this button
whenever we click that and we can just
hide this as well right so what I'm
going to do is why is this okay so
bootstrap is overriding that so we can
go to our file uploader CSS file here
and we can just say input display:none
I'm just doing it for alway what you
would like to select it first right so
yep okay looks good and now quickly we
can see that we get this pop-up as the
file selector very nice and now for the
gallery what I want is that gallery
should not be there unless we wanted to
so I'm just going to hide it for now by
something like this so that it doesn't
display right so we would just make use
of some condition here that we have got
response from the server
and then only we will display this
gallery so yeah that's all for this one
and then the next one will be actually
implementing the upload functionality or
maybe we will just go with the PHP
version first so that we can actually
configure the backend so we add that's
all for this one and if you liked it
then don't forget to subscribe and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
