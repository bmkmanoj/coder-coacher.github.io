11th jQuery tutorial and the story will
be learning about two more even methods
known as mouse and a bow sound so these
two methods are kind of similar to the
whole event
pattered we learned about a couple of
tutorials back but I'll tell you the
difference between these the bundle of
these two daeho one so let's get started
let's create a div let's say my Dave
let's make it visible
by applying styles to it
it's a background off red okay so we
have our different and let's grab
society down here we have document it
ready for the document do it then let's
say mouse enter
function
let's say I want to console.log mouse
entered
okay so
basically I could do this thing like
this also so let's say I create a
function about this let's say Mouse
enter and
let's copy the name of this function
down here inside this parentheses supply
the function name so we are good to go
now we have the even for Mouse enter
let's play them even for a mouse out so
similarly let's copy this line let's do
Mouse out I would say as good another
function Mouse out there we go
it's just about sound we are good to go
now here's the browser let's kill this
channel
it's inspect element
let's refresh this so we have our red
div let's lower over the mouse that if
we get the even a smart Mouse entered
now let's leave the day of mouse leave
entered leave entered leaf entered leaf
I like that so now the difference
between Hoover and mouse enter and
mostly we start lower down here if I say
my Dave got to work then it would accept
two functions as the arguments so
basically these two lines are exactly
similar to this one line but the
difference is over would accept to
function arguments which are the entry
event of Mouse and the live event of
Mouse so if I comment out this code I'll
leave it with this
would work exactly the same let's
refresh this and as you can see there's
not pretty much difference between who
were these two so that's all for this
tutorial I'll see you then in the future
tutorials and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
