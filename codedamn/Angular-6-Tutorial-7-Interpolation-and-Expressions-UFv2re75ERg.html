May ho and welcome to your seventh
angular tutorial in which I'm gonna show
you what interpolation and expressions
are in angular and this will really be a
quick two second video tutorial because
there's not a lot to cover in
interpolation and expressions on their
own but we will need them really often
as we proceed along with the web series
so let's get started okay so in this
tutorial we're gonna take a look at what
interpolation is it's simple
I don't know why I put that point there
but anyways you just kind of relate
really soon expressions used in
interpolation and some probated
expression syntax examples that's it so
putting in very simple words what
interpolation basically is is doing
something like my variable that's it
that's interpolation for you guys so in
this example what we have is these two
curly braces acts as the syntax for
interpolation and your interpolating and
this my variable whatever right whatever
you go right here is your expression so
for example or I can write 5 times 2
which would be 10 and you can see that
if we take a look here we get the output
as 10 all right now we can change this
to addition as well which works just
fine obviously okay now what we can do
is that we can actually echo out some
values as well so I can say my variable
here and I can say something like my
variable is my name right if you save
this Mayville it is easy now we have
seen what is interpolation symbol
expressions provocated expression syntax
examples now what we have is that we
cannot actually make use of all the
javascript in here especially like if
you want to do something like let's say
bitwise or
of two numbers like 2 &amp;amp; 5 so what you
would actually do with something like
bitwise or two or five this provokes the
bitwise or between 2 or 5 and bitwise or
is pretty much just like you present
everything in binary 1 0 4 2 and yep 1 1
0 if I'm not wrong no 1 0 1 or 1 0 1
yeah 1 2 4 plus 1 5 yeah so we are gonna
perform a bitwise or for these 2 numbers
so what we have in here is that 0 or 1
is 1 then 1 or 0 is 1 then what we have
will have 0 &amp;amp; 0 or 1 is what so we have
the answer as 1 1 1 which would give us
4 5 6 7 as the answer let's hope I don't
insult myself on YouTube so we can just
set this bitwise or right here it's safe
I'll take a look in the template let it
reload or let's just real it ourselves
okay yeah so the answer is in fact 7
cool but we cannot do this thing right
here inside an expression because
angular makes use of pipes for its own
use cases you can see that it shows us
template parse errors so you need to do
things like these and separate variables
now what we can do is actually call the
functions called functions as well but I
would not recommend this because angle
or whenever rear Enders the template
would call that particular function
again and again so you can so you can
see that let's just say this is my do
some some heavy task I have I just
console.log this called this dot I
times just like this honest AI is zero
and if I do like something like do some
tasks heavy tasks instead do some heavy
tasks there it is and what I want to do
is check my console in here about we
have some errors to some heavy task to
some heavy task console dot log called
this dot I plus plus times and my I is
in fact equal to zero column six what
the hell is this
okay we are missing Kali brace here and
let's just reload it one more time so
you can see that we get in console
called zero times one then students we
down so angular itself is calling it at
least four times in this execution
because it's rendering this HTML file
four times and it would keep calling
this function if I triggers change for
less to say any variable inside this
component so we can make something like
this very easily so we can say set
interval let's see
you
this dot some variable is math dot
random this should be sufficient to
trigger or angular's change
Anglet change to be performed so if you
take a look in the browser you can see
that this function gets unnecessarily
cold every time we are making change to
just this variable so that's why you
should not use functions usually in your
HTML interpolation syntax in angular and
use just the property names so that was
pretty much it for this tutorial and in
the next one
we're gonna discuss a lot more
interesting stuff about angular so see
you then in the next video and one more
