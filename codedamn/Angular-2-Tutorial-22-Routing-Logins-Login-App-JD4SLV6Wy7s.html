May ho are welcome to another angular 2
tutorial in which we'll be continuing
with our login application and first of
all let's just get rid of these messages
because these kind of look brutal so
what I'm gonna do is actually I'm gonna
say right here we want to redirect the
user to some different page if the user
is actually an administrator and if not
then what I want to do is pretty much
redirect the user to a universal page
where the user can pretty much view a
common page template like everybody else
would view so for administrator there
should be a sort of a different page and
for regular users there should be sort
of like a dashboard so what I'm gonna
make use of is I'm gonna say right here
first of all let's just define a private
router and we're gonna need a router
here route config and I'm gonna say this
is a private router and this is of a
type router well you can just do sort of
like object here as well that's some
typescript stuff so now what I'm gonna
say that since this is a router of our
page I'm gonna say this dot router dot
navigate inside here I'm gonna pass him
the name of my route so in this case
that would be let's just say admin area
so what this admin area is actually if
you remember from the past few tutorials
I guess I told you in simple shopping
application I told you that for an
aircraft you need to create something
like this not actually it's ref but
route wrong link and then inari and here
goes the admin area so we did that on
purpose and whenever the user played
this anchor tag what would happen is
that whatever the knee
of that route would be pretty much would
the user would be redirected to that so
this is the similar thing but in this
case you can think like we are just
immediately creating that link just
clicking that but actually that's
nothing like that is happening it's just
simply routing the user do a different
name let's just make the first first
caps and define another route and inside
this I'm gonna say admin and make sure
that only the name right here needs to
match this nothing else so you know it's
not like you have to make this admin
area as well no you can just keep the
pad anything but the name should match
then the component for this would be
pretty much different one so let's just
say this is my admin component let's
just define another file then new file
component dot admin dot TS and actually
let's just copy the login one so we
don't need this thing right here just
need the component right here then
pretty much for now I'm just gonna
display hello admin and yeah pretty much
I guess we are done with that so if I
take a look in the browser okay we get
admin component it's not defined because
we are not including in component input
admin component from component dot admin
all right now we are good to go and if
I'd write anything like that and
obviously yes we should probably
console.log this as well
console log just our data and admin one
two three four five login
nothing but only the console.log because
the code doesn't enter this is block but
if I change this to admin and hit login
we get a lot of errors so ng summit he
cannot read properly now you get of
undefined looks like I haven't thrown
this in constructor so you need to just
have the constructor first so that
should pretty much do our job
and I guess we have to endure router
instead of frog convict okay so now if I
enter admin admin hit enter you can see
that I am navigated to localhost 3000
and slash admin so yes the console still
works because actually this is a under
the behind-the-scenes routing not
actually have loaded this page but you
can see that if I'll directly load the
speed it still works which kind of you
would like so you know like that you
won't want actually that anybody in the
world just goes to your website and type
slash admin and gets access to the
administrator area well then what good
is login form so we're gonna make use of
a simple authentication thing with
angular which would kind of validate if
the user is logged in and if it is then
if the user is administrator then only
you have access to this area so that's
pretty much it for this video tutorial
