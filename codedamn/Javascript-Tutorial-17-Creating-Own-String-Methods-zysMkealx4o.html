JavaScript tutorial in previous
tutorials
I admit that we did very boring stuff
and just the theoretical knowledge and
how this works and how do we do that but
no proper implementation of what we
learnt in actually what we do on the web
for example we just learned about what
the prototype does and why why it is
done but we never learned that how you
can use it in your own web apps made in
JavaScript so in this tutorial we'll be
finally looking how to create our own
string methods okay so first of all
let's create the prototype method of the
string and let's say it reverse sentence
now before you catch me that I'm
creating a new thing or I'm creating
just a thing which is already available
in the JavaScript you'd reverse the
string like this actually in JavaScript
like if you want to reverse the string
then what you do is be dot split divorce
this will actually reverse the string or
sentence actually but let's try to
create this function this this method in
string so we can just simply access it
like B dot reverse sentence or let's
give it a user-friendly name
what about very short and simple ok so
let's see now we have string dot
prototype dot rev me and if you don't
know what's happening here then I
recommend you to go back in the tutorial
list and start these tutorials at least
from tutorial number twelve or ten maybe
from where I started this Java Script
prototypal inheritance tutorial list the
first ten are for just warming up you
okay so now we have string dot prototype
dot read me and we got a function inside
it so the first thing we need to do is
we need to get the string on which the
user called this method for example
let's say a sentence I love to program I
can program any time and let's reverse
the this sentence completely that means
everything should be reversed
like e/m ID by and a I hope you got me
just like we did with the split and
joint function and now let's go on so
log our future method of read me now
let's create this method the first of
all to get the string the user is
calling let's create a private variable
use a string let's
this dot length and what happens here is
not use a string yet this returns the
length of this string now javascript by
default splits every of this this string
completely into every single character
with specified index of area for example
I would be 0 then the space 1 then l2
like that then let's create a for loop
then Len and I plus plus let's create
another local variable here use the
strain
and just you the strength should be
equal to
this now what's happening here is we got
the length of the string as a splitted
array with each character as a separate
index then we did a for loop which runs
until the length is less than the length
we are storing the user string into the
string into this variable user string by
assigning the value of this index that
means on the first loop this would be
this zero and would return I to the user
string the plus is equal to operator is
just same as this is this and the
previous one are same so let's keep it
short hand
now let's see how we can reverse this
string now we have brought each string
in this variable the string supplied by
the user now let's see what we can do to
reverse the string now we have length
and we have user strength let's create a
while loop our while length - - and just
let straight another private variable
strange
some string is equal to use a string
length
okay
let's see now let's return got some
string now what's happening here is I
hope I'm clear till this for loop now in
the while loop what's happening here is
supposingly the length of the string is
let's it then then what happens is while
length - - what it does is it reduces
the variable length to nine and that is
actually required because the know the
length of the string is 9 then actually
the array elements are nine because the
indexing starts from zero for example
this dot length would return ten but the
elements would be till nine okay so
first of all when we access this nine
ten then what happens is it stores the
custom string into user string now what
happening here is we are actually
accessing the the string in a reverse
order and storing it in the custom
string oh I guess I missed the plus sign
here okay so let's try to run this
program with the sentence and see what
console.log this let's write a simple
one so I can understand that there's no
fault in the program ABC and D let's see
I'll just drag it a bit
as you can see it echoes dcba that means
it reverses the string and prints it on
the browser now let's try a complex
sentence
just a random sentence whatever you like
as you can see now it starts from this
exclamation mark because this is the
last character and if you have time to
read this sentence I recommend you to
pause this video and just write it in
your notebook and just do whatever you
want to do because once you reverse the
sentence you will get this sentence no
matter how many times you try it okay if
you want to confirm the sentence they'll
come for me let's do the traditional
method
we'll see done that it will
let's see
oh actually we don't need to reverse the
sentence as well because we are not
calling the reverse me method here so or
let's try this
now this should return true if this the
string return by this method is equal to
this method and if we refresh this then
you as you can see it returns true that
means both of these strings are equal
now this reverse method I don't say that
my method is superior to this method
because this reverse method has got a
real odd coding and stuff and
compatibility inside it for example if
we don't want to invert all the words
all the letters but just the words then
we can supply the parameter or maybe the
space parameter in the split and in the
join as well and then what it would do
is it would just simply return us the
sentence what
maybe inside yes and it will just return
this and dance in an inverse manner but
not the words as you can see I love you
or JavaScript I love to code and then
JavaScript I don't know what that makes
sense but that's something you can do
with split and reverse and joined like
that so I hope we are clear with the own
custom string dot prototype methods and
go ahead and create your own methods and
post in the comment section and I hope
