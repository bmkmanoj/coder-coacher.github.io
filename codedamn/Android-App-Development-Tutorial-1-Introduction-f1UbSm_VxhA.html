very first Android application
development tutorial my name is Mei hole
and in this tutorial and probably in
this whole series of Android application
development we are going to learn about
how to create awesome Android
applications which you can run on your
phone and on other phones and probably
on tablets on variables like watch
Android watch and pretty much any device
which android supports and you could
probably just make a bit of
customizations and you would be able to
support that particular device now
Android is an operating system and
developing applications for this would
be correct cumbersome if you do it in a
text editor like sublime text or notepad
plus plus well it's probably possible
but it is not feasible so we need an IDE
and Android itself has a very awesome
IDE for that purpose and that is Android
studio well you have Eclipse as well but
Eclipse is got a third buddy you need to
have some plugins of Android studio to
make it work nicely and you know it's
kind of slow as well compared to Android
studio Android studio is pretty fast if
you have you know obviously you haven't
used it yet but when you use it you will
yourself realize that the auto
completion and compilation is relatively
faster than Eclipse so what I'm going to
do in this whole series is that I'm
going to teach you guys how to create
Android applications well fair enough
but I expect a little bit of programming
knowledge from guys like you should be
probably like from web designing
background or you know anything else you
just you should probably know that yes
there's some sort of programming there's
some sort of language called Java or XML
and probably you shouldn't be like Oh
what is going on on the screen what this
text is all about
if you are one of the guys who have just
landed on this tutorial video and have
no idea what programming is and you know
how to do programming even how to create
a basic something so I would really
recommend you to first of all just get
basics of Java at least if you are if
you are completely blank in programming
and for all those folks who are coming
from web designing or web development or
you know just have a little bit of idea
about Java or C or C++ you would be
probably good to go and you have to just
download it and install it for now it
shows me for Windows if you are on Mac
it would probably show you for Mac here
and yeah so you have to just download it
and once you download it you'll get a
setup like this which would be around
1.15 gigs and as you can see it's
Android 2.1 in my case but in your case
it might be a little bit higher version
if you are seeing this video after a
bunch of months or something but if you
as long as you are in two-point x-series
you shouldn't have any much sort of
problem so you just have to install
Android studio just double-click it and
it will just wait for you
for the photo setup for extraction and
it would then ask you about permissions
just say yes and it will install it you
just have to click Next Next and it
saves me uninstall the previous version
because I already have installed Android
studio so I'm just going to click cancel
right here and one thing you might need
to do in your setup is that it might ask
you to install a virtual device now just
uncheck that option because we're gonna
make use of something known as
genymotion for our virtual device and
you know just install the setup as a raw
setup don't install any device
associated with it
so whenever you see an option like
install a virtual device or set up a
virtual device just uncheck or unmarked
that particular thing and you'll be good
to go so that's all for this tutorial
and in the next tutorial we'll be taking
a look at how to set up our Android
emulator so that we could actually test
our apps so that's all for this tutorial
and if you like that then don't
