May ho and welcome to your fourteenth
typescript tutorial in which I'm gonna
show you what classes are in typescript
and that script has tried to make it a
lot similar to what egg mask web six
implementation is about classes and yes
I guess I have a couple of tutorials on
classes in egg my script six players you
might want to check them out but since
we are making use of typescript now
let's just stick to that only for now
and the implementation is quite similar
so what you have to do as a basic
example is that you write a class then
your class name let's just say this is
websites and then our website just and
then for website what we have is a URL
as a string and then we have like I
don't know what else do we have like you
know whatever Facebook Likes or
something other number right so this is
our basic class and what you have to do
is just initialize it like our Google is
new website and we can actually just
pass in the a couple of arguments here
but for that we will need a constructor
which would take a look at later so now
you can say Google dot u RL is equal to
google.com like that and then you can
say Google God Facebook Likes is I don't
know let's just say one like this so you
can see that it compiles perfectly fine
and in the compiled code you can see
that pretty much you are making use of
closures and this is your kind of class
for the native JavaScript for now and
the rest is kind of you know
similar to what we have in here so this
is how pretty much you create a very
basic class and
typescript and typescript does follow
pretty much almost all the standards of
classes which we get from
object-oriented but there's obviously a
huge difference that javascript works
for and prototypal inheritance model but
classes work on some different they are
a ject oriented programming kind of
inheritance model so that difference
would stay obviously but typescript kind
of gives a lot of comfort to those
people who are coming from backgrounds
like C++ or Java which have extensive
use of classes in them so this is how
pretty much again how you create a basic
class and in the next tutorial we'll be
covering more on classes and
constructors and play around them a
little and yes that is all for this one
and if you like that then don't forget
to subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
