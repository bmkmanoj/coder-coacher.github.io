another ionic tutorial my name is
may-who and in this tutorial what we are
gonna do is quickly create our stop the
timer button and pretty much know how to
execute a function and how to pretty
much know whether the timer has been
stopped forcefully or it has actually
completed its whole cycle so let's just
get started now in the last tutorial if
a quick recap I can show you if I just
start the time or it would just count
down all the way to zero from this value
right here which we specified so that's
pretty much obvious so I'm gonna say
scope dot stop as a function and what
its gonna do again is pretty much just
do the same thing which we are doing
right here so now if I just start the
timer and stop it
you can see the timer is sort of freezes
out there and what you can do next is
you can just reset your timer my time no
just my timer do ten again so if you
just start the timer and stop it again
it just comes back to ten so you can
just do that or you can just leave that
it's up to you now the next thing you
might want to do is know that the timer
was you know just forcefully stopped
from this button or was actually stopped
by this cycle right here so that's
really much straightforward you can just
call any sort of function like scope dot
timer was I don't know timer was
completed or you can just name it
complete and true and you can just keep
it to one single function and actually
you can just omit this with the scope
actually because we don't need that to
be accessible anywhere and again I can
just fall call complete as false and
again I can just simply create to our
complete is a function and I can just
say this is a I don't know forceful
forceful abort and actually we could
just interchange the values because the
argument looks like we are calling and
forceful abort and if forceful about
then I want to just simply alert
you killed the timer else alert timer
complete here we go and if I start the
timer and stop it somewhere it shows me
you kill the damn timer and if I start
the timer and let just let it just
continue down one you can see that we
get the timer complete as an alert so
that's really cool and yeah that's
pretty much it for the functionality
part and from the next tutorial on was
will be customizing this a little bit
using a simple you know angular module
which would just allow us to create
circles out of this 10 number so that we
could just make use of the application
which I was referring from the last
tutorial so that's it for this tutorial
and if you liked it then don't forget
