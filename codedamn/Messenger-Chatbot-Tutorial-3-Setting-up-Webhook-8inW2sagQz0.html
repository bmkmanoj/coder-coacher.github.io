Mabel and welcome to your third chat bot
development tutorial in which I'm going
to show you how to set up
webhook real quick and what this webbook
essentially is that this would be the
URL where facebook the messenger would
send all of the things that user type or
basically like tap on links on in your
web but when it is communicating with
you so first of all working to do is
that we need to verify our web hook so
that Facebook can actually trust that
it's safe to send it there right so to
do that I'm going to go in my index dot
PHP file right I'm gonna write a bunch
of lines here which you have to write
exactly because it's kind of you know
Facebook would send you get requests on
the URL which we mention and then you
have to accordingly show the challenge
which the Facebook would send and I can
just show you that in a minute as well
what I'm gonna what I'm trying to say
here right and then token is equal to
request how verify token and this is a
get request you can make you just get as
well so what we can do now is say that
if token is equal to my custom token one
two three right anything can go in there
because we're going to provide the same
thing in our Facebook app here in very
excited oaken right so right okay so
looks good for now and yeah so let's
just deploy it and hit enter and as you
can see I have combined these three
lines so that
have to again and again type all of this
stuff so looks like it's done and if I
check the logs you can see the logs are
looking pretty good as well
right so now just open your app copy the
URL and paste it right here and just
select the things you want to and very
expensive and you can see that it says
complete in front of a book that means
that your URL is verified and it's kind
of working in a working state right so
the next thing you need to do is you
need to authenticate you know you need
to attend to get your account that you
can use a page which you want to so in
our case it's chatbot code damn right
and when you just do that it will just
ask you to log in with Facebook just hit
OK don't worry about this and just hit
OK then it will generate an access token
for you which will make use of later but
for now what I need to do is that I need
to select this page if you don't kind of
authenticate yourself here then this
would not work so make sure you do that
first so just hit subscribe and when it
shows you'll be good to go right so so
yeah that is how pretty much you set up
a basic web hook with your and not a
basic actually that's the only thing you
do with the web book and from the next
tutorial onwards I'm going to show you
how to send a very basic reply to the
chat conversation right so that is all
for this one and if you liked it then
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
