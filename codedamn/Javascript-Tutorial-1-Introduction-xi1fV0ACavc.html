JavaScript tutorial in this tutorial we
will be looking at how do we write code
in JavaScript
why javascript is required and what
other things we can do with JavaScript
which are not possible with CSS and HTML
to begin with I have a simple html5
document layout here which says document
type HTML HTML head meta carsick utf-8
title JavaScript oops it should be
JavaScript tutorial one head body script
body closing HTML you must be familiar
with the HTML layout but this thing this
thing here is the JavaScript code to
write JavaScript code first of all you
enclose all the coding inside an opening
script tag and a closing script tag now
everything which is here
is passed by the JavaScript engine of
specific browser now you must have heard
many times that your JavaScript runs on
one browser but doesn't run on another
or maybe it has a different behavior on
another browser this is because
different browsers have different
JavaScript engines which have different
parts methods though the the native
methods of JavaScript are identical in
every browser but when it comes to
libraries like jQuery then these engines
of browsers clash among themselves and
interpret the results in different ways
that is the reason sometimes a
JavaScript code works on one browser and
sometime it doesn't work on another okay
so as I've already told you everything
you write inside the script and the
closing script tag will be executed by a
special parser engine of the browser
which would execute and understand all
the cool inside here so first of all
let's write a simple document dot write
program which simply writes a bunch of
text to the document to do that just to
document that right
hello world this is our JavaScript hello
world program now what it does here is
document is the object let me show you
first
let's open this little cool
okay I have to scan this
okay
I don't know why it's taking some time
to note okay as you can see now what
document that write is doing is this is
the document this white area where you
write all your HTML CSS code and it's
get executed by the browser everything
inside this white space is the document
and the command is simple enough to
understand javascript is doing document
dot write that means javascript is
telling the browser to write on this
white space and what to write hello
world so this was our hello world
program for the JavaScript you don't
need any specifications for the
JavaScript to write you just need a text
editor I'm using sublime text
there are many text editors in the
market like notepad plus plus or if your
Mac or Linux there are other
alternatives but I guess the plan
sublime text is really cool and I'll
recommend sublime text to you do I also
have notepad plus plus install because I
need it for some C or C++ school but
sublime text is best for the web
development okay so why JavaScript is
used in HTML you can do the layout of
the web page that means you can make a
structured layout of what is visible to
the user ad takes graphics images etc
with CSS you can style that document
that means you can position the elements
add colors backgrounds and so on but
with the help of JavaScript you can
basically interact with the client-side
that means you can respond to the client
on Mouse events on click buttons on
tapping on hovering and in mobile
devices you have JavaScript events that
occur when the user slides or scroll
down and so on like that so basically
javascript is used to interact with user
on the client side and do some major
functions like transformational form
that are validation automated process
looping looping through events like that
so I guess I'll explain these events in
the upcoming tutorials and in the next
tutorial we'll be probably looking at
another object which is super global to
the document object and contains all
other events and default functions of
JavaScript so don't forget to subscribe
