your seventh bootstrap tutorial in which
we'll be learning about something called
Jumbotrons in bootstrap but before
starting with that I would like to take
up a bit of topic from that
you
I colored now let's learn how you can
create or basically how you can change
the look and feel of this to dark
colored without touching CSS obviously
so we have got another class for that
and instead of navbar default right
navbar inverse now what it would do is
it would just in word your colors too if
to fit to a darker team and as you can
see you see those right
these white spaces you see that
indicates the borders are curved so to
fix that what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
make this navigation bar fixed on the
top and to do that just right fixed top
class and well I guess this is love bar
fix top that should probably work yeah
so you see that the borders are now no
longer curved and if we had if we were
to have more content on this page then
this navigation bar would scroll with
the window and as you can guess you can
change this top to bottom as well and
you can create a bottom navigation bar
as well which would look equally good
and notice that this caret is
automatically changed to up itself you
don't need to do anything else so this
is a bottom navigation bar which is
fixed as well so it'll scroll with the
content when the content is available so
for now let's just keep it top and get
back to this tutorial
all right so Jumbotrons are basically
big boxes you can create with bootstrap
and to look at the official web page of
example of Jumbotron we see that this
thing right here this grey box is a
Jumbotron even if you can see on this
main homepage you see this thing right
here the purple one is kind of a
Jumbotron you can see so if you look at
the source then you see that it has got
a class of jumbotron so let me just pick
this up as a whole and then I'm gonna
explain how all of this is working so if
I just wrap some code right here to keep
it clean a little indentation won't hurt
all right so this is our Jumbotron core
not very much so we have God and
Jumbotron and then we have got a
container and as you can see that we
have got a container because this is of
a strict width if you change this
container to container fluid then what
would happen is that this text would
flow over the full width of the screen
which is obviously would not look very
nice so we can change this to match our
needs and what we can do is about Dara's
now we can change it to let's say
welcome to this website and this
description kind of area you can just
add like we self was best what do you
say
we sell world's best chocolates and let
me just check if I spell it right I
guess I did because yes I did
all right so that was embarrassing but
yes so this kind of looks we are right
now because of some you know emptiness
inside here so you can either fill it
with some dummy dummy text if you want
just like I'm doing right now
so this paragraph will be good enough
for us and there you go but I guess I
just got a line or two and that much
would be good okay so we have got a
paragraph what you can do is you can
create a slider as well here which would
kind of look more appealing to the user
if you asked me then with just a simple
message add this lawnmower button can be
changed to read about us or just about
us so this Jumbotron is ready and don't
worry if this looks ugly right now
because when we are going to create a
CSS file for this web page we are going
to edit a lot of stuff with CSS because
right now I'm just kind of creating
trying to create website with HTML most
of the HTML as long as possible so
that's all for this tutorial and yeah
this butter is created simply with just
a class of button button primary and
button LG means this is a large button
so if you exclude this I don't know what
would happen let's see you see that it
fall backs to a smaller button but we
would like to have a larger button only
so that's how it is so that's all for
this tutorial and in the next tutorial
we'll be looking at some more things to
add on this page and would be enhancing
the
vo of this page and would also be using
against the grid system of bootstrap so
