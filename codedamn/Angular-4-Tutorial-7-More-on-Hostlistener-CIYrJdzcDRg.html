Milly hood and welcome to your seventh
angular tutorial in which we're going to
go a little deep into what host listener
is and learn a little about it and it's
rubber usage right so in the last
example what we look is how to make use
a host listener to a very simple event
to even listener to your element with
directive right so what you can do
actually is you can use host listener
and the following way
now host listener would actually go
something like target and event and then
finally the arguments here arguments
here so this is the basic syntax the
proper the complete syntax for a host
listener then Stargate could only be the
global objects which is your document
and window and in most cases you just
going to make use of document ugly write
writing I guess you can make use a
window on scroll and you can make use of
like document and any other associated
even with that right so but now if I
make use of document click right so now
we are targeting every document and this
argument is optional as we see right now
so you can just omit it or you can
include it and if you include it what it
would probably look like is this event
right which obviously passes the element
which you have clicked in our case right
so now we can do element click and we
can safely say element we can a
console.log flick clement right and if
you take a look in the browser click
here you can see that we going to pretty
much click anywhere because we are
making use of document click
which is your global object right so we
are getting on all the good stuff it's
trusted true this is important that
means you have actually clicked there
down it's not programmatic click from
JavaScript right so yeah you can
probably just use this I don't know if
you are developing some application
where you require me to stop people from
automating stuff using javascript
but again actually it's useless all
right so you can just bypass this anyhow
so anyways getting back to where we were
if I remove this document now and save
this you can see that we lose our
document context now but we still do
have a directive on click setup right so
we get clicked and our mouse even right
here which includes all those properties
again which we saw in the document click
right and yes so that was all pretty
much for it and that's all for the story
--all and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
