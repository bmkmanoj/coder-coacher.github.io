lei ho and welcome to your fourth
angular 6 tutorial in which you're going
to take a look at what decorators are
and angular and basically in JavaScript
only because decorators is in stage 2
proposal for Eggman script and it would
be soon in the spec so decorators would
be the power of official standard soon
but right now since we are making use of
it in our angular project so I'm gonna
just stick to that and let's see what
decorators are
okay so in this tutorial what we're
going to cover is about decorators and
what exactly is a decorator how a
decorator is pretty much just a function
wrapping another function or a class and
then doing some sort of manipulations
with it and returning the original
function but after decorating it hmm
okay so next thing we're gonna take a
look at is how decorators make your code
easy to read and maintain which is
obvious thing that's why it's called a
decorator right so here we have our app
not component the TS and you can see
that component right here
is a decorator provided by angular so we
know that we're not gonna mess with this
component decorator but we're gonna
create our own decorator now for
decorators to work you need to set up in
your JavaScript projects you need to set
up babel separately but since we're
making use of angular angular already
contains all the configuration for that
and built baked so we do not need to
worry about that decorators will be
supported in our component files so
let's create a very small decorator
let's create a function which is just a
log function now what a decorator
receives is a target which is the target
function or class on which you're
actually working name the name of that
function or class and the descriptor
okay so let's just first of all log all
of these so we can take a look at what
all of these are right and how to make
use of a dis decorator well just go
ahead and write at the rate log just
like this component is written and in
the next line we'll write our function
so let's say this is a simple method to
just console logs
hey there simple as that right and now
if we take a look in the browser you can
see that we get this as the target name
this as the name and this as the
function
you
okay so with that being done what we can
do is that now we can start manipulating
this log method so the simplest way to
do that is to actually override the
function which is being called so you
can see that the descriptor if we take a
look they add the subject the descriptor
dot value is actually the original
function and if we modify the descriptor
dot value and return the descriptor from
this decorator what happens is that that
becomes the function which is being
called so in most cases what you want is
store the original function in a
variable right do some manipulations
with descriptor not value function which
is the function which will be finally
executed and then return the descriptor
this would be our flow right so what
we're gonna do first of all let's say
this is our original function which is
descriptor dot value right so this
original contains our original function
and what I want to do is do some
manipulations with descripted or value
so I'm going to create this as a new
function and what I'm going to say this
function function f un sitio and was hat
something like this and ignore the typos
and what we have in here is that now
this function is overridden overwritten
with this console.log statement and what
we can do is just return this descriptor
now so what happens now when we call
this method so let's see if I call this
dot a simple method here inside my
constructor take a look in the browser
you can see that I get this function was
hacked instead of getting a their call
so you can see I'm calling this function
when I call this function this decorator
kicks in tries to modify something but
instead of modifying we just overwrite
the function definition itself right so
if instead of doing this if I do
something like original right
and see here you can see that we get hey
there and hey there two times because
first time we are calling this inside
the function itself and second time we
are returning that function which is
actually being called so if you just do
something like this it should
console.log hey there just once as you
can see okay so what's the use case of
this well if we move back to our
PowerPoint actually so we saw that what
exactly is a decorator it just helps you
to wrap some code a function or a class
instead another function which that's
some useful stuff and returns the
original one we're going to take a look
at an example soon now how it just wraps
the code and makes code easier to read
and maintain you can see that if you
create a particular log function here
which logs all the arguments under it
the result of this function then you can
pretty much just use this decorator
anywhere so let's just quickly create
this function sounds like a good idea so
if I do something like this krypter dot
value is a function with arguments past
I don't know what arguments were passed
so I'm going to say that my result of
this function is the original function
and I just want to pass in the arguments
here inside original function
and what I want to do is once I get that
I just want to say that console.log
arguments were passed and this function
right and actually let's just do
something like this so that we actually
run this function inside the context of
that function itself and the second
argument we can specify the arguments as
an array so we want to log the statement
arguments were passed in this function I
can just console.log the result of the
function is and then we can just go
ahead and type result here all right
looks fine looks fine let's just see and
we can do in here is that you can say
something like a simple method a which
just squares this
I can see console.log this does simple
method a and five
we can just see here this statement was
generated by the constructor okay
everything looks good let's just see how
this looks like so we can just comment
this out
reload I can see that we get arguments v
or past which is actually the number we
passed right so this is an array of
elements which is passed so we are using
the structuring of the argument so if I
do something like a and B right here and
if I do like 5 and 2
something like this and if I save this
you can see that I get the output as
argument five and two were passed in
this function the result of the function
is not a number
okay so sort of the function is not a
number
oh okay so we are missing an apply
function call here well that was stupid
but anyways so when we apply this now we
are using this value of this function
you're binding the original functions
this to this and then you're passing the
arguments which we received so you can
see that the result of the function now
is 10 statement in which by the
constructor is still undefined because
we are not returning the result from our
descriptor updated function right so
remember that once we change this
function what executes when we call this
thing is this function right here and
not the original function right so this
function makes use of the properties of
original function but remember that this
function is the one which is executed
the scripted or value execute story
function restores the result and then
console.log said okay so
what we have in here is the types of
decorators now right now the our script
just supports two types of decorators
over class decorators and member
decorators so we have been doing so far
is an example of a member decorator so
you can see that I wrote a decorator
here and a function just under it and
also a point that your decorator should
be followed immediately by the class or
the function you're writing so you
cannot have difference like function a
between that it would not work you can
see that we get an error which says that
decorators are not valid here so make
sure your decorator is just above your
class or function or which you want to
apply it so once you're done with this
you can see that this is an example of a
member decorator for plastic readers
what we have is we can apply this
decorator directly to the class itself
as well and you can apply multiple
decorators as well so so we need to make
some changes to our log function and
let's just make some let's just get rid
of all of that and replace this as the
class name
right so knife a console.log
this.classname and it's safe and remove
this decorator from here and take a look
in the browser we see that we get
actually if we get a function because
basically classes and JavaScript is just
a syntactic sugar for functional
prototype inheritance so yeah that makes
sense this is a function whose app
component and contains the body for
constructor right so what we want to do
is actually mess around with this class
now so we can do is we can now return a
function which has its or arguments and
what this function is that we can first
of all is to see arguments passed to
this class class constructor
are
and then the arguments and then we can
actually just return the initialization
of the class itself so you're gonna say
a new class name and the arguments we
have in here now obviously I just don't
want to use this decorator with this
class what we can do is actually create
our own class right here a little one I
can say class my example class right and
I can say something like if you take a
look okay
you
let's just continue if I see something
like constructor r1 r2 console dot log
received
or let's a constructor fired here
and now if I do something like bounced
my classes new example class and five
and ten in here
okay so the core looks fine but it says
that it's unable to resolve the
signature of flowers decorate row when
gold is an expression hmm let's see in
the browser what we have argument pass
to this class constructor add two five
ten this looks fine constructor fired
looks fine the statement was rated is
fine but I'm not sure why the line'
turist throwing this warning or error or
whatever this is unable to resolve
signature of class decorator wind call
as an expression
okay I am not really sure
I'll check this and would get back to
you in the next tutorial if I get to
know why this warning is being thrown
because our code is working fine and
essentially what's that's what really
matters but I'm not sure why this is
destroying some sort of warning that's
usually I guess related to a tightrope
or something so anyways so this is how
pretty much decorate a class plate so
now you can see that when I called this
my class what we get is an argument pass
to this class constructor are five ten
on shorter fire and basically yeah we
are just returning the class after doing
some logging with it so you can
essentially relate with the angular
counterpart that this component fires
before this class is exported right and
then this selector then this component
decorator does a lot of things like it
will replace the HTML let's say the
render function of this class with the
HTML contents by getting the HTML out of
this file it will add some styles to
this class class HTML with the style
URLs property it would add all of that
to the selector inside the dorm so you
can see that it makes your life much
easier you do not have to explicitly
write everything every time in every
component so that is essentially how
decorator's who work with javascript
mainly and with angular as well in our
case and yeah that's all for this one
