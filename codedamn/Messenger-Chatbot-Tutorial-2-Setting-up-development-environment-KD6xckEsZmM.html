Miho welcome to your second chat bot
development tutorial in which I'm going
to show you how to pretty much set up
everything required to develop your
first chat bot right so let's get
started well what happens is that when
you develop an app right here with
Facebook you need enough for technically
everything you do with a Facebook API is
or something so if I create a new app
right and I go with basic setup
I need my app to be like cold damn Chad
bot and my email address to be like that
and if I just go ahead with
communication as the category and do I
check all the wristwatches summit and a
wait and I wait and wait okay so now if
I go ahead and get started with my
messenger right and I go ahead and set
up a web hook now what happens is that
this callback URL now what the heck this
callback URL actually is this is the URL
which on which Facebook would send
everything related to the messages
people are sending to your chat board
right so you have to interact with your
people the people with your messaging
you or actually you want to message them
in return
using this URL right so it is a kind of
a you know it's not a bridge but
actually Facebook is a bridge but it's
the other side of the bridge right so
this URL is HTTPS right so you need to
have an HTTPS URL otherwise it would
probably not work right and all
so you cannot have localhost here right
so Facebook needs a genuine real online
babe URL so what happens is that either
you can buy an HTTPS certificate and set
it up with your website or actually if
you don't have any website at all then
purchase one or whatever you want to do
or you can go ahead with some cloud
platforms like Heroku is the one so it's
free and you can just create a free
account here and it just allows you to
develop in your languages like it
supports node Ruby PHP and a bunch of
other languages as well so just create a
new app just leave the app name as like
it will just automatically sign just
leave it at United States and just
create your first app so it just gives
me obscure journey as my app name and
right here so here's the magic all right
so first of all to work with Heroku well
the only purpose for Heroku is that it
just provides me a platform to push my
code to and this would be my web hook
right otherwise if you have a HTTP
website you don't need Heroku right you
can just get started without it so
anyways now first of all what you need
to do if you are using here okuu you
need to install this hero who dual dealt
because it would be really really useful
to use command line instead of just you
know doing everything with GUI right so
install Heroku toolbelt and just do it
from this website if you're on Windows
just do it like that it's similar it's
easy to install it's just
straightforward so once you are done
just open your terminal and say Heroku
login right and then enter your hero
credentials these are the same one which
will create while signing up for a free
account
and once you have done it and just show
you logged in us your email address
right so okay so the next thing is that
you need to initialize a git repository
now the reason is that you would kind of
you know work on git and you can just
push your files using the get bush just
old school stuff if you have ever used
git so what you have to do is that since
we are creating a first-time repository
so we can just directly make use of
something like this otherwise you can
just create a repository and then add it
to Heroku later on right so you can just
to get in it hit enter and it stays
initializing an empty get repository now
if I if you see we don't have anything
in here so let's just create a simple
PHP file in here and see it's not here
now what I can do is I can say get hot
dot which will just add my files to get
and then I can just commit it to be
first comment hit enter right another
files already T ready to be pushed and
then finally I can do git or actually
not right now because we don't have this
Heroku set up yet so as you can see now
I skipped the hero cou set up after in
it so what I have to do now is add an
existing git repository to Heroku the
help of this right so what I have to do
is type here okuu get remote and by the
way gate comes automatically
I guess it's pre-installed with max but
in Windows I guess I have showed a lot
of times even in node tutorials I guess
how to install git so it's pretty
straightforward actually you just have
to download get bash or something that
you
good to go if you don't want to set
environment variables otherwise it just
works with your regular command line as
well for Windows obviously so Hiroko get
remote and then a a means your
application name and in this case it's
obscure January as it has automatically
filled for me for four nine one four
right and hit enter and okay I guess oh
I'm making use of kind of scope
resolution operator kind of stuff so
just we do have this one here okay so I
can see that it set the remote to this
URL and it essentially means that
instead of the CRL now we can make use
of just hero who to you know add or push
our files to the 0qu URL repository it's
similar to what we do in github if you
have ever used it so finally as you can
see we have index and it is already
ready to be pushed so I can do get push
here okuu and then finally it's on
master branch right and hit enter right
and I guess I should have added at least
one line so that we could have actually
see we actually see what is happening so
we can just do that right now so you can
just make use of any text editor or
something like that right and then again
I'm just gonna do get a dot and get
comet second comet and then just get
push Heroku and then master right so
it's just pushing to our source
as you can see it just detected the PHP
application as well right so now what
happens is that if I go to my app you
can see that HelloWorld is here right
lends HTTP so you know it's essentially
just loading index dot PHP right so if I
just name it a bi or a bi dot PHP or
something
so just lower it just load that so that
is how pretty much how you set up your
index dot PHP file on Heroku and
actually we didn't see a lot and this
tutorial regarding our chat board but
what goes here is this URL right let's
crawl back URL so we just edit this sort
of code which we wrote here in PHP to
create a kind of working chat bot
condition so yeah so that's all pretty
much for this tutorial and in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
set up your Facebook app to work with a
chat bot right so that is all for this
one and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
