Minho and welcome to your 31st angular 6
tutorial in which we're going to take
the look at what the heck
actually Redux is so let's get started
so first things first what is actually
Redux so if you are someone who has
never seen Redux or maybe you have heard
about where the actual like I have seen
with ducks are working with react or
something but it's used to work with
some sort of data I don't know what
exactly it is so yeah what it is well
Redux is if you're seeing it for the
first time you can think of it as person
who is in charge of managing the data
flow in your application so Redux
simplifies Gowans
manages how your state of your
application how the data in your
application is flowing from one view to
another or actually how views are anyway
requesting the data from the Redux
store so how is data stored without
Redax
well you know that typescript in that
typescript classes we store the data
like here's our code you can see that
right here if we take a look inside our
app component you can see that we are
storing the data right here and then we
write the logic here somewhere here
right so that is how basically
typescript stores you store the data
without Redux so this is the typical
standard way of storing the data then
why do we need Redux in the first place
well you don't if you are if you can
work without Redux and without beating
your head to the wall you probably don't
need redux
Redux if you add Redux to simple
applications would only complicate them
and this is a tried-and-true thing so
you do not need redux as long as you do
not feel to use something which
simplifies your data flow
all right relax usage now let's answer
first why would you need redux in such
an application if you have been
following this web series all along then
you know that we had developed login and
registration app and what I missed in
that application is a header now let's
just say we had header in that
application which displayed links like
welcome user whatever the name is and
sign up sign in log out and all that
buttons let's just say inside content I
had a logout button here as well now
when I click on this logout button I
want that my header should display
welcome guest or you know should remove
pretty much remove that message how do I
convey that information from my content
component to hit a component now I could
have done that if my content was a child
of header I could have just passed down
a method which I could have called from
this content to header but header is not
the parent of content
neither is content associated with
header in any way any near way obviously
there's a distinct relationship between
them you can just go to its parent and
then go to header but that's not really
the practical way to achieve that right
so in this case what we can do is
actually create a Redux store so reduc
store would sit somewhere let's just try
to troye it our Reducto would sit
somewhere right here right and what it
would do is that when you click on this
logout button here it would contact this
reduc store to update the particulars
state and then the header can get that
information from the same Reducto and
update its component so you can see that
instead of going right like this
which might in very big applications
create a lot of confusion and hard to
debug or we are going through a store
this is the store the radix store right
so similarly if inside my menu I'm
displaying something for something
different for logged in users and
something else for logged out users what
I can do is once I click or let's say
logged logout button here now I can
update this store here the store this is
the store same store through which
content fetches its details so it gets
updated as well and the menu gets
updated as well so you can see that
there's a consistency there's a flow of
data when you use redux
so when to use relax I already answered
that question in the previous slide only
so when when component when needs to
access data of another component that
might be the use case of Redux when you
need to update the components data that
might also be the use case of Redux and
when you want to keep data in sync and
if you carefully read all these three
points you would notice that these
points are actually same they're not
different from one another so yeah that
is basically what why when and how of
Redux and that's all for this video and
in the next video we'll see how to
actually implement Redux with angular 6
so I'll see you then in the next video
