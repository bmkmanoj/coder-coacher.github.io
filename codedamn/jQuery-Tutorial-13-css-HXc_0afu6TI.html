your 13 jQuery tutorial and this
tutorial will be looking at the event
handler CSS now the CSS event handler
allows your jQuery code to set read or
modify or element CSS so how do we use
that
I'll show you now next great a div ID
with CSS
it's a platinum styles to it some inline
Styles background red color we know need
color with 100 400 pixels high 200 pixel
Bob shadow at 0:00 0:10 pixel black and
I hope you are familiar with the CSS
properties because we'll be using them a
lot in the jQuery series so let's move
forward and accept opacity to 0.5 okay
so now we have some CSS applied to this
and now let's retrieve the CSS down here
so instead of typing everything let's do
it in the square I called a kind of loop
down here
with setting the CSS properties and this
would be the array we would fill this
would whatever properties we want to
retrieve for example I would like to
have the background with
then we have the height then we have the
walk shadow make sure you put the names
exactly you do in the CSS because the
CSS even method in jQuery would accept
the exact same CSS names as you have put
down here for styling the element so
let's go ahead and use for I equals 0 is
less than CSS properties dot length I
plus plus
okay so we have but CSS is very variable
X which would store the particular CSS
value CSS and we'll say CSS properties I
now let's console log X this stuff is
CSS properties
basically X so what we are doing here is
and we'd go with CSS properties I down
here sorry about that
so what we are doing here is in the
first group what would happen that CSS
this X would be CSS demo'd of CSS
background now we would have read or
basically the RGB value of this red
color and this variable X will consume
log the background of this div is the
RGB value of red and let's see what
happens
here we have a browser let's refresh
this and we are qualitative and we have
caught all these properties listed so
let's see diagonal of the stiff
there's RGB and we have this thing down
here I'll explain what this means then
we have width of this device 100 pixel
height of the stove as 100 pixels then
Bob shadows this div is this much and
you should know that colors are
automatically converted into RGB values
when you are printing them so opacity of
the stave is 0.5 and you can cross-check
with all these values so about this long
string down here what does that mean is
in CSS if you know then using Berger on
we could apply a color as well a URL a
image of background as well and a kind
of gradient or linear gradient as well
so to retrieve the color only add just
not using this value because we don't
need the string to retrieve only this
color what we'll do is we'll retrieve
background color instead of background
so that's how you set a background color
in your CSS and that's how it will
retrieve this color in the jQuery so
let's refresh this and now we get
background color on this div is this RGB
value which stands for a red color
so this was a tutorial on setting our
basically getting the CSS values of the
element and similarly we could do we
could basically set the CSS value of an
element as well so do lets you take an
example let's basically remove this line
so let's say I want to modify
the background color of this diff so
I'll supply background because that's
what we are using down here and the
second argument and supplied the value
I'm using to replace with the original
value so let's see let's refresh this
and as you can see the color is
immediately changed to yellow in the
door so the first argument would be the
property you want to modify of CSS
element this second argument would be
the value you want to assign to that
property so this is how you set a value
do an element element CSS basically this
was a tutorial upon setting and getting
CSS values and I'll see you then in the
next tutorial we'll be discussing some
more awesome stuff about jQuery in the
next tutorial and don't forget to
