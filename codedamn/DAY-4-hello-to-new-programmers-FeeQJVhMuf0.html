Mabel and welcome to your day 4 of
making goat dam and in this video I'm
gonna show you what essentially the
community has contributed on the fourth
day and what I have done to the website
so let's get started alright so today
was not so active day for from the
community side so we still have that one
pull request only which I did not merge
so let's see what he says
on this ok
huh that's right actually I was thinking
about it
so he says correct
he should be actually in the environment
but right now since I am actually
developing the key ok so um it reviewed
this okay that's right
just in case config hold is not present
it's always nice to see people
cooperating and working with each other
so
actually they are correct but what I
wanted was to tape up the platform first
and then move these stuff too it's okay
I believe I can kind of take a look at
this so he has updated the readme file
he has created config folder with
environment variables defaults
development production
we just stood updated the register of
tes okay we are gonna I believe you're
gonna have some merge conflicts there
because I have made changes to all of
these files as well cookie secret
can't fake montiel is added convict OTS
is created okay
looks fine to me I guess we can just go
ahead and merge this without actually
maybe find the code I believe it would
work and if it doesn't it's not very
major change so yeah I guess so we
should be able to just go ahead and
leave a message to both of these guys
first let me just see how possible it is
and the message like yes I believe yes I
hear that you should not be stored in a
file but I hope to make this change
later on after developing side of it but
since you have already sent this PR
let's do it right now okay so let's go
ahead and March the pull request oh so
it merged smoothly okay that's great so
that's all for the pull request and for
the issues right now you can see that I
have opened just one panel design so
obviously I want to have some sort of
design some sort of UI for the panel I'm
not really that good with the UI's I'm
not a designer I'm a developer so let me
know if you're a designer and post some
designs or UI examples links which I can
take a look or maybe just send a PR that
will be actually great so the code for
panel is up it's
ugly right now if you see this is it so
that's the thing but what actually I
want to show you is that what I've done
today screwed something were named hello
so what this is is if I just log out let
me just try to create another account
here let's just say my user name is
Mabel past email ids Mabel password this
may and it's Mabel as well I'm on the
back and I have not enabled validation I
mean I'm just returning true from the
validation function so it will register
me anyway otherwise this sort of this
sort of registration is not valid this
this is invalid the password is too
small the user name is and I believe but
it's okay so obviously this is one thing
to fix as well the registration shows
just the raw JSON instead of
nice-looking response say when I log in
with the maple maple hit sign in you see
that instead of getting to the panel we
get to the hello and actually we cannot
go to the panel unless we complete this
hello thing because first time users
have to go through this hello thing so
right now I just have a couple of
questions which is just for testing of
this thing so let's say have that have
you ever done programming for our
probably answer yes you would probably
answer yes but somebody who's extremely
new to programming and all that stuff
I'm not sure maybe your grandfather or a
father or anybody who wants to get into
a little bit of programming start with
the programming or maybe some child aged
11 12 who wants to learn about
programming would probably go with no
and I click on next so right now it
disappears whenever there if you click
on no as well so that's the thing to fix
so you can see that it's kind of broken
right now you need to arrange and it
we're gonna lay out to choose some of
the languages which interests you this
is JavaScript I believe so you can go
ahead and select some languages and
Python obviously so next and that's all
we need to know let's get started
let's go and now I'm in the panel and on
the back end if you take a look we see
that a new object is created you see
that first time it's false and I believe
I guess I'm not updated the schema for
Mongoose which should actually show the
tags here the tags of the user should be
added for example I selected JavaScript
PHP Python and all that stuff so that
should be visible here so that's
essentially it for this day and I expect
to see some more pull requests and good
stuff from you guys come on guys let's
do it
so that's all for this day and I'll see
you then in day 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
