Mei hole and welcome to your third
tutorial for es6
in which i'm going to go real quick on
what template literal star in es6 and
this is one of my favorite part of es6
is that is that it brings template
reference to the javascript finally and
what this allows us is actually include
all the variables and new lines and tabs
and all that stuff into a one single
string without even actually closing the
outer I don't know we call it back text
right so what you can do essentially now
is that it was not possible to do
something like you are my message is say
there this would not work right you can
even see from the syntax it's broken but
what es6 allows us is that if you take a
close look and replace this single or
double quotes with backticks
you can see then the syntax changes and
looks like it would work now if i write
my message it is pretty much the same
thing the same thing we would do with a
bath take but with something like world
my message - something like this right
which is essentially just escaping the
newline character right so now it might
look a little bit you know not so
important to you because we're just
doing it for a very simple example but
essentially this provides a lot of
readability in code and they're kind of
bug free as well if you by chance missed
any code it drives you nuts to find out
where it was right for especially for
long strengths so what we can do another
thing we can do is that we can create
something like a hey let's just say age
is 18 and the same name is go down well
that's kind of weird go down as already
so we're going to say for email
something like hello and then what we're
going to do is make use of this dollar
and the yeah and the variable name
inside that right so what this will
essentially do is it would just split
out the variable value whenever we have
inside this name Mabel right now so
we're going to state a Meho and thank
you for joining our side you are
eligible as you were above and then we
can say age something like that and then
we go and hit enter so if I write email
now it looks pretty sweet
okay in hello Mabel thank you for
joining our side and blah blah blah so
what we would do without the string
literals is something like this again it
stops looking ugly to me right now
so we're going to do something like this
and then we're going to escape strength
and then we again gonna do something
like this so it kind of is hard to
manage even right now because if you
somehow power this then your code will
break if you forward somehow this plus
then your goal would break and all that
stuff with es6 template literals
it's kind of very easy to write stuff
inside it and you can just let out the
variables as well spit out rather not
split but yeah so you again any sort of
JavaScript can go into this course so
you can pretty much do something like a
work email or you know anything like
message three is something like Hello
then inside these dollar and these curly
braces any sort of JavaScript you know
any function any method anything you
want to call you can just go ahead and
do that so yeah that's pretty much how
template literals would work in es6 and
yeah that's all for this one and if you
liked it then please don't forget to
subscribe and thank
we're watching I'll see you then in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
