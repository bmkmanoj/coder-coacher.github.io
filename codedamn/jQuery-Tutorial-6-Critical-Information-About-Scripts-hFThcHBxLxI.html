sixth jQuery tutorial let me know in the
comments section if my voice is audible
to you now because I've been getting
some suggestions by some users that I'm
not audible in most of my videos so just
let me know if the voice level is now
okay so let's start with this tutorial
and what we'll be doing in this tutorial
is will be learning about some
information about scripts now basically
I made this tutorial because on the
internet I see a lot of confusion among
people that the difference between
basically in inlined
internal and external the execution of
the rough scripts and all that
information about script execution in
the browser so to start with let's learn
with different types of scripts so first
of all down here we are including a
jquery file so we are giving it a URL or
kind of a path for the browser the
browser down here to locate this file
and currently the path is something like
this this URL suppose if i download this
file and place it down here in this
jquery folder i can actually give this a
normal path like script SRC jquery dot
dot J's if this file is present down
here with this folder so this type of
script inclusion is called external
scripts now by that what I mean is let's
view this URL
now if you open this then you'll get a
lot of J JavaScript code but it's not
actually bounded in script tags opening
and closing script tags as you can see
the JavaScript directly starts from here
and all the way down to this line and
it's not bounded in any script tags so
while linking with external script tags
we do not include any script opening or
closing script tags in the file so if I
do like let's say if I create my own
script file script SRC scripted cheers I
store
it down here in the same folder and I do
alert then it would work because we
don't need any script tag down here for
this child script do work and the reason
because that is first of all we are
including it with a script tag already
next thing we have a dot J's extension
which already stands for a JavaScript
file especially a JavaScript file so
this would give us an alert on the
browser okay so the next thing is
internal scripts now about internal
scripts what I mean is the scripts we
have been doing since last four or five
tutorials maybe the script we write
inside a opening script tag and a
closing script tag so everything we do
everything we do down here is internal
script and the difference between
external and internal is quite similar
and basically quite visible to you that
in internal scripts we have the opening
tag and the closing tag whereas an
external script we just give the path of
the script and down the script we don't
include any script or any HTML tag so
this was about internal scripting and
then we have inline scripting and what
is inline scripting for example
let's create a function in the script
Egeus I'm just doing normal JavaScript
down here my function and let's see it
would just give an alert and down here
in the body let's add body onload body
onload my function so this down here
this onload all load event attribute
acts like a internal JavaScript so
basically this thing right here is
internal JavaScript so internal
javascript is actually directly given to
the HTML tags so I guess the difference
is clear external javascript are loaded
with the path or a file URL or anything
and no HTML tags or basically no script
tags are included in external file then
we have inline JavaScript which are
given inside script tag opening script
tag and a closing script tag and then we
have sorry this is internal JavaScript
and then we have inline JavaScript which
is given in the tags of the HTML
directly so one thing to notice is that
that in this case down here you cannot
use the script tag as a internal script
so basically this won't work
this thing down here won't work once you
have given SRC to a script tag then you
have to use another script tag to write
your JavaScript code the next thing I
want to talk about you guys is talk with
you is that the order of execution now
you must remember this thing that unless
you specify some keywords known as
Zephyr or async nourished then your and
I'll explain these to give words in my
next tutorial but for now just remember
that in most of the ideal cases these
scripts are executed from top to bottom
that means the first script would be
executed first would be downloaded by
and executed by the browser first then
the second then the third and so on so
basically if your script is down here
let's say if it's using a document dot
ready function let's say we are just
doing an alert ready let's say we are
calling it after jQuery so we have the
jQuery or the dollar variable as I told
you and my previous tutorials available
to us but if we call this above this so
basically what happens is browser will
firstly render this script and then
we'll download the script and browser
will say to describe that I don't have
this Jake very variable so it would log
an error in the console which would say
undefined variable dollar or jQuery or
whatever you are using in down here yeah
as you can see dollars not defined
because we are calling the script above
jQuery and since the script is executed
and passed by the browser before the
checker is downloaded to the browser
therefore the browser says that this
variable dollar down here which actually
means jQuery is not defined
so that's these were some basics of
JavaScript actually they are not
belonging to check where they do not
belong to jQuery but I made this
tutorial because I've been seeing on
various places on internet that there's
a lot of confusion about these two
topics basically if the types of scripts
are the execution order so I hope I'm
clear with this concept and in the
upcoming tutorial we'll be doing some
hands-on coding with jQuery so stay
tuned with me and keep watching and
