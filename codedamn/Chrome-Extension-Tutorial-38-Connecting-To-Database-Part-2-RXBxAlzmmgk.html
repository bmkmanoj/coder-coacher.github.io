Google Chrome extension development
tutorial I'm a whole ad and this
tutorial will be continuing with our
application which we started in the last
tutorial and that is to send your data
to somewhere with a Chrome extension and
precisely storing it in a database so
the last tutorial what we did is we just
created a simple database with MySQL and
with PHP myadmin now let's just program
the extension first and we'll take care
of the backend later on
so this is our manifesto JSON how this
would look so this is the name
description' you already know that
browser action you know everything you
know so yeah so we need this localhost
permission to access a script which will
be placing you should be sending our
data to and with our extension obviously
let's just create our pop-up dot HTML
titles not required
Harden's head body let me just quickly
create a form now we have a couple of
options we can either just create some
input boxes here and with Jack's we can
send that on the back end or you can
directly make use of form action if you
want it's up to you now the form action
approach is a little bit easier to
implement than the Ajax one but the
attacks one would look good now I hope
you guys have enough knowledge to
implement the ajax one yourself so i'm
gonna skip that and this so that you
guys can't implement that yourself so
I'm just gonna say localhost this would
be our application name let's just say
DB 1 squared dot PHP this file is just
to create it's not there
method should obviously be post now
inside here is discrete input type text'
name name and placeholder your name and
an input type text' name email
placeholder your email
okay so I'll just go break break here
and this is our skeleton file how this
would look so let's just set this up in
the browser okay I guess this is the one
and this one is getting started so let's
just disable that for the while okay so
we have these two input boxes and I
guess we are missing the submit button
input' type submit' value go now we can
just reload this extension we can just
do a little bit of styling as well if
you like and we can say input type text
and input type just text okay and there
should be pairing of three pixels
whatever you like March 5
text-align:center fontsize then Dean and
what else
I guess that much is good for the text 1
I'm just gonna place that here only and
for the summit one
does the same the background is black
the color is white the border is zero
padding is 10 pixels 5 pixels
display:block margin:0 auto ok that's a
simple application you see right there
we could just create an h1 and tree are
details to download free ebook okay and
I guess h1 would look way too big so
let's just drop that to h3 ok so it's
just reload and there you go
so this is kind of our simple form we
have got here and what we want to do is
we'll first of all get these details
from user and when the user will press
corps we want to send these details
somehow to test database and this foot
store these email ids and name
automatically here ok so first things
first start to a JavaScript script legit
I guess we already have that file let's
just get rid of that
all right so now we need to oh I guess I
missed something okay so we already have
this farm set up we don't need the
script we would need the script if we
were doing a Jax but since we are
directly sending this data to the
localhost therefore we don't need
scripts so I guess I can skip the scope
section right here so we don't need any
scripts because we are directly sending
the data to the script dot PHP file with
form attribute so that's it for this
tutorial and the next tutorial I'll be
starting with the PHP stuff and we'll be
seeing how to set up everything else so
till then don't forget to subscribe and
thank you for watching I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
