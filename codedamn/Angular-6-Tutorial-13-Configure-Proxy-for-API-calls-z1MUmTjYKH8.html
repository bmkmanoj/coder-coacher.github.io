Mabel and welcome to your thirteen
angular 6 tutorial and which we're going
to discuss about a little problem we
faced in the last tutorial and how to
fix that so let's get started alright so
if you followed my last tutorial
what we had was that we were fetching
some data from one endpoint and
displaying it on the screen that data
was JSON but the problem was that at
first one we had a problem that it
showed us some error related to cost
which is cross-origin resource sharing
so what that means is that course is a
standard set of implementations which
just determines how you can power your
JavaScript or your front-end can access
other servers good right so again I'll
just send an ajax request to anywhere on
the internet and get data that this is a
security implementation by browsers so
for development purposes what we need is
that we need a smooth way of integration
of our API with the angular server so
what happens is that angular runs on its
own server and our API calls like
checking for correct details of login
and creating some recalls on database
and all that stuff would happen on some
other server for the development part ad
production obviously angular is just
front-end so you can just merge your API
server with angular front-end and you
would be good to go but for development
what you want is we need to proxy our
requests from angular server to our
remote server
right so how do we do that well first of
all what I'm going to do is change this
from localhost one two three four
something like API and then file or PHP
let's say something like that now what
you're going to do is just take a quick
look here that angular runs on port
photos usual makes an API call
direct to
API server this is working tree for
right now what happens is that after
toxifying disconnection we would make
API call to slash API slash something
and this would actually wetback would
handle if so we would handle this and
put forward it will proxy this request
to our remote server so behind the
scenes what happens is that we are
actually making a request to the server
only but on the front end part so the
browser's are happy we are actually
making requests to the same domain so
that's how it pretty much works so you
actually set this up what we need to do
is actually create inside our and
actually I've already done that I guess
package tour JSON you can see that we
need to set up this ng this start script
to ng serve proxy config and your props
you can pick that JSON file now we need
to create this proxy contact or JSON
file here so I'm just going to create a
proxy from fake purchase yes now should
be
Roxy got big JSON
just like that and now this would be a
JSON object and let's just say I want my
API endpoints to be blocks if I'd to say
target is localhost point three four and
there are a bunch of properties you can
search them on internet plate for
example it's not secure and then you
have there's also one change or region
true and you can just set your log level
as well and all that stuff
so once you do that what we have now is
inside terminal if I write and be and
start get into and you can see that my
local server is actually up so
what we have here is that it runs from
our proxy config file and it's just
building the project for us
now if you reload this
we can see that we get a 404 on our
photos your call of a bi file or PHP now
this is because whatever you write
inside your proxy config right here
right here this would be appended to
your target URL so as a quick fix what
we can do is inside takes test panic
tree then create a folder API in which
we can place this file
now what we have is a fee reload this
you can see that we get our data now
what's happening here exactly is that we
are requesting local host for the users
or api file or PHP which is the same
domain when the taxis that we have
something like AP and and something in
front of it it proxies this request to
this target which we have by appending
API and whatever it their world in front
of it to this URL it gets the response
back and it sends back to us so this is
how pretty much we are gonna proxifier
some requests like these and yeah that's
pretty much it for this tutorial I guess
and once we have our proxy set up now we
can create all our PHP files in here and
just request them wire this API endpoint
and we should be good to go so that's
all for this one and if you liked it
