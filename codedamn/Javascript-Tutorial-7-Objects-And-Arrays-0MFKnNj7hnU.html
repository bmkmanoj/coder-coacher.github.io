seventh JavaScript tutorial in this
lesson we'll be learning about our base
and objects in JavaScript now arrays and
objects in JavaScript are very important
concept in JavaScript this is because in
JavaScript technically everything is an
object even arrays are special kinds of
objects everything could be made into
objects like your strings numbers
boolean arrays everything is object
except the primitive values so to begin
with let's start with arrays now what
are arrays arrays are simply the place
containers holders which could be used
to store more than one similar values
when stands we can create an array in
JavaScript with the help of variable
array name and within the square angular
brackets square brackets sorry we can
supply the values for the array when
stands we created an array name the
value one two three four five six and we
can access the values with the help of
index
now if we try to alert this then it
would return as one in the browser
as you can see
the next thing
is that in Aries in JavaScript the
indexing starts from zero not in
JavaScript
technically in every language the
indexing starts with zero that means at
the zero index the first value is stored
and the first is the second value and
second is the third value and the third
is the fourth value and so on next we
created another array
re2 with the value six five four three
two one
and supposingly we want to merge these
two areas within each other so what
we'll do is we'll create another final
array and we'll do
Aaron name.com cat
attitude now what's happening here is in
the final area we are storing the concat
version of our game i'm kyra do what it
does is the final array these two will
merge that means the final error would
be one two three four five six and six
five four three two one
let's view the console
as you can see one two three four five
six and six five four three two one
okay now let's create an array named
programming languages
see
then comes C++
job
my turn
we'll be like that supposingly we want
to sort this array
then what we'll do is we'll type the
name of the array and we'll assign it a
method salty now the sort method what
really does it
it would solve these areas on this array
on the basis of the names coming first
in the dictionary to the last key
console dot lockers
refresh it
oh I guess I'll get to the started
alright let's write Java here again
and then we refresh it as you can see C
C++ Java Java PHP Python and Ruby this
sorts the array but the problem arises
with integers for instance let's say you
created an array with numbers as 3,300
then 2066 32 57 104 zero and what you
say 512 now when we try to sort this
array it is expected like 20 30 and 32
57 Oh
maybe start to 10 you know what I'm
trying to say but when we see the
console results it says 10 10 40 20 3332
which is absolutely wrong now what is
happening in JavaScript this sort method
the spot method considered the array has
strength string literals and then it
sorts the array according to the
indexing of the integers even the
integers are considered as strings in
the sort method of array this odd method
now what's happened is this sort that
considers the array like this
accordingly it sorts the array now
according to sort method now the first
number should be 10 because 1 is the
lowest here then the next number 0 0 is
greater then we don't have any number
hence this number should become next
then the third number should be 20
because 2 is the greater than 1 then the
port number should be 30 and so on now
to solve this problem we can create our
own sort function which accepts the two
values supplied by the sort method and
then return the difference of those
lights or array
I will simply return a minus B and the
sword
let me just move towards here
and let's create a function once more
start array a B and it returns the
difference of these two
okay in the salt parentheses we supply
our array name
now what's happened here is when sword
gets this array it passes too fast to
values or the consecutive values to our
function our function accept these
values and integers and returns their
difference now what happens is in the
first one short supply is 30 and 300 to
our function name our function returns
50 minus 300 that is negative of 270 now
negative here means that the second
value supplied by the sword is greater
than the first value so Sadhna is now
knows that 300 is greater than 30
similarly it runs the check multiple
times with our help of our short
function and accordingly arranges the
array now if you view this function in
the console log now then you should see
a nice and sorted array like this if you
want to sort the array in descending
order then we could do B minus 8 simple
then it would show sort the array in the
descending order
next thing supposingly
you want to modify this array and add
another value at the end of the array
now what would you do is you would do
num num
is equals to the number you want to
supply
simple isn't it
directly console dot log
thank you fish it you can see that the
values I've got the last now what
happens here is not length non am NOT
less dot length is the property of every
array which returns the number of
integers or kind of number of elements
in an array fit to an alert or
nonetheless it returns night you can see
one two three four five six the thing to
be noted here is length returns
mathematical values and it does not
start with zero it starts with one that
is we get the value thirty from this
array by using num square brackets and
zero but the length of only this array
would be one and not zero actually
because num dot length would be always
greater than one the number of index of
RS in every array so this is simply like
Lum dot nine we have zero one two three
four five six seven eight
at the ninth position we can add this
value so we could simply use lamb dot
length and it would insert this value
for us in the array do you move the
first the first array value we could do
something like
num dot shift now what it does is it
would remove the very first element of
the array
not only integers but any re would
okay now you can see that part is
removed from this area they are starts
from 300 next if you want to add to the
first position of NRA you use the
keyword and shift and supplies
element to be added you can see hundred
is added here if you want to remove the
last element you just do a pop and back
the value is removed as you can see 512
is removed from here if you want to add
to the last value the last array you can
also use push and my method of non dot
length both are same
and you're gonna see under decided to
the last
okay so this was about arrays in brief
coming to objects now objects are very
special in JavaScript because everything
is object in JavaScript for instance if
we do like my strength is equal to
now this should return string but if we
do
then this would return
yes you guessed it right an object in
JavaScript whenever you create something
with the keyword new it is automatically
assigned an object JavaScript sorry
it is also automatically assigned as an
object in JavaScript for example if we
refresh this page and look at here then
the first console.log type of returns
the string and the second returns object
the same is with numbers if I use new
number and supplied with any number
it would return object but if I do like
this then it would return a number here
now if you remember in the beginning of
the tutorial I told you in JavaScript
you can everything is technically an
object except primitive values now what
are primitive values here is we are
assigning this value correctly we do
variable this is a primitive value the
primitive way of assigning a value
therefore it returns the type of value
Istanbul now this is an kind of
object-oriented way though javascript is
not an object-oriented language but we
use do keyword in object-oriented
languages like C++ to create new objects
new is basically used to create objects
in any language and in JavaScript you do
new keyword to create new objects
okay so coming back to objects you
create an object like followed by our
keyword your copy check name then
unlike Ares we use square brackets in RS
but in objects we use curly braces this
belongs to RS and this belongs to
objects objects are used just like RS to
store multiple values but we have some
differences on objects at Rs basically
JavaScript objects are containers for
named values called properties and
methods in JavaScript we could call
objects by their properties but in RS we
have to call the elements by their index
numbers in arrays in JavaScript we don't
have associative arrays
okay now let's create an array object
name
check one
let's create a function here
and let's write the function it would
have done
of check one oh yes make sure you put
this keyword so that you are actually
referring to this object and not on the
window google now let's console dot log
check name
function
you should see the world as expected if
you want to retrieve object one then you
okay name one hello
I'll check - and in this function we are
just combining these constraints
so this was all about objects and re and
I hope objects and re are clear the
basics are clear actually for you in the
next tutorials or in the upcoming
tutorials we'll look in more advanced
ways of objects and array and new ways
to create objects and RS with the help
of new keywords and something called
prototypes and all that interesting
stuff so stay tuned for more don't
forget don't forget to subscribe thanks
