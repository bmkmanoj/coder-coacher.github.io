a second part in advanced CSS selectors
so now in the last tutorial we learned
about only two advanced CSS selectors
which is a child selector and an
immediate child selector but let's get
the things a little bit faster and let's
see some of the more CSS selectors in
this tutorial so let's type some HDL
code Alice where the div and a closing
one for sure let's create a h2 saying
what's up buddy
our insider span let's say
I'm fine dude
and again let's create it that it's do
with
where are you these days
let's go to span again let's say
and India so let's reload this and we've
got what's up buddy I'm fine dude where
are you D simple where are you these
days
I live in India simple enough now let's
say I want to select every span in this
document which is next to h2 tag now
let's say if my document is not just
like limited to this one but there is a
full-featured web page with span used
various places so let's say I have a
span here saying convo that's bad here
as well saying next question so I just
want to target okay so we've got a
problem let's say BR so I just want a
target this answer which is the answer
to the question and I know that it's
immediately next to the question which
is an h2 tag so what I'll do is I'll
make use of something called plus sign
this plus sign and CSS not oh it should
be span actually so plus sign what it
denotes is that find h2 and immediately
to H 2 this plus sign says that
immediately next to a ch2 you should
find a span tag and since just like we
had this angular bracket for the
immediate child you have got this plus
sign for image it you can say the image
it's sibling so h2 plus span would
locate the image it's been sibling to
this edge to let's say I give it a color
of cream and now let's reload this and
now you can see that green color is
applied only to the answer of this band
do we have a span right here as well and
we have spot on the top as well but it's
only applied to the answers for your
question so this is the image shade
spanned against our after edge two so we
have our h2 then image it is spanned
then we have got again an edge to an
image it is span so
now let's say I rename this to h3 h3 so
now this style won't be applied so let's
reload this and as you can see the style
is not applied for the third question so
let's say I want to have some lenient
sibling selector and just like we select
any child inside a parent like h2 span
would select any child inside any span
child inside this edge - no matter how
descendant you have to go similarly we
have is symbol on the left of your one
key and press your shift and press that
key and you will get this wavy like
symbol which basically means select
every simply of this edge - which is a
span so now when we reload this then
these three are green but this is not
now the reason being
h2 we have got h2 and a span tag so not
expand actually we have got three span
tags so h2 the symbol denotes the symbol
denotes that select any sibling which is
adjacent to h2 and that doesn't signify
only the immediate one but any sibling
like this one or this one because these
all these are siblings so
that's how you select a sibling and
let's say if I move x2 to a new position
let's say here so now what would be a
guess whether these two would be
selected in this selector or not because
these two are still siblings but would
they be selected with the selector let's
see
now when we load this you get fine dude
next question like that now why that
because first of all we have moved h2 to
below this so this looks kind of awkward
because the answer is air and the
question is here but the main thing is
that color green or this property is not
applied to the previous siblings and
this is the most important thing you
have to remember and most of the
tutorials won't tell you this that
though you can select the next the
immediate next and the next siblings in
a jar in CSS but you do not have any
option to select previous siblings but
this what I mean is from this h2 if your
control in CSS you know is on h2
you can go to h3 and span but you cannot
go to the previous disband which is
located above this h2 so basically kind
of you can go to your small brother or
small sibling but you cannot go to your
elder sibling in CSS that's you need to
know about CSS these are the sibling
property and with this let's move on to
some other CSS selectors so let's say I
brought a drift
let's say Apgar a link saying google.com
and I say Google let's have got a link
saying the local one and I say visit my
tutorial 15a let's have got another link
saying facebook.com but three lengths to
which point outside a website out on my
website and one which is located inside
my web site so did links which point
outside my website are called external
links and this link which points inside
my website is called internal link so
let's say I want to style every external
link automatically without creating any
first like reading class ext and then
class int and all that would create a
lot of fuss because I would need to
apply a class to every link I have and I
would create in future so let's say I
want to create a kind of automatic style
applied to external links so what I'll
do is I'll take a
and xref so first of all what this what
you're doing is we are first of all
selecting every a element which has got
a ashraf so if i do like a hello world
then these styles these styles do not
apply to this element so a the square
brackets and the attribute name
signifies that this attribute should be
present in this element then only these
Styles would be applied so let's say if
I do color yellow let's reload this and
as you can see kind of not see let's
make the background black so it's
visible
growing black here we go simple enough
okay so now we have got a problem we
don't see hello world but you can see
that your links with each chef are
converted into black or sorry yellow but
not the normal a without a href
attribute so using this you could select
a href all the a attributes a tags
having H ref attribute but not anything
else so now let's take it one more level
crazier so now I want to select every a
link first of all which is called a
natural attribute and the next thing
this should have is a link where the
value has Google got
now what this mean is okay so first of
all it would say give me an A so HTML
would return all these five then it
would say give me an H ref a with all
h.res and this would return it four and
since we are supplying a value here then
it would look for the exact value and
would return you a link which has exact
value in the ED sure if you have got
google.com as exact similar to like this
so this style would only apply to
google.com right now and let's make
color white for the link so they are
visible a black background let's reload
this and now you can see this is not a
link because we have not supplied it
shift to this the rest are
white in color so
we are only applying this color yellow
to the Google one let's take it to
another level and now let's say I want
to target the links only starting with
HTTP because that would technically mean
that I'm referring to an external link
because I won't start and then tunneling
with HTTP I can simply navigate in my
website with slashes or direct paths so
let's see how we do that so we just
can't simply do like this because if you
do like this then what does that mean is
it would say select every in links with
edge ref as HTTP so this would select
every link which has only HTTP as extra
value but we want to have HTTP as the
starting keyword and I don't care what
is the next alphabet or any character so
for that what we make users we make use
of the kind of up arrow which is above
your six key and this look likes this so
this is the up arrow which is above the
six numeral key press shift and press
six then an equal stream and HTTP so it
signifies that selects all links would
start with HTTP and don't care about an
behind our anything after that so now
let's check out the browser let's reload
this and Google and Facebook get the
color as yellow because these two links
begin with HTTP okay so now let's take a
look at the end of the string type of
selector so the selector is used to mark
the starting of a string and apply some
strength to it so if we have got also a
end selector and let's have a look at
that let's say I create my side download
PDF dot PDF
download PDF
my side download doc dot HTML HTML and I
say
virus dot exe
but actually nobody gives the virus by
saying that it's a virus so that doesn't
matter but let's say I want to target
PDF HTML and wireless links are kind of
executable links differently so what
I'll do is I'll put a dollar sign
instead of that upper arrow and now it
looks like a at schref dollar no space
equals and in the value i would write
PDF so now what I am doing is I'm
selecting every a which has got an extra
value ending with a dot PDF thing so we
are selecting kind of PDF files and this
let's copy this again and write some
different values for here
but we've got HTML let's say as a
specified color to green yellow and red
so now let's check out the browser let's
reload this now you can see that PDF is
automatically Queen in color this link
automatically becomes green in color the
HTML is automatically red and your virus
file which is the exe one is
automatically yellow and it doesn't
matter how many links are with how many
different extra values we create if they
end with exe then they all would have
yellow color if they end with HTML then
they all would would have the red color
and again if they end with PDF then
again they all would have green color so
that was some of the advanced CSS
selectors we would be walking with and
okay yeah so before leaving this
tutorial learn about one more CSS
selector which is kind of very funny
type of CSS selector and sometimes place
where a useful role while you are
resetting your browser CSS so that is a
star now the star means everything so
the star
technically signifies everything
to every element so what does that mean
is if I do star let's say opacity 0.5
and I do like the next one and I create
another div inside this
and as I stand next to
now let's reload this and as you can see
now this next one is steam itself
because this opacity 0.5 is already
applied on the HTML itself then to the
body then to the dev itself so if you do
kind of math then HTML having a pasty
0.5 then body having 0.5 would
technically mean 0.25 and 0.25 would
technically mean for the div as 0.125 so
this term right here is having an
opacity of 0.125 so let's increase this
to 0.9 and we can see some results now
so now I guess it's true doc now let's
reduce it to 0.8 so now you can see that
this div this text right here is kind of
darker than this text and the reason
being this star opacity would be
inherited by every of this element in
the document so what does that mean is
this opacity 0.8 is applied on HTML head
meta title style head body div span hat
all the way to down and obviously meta
and title doesn't give a damn because
they don't have anything to show on the
document and obviously you cannot
opacity blurred this title right here
so the star would actually select every
element down here and what's the use of
the star so basically you can combine it
with the advanced CSS selector of child
which I told you in my previous tutorial
using this now you are targeting every
element inside the body and similarly
you can do like what it diff star and
this would mean that every element which
is
every day which is inside body and
select every element inside that so for
now we are the silicon span so that's
how star works and star is kind of a
wild card for CSS which would select
every element you specify and this would
work with other CSS selectors just like
this body immediate star means select
image a child's image every image a
child and like body div plus star would
select every sibling which is next dude
div so I guess this fan would also get
style with this this P would also get
style with this because now this star
doesn't give a damn what it is so it
would select anything which is next to
Dave so combine the star selector with
my previously dot advanced CSS selectors
and you would find some amazing and
interesting results so till then stay
