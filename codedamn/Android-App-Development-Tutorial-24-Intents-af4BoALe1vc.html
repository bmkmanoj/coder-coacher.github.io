your 24th android application
development tutorial my name is may hold
and in this tutorial what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna show you how to create a
way to go from one activity to another
using intense so intense are pretty much
the this is tool to allow your
application to go from one activity to
another and in between you can pass the
data among the activities as well and
receive them on the other end as well
obviously so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna create a couple of buttons on both
of these activities which would are
actually just a single button so i would
create a button on this and pointed to
this activity right and i would create
button on this and point it to this
activity so you can just play around
with those two buttons right so let's
get started so inside my main activity
which is matt launch or activity i need
to credit button so that i can actually
go to the other one so i'm gonna say
that this is I'm going to text take me
to second reactivity right and I'm just
hardships which it do relative layout so
that I can make use of Android layout
sentrin parent to be true right pan I'm
just gonna make you the same exact
layout here as look just this would be
main activity and ID of button actually
it wouldn't actually hurt to have say
Miley because these are two separate XML
and two separate java classes as well so
what I'm going to do next is I'm gonna
say four main activity button or let me
just create button button now and input
that
as buttons fine view by Heidi that I did
button easy enough then I'm going to say
set on click listener new and click last
all right so here is the place where we
would place that intense and what you
have to do exactly is right intent and
it will just automatically hold that for
you and give it a variable named let's
go say hi is new in tent right and you
have say the context of your current
application for now you could just
either write this or you can write yet
application context so that would mean
the same thing and for the second
parameter you have write the name of
that particular java file which you want
to point to and then add a class to that
file so my case this would be secondary
activity class and the reason you are
not writing Java here and actually class
is that java files are actually compiled
into classes only so you are actually
pointing to a compiled file instead of
just a binary data right here or
actually asked i should say so well we
have thus created our intent but i need
to start my activity as well so what I'm
going to do it i'm going to say start
actively and then pass in the intent
which I just square it and we are done
right so I need to do the same exact
thing for my secondary activity as well
so i'm just going to copy and paste this
just like that and we just need a button
martin is not right so we are good to go
now and pretty much let's just test our
application on the device and
let's just see it's building right now
and installing a piguet and I guess here
we go so now we have a button which
saves me take me to the main activity so
I'm just going to click this you see
okay so I guess I forgot to change that
the exploit so this should be take me to
me an activity but this one should be
take me to take me well the second
reactivities sick again three activity
right and then just do it instant run
right so now it saves me take me to
secondary activity what the heck I guess
I forgot to change the name here as well
so while copying this change that we
mean is pointing to secondary and second
reel actually pointed to its up so this
chamber you mean as well and you'll be
good to go so now if I click on this
button very awesome so now we are
getting sick and reactivity for both of
these and I guess this XML is not
getting compiled properly again so I
should probably just restart my
application why not so let's see if it
works now and take me to secondary and
take me to secondary well that is weird
because I haven't updated my main
activity but to it does not kind of
reflecting and our Java code so what
might be the reason so let me just our
install this one
and minimize this run this again and see
if there's anything which was being
cached
the
very good so now oh it's to do is sign
but it comes to life again and it's such
installing a PK now so you'd say it's me
take me to second reactivity and or the
head lets going on take me to main
activity will that not probably happen
holy so I guess I got it I mean
main activity as well I'm making use of
that single so never ever copy paste you
are hooked right there so get rid of
that second line so this is disastrous
isn't it so now let's just run that and
finally so we are on secondary to me
secondary to mean secondary main
secondary may sicken three me and you
can do this all day long but I have to
end us at oriole so that is how pretty
much you go from one activity to another
and what you can do as an assignment is
create three activities link first word
second second with third or actually
just link every activity with every
other activity right so that's all for
this tutorial and in the next tutorial
I'm just gonna show you how to pass some
data as well with the activities so if
