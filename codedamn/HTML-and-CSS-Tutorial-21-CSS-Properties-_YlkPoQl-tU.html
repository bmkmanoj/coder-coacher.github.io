21st CSS tutorial I like most HTML oh
I'm sorry yes Tina let's do it again so
welcome everyone to your very first HTML
and CSS tutorial and in this tutorial
we'll be looking at CSS properties so in
the last tutorial where we learned for
God actually yeah so in the last
tutorial we learned about classes and
ID's in HTML and now let's make use of
those and do some interesting stuff so
let's say I have a div right here lived
a class
ABC let's say I styled sentence
let's create a simple div with no class
and say
i styled the two
now down here let's first of all apply
some styles of the div so now this since
this is we are only using div then even
though this has got a class but since
technically this is also is a div so
these styles will also have add to this
div so now let's write some styles and
the main purpose of this tutorial is for
CSS properties so let's look at those
carefully so for CSS property we have
here is the color one and color would
technically set a color to everyday for
your selector you selected inside these
style tags so color could not only be
words but could also be a hexadecimal
value or your RGB values and by that
what I mean is your hexadecimal values
are from
I don't know it's from like zero zero
zero zero zero zero and from
I have no idea basically it's like yeah
so I think that they're from six zeroes
to six F but do confirm that because I
guess yeah I'm right so this is from
black white and the hexadecimal would
include all the colors in between so
let's say I want to give it a
hexadecimal value of color white so what
I'll do is I'd write a hash symbol which
detonates a detonates whoa it should be
denotes isn't it so let's do it again oh
I just did it again two times in this
tutorial so never mind let's do it again
so the hash symbol denotes an ID in your
CSS selectors but right here it says
that I am NOT a word but I am a
hexadecimal value so now we have Dave of
color white let's give a body a dark
color so that these dips are visible so
we'll just do background black
so now let's reload this and these two
devs are right okay so now let's say I
want to apply some different styles to
their stiff so what I'll do is I'll
write their dot ABC and inside curly
braces let's write my own color which I
would like to give let's say color
yellow and let's reload this and our
sentence God highlighted out so that's
how you work with glasses kind of in CSS
let's look at some of the properties
which I have got for you the next one it
was the background one which I already
explained let's take a look on the next
property which is the border one now
with the help of border you could kinda
give a border to your element so that it
stands apart from rest of the elements
so what we have syntax for border is
and I pretty much like let's say I want
to give border to this ABC what I'll do
with a right border then your unit
your type
yard color so let's replace these with
values let's say I want the border to be
two pixels thick I would like the border
to be a solid one and I would like the
color to be white so now we have a
bottle which is two pixels take solid
add white for this Dave right here
so now let's reload this and as you can
see we have got a nice little border
around it which is two pixels in
thickness it's pure white and is a solid
ball and by a solid border what I mean
is we have got a bunch of Potter's in
CSS the solid being is a straight line
then we have got a dotted dotted model
which would be kind of a dotted one as
you can see I can zoom in if you wish to
so this is a dotted border and we have
got a dashed border dashed dashed is
dashed instead of dotted it is dashed so
I hope you got the difference between
these two these three basically we have
solid dotted and - and that's how it
works so basically it is two pixel
dashed white so we can replace this with
any color you want just like what colors
are hex colors so let's reload this and
you've got a yellow border right here
and okay so let me tell you that we have
to type basically we have three types to
give colors in CSS the first one being
the word name which is like giving
yellow or red or green orange black like
that then we have the hexa decimal value
which is the hex colors and we give it
with the hash sign the color the
technical format of that color and then
we have the RGB values now what does RGB
signify is RGB
it consists of parentheses and in these
goes three values which signify the
intensity of the colors red green and
blue so in computer basically you could
make any color using different
intensities of red green and blue colors
so when you have maximum intensities of
all these colors then what you get is is
black and when you have minimum
intensities of these colors then what
you get is a white color so the values
of these arguments where is from zero
zero zero to
255 255 and 255 so go ahead and use ur
permutations and combinations to find
out how many colors we have on our
computer
so now let's cut this and paste it
instead of the value and we don't
require any hash right here because we
are using the RGB keyword and now let's
reload this and there's no change
because 255 255 and 255 signified black
color now let's make some fun with it
let's rename it to let's say 41 so now
we have red to maximum intensity blue to
maximum intensity but green is 41 us and
on the street or this and oh okay so I
am applying it to a div actually that's
what I missed out so I should apply it
basically to the body
so now let's get 41 and let's reload
this and so we have got a pink color in
the background by using 41 in the green
intensity so now let's make some more
amendments and let's say 100
2:31 and let's say 105 let's see what we
got here
I've got this 9 nice little green shade
so now there's a way to find out colors
for these hex and RGB values as well
which I'll tell you in the later
tutorials
we don't have to just hit and trial to
get our desired color also there should
be one semicolon instead of two
so coming to the next property we have
text decoration now text decoration
would actually be helpful for your kind
of underlining your text so let's say
text-decoration:underline
so let's reload this and now you can see
your text is underlined so traditionally
what we used to do is when we are
learning basic HTML we did like few tags
here and you tagged as a closing tag to
underline the text but when you are king
in HTML then you could pretty much do
anything without this tag so basically
we have recreated this function of this
you tag in CSS and we don't need it
anymore
and similarly let's take a look at
opacity in HTML now let's say this kind
of looks solid right here it's a
transparent that means you could not see
this color behind this yellow color so
what I'm doing is okay so I guess you
guys won't understand it this way so
I'll make use of a background image so
we've got an image right here which
looks like dum
it will work so to give a background
image we use this background we make use
of the keyword URL and inside the
parenthesis we supply a URL of the image
to be used as background image for now
it's image dot PNG and let's write image
not be ng right here now we have this
image as background of our page
now let's reload this well okay so yes I
have zoomed a lot so it kind of looks
like jumbled now let's say I want to
have this image but I also want in the
transparent areas to have the color
filled automatically to black and always
remember that my image right here is
transparent a bit so it's not fully
opaque like having white color right
here it's kind of transparent and you
see these check boxes because this
symbolises that this image is
transparent from these sites and what
does that mean is that you could
technically fill any color
your background CSS properties in these
transparent areas so what I'll do is add
right background black and a space and
the thing we have written earlier so
this technically means that okay so you
want a background which is black in
color but you also want a background
having URL background so this would seem
like a dump idea but when you want to
have colors as well with the image you
are using if the image is transparent
then this is the trick you need
so now let's reload this
I guess I didn't save it let's save this
now it's real of this how do we have got
a black background with these buttons
these big patterns so now so what I was
gonna teach you yes so I was teaching
you about opacity so now let's see what
Basti is an opacity pretty much makes
your elements transparent and that I
have what I mean is if I give an opacity
they've got a B C of 0.5
now opacities are given from zero point
zero which is actually zero to one point
zero which is actually one so opacity is
like zero point one would be 10%
visibility zero point two would be 20%
and all the way to hundred person would
be one so it doesn't have any unit
because 0.5 literally means 50% which
ability and let's reload this and as you
can see this sentence right here
Dems a little bit and the reason being
is the opacity property we have applied
right here to the step dot ABC so this
div dot ABC now it's gonna become
transparent as compared to the normal
day right here so that's how opacity
works that
where this you could make it use with
any other element but remember that
opacity applied on the parent would
actually be inherited by the child
itself so for example if I said I'm a
stylist intense band and I don't want to
be transparent then since we are
applying it on the parent this band
would automatically have this opacity as
0.5 so now let's reload this and as you
can see this band is not having a
opacity of 1 by default and even if you
try do have an opacity one to this then
this would not work now because this is
because the opacity applied to a B C the
C 0.1 would be kind of a new opacity to
lose the span element the chair child of
this element and it would be create
treated as one so the opacity for a div
dot ABC which is 0.5 is opacity for span
as 1 so 0.5 is being treated as 1 for
this pan down here so remember that it's
just an additional bonus tip for you
guys so now let's move ahead with some
other CSS properties and let's take a
look at text align and I guess would be
the last one for this tutorial because
it's already 16 minutes across now let's
take a look let's reload this and we're
good to go now let's make use of next
align which I was telling you so now
right here this text is aligned to the
very left of this whole day which we can
see it in the model let's remove the
opacity so it's visible again
okay so this text let me see if I want
to move this text in the center of the
div or
in the extreme right of the Deaf then
I'll make use of the property text
aligned in CSS now text align would
actually help me to align this text in
this container so let's say I gave
they've got a PC it text
aligned
Center and remember that Center is
spelled scen ter Norris the entr E
so let's reload this and we have got
this text in the center of the container
and if I resize this then this
automatically adjusts with the width and
gets the central position again itself
so I guess that's pretty much for this
tutorial because it's going along it's
only 17 on that block so I'll see you
then in the next tutorial and we'll be
continuing this CSS properties thing in
the other tutorial as well see that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
