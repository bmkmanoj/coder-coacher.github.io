hole and welcome to your fold WordPress
tutorial in which we'll be starting off
with some real coding of WordPress
themes as you can see I have opened this
my first team in my sublime text editor
and you can just open it and any editor
you like but I just prefer sublime so
here we go
and we saw that in the last video
our website looks blank for now for our
custom theme well that's not what we
want we want an awesome team so let's
start coding of off so four index dot
PHP you would require something like you
can add pretty much anything you want to
say let's just add a simple HTML page
let's just say my homepage let's just
say hello world pretty much our first
hello world with WordPress themes and go
to your website you can see that you get
hello world out of your resource it's
pretty much same as if you have written
a simple HTML document and opened it in
your favorite browser then what's the
use of WordPress well actually that
WordPress you have access to PHP so if I
just activate this 2015 theme and go to
my website you can see we get this hello
world post and if I just quit another
post let's just say this is testing my
testing not really one two three one two
three let's just publish this off on our
homepage you can see that we get to post
right now the testing 1 and the hello
world 1 so when i activate my own theme
you can see that nothing appears but a
simple hello world so what makes the
other team work like that so that is
basically the other team is querying the
database and the database is actually
this local host PHP myadmin double
be right here you can see that the
system will be post table and this table
contains this post right here this mic
testing and it is a couple of times
because I guess one of its occurrences
is sort of a draft or something is a
revision so you don't need to worry
about that very much so let's just close
and get rid of that and very much just
write some code to display our post so
here goes the PHP and the since
WordPress comes with a lot of methods
inbuilt because you know it's a
framework so it gives you a lot of
things itself before even you start
creating your own things so for example
you have a have post as a method a
function you can say which returns a
boolean value if your database the
database this one this table right here
if it contains any sort of post values
then this half post would return true so
you don't have to like do like
connection as MySQL I'll connect no not
that stuff what press would take care of
that for you so you just have access to
this direct method so you're gonna say
if half posts that means there are some
posts available for us then you can say
while half posts that pretty much means
while this is true and so you have the
post and as long as you have the post I
want to call this in the post method now
what this is doing is that pretty much
as I have told you that half post would
return you a boolean value depending
upon the if the database has some posts
or not well I didn't tell you the
complete thing it actually returns the
index
whether a post is found that that
particular index or not so for example
if your ID starts from one it would say
that half was is true if it founds a
post ad ID number one and it is false if
it doesn't found a post at ID number one
so the post would increment the ID of
the post that half post is checking so
consider it like this so when the loop
enters you have half Post as one let's
just say you two have ID number one or
post one in your database then the post
increments this particular value to two
now you don't have that so this while
loop would end up and you would just get
a nice little list of only valid post on
your website and no MySQL errors so this
door post is required and after that
pretty much we have access to anything
you want to have from the post so let's
just say you just want to display the
title so you can say echo the title this
title would be obviously associated with
the same post which this top post is
calling so let's just do a PR as well
and right here you can just reload this
and as you can see we get these two
inputs outputs as actually the testing
and hello world because our posts area
contains only these two posts with the
titles as hello world and testing now
let's just add a bit more information to
our post so that it looks relevant so
let's just say I want to have content as
well so I'm gonna say echoed the content
you can see that it's not that bad as it
might you know sound WordPress so these
functions are pretty user friendly
meaningful you don't have to just lose
your mind in MySQL connections WordPress
automatically does a lot of stuff for
you
so after this the content for example if
you want to insert like social sharing
buttons you can say like like dar post
share it on social network and this is
just a simple example then these some
sort of buttons in here and that's how
pretty much most of the people code
their websites the developers who sell
things here we go if I reload you can
see that we get testing then mic testing
not really one two three one two three
which is which was the post body of this
testing post then for the sharing button
we get liked our post and then again
welcome to WordPress this is your first
post we get hello world actually here
because there's no break in here well
you can just do something like h1 the
title then you can say very much h1
instead of B are so reload
okay so looks like the HTML doesn't like
it okay so looks like WordPress is sort
of automatically adding the P tags and
yes I know that WordPress does that so
okay so there's some sort of problem
WordPress is creating with heading tags
so instead of trying this approach what
we can do is actually just close your
PHP tag in here and just write your
simple HTML so you don't need these
quotes and you can say that PHP the
title and I guess I've pretty much found
out the reason and the reason is that
you don't need to echo the title because
that would pretty much echo itself so
that would be a better approach I guess
so just close the PHP body again and
just get rid of these quotes and only
say and actually you can just omit the
PHP word itself if you want to this
would work as well let's just get rid of
this for now and don't forget to close
your while loop so here we go you can
see that our while loop is closed but
not the if statement so here we go and
when you reload this we can see that
this shortcut is not available for my
exam so this there's the option to
availab make that thing work and this
would be in some PHP dot i and i
configuration or somewhere i would just
find that and let you know but for now
if it doesn't work then just switch it
to PHP only and I can see
that it works perfectly fine with h2
tags and pretty much you can just echo
out the content as well and here we go
reload looks really nice well before
ending this tutorial I'm gonna show you
another thing and that is actually you
can link to your post by making use of
PHP the permalink now this formal link
the permalink would fetch permalink this
one so it would fetch the same permalink
which you have right here and there
we'll just make it the title link to
that particular thing so this is my H
ref there's a closed reload and you can
just go to that particular post as well
and we don't have any file for post for
now but it still shows its best it can
do so if you just automatically create
any new post in future let's just say
this is the post and publish at your
home page would be pretty much updated
itself put it C sweet so that's how
pretty much you create a very basic web
page with WordPress and we'll be doing a
lot lot more than this but hey this is a
start and congratulations on your first
WordPress theme and I hope to see you in
future tutorials as well because they
are gonna be real fun and real awesome
to work with so if you like this video
