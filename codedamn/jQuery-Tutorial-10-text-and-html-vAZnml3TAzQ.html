your tenth jQuery tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be looking at an event
method called text now in the last
couple of tutorials are discussed in a
very fast manner about event methods in
jQuery but now from now onwards let's
take it a bit slow and steady so you can
understand what's going on so here I
have my check with library and here I
have my script so let's open the script
we have document already which waits for
the document and let's say I create a
div down here with ID my dev
let's nest it a bit so let's wait
another day of my death to let's say
and if - and out here let's say I in
live one
so let's open in this browser
now and here it is if i refresh this i
get i'm and ev1 and i'm in dev - so down
here in the script let's use variable X
to store the text inside Madoff - so
let's say the selector is my tip to ID
dot txt now what it would do is it would
the variable X would store on the text
inside this might have two so let's call
so it should be here
let's alert this let's see what happens
refresh we get alert as I am in dev -
okay so the next thing let's alert out
the text of my death
yeah Madoff so let's refresh this we get
text as I'm and f1 and I meant if - now
let's say if I do my dev dot HTML now
here's the main difference between text
and HTML and when i refresh this as you
can see I get the HTML as well inside
the
first if so basically when we are using
HTML then we are actually working with
the HTML inside the element are to be
more precise a selector but when we are
working with text then it does not
return us any HTML or any HTML code and
thus it is kind of safe to eval code
because it will not return the HTML
inserted by the user for example let's
say I create div id see this and copy me
let's create a spy inside it span ID or
justice band this is some text let's
apply some styles to it so we can see
the difference background
yellow simple as that so if i refresh
this
okay so let's remove this for now
if we reverse this as you can see we
have this text as yellow now what we'll
do is we'll create a copy of this would
insert this after this element down here
so let's do it
first of all we'll grab this element in
the selector and we'll say I see this
dot next
but first of all let's weigh the
variable X is equal to see this dot txt
or let's say text and who are HTML is
see this dot HTML now let's say will its
insert next or basically let's do after
text now what would what would this do
is it would insert this thing after this
thing so basically we are inserting the
text off see this after see this so
let's see what happens this reverse this
and as you can see we get only text
copied that means no HTML was copied
because HTML the styles were applied to
span tag which was as a result span tag
was not copied now let's do HTML and
once we replace it with HTML we get the
HTML copied and thus the span tag is
also covered so that's how text works
text method in jQuery works and this is
different from HTML one so this was a
quick tutorial on text and HTML and
we'll discuss some more event methods in
our upcoming tutorials till then stay
tuned with me and don't forget to
