last tutorial in prototype section and
finally we'll be ending this boring
series of prototypes and we'll be
starting with some cool and real news
JavaScript commands and api's like that
so to summarize this let's see what we
have learned so far from tutorial number
10 or 12 I don't remember in the
prototypes first of all what are
prototypes prototypes are the JavaScript
inherent model like prototype inherited
model with the JavaScript uses instead
of the classical inheritance model the Y
prototypal inheritance model is
different from classical inheritance
model this is because in prototypes we
don't have classes we just have objects
and instances objects and constructor
function acts like a base class for
example creating a prototype with the
base class
we just do this dot X is 100 this but Y
is 200 mr. Z this function which returns
us this dot X star just got Y and down
here we can create a new object and if
you console.log this
then it says what is the 200 star
hundred is like this the next thing is
the inheritance or one class into
another for example if we create another
base class to base class - and write
destard a is equal to 300 and this dot b
is equal to 400 we do base class dot
prototype notice that we are assigning
this base class due to the prototype
chain of base class dot just simply the
prototype is equal to new base class -
now the prototype chain inherits all the
properties of the base class - and the
methods if available now object dot a
should print out 300
this is inheritance in prototypes I'm
just going to quit because summarizing
prototypes listen if you want to learn
in detail and have took time to explain
then go ahead and go back in the list of
playlists and you'll see we have a lot
of tutorials on prototypes the next
thing what is the next thing was I guess
we created and manipulated yeah the next
thing is private variables for example
if we create soirée is equal to hundred
VAR b is equal to 200 then let's say a
and B because we do we have a variable
here so object dot a a would print out
undefined because this is not a dash to
the prototype chain and this is the
scope of this variable is local to this
constructor class for the base class dot
a a would echo out 100
but this variable could be used right
here in the class itself and you could
just use object dot Z should return us
with the same result
because the constructor class can access
its private methods and properties
the next thing we learned about is the
static methods you know the static
methods are like if I create base glass
dot my method function
returned three then object thought my
method does not exist it will throw an
undefined but if I do base class dot
prototype dot my method then this would
return three because now my method is
attached to the prototypal chain or
basically the prototype chain of this
class the constructor function the next
thing in the last tutorial we learn
about or maybe tutorial before last
creating a color custom string function
which returns us
the reverse of any word or sentence like
that I'll just copy the board from the
last tutorial as you can see if you do
like this
just
me then it should return the reverse of
above strength
I don't have time to sit and write every
single letter in the reverse format but
it would be something like like this
you can check it in your console grocery
so that's all for the summarizing of
prototypes I hope you're clear with the
prototypal inheritance model and how
does Java Script prototypes work if you
are not go back in the playlist and
watch tutorials again and again and I am
pretty sure you will master in
prototypes in JavaScript if you still
need my help you are free to command
below and ask for any help or leave any
suggestion and thank you for watching
and don't forget to subscribe that's
very important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
