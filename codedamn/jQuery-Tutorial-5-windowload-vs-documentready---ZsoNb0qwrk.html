jquery tutorial and of this tutorial
just like the previous one we'll be
learning about something called window
dot load now window dot load event kind
of fires when your whole window is ready
to see it working let's create the same
document or trading event we did in the
last tutorial let's say this should
alert door is ready
where document is ready to be
manipulated this would say window is
ready when it is ready so let's refresh
this page in the first alert we get Dom
is ready the second alert says window is
ready now the difference might not seem
very much but when we see on the light
sides which have sizes like 1 or 2 MBS
then these 2 functions have a very
different time of execution for example
okay so
let's download an image HD wallpapers a
heavy image I'll let you know the
differences
let's apply some filters
this should be good yeah so we have this
image down here
let's copy the URL
I'll place this as an image
here you go now let's reload the first
alert we get doors ready and now the
image is being loaded into the browser
notice we haven't caught window is ready
alert yet this is because window this
function fires when all the components
that means images forms etc are ready to
be used and this event would fire I'll
just zoom out a bit so that it's visible
kind of and this even would fire once
this image is ready so let's just wait
for this image to be ready once this
loads completely because this is a very
HD image so once it's load completely
then this event would fire and we'll
receive an alert saying window is ready
so basically this is our window dot load
differs from document dot ready and this
is our window dot load works
actually the tutorial is over but let's
just wait for this image to load I want
to make you guys see what happens when
this image shows
just a few centimeters left
and I'll just wait
okay
oh that's a very large size image I
guess maybe three to four mb/s
you almost got there buddy don't give up
you are almost there
come on yeah okay
I'll just pause the video and with
resume once this which is it's okay
so we are almost here
and it's almost about delivered
and here you go once the image is loaded
completely we get the alert is window is
ready so I hope you know the differences
between these two and thanks for
watching and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
