22nd JavaScript tutorial in this
tutorial we'll be looking at something
called index of and last index off in
JavaScript now these two are basically
methods of string prototype which are
used inside a string to get the position
of any character or any word or any
sentence in a particular string for
example let's create a variable X and
supplied with parameter the value as I
am learning JavaScript JavaScript
let's make it gaps as well
okay so we have this variable X and
allow create a variable Y with X dot
index off we went to find the word
JavaScript notice that this index of his
case-sensitive
that means javascript is not equal to
javascript okay so we have right Y is
equal to X dot index of JavaScript and
let's try to console.log this Y
basically like that
and here we have our window
and in the console.log we get 13 now 13
here means that this position of
JavaScript is actually 13 from the
beginning the eye right here is index at
0 remember indexing starts from 0
therefore I is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12 and 13 so at the 13th position this
word is found by index off now what does
last index of me then the last index of
means the last occurrence of this world
just like index of returns as the first
occurrence of any word or character the
last index of returns as the last index
last occurrence of any character or word
they are basically the same thing one
and the same but the first the index off
returns the first occurrence and the
last index of returns the last week the
last occurrence both are case-sensitive
notice that how you write it and if we
refresh this again then we get 25
because we were 13 right till here then
14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
and 25 okay pretty simple now the thing
I want to discuss with you is a couple
of things that if you supply index off
and last index off with any word which
is actually not in the sentence then
this these two functions return negative
one for example if I do Python right
here and if i refresh this page then we
will get negative one
now what this negative one means that
index of the same okay to JavaScript
that yes I searched this sentence but I
was not able to find the word Python in
this sentence so it returned the
position negative one and the same with
the last index off no need to show the
next thing I want to discuss this index
off could actually save you from running
a loop to find a variable for example
let's have a variable here numbers and
give it the area of some natural numbers
and let's close it for example I want to
find out whether six is present here or
not
so the traditional way I would do is
I'll launch loop numbers dot length will
just increment the eye each time and we
say if numbers I is equal to six then we
have got the number here and just break
out of the loop now this is kind of a
big thing and unwanted consumption of
memory when we have such a nice and neat
function so a shorthand of this loop
would be using index off so if I want to
store the value whether the numbers
present or not what I can do is numbers
dot index off and supply and the
parentheses the value of one to check
against so if six is actually present
then this this value would hold anything
greater than negative one so if I do if
present or not is greater than
negative one that means console.log yes
six is present otherwise
console.log no 6 is not present and if
we try to reload this
we get yes six is present and just sleep
is six with it so that we can use
numbers and let's try with one yes it is
present let's try with seven yes it is
present let's try with nine let's see we
get no bits not visit so instead of
writing a big traditional loop we can
use this simple line statement which
returns us negative one if the number is
not found or the position of the numbers
basically anything greater than one
negative one if the number is found we
can also do this with string arrays like
foods or anything you want to create for
example languages so we can do like PHP
Python
all like that we can do like index of
EHB
we've been like this it will still work
yeah it is present yes indeed it is so
this was all about index off and last
index off they are basically similar but
most of the times programmers use index
off instead of last index off so it's up
to you what you want to use both will
return the same result if the occurrence
is only once in the string or an array
so don't forget to subscribe and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
