and welcome to your ninth noches
tutorial in which I'm just gonna show
you an alternative to the approach which
we saw in the last tutorial and the
alternative is that how to just keep the
states intact of each module when they
are included simultaneously in a single
file so what I told you guys in the last
tutorial is that we are gonna make use
of this new keyword and all of those
JavaScript geeks out there who are
familiar quite well with JavaScript
should know that new keyword is used
when you are making use of a function
and that function is ref whereas
constructor so whenever you got a
function with the new keyword you just
said that that's function is a
constructor so since we are making use
of the new keyword as I told you we're
gonna create a constructor in the Spain
module so let's just say I'm gonna
create a function let's just say this is
function and inside here what I'm gonna
say is that just return me an object and
what this object would consist of is
let's say name there's a function first
name last name
and we're gonna need another variable
let's just say we're gonna say name
holder is first name lost last name then
I'm gonna need another function which is
just a console log I'll just show the
function show the name so it just gone
so long name holder all right so there's
no need to confuse yourself here now you
can see that this looks much better so
we are just essentially returning an
object only nothing fancy going on here
so let's just export expose I guess
construct function now although this
function returns an object but still
this is a function so we can make use of
the new keyword so inside your module
one just go ahead and write require mean
more to you cannot with that GS and I'm
just gonna throw this mod and then I'm
just gonna save our name is new mod u
mod then I'm gonna say my name is these
two parameters may hold and then I'm
gonna say more dot console.log similar
to this one as well just gonna say or
change this to something else all right
and I guess I just forgot to include a
space here you go and open the terminal
right node main
mania no mean file ojs all right
model name is not functioned
okay so I guess I just made use of the
incorrect variable name there here you
go
so now you can see that we get may hold
Mohan Mehta sugar well as separate names
although they are sharing the same
module so that's how you kind of prevent
the overriding of all that stuff and
just avoiding that bad conflicts and
yeah so that's pretty much the basics of
JavaScript which we are discussing so if
you knew that already then that's well
good if you don't then here you go
so in the next tutorial I don't know
what we'll be doing but that would be
great so yes that's all for this one and
if you liked it then don't forget to
