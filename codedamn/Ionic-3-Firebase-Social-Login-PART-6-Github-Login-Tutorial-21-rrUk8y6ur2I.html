Mei hole and welcome to I don't even
remember it gets its 6th or 7th tutorial
in this mini series where we would be
now doing our final candidate I guess
for the social login yep and that is the
github so let's just go to github.com
slash settings / applications slash new
and create a new application so what
we're going to say this again a social
login app homepage URL again sorry get
out we don't have one
because you are an app application
description is optional so we're going
to leave that and again for this thing
you can just copy this and it will this
rather not based it a register
application and boom you are good to go
so we have got the client ID
there we go the client secret all in its
place it's safe and couldn't be simpler
than that right so if you have ever
worked with oat before with some other
libraries you would realize how painful
it is to set up individual websites with
oat getting their SDKs setting that up
setting this up selling blah blah blah
but firebase it's smooth so again I'm
going to do with some pop-up new
firebase dot r dot github auth provider
the tent well again it's tiptoe copy of
all the previous functions and again I
want to reduce it to one function
because do much symmetry and code kind
of gets me high so anyways what we're
going to do is ah just change pretty
much this thing yeah and we are done how
cool is that
so we can just copy this thing paste it
again
with github this time boy and now we are
talking
login with github you can see that it's
easy as it can get and I'm not sure why
it didn't even ask me for the
authorization but anyways again we
haven't got the email address and we got
a low-quality photo I guess we only got
the high quality one with Google I think
all of us provided low quality ones well
good work Google there but anyways you
can see that we again have all the
necessary information like the access
tokens and all that stuff with us so
yeah that's pretty much all for this
tutorial
and again if you liked it then please
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching I'll see you then and some
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
