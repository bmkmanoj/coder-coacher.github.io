welcome to your 34th annual application
development tutorial my name is May and
on the story I'm gonna real quick show
you how to fix that
title text overlay and make it a bit
nicer and look so you have a lot to do
so let's get started so I'm gonna say
that this dot News description small
remember this variable which we created
is News description but it's just a
power of new description so let's just
say I want to get about fifty characters
for now from this news description and
what I'm gonna do next is I'm going to
go to mean activity and right here I'm
gonna say instead of this description
that said text news description small
actually so it sets the text to small
actually the smaller one means that it's
kind of restricted okay so yeah so let's
just see how this looks like for now and
while it's running let's take a look in
item dot text XML actually well let us
just run at least first so you can see
right now it's pretty boring and it's
still actually overlapping to a lot and
a lot of extent and you can see that the
title is actually over lapping it as
well so what we can do for the title at
least is actually I can say I can code
it something like that that it would
just kind of overflow if it's overflow
in the sense that it would just show
some dots what we call as ellipse I
guess I don't know how you pronounce
that whatever way you like so I'm gonna
say this is Android scroll horizontally
to be true so that it just scroll
horizontally when it overflows and when
it overflows
I want its maximum lines to be one right
and then Android a lip size equals to B
and right so this does the magic and if
you see now hopefully it should work
all right so we always have such sort of
problems
and what is that now well no nothing
real so let me just launch the app again
and see okay so it looks like it worked
right but the text and the title are
still kinda on each other so here I can
say that this is margin actually Android
margin bottom to be 10 DP and 15
actually let's just say and fire out
again
and it should probably load
why isn't loading it oh ok so it is
actually performing a timeout error ok I
get it now why this is happening is that
Android by default what it does is that
it would time your volley this request
for 5 seconds right if in 5 seconds the
server responds then the code will
proceed otherwise it would just generate
a timeout request error and that is
what's happening with our code and the
reason is that my PHP script the style
are scraping the data down a lot of so
it just takes a bunch of seconds to work
and it might be due to my internet
problems as well right now so what I'm
gonna do instead is I'm gonna create a
retry policy for my request right so my
object is my request same as this one
and I'm gonna say set retry policy new
default and Android studio kinda does
most of the work for me for the first
argument I'm gonna define a new timeout
so I'm gonna say that let's just say
this is thousand one strength hundred
thousand ten thousand so this is this
time is in milliseconds right so it
would just timeout after 10 seconds
the default is 5 I guess so just to set
up the other two as the default ones so
these are the maximum retries and this
back off em ult whatever does that mean
and I will use this one so I just try I
just add this timeout value and the
maximum retries why just code it
yourself when you have the default
values available and all three are
integer by the way if you're wondering
so we are all set to rock and roll and
see if our code works well
okay so did that work or not
or we should get a timeout somewhere
about now if it if it is timed out
actually well that's strange
and I'll run it again
okay so that is some weird behavior
they've got there well anyways for now
let's just focus on code so my what we
did last actually forgot all right so we
put a margin bottom of 15 DB so it
doesn't look like it's worked a lot so
we need to reduce the spacing this line
spacing it's way too much so let's just
say this is Android line spacing
external let's give it a value of minus
for a 3d piece and run it again and
again it's gonna show us blank newsfeed
and then I'm gonna close it and it's
kind of boring to perform so oh well it
worked this time well this is sort of
unstable API you can say okay so looks
much better but what we can do as more
is that we could just say that my
heading text is Android textile not
alignment broke textile has bold and
that should be pretty much it I guess do
we need anything else well I guess that
should be it pretty much so let's take a
look finally on our app and well well
that is sick
okay so looks like there's some sort of
problem with API so what I'm gonna do is
actually just let me just copy this
thing right there this whole thing go to
notepad right and let me just save this
with this remote and say that this is
new starch so and yeah okay so what I'm
gonna do instead of my PHP script now
I'm gonna say this is new start
gs1 right so this is now a static file
so this should be a lot easier to access
and you can see now it pretty much works
good but right now you can see that it
pretty much just bluntly cuts it off the
text so that kind of doesn't look very
nice and the title and description are a
little bit touching as well each other
so let's just modify our code a little
bit more and say that my heading is
actually wizard Oh wrong file my heading
is not actually like that Android text
size is let's just say fifteen or twenty
five or twenty maybe okay so 20 tepees
what we have next is that I want to see
in my news item that this one is
concatenated with three dots like
actually just change that to string
literal like that and see if it works or
not
so actually the font size is way too big
again actually this should be SP and it
should be 18 let's just try that out and
maybe we could just reduce it to sixteen
okay it looks cool now right so pretty
much all of the stuff is done but images
left right so yes we need images because
they make our application cool and let
me just see if there's some sort of
problem with my net okay yeah images are
loading fine so there's no sort of
problem so yeah okay so that's all for
this tutorial and in the next one I'm
gonna show you how to add images to your
application and finally just finish it
off and yeah so that's all for this one
