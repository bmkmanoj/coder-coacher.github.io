May ho and welcome to your 38th Android
application the blocking tutorial in
which I'm gonna show you how to make use
of grid layouts and pretty much create a
simple UI like calculator one because
that would be kind of a best
demonstration for a grid layout because
it kinda requires you to put things in
grid and would be terrible thing to do
with a linear layout at least so first
of all change this to grid layout right
and very much I just don't need these
five actually right so now what we have
is that I need to create some buttons
right so what we can do is we can just
create a button and the fun fact here is
that you don't actually need a width and
a height attribute right here now the
reason is that you are working in a grid
layout but if you switch to some other
layout it becomes mandatory to specify
height and width of this particular view
but with grid there's nothing as such
right so what I'm going to do right now
is say first of all I'm going to
restrict my width of the columns to a
particular number for example if I open
calculator here you can see that it's
pretty sure that no matter how the scale
version is of calculator there are only
four columns like if you're running a
tablet you might display a view like
this or if you're running a mobile you
might want to display something like
this you know it's kind of so what I
want to do here then is say Android
column count as let's just say we want
four columns only the three by three for
the numbers and then the fourth one for
operations right and I'm just going to
specify the actually I just want to
switch this to wrap content
I'll just let you know in a moment by
then I will specify the gravity to be
center-right so now you can see that my
grid layout the whole layout is in
central but it kind of looks like this
button is in central because it's the
only element right now in the grid right
so now with the wrap content my grid
layout would accordingly it would be
flexible to whatever contents I have
inside my grid layout right now I can
say that this is Android text of let's
say this is button one right and I just
replicate this button four times so I
sensed two three four right and check
this out well right now I have not set
the orientation property but if I change
the orientation from horizontal which is
right now to vertical you can see these
things are stacked in a row instead of a
column well it's up to your needs what
you need but for now I'm just going to
switch it back to horizontal and I need
to create buttons right so what I want
to do is set this to one the street
three actually two then this one three
four and then we need six seven eight
nine nine eight seven six five you can
actually just do it with a code snippet
as well you can in your
mainactivity.java just create a button
dynamically assign this grid layout an
ID and just loop over and add the
buttons but that would be kind of
advanced approach but let's just stick
to the basic one right now and we need
to have in between the whatever the
operations as well so right now
instead of four I'm going to say that
this one is I don't know what this is
divided right so we can just write a
slash like that for this four then we
need it after six so this would be a
multiplier right and then we need it
after nine this would be an addition one
addition one right so we need this one
row this row as well so what we can do
is I can just write to zero here and
where's the subtract one actually we
need to subtract here instead and I can
create like I don't know I can just
pretty much create this as equal to then
this one is zero and then this one is
finally subtract or add and this kind of
looks weird so let's just make it I
don't know like zero zero or zero point
zero something and then create it just
to get things in place for now so here
we go right so now we have a basic
layout set up but what I would like to
have is that in this application it's
kind of actually yeah I just I can just
change this to point right so in this
application the Microsoft one the width
and basically the size of each cell is
same but in your application you might
want to span this plus for about two
rows or for two columns as well so how
we do that well for that what you can do
is you can make use of a property known
as lay
out underscore then whatever you want to
span across like for I want for example
I want the Division one where's it right
there to span like Android layout
rowspan to be like three right so now
you can see that it is actually taking
in the space for three rows instead of
just one but it doesn't look like it
this when the reason is that you can the
reason not not the reason but the fix is
that you can just fill its gravity right
so now it just takes whole width and
that you can just change this row span
to called span as well and well and
change it to three as well I can see
that it spans three columns instead of
rows so that is how pretty much you do
some rows panning and column spanning in
grid views and in the next video what
I'm going to do is I'm going to enhance
this layout a little bit so that it
looks better and I guess we could just
create the size of this plus and equal
to a little big and maybe just get rid
of this thing at all because we just
love integer addition subtraction and
yeah so that is all for this tutorial
and if you liked it then don't forget to

I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
