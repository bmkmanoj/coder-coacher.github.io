maja and welcome to your 37th angularjs
tutorial in which we'll be looking at
custom filters in angularjs now in the
very beginning of the series maybe like
around with a real 11 or 12 we looked at
introduction to filters or something
like that that your real name was that
and in that tutorial what we looked at
is the inbuilt filters in angularjs like
you can just convert a string to upper
case it would work alright okay so we
don't have the application setup right
now so you know you get the idea how
this would work so in angular what you
can do is you can create your own
functions I'm sorry your own filters as
well so let's the squared one so in this
video tutorial what I'm going to show
you is that how you can convert a number
into another base so to do that first of
all let's just create some input boxes
text and ngmodel let's find this with
number and input type text ng model
whatever you see base number and just
make up name number BB ours the base
here you go and then your number number
in base base is now here's what we are
gonna do and this would be base number
okay so now we are going to create a
filter which would accept this number
and I'm just gonna put off the sidebar
okay so this number and this pipe if you
remember starts the filter and here's
the filter name we're going to write
some filter name here so let's just name
the our filter as base and what
additional option would accept is the
base number so right now two things are
going to be sent to the JavaScript by
angular and the two things are the
number which is by default angular will
always send and this base number which
we chose to send to our JavaScript code
now let's get back to JavaScript now
right here let's just quickly create the
application one two sorry this should be
angular this is main up like that and
one thing you have to remember is that
even if you are using filters without
you know any controller I mean to say
that if your code is capable of working
without a controller but still you have
to include an empty controller for the
angular application to work and now to
create a filter what we do is we make
use of this app which has your angular
module and filter now this method would
just like controller accept two
arguments the first one being the name
of the filter which is same as this one
right here and the second one is the
function now this function is merely
this function is called whenever this
base is you know use in angular and this
function would call every call every
time by angular whenever the angular's
digest function runs
so you know your filter would always
keep the website content up to dated if
you are using that alright so here what
we made make use of is we return
something to this page and what we
return is is defined by a function again
now we need this function because you
know all of the stuff which is sent by
your HTML page into this script is
contained inside this function so first
one is the input and second one is the
argument one argument two argument three
and the list can go on forever if you
wish to but since we have only one
argument right now I'll just restrict
this to argument 1 or simply just the
base all right so now since we have
access to these two values and obviously
I want to store the return value of this
function somewhere so that I can return
value from this function to this
function and this would return value due
here ok now I'm just going to name this
let's say something why not and here I
want to return something again all right
well that was a silly joke anyways now
first of all since we are getting these
two values or these two numbers from
HTML we would like to make sure that
these are numbers only so to do that
what you can do is you can just create
two numbers again add a variable sorry
let's just say this is parsed and this
is parse int input and then and this 10
is to make sure that the number that
user is entering isn't formatted as a
base-10 number because you would have
some problems if the user end
would a number starting with like zero
or you know all that base eight or seven
stuff I don't know all right so now
since we have number in base eight base
ten
I'm sorry and then we have the base but
since we are already making use of that
so why not based so based is the parsed
version of your base and this one is
based in as well so now I want to check
that if is not parsed or is land-based
then I just want to return the input
itself otherwise what I want to return
is parsed the string based now what
happens here is when two string method
is used on an integer with an argument
as a number what happens is this number
or this value which is returned this
number gets converted into the base
provided and is returned as a string so
let's just check out our application
looks good okay so base base number yeah
yeah so this should probably work and
here's our page okay so let's write our
number let's say 1 2 2 4 why not
because that's 2 raised to the power 10
and in base 2 it should be kind of like
a million or something so let's just
start with base 2 and yeah you see that
this kind of looks base 2 if you can
read that ad in base 3 it looks like
1101 22 one base for looks like this 5 6
7 8 9
and there's a limit to which this
angularjs can con wood to adhere you see
that it says me an error range error to
string radix argument must be between
two and thirty six so that was the limit
I was talking about so like you cannot
have a base one see it throws an error
or you cannot have a base 37 as well you
see the throws are so you're permitted
base conversion is between base 2 to
base 36 now let's just restrict that and
we just need a couple of more conditions
here I just want to say if base is less
than equal to 1 or based is greater than
equal to 37 then I just want to return
the number itself and let's just try
again
with let's say 100 days - looks like
this base 3 base 4 5 6 7 8
and if you drive it base 1 you see that
nothing happens and base 37 how about
that see nothing happens so what you can
do is you can in your code through some
error here you can return like error I'm
just going to show you ever in well it
base or you can just split out these
conditions and individually check if the
number is invalid or the basin's invalid
I'm just assuming the base to be invalid
right now you see one is also error in
base 2 is not 3 is not for is not 5 now
36 is not 37 it is Oh 337 my god alright
so that's how you create a simple custom
filter in angularjs and go ahead and try
with your own custom filters and that's
pretty much it for this tutorial and if
