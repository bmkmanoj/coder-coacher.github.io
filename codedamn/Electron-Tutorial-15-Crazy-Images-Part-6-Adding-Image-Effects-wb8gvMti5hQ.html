Mei hole and welcome to your 15th
electron Gia's tutorial in which we are
going to create that either sort of
thing which I was talking about and
let's begin so right now we have in our
edit image is these two windows so let's
just add another window which would say
these are live effects and actually I do
not want to show it every time so I'm
going to show this every only Rin gun
crews active let's just name it
something like that and I'm going to say
scope dot controls active is false
and when somebody clicks there we're
going to switch the controls actor to
true and similarly we can say something
like this so we can now say that this is
our effect and we're going to repeat
this again ng-repeat
which would be effect props in effects
and I can just switch down side bar and
yep so our effect would the effect
column the lives that column would look
something like this class escape name
and we're going to say that this is just
expect now this effect actually refers
to just in case if you're wondering this
thing right here brightness contrast in
word you rotate and this drop refers to
this particular value of that effect
like we will just access have access to
this Val main Max and del M property so
I'm going to say this is the effect name
or rather no because you're going to
make use of that in
ng-repeat so the elements are going
through beaded here this would be amount
done so we're going to say this this
props dot value plus props tell em which
would pretty much print something like
thirty percent or one hundred percent in
original case for brightness and finally
what we are going to do is create a
range slider range slider and I'm just
gonna copy this code from Internet and
I'm going to leave a link how you can't
do that in the description so make sure
to check that out if you are following
up otherwise I'm just going to put this
on github anyhow so if you just want to
download the complete code you can just
go ahead and do that so this would be
interpretive range and I'm going to say
this is slider input and now I'm going
to say that minimum would be drops dot
min and maximum would be drops max
because in some cases the minimum value
would be maximum value would be like
only hundred because two hundred percent
inverted image doesn't make a sense but
two hundred percent brightened image
makes sense right so maximum would be
props but max and then we're going to
say entry value for now would be props
dot well and I'm going to ngmodel this
as well with props dot well so this
gives us an advantage that we do not
need to explicitly change
rob's dot well right or we you can just
do that as well if you want like if we
say ng change and then we can say this
is a Fed effect and yeah we can just
pass and drop start well if you wish to
right so a lot of stuff going on here
let's just see what's happening so first
of all we have read an input type range
which makes it a slider instead of a
regular input field then we are making
those some classes is your going to take
a look at in a minute then minimum value
we're getting props dot main from here
and for maximum value we're getting the
maximum value from here then we are
getting the limit rule we're not going
use of the limiter here but we're the
basis of the limiter here and then
finally we are going to make use of
frosted well we are actually making use
of that in ng model and ng model I guess
we just need this right and in ng value
we go again just need that okay so far
so good now what about the slider tank
well first of all let's just see how
ugly this looks so I'm going to fire
electron II 1 and we have some errors
what we have in here
I'm let's just take a look this should
not be there
and again E 1 and if I click on
brightness you see that we get actually
all the controls add one go that's not
what we want right so what we can do
instead to fix this is we can create
something like a scope dot active effect
is effectively and then finally we can
say ng show only if effect is equal to
active name right so yep and then if we
run this e1 brightness we see our
controls nowhere because live effects is
visible but the effect is equal to
active name or active affected as rather
instead of active name so effect
activity SPECT
II one right
yes and we see only rightness control
okay good now the next thing again we
need some styling in here like that and
we can stay preview is again flex one
live effects needs to be flex one as
well and yep so you're going to see this
is again displays legs
click justify content sent through a
line items center text-align:center like
that so you can see that this input
looks really ugly right now and that's
not what we want so I'm going to get
some styles for this input and the rays
are yes s right so we're going to go
ahead now I'm going to go ahead and add
some styles to this input so just give
me a sec okay so I've added some styles
you can see these are the styles I added
I just picked up from the internet it is
some slider known as ring spiders
actually jQuery slider but I just
trimmed it down to a very basic CSS
style zombie slider and where's our
slider input and rate aside room yeah
that should be it
so it just does some sort of CSS magic
on the slider we do not need to just go
into jQuery and all that stuff to design
CSS sliders so let's just run this again
and click on brightness you can see that
we got a nice little styler instead of
that boring slider right so that is how
very much we can create this thing and
yeah that's all for this one and in the
next tutorial I'm going to discuss about
how to add actually how to make this
image work with this value which is
being reflected here so that's all for
this one and if you liked it then please
don't forget to subscribe
like and share and that's all I'll see
you then in the next one real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
