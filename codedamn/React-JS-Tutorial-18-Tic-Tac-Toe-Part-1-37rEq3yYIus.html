is middle and welcome to your eighteen
three access tutorial in which we'll be
starting with our tic-tac-toe
application so let's just begin well to
take a look at this first we can see
that now would create react app we are
able to impose CSS as simple as
providing just import and then /ab CSS
and if we take a look at this add the
CSS you can see this file is directly
used in our component right so you can
just break all CSS according to
different different components and you
will not be you know you will be able to
discard or not use any styles which are
not required by that particular
component okay so that's a different
thing
first of all let's just get rid of all
this and you don't need the logo as well
okay so now first thing we can say that
this is divided e game and now you can
go ahead and say head or you know what
we call this as scoreboard or anything
like that and then we can go okay whitey
both like and I guess I have a met right
here okay anyhow so again for the board
what we need is we need nine dips which
would be squares right so what we can do
is def dot square and times nine and hit
stop now what this was was it is a
plugin called Emmett and if you want
this feature you can just install it by
going to come by pressing ctrl P and
package control installed and it will
just load the repository
is unjust right Emmett right I already
have that install so it doesn't sure for
me but it would just would just be
Emmett right not just MHC as a snippet
or anything like that it's just omit and
then once it's installed for me it works
for tab I don't know I can figure it
back but it's usually control key as
well so maybe it works for control II as
well yeah but for me tab also works fine
right so anyways now we have got
everything if I save this you can see
that we'll get nothing right that's cool
so if I fire up this terminal and we
take a look at the board we see all of
our stuff pretty good right so if we go
to the CSS and do a little of resetting
of styles and box size thing bottom box
we're gonna need this and then what we
can do so we can say our board is a flex
container and we can set its width as we
have nine boxes right so we can just go
ahead with 600 maybe for now and four
squares we can say it's weight is added
pixel height is also on the fixed we can
just give a background or rather just
embody this wonderful solid black okay
now they're all in one line I don't want
that so I'm going to Lex wrap wrap and
there enough we have expanded X right so
this should be 200 okay yeah but that's
way too big for the screen so let's just
drop it
to 300 AD I guess hundred would be good
okay good now we have got our box is
ready and you can just tweak it a little
bit as well to remove the lines from the
corner boxes right that should not be a
problem okay now we can just create our
header as well so we can say world this
tic-tac-toe ki or anything like that
a I and you can see that sort of works
and if you take a look here and game
we're going to actually make this other
flexbox container as well just enter it
and we can say justify content center
line items line items thank you and
let's direction should be grow or call
another okay yeah so for the head we can
do font size 20 pixels or 25 be good and
we can do like padding 15 pixels or
something yeah that's that will just do
for now okay so now we have our grid
ready and a basic interface ready right
so the next thing we need to do is to
work with a little of JavaScript to
place the cross or the pool wherever the
user clicks and switching all the terms
and all that good stuff
alright so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to add on click here and I'm going
to say
click maybe anything like that and what
we can do in here or we can just pop in
the event as well we can create click
here and again this would be just start
to it right and we can say this from the
logs this event right so or rather we
should just do even let's target if I
click on this we get these squares right
and they are all individual squares
separate squares right yeah that works
good ok so now we have got the squares
so we can just simply change the inner
HTML or inner text or in a content of
the squares accordingly to the turn and
we can just switch that so we
essentially are just left with the game
logic and we'll be good to go so that is
all for this tutorial and if you liked
it then don't forget to subscribe and
