Miho and welcome to your fourteenth
WordPress Team Development tutorial in
this tutorial we are gonna learn how you
can create subpages with your
administrator panels so right here you
can see that if I hover on settings
I get German writing reading discussion
media and permalinks and if I click on
this it nicely just unrevealed all of
the pages which are available with that
so for our menu right now we have pretty
much nothing
as you see edit so let's just change
that well to do that what we need to do
is actually add a submenu page just like
a menu page does work for the main menu
as some menu would be particularly
something associated with the main menu
so as you can see the first option is
the parent slug which would be obviously
this one for our case the page title so
let's just name our page title to be I
don't know just name it settings for now
then for the menu title this would be
the title which appears inside right
here so I'm gonna say this as homepage
so that it's easy to recognize that we
are editing stuff for our homepage then
capability again is how the you know
page should be paid access should be
there for what sort of users then for a
menu slug it would be let's just say
homepage settings and then we have the
function associated with it and let's
just probably say that it would be
same as our main function so I'm just
gonna say this is T minute as well so if
I reload on this you can see we get
pretty much do I menus right here which
is customized on home page well this
looks awkward because you will have two
menus with pretty much everything
similar but there would be two separate
icon items so to get rid of this do this
right here
change your slug back to the slug of the
parent and reload okay so we don't have
that slug now so now you can see that we
pretty much get nothing out of this but
I do have created a page out of this so
now I can make use of the submenus api's
as well so if I just copy this thing and
paste it down here and pretty much say
it like this is like settings only let's
just leave it to settings to then post
let's say we will create something like
post page in future then manage options
then post theme settings and this far
let's just say this is team post
settings and for the time being let's
just create this other blank function
and reload you can see that pretty much
we get home page and post now and
there's no sort of fuss going on because
it kind of looks nice and it is like
home page only so you could pretty much
name it like home page only I'm just
gonna leave it to homepage and yeah so
that's pretty much it for our page some
menu page and in the next tutorial what
we are gonna learn is that how to
the submenu page with our input text
field pretty much just how to manage up
fit forms so as to get our stuff in the
database and on the website live website
as well so if you like this tutorial
