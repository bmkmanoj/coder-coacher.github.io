third PHP tutorial in which we'll be
discussing about something called echo
and print in PHP now echo and print in
PHP is pretty much used to do stuff like
you want to output on the screen or you
want to write on the screen or you want
to display something to the user so what
this echo would do actually it would
function as if you are writing some HTML
inside this the difference being you
could echo dynamic data at the screen of
the user's so when we will be learning
about variables after a couple of
tutorials then you would realize that
echo just saves your day so echo hello
world right here as we see in the first
example if I open three dot PHP here it
will show me the same but if I'm view
source this page then you see that echo
hello world what it does it it sends
hello world to the browser and nothing
else so what if I do something like B
and B so right now I'm writing HTML and
PHP now this perfectly makes sense
because PHP is a server-side language
and everything is sent by a server to
the browser so why not HTML as well so
when I write echo B hello world B then
what would happen is that it's ended as
a HTML only HTML document only so if I
actually view this document because this
was the view source page if I actually
view this document then you see that we
get hello world as the bold text instead
of just getting that slim text so inside
this you see that we could actually pass
on the HTML as well and not only this
you could type any HTML
like list item one this would perfectly
make sense to the PHP because it is
designed to do this so it would echo out
the HTML so another statement which we
have similar to echo is the print one so
what does the print two is same just the
echo do so if I do print and reload this
page you see there's no difference so at
this level I would only tell you that
echo and print are same and you could
use them interchangeably so this was the
third tutorial on PHP and I'm taking it
really slow because it would be
difficult for you if you are not
experienced with PHP before at all so
that's it for this tutorial and don't
forget to subscribe and watch the next
one so I'll see you there goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
