Miho and welcome to your tenth tightrope
tutorial in which I'm gonna show you
what is optional argument and you know
how it is pretty much different from the
default one well actually it is it isn't
different at all from the default one
it's just that an optional you are just
creating an optional argument you know I
don't know how to explain that I'm just
gonna show you a code and you might
probably figure it out yourself so let's
just create a function which is area or
square this time right and it accepts
argument a side which is a number and
then another argument which would be
like is integer which would kind of
return us an integer instead of you know
any decimal value or a decimal number or
any floating-point number which gets
into our calculation while you
calculating the area so this would be a
type of boolean right obviously I want
to make this integer an optional right
so if it is passed as true then only you
know kind of make the response as an
integer otherwise we are okay with
decimal if it does false or if it is if
it isn't passed at all so to do that
just put a question mark here in front
of your variable name so now it is kind
of optional so your typescript compiler
won't bug you if you don't pass an in is
integer as the argument while calling
the area of square function so what I
can do now is that I can safely say
isn't teacher then returned math dot
floor or you can just seal it out as
well number times number otherwise
return number times actually its side
not number right and just copy this
thing right here as well and what we
need to do now is pretty much just call
in console.log area square five point
two five and see I'm not passing
anything so I reload this Oh actually I
haven't builded this yet it ain't true
that's there so you see not much of a
change so if I reload this you can see
that I get 27 points five six two five
but check this out it's not passing true
with the calling of this and then build
it right and now if I reload the page I
guess with my mouse you can see I get
the answer Australia seven instead of
you know the decimal value so that is
how pretty much you make this thing a
boolean value actually not a boolean
actually an optional value so you could
have made this a default one as false as
as well it will just work fine but you
know we just make it up default or
actually a option value as well so yeah
one more thing I want to tell you about
this is that you can actually define the
return type of the function as well in
typescript but that's pretty cool
because it adds more functionality like
statically typed languages like C and
C++ where you have actually you have to
actually define the return type of the
function as well so this kind of you
know scales down a lot of bugs
you might unknowingly create in your
JavaScript code so that is kind of
advantages of typescript over one
Ellijay s so you can just specify a
number here because I'm pretty sure the
area of square would
be a number only so now you can see that
as I try to return something like which
is not a number like we've done zero
something like that you can see that I
already get this wavy line and if I
compile my code you can see that I get
an error type string is not assignable
to type number which is of this type but
if you just omit this then you can by
default by mistake you know pretty much
actually get error but no best common
type exists someone returned expressions
yeah okay it's some sort of giving some
sort of clue to you as well right now
but it's better define your return
datatype would function as well so that
is how pretty much you create a optional
argument and define a return type for
your function as well and in the next
tutorial what I'm gonna actually cover
is that how you can overload functions
and it's pretty easy and you know the
word overloading kind of looks a lot
technical but it's it's a lot easy it's
easier than you can think so that is all
for this one and if you liked it then
don't food to subscribe and thank you
for watching I'll see you then in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
