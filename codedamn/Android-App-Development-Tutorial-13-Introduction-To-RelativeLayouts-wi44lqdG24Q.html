Android application tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna build another layout
but this time I'm gonna show you why
Android relatively out would be a good
choice for the sort of layout instead of
linear layout so let's say that I want
to build an application which is Cana
this is your mobile phone then this is
your user name field and this is your
username text place where you would
enter your username and this is password
then the field for password then this is
your signup button then you have like
some more registration area or something
like that so you know you get the idea
so let's see how to build that with a
linear layout first so I'm just gonna
get rid of this all of that real quick
and I'm gonna say that our linear layout
linear or actually this is nearly out
this is rack on then let's just wrap on
them for now and actually I'm just gonna
match parent for this one and I'm gonna
say that inside this I have a textview
with rock on to wrap content for now and
I'm gonna say that the text or email
alright now I want to have an edit text
and pretty much that's all for this
layout wait is one Android layout wait
is one and actually what happens is that
when you don't specify a weight sum then
it would just take all of these you know
views and then it would like if you have
like 10 views then it would take the
weight sum to be 10 and then accordingly
distribute that stuff so if you
explicitly specify
that well that's good if you don't then
it's kind of fine as well so you could
just add a little bit of Martian March
left so you could say that this is like
20 DPS and layout margin left as it says
that it just add a margin to your layout
then Hummer layout margin right margin
right it's 20 DB as well so we just
specify gravity as well for this one
central here we go now you could just
copy out this layout and paste it again
here and say that this would be your I
guess I should probably keep this on the
left only because that kind of looks
awkward if I just you know keep it
central and this would be then password
and yeah pretty much it then what I want
next is a button so let me just add a
linear layout again and say that this is
button much parent wrap content and this
would say that sign man so I want this
thing to span the whole screen let's
just as you well obviously in a real
application you just don't want the
login form span the whole screen unless
your login form is kind of big and
catchy so what I can say this is where
await some of hundreds so I can spray
them this is Android layout weight is 33
then this one is 33 as well and this one
is 33 as well you know it's got a 99
it's not hundred percent but still it
works so you could just specify the
gravity as well
Rowdy Center rally center then gravity
Center so kind of awkward but it's okay
so now what happens is that if you hover
over this you would see something like
this nested weights are bad for
performance and if you click on more it
would say that layout weights require
widget to be measured twice when a
layout weight with nonzero width is
nested inside another linear layout with
nonzero weights then the number of
measures measurements increases
exponentially
exponentially is kind of a big thing to
worry about
because exponents are the increase real
quick from you know it would take just a
few nested layouts to crash your
application if you make use of layout
weights a lot of times so this sort of
layout is possible with relative layout
as well and kinda with ease actually
because relative layout would not need
allow us actually with the help of
relative layout you would not need to
have actually a nested layout at all so
that kind of not only saves your layout
weight but a layout are nested layout
itself so that kinda would be helpful so
let's just see how that would look like
so again I'm gonna change this linear
layout to relatively out and it
automatically does that for me
right here and again I'm gonna say that
let me see okay so I'm gonna say that
this is textview
Android width is wrap content wrap
content for now and I'm gonna say that
this has text email
and what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna
specify an ID do it now what an ID is an
ID actually is kind of an identifier for
your view so in relative layout you can
make use of ID to specify which view
would go on the left right top or bottom
of which of what another view so you're
gonna see that in a minute real quick so
let me just say that this is my email
email label right then I'm gonna say
that you know that's pretty much it for
the email one then I wanted the text so
it saves me rock content rock content
and I'm gonna say this is Android layout
to write off now pay close attention
here now what's happening here is that
actually I am creating a layout which I
can say to that place this edit text to
the right of which ID well if I say does
this email label then what happens is
that this if you see closely then this
and this are placed on left and right of
each other well there's sort of it
height difference because this is kind
of just a label but this is an input
field so we'll worry about that later on
well now what I'm gonna say that this is
Android layout align parent right and
set this to true now you can see that it
spans the full width because I have said
that this is a line to parent right so
it saves me that consider replacing
Android layout line parents right
payment end it to true for better right
- okay so you can do that but I'm not
right now concerned for RTL or LTR
support
so for the text you can just give it an
Android text size of let's say an ESB or
maybe like 22 SP or something and I can
say that this is Android layout
margin-top is equal to let's just say
five DPS or ten DPS or whatever you want
to have now you can see that we have
placed these side-by-side without an
actually making use of any other layout
so you know you could pretty much do
something like this to all of these
things now there would be a little bit
of duplicates so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say that this one has an ID of
password label and I want to say that
this one is to the right of password
label but where is password label while
we haven't specified its position so
let's say that Android below and an ID
of email label so now it's here and
let's change this to password and it is
still right here but what I want is that
it is Android layout below it is below
to the I guess I haven't specified an ID
for this one let's just say this email
field so this is below email field right
so now you can see that it pretty much
looks cool and the final thing you have
to do is just create a button out of it
so this is again wrap content let's just
say that I'm gonna say this is Android
text as let's say sign man
and I can see that it has a distorted
position because we haven't specified
its position yet so I'm gonna say this
is an ID of password field right and
finally I'm gonna say that this is
Android layout below password field
and pretty much you can then span it on
the whole screen you could say that this
is match parent and you got the pretty
much the same layout but I haven't
created that height difference so now
you can see that it's pretty much same
as the other layout we just have a
little bit of weight difference which we
can fix easily but the main purpose of
this tutorial was to make you see that
how relative layouts can be used instead
of linear layouts well both of them have
their own you know advantages and
disadvantages it's not that relatively
out of supreme relatively out of scanner
sucks it kind of sucks really bad in
some situations are linearly out Kara
sucks has well really bad in some
situations well it really depends from
situation to situation what kind of
layout you want to have so for such an
application I would prefer a relative
layout instead of linear because it is
fast and it kind of avoids your nested
layouts as well plus the layout weight
as well so I guess that is all for this
tutorial and my app was running actually
so anyways so that is all for this
tutorial
