Nicole and welcome to your 11th crazy
images tutorial not really your 11th
electron tutorial in which you're going
to continue our application for crazy
images and let us see how we can bring
life to this toolbar so again as I said
I'm going to make use of angularjs in
this application so I guess it's time to
import it now so I'm going to go to
code.org
and let's just go right for this one
angular 2 this is the last release for
angular 1.6.4 I guess yep and then we
can just copy angular jeaious from here
and pretty much a it right here script
SRC and strip the stars together you
need angular route as well so angular
route there we go
so we have our angular already and now
let's just make some use of that in a
script file so I'm going to place my
foot at the bottom which would be
straight KS and again a new script dot
J's files which would be and she act app
lets us take and i'm not going to go a
lot deep into angularjs for now if you
are not even a little bit of comfortable
with angular I suggest you take a look
at the playlist I guess I would post the
link in the description for angularjs
and you'll be up and running in no time
so once we have done we can say you are
apt is the angular modules half and
we're going to need make use of ng route
and we can say that fan out app dot
config route provider get function route
provider and he'll and say so provider
dot when the Sun homepage I want the
template URL to be how we do not have it
yet but we can create a folder say
component and then home right here I can
put a file home dot HTML and we can save
this component home home dot HTML or
otherwise you could have done something
like dir name and then this thing is one
on the same thing and for the controller
I'm gonna need let's take one controller
now let's just define this home
controller boom controller function
scope and let's just define this later
first of all define our head controller
right now what this head controller is
is about creating this header so I'm
going to say this is ng-controller is
head control and now we can mess around
a little here you can see ng click and I
actually forgot what this was I think it
was heavy multiplication so I'm going to
say close for this and just copy this
because I'm lazy I must say I don't know
this will maximize
nice be nice you can take a look 55 55
is a waterside d5 minimize 5 d 5 is
minimized that's right
so we have these things ready and I can
put a scope dot flows is equal to
function so dot max they might not be my
it also function as cold start
minimize it's also a function and we can
just conclude window all the state went
so that we don't mess with original
javascript remote got get cross window
and again this is the same remote which
we learned about in I guess some
tutorial and we need to get promoted
post it is this are require req I can
spell what the heck are eq u ir e is one
and you can just make it constant
I don't know people just make you of
that but war is fine as well
so we have our window now we can say
when the dot close window dot maximized
rather window is maximized just what
like we did earlier so window dot unmask
the mice otherwise window dot maximized
right and then finally window dot
minimize that's it and yeah that's
pretty much it for the header part and
let's just take a look if we have
anything else to do here now looks fine
for me nicely one this again okay we do
not
code looks like there's some problem
with the scripting I don't know what it
is the code looks fine but try to run it
again yeah this time it works I don't
know what happened glass tank so anyways
we can see that if I try to minimize it
MoDOT get current window is lot of
function well that's rude
obviously because you do not want that
but actually this so now if I try to
minimize this it minimizes if I try to
maximize this it maximizes annex I try
to close it it closes sweet so that is
all for this one and we just completed
our toolbar for the app and from the
next tutorial I'm going to start with
the file upload system or rather just a
file selection because we are not going
to upload it anywhere so yeah more or
less like accessing the file system so
that is all for this one and if you
liked it then please don't forget to
subscribe and like the video and thank
you for watching I'll see you then in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
