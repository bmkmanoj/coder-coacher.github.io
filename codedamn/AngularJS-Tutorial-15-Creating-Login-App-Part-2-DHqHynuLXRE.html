15th angularjs tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be continuing with our
login form we have been developing since
one tutorial so in the last part of the
tutorial I talked to you about a talk
with you guys about conditional routing
we need to prevent the user from direct
lyrium the dashboard and to do that
we have something called resolve in this
when Clause itself so I'll just put a
comma or I'll just do it right here when
we solve
and right here I'll do something called
check now this check would check against
a function and would do everything
specified here so the control would
first be passed into resolve then inside
check then this function would be
checked so let's save this function if I
say if 1 equals 1 then location bad
dashboard so if I the specified location
here then every time every single time
you was at this URL
you would be automatically redirected to
this thing but we do not want that we
want the valid and authenticated users
to be logged in inside the dashboard
itself so let's try something
alternative and what we can do is we can
use something called route scape now
route scape I'll just write it for you
guys
root
scape or it should be scoped instead I
guess I had a Dark Crystal right now so
root scope is a kind of you can say a
global a super global variable through
on which whatever you assign remains
accessible in every controller and
everywhere in your angular directives
and controllers and factories and all
that stuff so root scope if I said like
that root scope dot this name equals
something then even if I had another
controller down here and I just say
alert root scope dot this name then it
would alert something but if you do like
scoop doc username or you name then it
would obviously not alert anything or
would just alert undefined but root
scope that is all of your properties to
global object
okay so the thing we need to do now is
change the why you name and you are
password to our instead of wire to root
scope dot you name and root scope dot
password now we have got these two
things accessible inside our you can say
the global object so we can access these
two here now so now if you're getting me
what I'm gonna do is I'll just say if
root scope dot and actually what we can
do is we can just move this thing right
here or just before the redirect
actually so now we don't need to check
anything against the value we can just
specify or actually we don't need this
add up you know and a little bit
confused up guy but I always come with
right and clean solution
so now the task is simple now and what
I'll do is just a fruit scope that
logged in then do nothing but if it's
not the location at the main stuff and
otherwise else I just like to display
the template URL and let's check this
out on a browser so here's the browser
and let me change it to 15 or HTML let's
say admin and admin let's login now
okay
scope is not defined the reason is added
provider would scoop here so in angular
you know just make it a habit that
whatever angular stuff you are using you
through it in the function arguments as
well otherwise things just screw up so
let's I guess I didn't provide it here
as well who were me
alright let's reload now admin admin log
in check this out we are on the login
page but nothing works
and why maybe we just don't need the
template URL inside the conditional
clause because we are already
redirecting it to the main site let's
reload this again let's check this out
one more time let's login and it says
welcome user not a problem but the
problem was that if I go directly to the
dashboard alright so now I guess
problems is fixed and check this out now
whenever I go to dashboard I'm
automatically redirected to this page
back and I'll just confirm this for you
through traditional JavaScript as well
and you see that
um
the hash automatically changes to the
home page 1 whenever I go to the
dashboard in an unauthenticated way so
that was a really poor angularjs
validated for my admit that from my
bottom of my heart you cannot implement
this form anywhere in your site I know
but you know this is just the basis of
what you can do with angularjs obviously
you wouldn't store your password inside
your source code only so in a real world
application what you'll do is you will
launch another attacks request to the
server and send the UA this username and
password to there and would wait for the
response as valid or invalid until you
perform the specific actions so
basically all the security issues lies
here only so this was a mini basic gonna
ugly login form and you can go ahead and
style it a little bit and even implement
a security feature or to create some
session IDs to keep the user logged in
create some cookies with JavaScript to
keep the user logged in for a specific
period of time and whatever you want to
do but my main purpose of this tutorial
was to teach you guys how the check is
working resolve and we have got some
more things in resolve and how root
scope is working location we have
discussed add all the stuff
so at last you see that we just did the
wrong stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
