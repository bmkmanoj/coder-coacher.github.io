Android application the blocking
tutorial madness me hole and in this
tutorial I'm gonna show you a real quick
thing which I guess I missed when I was
doing even listeners so I should have
probably done that at that time only but
here we go so what I'm gonna tell you
about is that there's something known as
it's an on long click listener now yes
we did on click listener earlier and
just make some space for myself and get
rid of this code and remove the
redundant imports as well on this one
too so we have this button right and let
me just quickly get that and my code so
I'm gonna say my button first button is
now and then I'm gonna say first button
is fine view by ID dot ID like that make
sure import that button module then you
have to obviously cast it to button
otherwise we'll give you some errors we
say first button god set on long click
that's not right so what its gonna do is
it's gonna pretty much do listen for
longer clicks right so like if you're
holding something for a second or two so
on click what it does is that it just
listens for any click so why I wanted to
tell you about this is the reason we
would make use of the public boolean
here as well just like we made use in
that on touch so this example would
pretty much demonstrate how this return
false differs from returns true so now
let me just set up my emulator as well
any motion and this is to some other
stuff so I'm gonna say first button got
set on click listener
as well so yes I am adding and click and
an on click both listeners right so I'm
gonna say this is my on click listener
and let me just fire off emulator first
and here what I'm gonna see is that
let's just say Here I am
create creating some text view word wrap
content Android text idle and Android ID
of let's say my text and right here I'm
gonna say text Mew is equal to or
actually takes to you my text is text
view and then I'm gonna say fine view by
ID r dot ID then I'm gonna say I might
text you let's set text I am being
clicked right and I'm gonna say the same
thing right here I'm being clicked long
so it's just gonna say me
nullpointerexception but let's just
ignore that for this application because
you have to probably just move it out of
this click listeners you know so it's
just gonna show you that you don't worry
about that so let's just name s DK is
greater than device SDK wait a minute
when did that happen
let's just make it to 16 holy and just
synchronize your version so that doesn't
affect your application and it's just
synchronize encase about this file later
on when we are you know pretty much done
with
Android then we are gonna look at what
this file is all about it's pretty cool
actually
so okay so now looks like
synchronization is done let's just run
it again and Here I am using Nexus 4
because I don't know somehow
applications were running very slow on
getting motion I don't know I have
virtualization enabled and I have got 16
GB of RAM graphic card everything but
still getting motion one slow anyways
for my application I actually use a real
device so I just tried getting motion
for first time so it didn't kind of work
so now you can see the status is idle
for now and see if I click a short
button it says me I am being clicked
right and right now you can see that it
says me to return false right so if I
hold this button you see that I am being
long appears and see the moment I
release my mouse click you see that I'm
being clicked is fired as well right so
what is happening is that if first of
all when I am clicking this for long
Android does give this event right here
it informs that hey something some
button is being long click which you
want to know about and this code says
yeah okay so I'm just gonna set my text
- I am being long and then with this
return false is that this even says to
Android well I have done whatever
whatever I wanted to do and pretty much
I don't want to handle this anymore so
you are free to go and ask anybody else
if they want to handle this click or not
so if you return false it just says to
Android like you know I'm not in charge
of this event anymore so just go ahead
and ask somebody else if it wants to
fire some else code some code block or
not so if I return true here instead of
false what would happen is that this
SCOR would take control of that
particular event so now what would
happen is that Android would say this
code would say to Android like I have
pretty much handled this event so I
don't want you Android to go to any
other event to look for a click or a
similar event which might fire another
code block so return true Cara absorbs
the evil it Cara
you know consumes the even that it says
200 like I have handled this so you
know you get the idea so if I run this
and click on this button right so you
see I am being long and if I release
this you see that the text doesn't
change - I am I am being played right so
what is happening is that I am being
logged is actually returning true now to
Android and that is the reason that
Android just comes over to this code
only and doesn't go for the onclick
listener which it usually do when the
button the touch on the button is
released but obviously on click would
work for small clicks as usual so that
is all for this tutorial and the similar
things happens with on touch as well if
you just start creating events with
which might conflict with on touch like
on click on that also has its action up
motion even door action up so that might
create a conflict so in that case you
could also test this return true return
false but I found the set
onclicklistener to be kind of simple to
understand and yeah so that's it pretty
much for this tutorial and if you like
that then don't worry subscribe and
