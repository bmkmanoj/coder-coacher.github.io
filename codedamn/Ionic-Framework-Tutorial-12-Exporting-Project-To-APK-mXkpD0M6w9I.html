your twelfth I guess ionic tutorial my
name is Miho and in this tutorial what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna export our
ionic application to an apk file so that
you can just upload it on Play Store or
you can just you know pretty much
distribute it among your friends so that
actually the people can install it
because right now what we have is a
simple website with some sort of things
like ionic tags and basically we have
angularjs set it up so first of all let
me just say ionic serve so as to just
take a final look at how this website
looks like so as you can see this is how
the application would look like on an
Android device and if you go down right
there you can see that new news feeds
are loaded automatically so that's
really move okay now I can squid that
now what you need before you can export
your application to a specific platform
like for example I'll consider Android
for this one you'll need an Android SDK
now for Android SDK just go ahead and
just go to this developer.android.com
and you need not to download this
Android 6 API currently this is the
latest SDKs so I'm downloading this one
but if you just watch this video
tutorial later on someday then like
maybe six point one or six point five or
maybe 707 is released then you could
probably download that as well okay so
the next thing we need to do is
obviously edit the name of our
application I don't want my application
to be like hello world at Google Play
Store so that doesn't look very
professional so what I'm going to do is
go to this conflict XML and right here
I'm going to
added this - let's just say newsreader
and let's just keep it neutral only get
latest happenings around the world and
you can probably just edit this one as
well let me just say me hole NVIDIA HTML
calm and for now right here you can just
in shorts calm or probably code them
because after all I made this
application so my name here here we go
then pretty much don't mess with any
other thing right there seems cool
the next thing inside ionic project do
the similar thing this is my newsreader
all right and then I guess in package
JSON as well you can just make the
similar changes well it's not really
required for package dot JSON but you
can just do that and just change this to
watch 1.0.0 if you like or let's just
give it to this one only doesn't matter
okay now the next thing we need to
download android 6 AP i and to do that
you can either make use of the android
studio if you have or you can actually
download it somewhere here yes android 6
api download so
this is sort of a splash page actually
Android SDK now you can just download
this Android studio right here or you
can just simply download the SDK I guess
there was some sort of yeah this one
standalone SDK Tunes if you don't want
Android studio so you can download this
and then once you download this pretty
much what you'll get is something like
this so this you would get this Android
SDK manager and I already have actually
I have Android studio installed so this
comes built in so if you are you know
just looking for a real simple way to
download this SDK and set it up as well
so you can just go ahead with Android
studio and it will just give you this
one as well so currently I am myself
downloading this as you can see this is
Android in platform and Android six API
so I'm downloading both of these and it
would be downloaded in a while so I'm
just gonna minimize it for now and once
it is downloaded actually we can do
pretty much a bit of stuff right now as
well so what we need to do here is say
ionic platform add Android and hit enter
now pay close attention to here you can
see that this platforms folder is
created and then it will fit some
information from github or something
like that now because I have already
done that previously therefore it does
not download some sort of stuff but if
you are doing it for the first time it
would download some sort of repositories
from github so once you are done you
will see this nice little fold right
there Android and then pretty much when
you are done with that just go to
platforms Android and wait for your SDK
to download now so I'm going to pause
this video right here and
once my SDK is installed then we'll
continue with this one okay so now looks
like we are pretty much done with it so
I'm gonna clear the console right there
and I'm gonna say ionic Android release
on it and true oh wait am I on ik build
Android and release and hit enter okay
oh okay so go back to directories so
that you are again in your hello world
application folder and then type this
command and wait for it now it's
downloading some sort of Gradle stuff
and just wait for it to download so okay
so
all right let's see how many dots
it would make yeah and actually one more
thing I want to talk about is that grunt
Li the apk file which we are building
from this ionic built Android release is
actually a unsigned apk file so that
particularly means that you have not
signed that and the major differences
between a signed and an unsigned apk is
sort of a folder inside your root
directory so we need some sort of Java
tool to do that and the reason we need
to sign apk is probably because you
won't be able to upload it to Play Store
if you don't sign your apk
so I guess Google Play requires you to
sign your apk and we'll be taking a look
at that as well how can we do that later
on but for now let's just focus on how
to pretty much you know get the apk file
out of our project so that at least we
can view it on our mobile devices and
see how it works and there are a lot of
dots right there and I don't know when
it's gonna end
so probably let me just pause the video
again maybe alright so I went to take a
nap and looks like it's done so we've
got a couple of notes right there so
let's just read them one by one it's
gonna take forever
so going down down down so many dots
right there okay so it finally ended
right there somewhere then downloaded a
whole lot of other things
not very much interesting then some sort
of work started
then say is that some input file use or
all right deprecated API well that
shouldn't does make any sort of
difference because all of these are
notes and we should really just worry
about errors let's just ignore warnings
and notes so this is uses or overrides
deprecated API we compile with excellent
and I guess this is the simmer like that
one okay so we have pretty much done it
and this is our apk file path and as I
said you this would be an unsigned apk
because I'm not actually signing it
right now so let's just visit this so
its platform Android and where this
build outputs then apk and this is the
one so this is pretty much what our
application looks like for Android and
it's about two and B's right there so
that's all for this tutorial and in the
next tutorial I'll probably show you the
working of this if it works so if you
