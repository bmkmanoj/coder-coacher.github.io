ionic tutorial in which we'll be setting
it up the other ionic framework with a
project so if you just look at the
documentation and yeah one thing I have
to tell you is that there's a sort of
ionic - as well available so just like
ionic works with angularjs ionic - works
with angular - well I do have tutorials
for angular 2 as well and I could
actually teach ionic 2 as well but for
the series I'm just gonna stick with
ionic 1 Olly and it's not that ionic 1
and ionic 2 are pretty much same they
have differences yes a lot of
differences because of angular 2 so
we'll be covering ionic 2 some day later
on in a different playlist but for ionic
1 we are just gonna stick with it or
this whole series and the angularjs only
so you don't have to worry about that
this is going outdated because it would
be in support for a long time so you can
stick with these tutorials and use
angularjs as well instead of angular 2 4
with ionic 2 so now starting off first
of all we need to install some basic
things so what I'm gonna do is first of
all I am in my working directory for KY
tutorials and ionic you can just go
ahead and on your desktop you can just
with a folder ionic learning or
something like that and just open
terminal right there so make sure your
terminal points there and I'm just gonna
copy and paste this line NPM yeah and
for this to work first of all what you
have to do is just go to node J star arc
and download node just download this
version or this version and just you
know just follow up with the
setup instructions just click on next
acts and you'll be good to go so once
you're done with that what you'll get is
something known as a node package
manager the NPM and yeah so once you are
done installing node then just open your
terminal and right-click and it will
automatically come inside the terminal
and hit enter now once you hit enter and
this G flag just means that install the
squad or ionic framework as a global
framework so this framework is not only
just restricted to my this fold right
there the white dude slash ionic but
this will be available for all of the
projects even if I create something
outside this folder so let's just
complete itself now right here we see
that Windows users we strongly recommend
to use Visual Studio well I am NOT a
sort of you know some people just like
do like I des to code I don't like I des
that's my personal opinion
but if you just if you just find I des
comfortable like if you are just
comfortable with Visual Studio then you
can go ahead and just follow along with
these tutorials with Visual Studio
actually as well but the only difference
would be like you would get some sort of
more bottles and buttons and GUI tools
to just test your application or just
set up the things and nothing else cut
off so we'll be just making use of the
command line and you'll be sort of just
you know making use of buttons with
Visual Studio so it's really up to you
if you want to just make use of the
visual studio or this the command line
stuff well I find this command line
better than the IDE one because you know
just kinda just makes sure that you
learn everything you learn actually
something new every time so this is the
Visual Studio Tools hour for the past
Cordova so you can just make use of this
as we
if you like alright so it might take a
bit to download so let's just see this
really or I can just even pause the
video for a while while this is
downloading so yeah so see you on the
other end buddies alright so looks like
it's sort of done so let me just clear
out the console here we go nice and
clean console and the next thing we have
is starting a project right so what I'm
gonna say is ionic start that it saves
me my app so what we named it I guess we
didn't name it at all for now so this
would be kind of my project name so I'm
gonna say start my app of the world
instead of my app and this tabs is sort
of your layout the dummy one so let's
just say taps and hit enter it saves me
creating ionic app in folder so it's
sort of downloading some stuff
and it's pretty much done so I'm just
going to wait a sec more six five four
three two and done so it saves me
initializing the project
I'm just waiting waiting and waiting for
it to complete and here we go
so it saves me create an ionic account
to send push notifications and use ionic
view well that doesn't sound very vast
so let's just go with it so it has open
a new window for me so I'm just gonna
wait for the login page for now it just
got me back to my directory listing so
well
okay so let's perform a reload so that
the page looks a bit better so it is
signup form well why not just sign this
up me who loves BT evil.com
and this is a secret so now obviously
the password wasn't this is a secret so
if you just might try it out
so okay I'm just gonna leave this as it
is so I'm going to try out now with my
application actually so we had this one
and this one so now to start our
application let's just change the
directory to HelloWorld
and once you're inside it right ionic
serve now what this is gonna do is it's
gonna select an address for you and it's
gonna prompt it for yours for on which
address you want to launch your
application the localhost 1 so it's
probably four four addresses out of
which two are for VMware so I'm just
gonna go with localhost and you might as
well so this is the same URL I'm using
right here so I could probably just open
this right here Olli
so if I just kind of shrink this down to
a phone size now you can see that it
pretty much looks like as if you if you
are working on a phone so this looks
like that you are kind of working on a
phone so this is a tabular interface
which we just selected when we just
created our application we had a bunch
of more options I guess for this was a
tabs one that we had this side menu and
the blank one as well well we'll be
taking a look at what this code is and
how does it actually work like so we
have this index dot HTML and it is the
same index which is displayed right here
so if I can just get to localhost 8100
this is the dashboard so this is as you
can see this is all sort of angular
stuff going on here
and I guess I need to dig a dip that was
a tongue twister sort of so I need to
dig a bit deep into the scope and we'll
be discussing about how this code works
sort of from the next tutorial onwards
so that's all for this one and if you
liked it then don't forget to subscribe
