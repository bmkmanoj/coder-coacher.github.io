1980 ml and CSS tutorial and this
tutorial will be writing our first CSS
program now as I told you in my earlier
tutorial start with CSS we can pretty
much customize anything we like and
let's say I create some tags like B and
I say my first CSS program or basically
CSS program would be good I guess let's
add one more line I'm loving it
basically it's I guess McDonald's
tagline but who cares let's reload this
and we have got the HTML as expected
now let's customize this a bit with CSS
now work with CSS first of all what we
need is the basic syntax of CSS is
inside style tag the basic syntax is
the element name
then a curly braces which is shift and
pressing I don't know like the curly
braces key on your keyboard
mine is next to be but I hope that yours
is same
so anyways press shift and press record
braces these curly braces would appear
in your text editor and I'm telling you
about the syntax the government name the
property
to customize a colon which actually
separates the property and the value of
property and a semicolon to end the
statement so we have element named to be
element to be customized in this case
which is P so let's fill element name
with P now we want the property to
customize let's say
I want to change the color of this text
so in since CSS we have pretty much
similar names just like we have in
English so we want to customize the
color of this so property would be color
and remember that in computer science
you write color as C olor
Laurence Norris eol where you are oh you
are like that so we have Co lor we want
to customize the color and the value of
the color would be
let's say green so I want that be tagged
should have a color of green and how do
you write that in this Kali braces so
that your style interpreter know that
you are applying this color green only
to this section of code which belongs to
your P tag now let's save this and
reload this and as a result if you see
then your CSS is your line is converted
into green color now has a green color
now let's say I want to have what you
see
to change the font size of this so what
I'm do is as I told you I want to change
the font size so you have now guessed
the property name yeah it would be font
size and just like the color one it
would accept it would be separated by a
colon and then a property value which
would be which would have basically
pretty much like previous type of values
like we have pixels we have e/m we have
point we have REM we have a couple of
more I guess but most commonly use is
pixel at TM so how do we use that we
write one size as a numerical value
appended with the unit we want so 14
pixels would technically mean if you
know about pixels that good but for
those who don't know about pixels
go ahead and come very close to your
computer screen and you would kind of
see your computer screen as a collection
of very very small dots and one dot
would be a pixel for that and if your
dots are not visible and or if you are
seeing this tutorial on your mobile then
this is because your mobile is very you
can say high quality resolution so it
has a lot of pixels so but if you are
doing it on a traditional LED screen
monitor then you would see pixels when
you zoom up your head inside your
computer screen so
now we know about pixels that they are
very small dots on the screen
so technically font size would give us
the height of each letter as pixel so
for size 14 pixels means that each
letter in this should have a height of
14 pixels
so now let's reload this ad as you can
see now the height of each character is
14 pixels now if I change it to like 54
pixels now we have the height as 54
pixels so for example from this point
down here you see the topmost point to
the bottom most point my screen has 54
pixels all the way down
and similarly like this and this
I have 54 pixels all the way down so
that's how we work with CSS and that's
pretty much the syntax of his normal CSS
applying to an element and in the future
tutorials we'll be learning more about
the syntax of the CSS and more
properties and values of CSS office lis
we will be learning about css3 which is
way cool and later standard of CSS so
I'll see you then don't forget to
