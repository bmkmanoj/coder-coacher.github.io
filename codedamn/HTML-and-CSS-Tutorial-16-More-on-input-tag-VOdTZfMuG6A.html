your 16 HTML and CSS tutorial I'm just
hot dinners so I'm kind of an active boy
right now so I have gathered a lot of
input types in my mind for you to
explain in this tutorial so without
wasting any time let's get started
so in the last tutorial we learned about
input type attribute and how it works so
let's say you want to create a bunch of
options for the user to select from so
as you have seen in various sites people
create checkboxes which you can take are
basically uncheck let's see how you
create that so first of all let's create
a form and let's set the action to this
page itself so it doesn't do pretty much
anything so now before basically
teaching you the checkbox or any other
attribute or any other value of the
attribute type I should teach you about
the name attribute now input type text'
name
user name now what's name please hear
the role of name is pretty much nothing
for this document right here but this
name is basically used to retrieve the
value entered by user in the backend
databases you manage so for example you
have let's say a file another file in
the backend say a PHP one so if you want
to retrieve what the user wrote inside
this input type then you will use the
post name and you would use this line
similar to this line to retrieve the
value inside this input box and this is
default HTML standard and basically it's
just the default way of sending data to
back-end with the help of name and back
and grabs value to name but that's it
about an browsers actually work a thing
or two with this name attribute as well
so we'll see this name attribute useful
in radio buttons but let's check out the
checkbox buttons first so let's close so
we don't need this okay so do input type
checkbox'
and let's say let's create a say choose
your fruit or your fruits or basically
the foods you like let's get a beer
banana
we are Apple let's copy this black give
it the name attitude with fruit or
anything you like but the name should be
common the second one as well and here
you go
let's reload this and we have got choose
your fruits banana take Apple tick as I
like both so I'll check both so that's
how you create checkboxes in HTML with
the help of check box now let's see
radio now if I give it radio then I'm
limited to only one choice now this is
because oh and make sure you spell it
like radio and not R I do so with the
help of radio buttons you can only
select one one choice and if I click on
this and this then I am basically
switching between choice instead of
selecting both and this happens because
of name attribute now with name
attribute that a radio knows that the
HTML knows that these two belong to a
single class or a single type and could
not be chosen all together so let's say
if I create choose your gender as a male
and female
and I give a break and I say choose your
age and let's say less than 80 let's
just copy this out
let's give it gender gender and age
let's go up it again
greater than eighteen let's give an age
so now we can distinguish between let's
go up here oh yeah
so now we can distinguish between these
four because if these four were having
the same name then only one of the four
be able to be there get selected and if
I rename these do some different then I
would be able to select both of these so
which is kind of not valid and that's
why we have the name attribute which
helps you to work with input type radio'
buttons so that's how you work with
radio buttons by creating input type
radio' assigning it a name which would
be used as a reference entity for two or
more radio buttons to switch from so now
let's look at the reset one let's say if
you have
input type text let's just copy and
paste this a bunch of times and suppose
you have say a 20 or a dozen of input
type text on your form and user enters
everything
and finally user says or what the heck
am i at wrong page and user wants to
reset all this information and start
over again so it would be really
difficult for deleting each every input
field currently there are only three but
in real time you would be working over
like 20 or 30 input fields at a time so
that makes this deletion of your data a
kind of mess so what we do is we create
the input type reset button no reset
would actually reset the form to its
default position and not position
basically default values which are empty
values and let's say value we set this
form
and let's see let's reload this and we
have got a reset button and let's type
anything and when I click this reset
button as you can see everything
disappears from input fields and
similarly this would happen with
checkboxes as well
let's say I create just one check box
and let's reload this and I supply some
information and as you can see the check
box is automatically unchecked to its
default State and similarly with radio
buttons as well so let's reload this
I'll select this now I have no option to
unselect this so to reset this form I
will use this reset button and as a
result this is unchecked this radio
button is unchecked so that's how you
work with reset let's come to a very
special kind of input which is
introduced in HTML 5 and that is input
type range now range kinds of create a
slider accordion for you do drag your
cursor and basically do drag just let me
show you because I won't be able to
explain the GUI
very nicely to you so let's say I want
how many apples do you eat in a day so
let's say I'd be at this and I supply
input type range
so let's reload this and as you can see
we have got a nice slide around here but
we don't know any information what this
means or what the value here stands for
or what is the maximum what is the
minimum so what we do is we add a couple
of attributes to this input and which
would be min which stands for minimum
values which would be 0 obviously and
maximum a person can eat in a day would
be against hundred apples or so
so let's reload this and okay so now
let's do Co let's do hundred right here
so
now let's set default value too
to 100 would be a very much so I'll just
do 210 so that it's easier to read so
let's see what
now this stands for zero now this stands
for one and you'll feel a little jerks
in your movement of the slider when you
have smaller values so this is one this
is two three four five six seven eight
nine and all the way to ten and you can
grab this value with your HTML or
JavaScript to be more precise and do
learn about that go to my JavaScript
playlist after you have finished this
series of HTML so that's how you create
a slider and you can customize it with
CSS which I will be teaching you in my
future tutorials so let's get real quick
and come to number now input type number
I guess I explain that to you in my
previous tutorial but anyways let's do
it again
input type number would accept only a
number input and let's verify that as
well
mint value salad
and let's reload this and we have water
input type field which would accept only
numbers and if we enter something
invalid then this default pop up would
pop up and we could actually select
numbers from this accordion and once we
click sum it with a number inside it the
form gets emitted simple enough now we
have input type password so you ever
wonder that when you go to your
authentication sites then your username
is a fix text but your password converts
into dots and that's how they do it they
use make use of input type password and
what it does this let's reload this and
whatever you type inside your input
field it gets converted into passwords
so basically not in passwords but each
of your character is converted into dots
and one thing you should know about this
password field is that you cannot copy
it from your mouse but you can copy the
text field but not the password fields
so that's something unique about
password fields
and the next thing we have is input type
search so input type search is kind of
which search box just like the regular
text box but with a twist it provides
you a cross symbol down here so when you
try writing this and you want to clear
your search then this would this cross
would automatically pop up and when you
click on this cross then all your
content would disappear so relevant for
people who are looking for a search box
on their site it is input types are just
like as the text box input type text but
a cross symbol appears where which
allows user to remove all the contents
of the input type box so the next thing
we have is input type as file now input
type file would kind of accept a file
from the user to be uploaded into the
browser
so let's reload this and as you can see
we have the default ABI
of Google Chrome which there is no file
chosen and it created a button kind of
button for us with input type file now
when I click on this button I get this
dialog box saying choose a file from
here so I have a bunch of files down
here and let's say if I choose X a dot
PNG I don't know what this image is
let's see okay so anyways I'll see that
later so when you click on this choose
file and to the file then you can
actually basically upload a file to your
website on website and send this file to
your server and we would be learning
about that in our PHP series how to send
this file to server but for now just
learn that input type file we would
accept a file or basically it would give
you a open dialog box to choose a file
so let's move to the next one and then
we have input type as URL now just like
email this URL would accept only a URL
formatted example if I submit a random
text then this won't work if I submit
something like this like google.com then
this would work because this is a valid
URL so this would automatically
stop your browser from summiting if the
user inputted a malformed
string which is not a URL so the next
thing we have is image now I told you
that we have to have a submit button for
deform to summit now what if you want to
use an image instead of this crappy
button so what you do is you can either
customize this button with CSS which you
would be learning in future tutorials or
you can make use of input type image'
not this input type image' is by default
the submit button as well for your form
so what I'll do is it would accept an
image and it would act like a summit
button or your form so let's see how we
make it work so just like an image
instead of value we would supply an SRC
value to it and let's see if I've got
any image down here and I got this big
crappy truck so
nevermind let's use it and let's see if
I supply image dot PNG and why not
Google
why not hate Google a summit button what
say
why use that bad boy truck let's use
this goodbye image so let's save it save
us
SVG I need a simple PNG file called time
and here we go No
oh my god we don't have some good images
so let's use this I know it looks crap
but who cares so let's save and I've
already save this image so now it's
ready for us to use in this SRC and here
you go I have replaced the image of PNG
do only one with this new one so now
here's a browser and let's reload this
and I know it looks like a lot big but
we can customize it any time with CSS so
now I have my text ready and when I
click on this oh we need a URL right
here so when I click on this then the
form gets submitted just like with the
input type submit button so that's the
main use of basically the summit button
and difference between images summit is
in summit you specify text in the value
attribute whereas in type image you
specify the image path in the SRC
attribute so the next thing we have is
kind of interesting so let's rename this
to summit because it's kind of
distracting so let's say well you summit
this
and the next thing I have is kind of
interesting and I like that and that is
daytime local now date time local would
actually give you this kind of technical
thing which would allow you to select
date and time of any event you like to
record so for example I would select
this date date round here with this drop
down calendar and time so I will just
say like right now it's 11:35 and maybe
12 seconds or basically it's p.m. right
now and
using this we could actually record date
and time and you would summit this so I
don't know maybe like I don't know
and which feel it would be useful but
yeah in case of your like when you are
submitting your form and contact form
and I know I'm talking crap but
seriously I don't know when this would
be useful but I just think this looks
cool and you can't clear this at once by
using the cross button just like in the
search box so the next thing we have is
simply type which would not let you
input the date but just the time so just
like you do that and this makes kind of
parsing your date and time a lot much
easier and better just than using the
traditional text boxes so these are kind
of boon of html5
now all these I'm teaching you date time
local time your image and your range all
these your search all these are html5
values of type attribute they were not
present let's say in HTML 4 or older
versions so the next thing we have is
I say del now del del would actually
accept a telephone number instead of
just a progeny number so that basically
is just crap it works just like it
normal text box but I guess it won't oh
it does accept text box that's
embarrassing but anyways how are you
loaded this yeah so del kind of and used
to accept telephone numbers till this
tutorial but it's not working now I
don't know why
and that's embarrass I know but anyways
I've already shooted 20 minutes tutorial
and I'm not in mood of canceling this so
let's go forward and I'll see to this
issue what's happening here but I'm sure
it's still all we only anyways don't
mind and let's go and type weak now
input type B would allow you to select a
week the week number of a particular
week in the year so for example
if I go to last of 2015 that is the
December month and select the last week
then it would give us fifty third week
of 2015 so 31st December 2015 lies in
the 53rd week of 2015 so I guess I was
the first one to tell you that
congratulations so the next thing we
have as you guessed is the month
now the month would actually allow you
to select month and the ear and your
format like April 2015
or like May 2015
just like that so this was all about
input type boxes
input type checkbox' input type range
your number password file URL radio
reset date/time local time image del
which doesn't work and month all that
stuff so I hope you liked the tutorial
and I'll see you then in the next one
