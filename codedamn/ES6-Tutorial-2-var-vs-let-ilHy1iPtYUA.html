Mei hole and welcome to your second at
my script six tutorial in which I'm
going to quickly go through what left is
and why the heck would you need that
instead of just going with the work you
would so let is just another
implementation of work you were with
some benefits right so what we're going
to do is pretty much see how were
differs from lead in a couple of ways so
first of all let scope itself to four
blocks right for loop or any kind of
loop in any sense now what that means
actually is that I do like for for I is
equal to zero is less than 10 i plus
plus this pretty much means that I am
just taking a variable I and
incrementing it all the way to ten and
I'm just gonna not provided any block so
I'm just going to execute it anyhow so
hit enter and if I make you look I hear
very cool we do have access to I just
like we should
but the problem or rather the feature
would let is that it just binds itself
to the for block so if you do look do
like or let it share rather less the
sake just less than 20 inches plus plus
and you wonder scope now this J was
actually accessible only to the spawn
loop inside that curly braces which we
skipped that is the definition of the
spa loop so if I try to access a in here
you would get a reference error that J
is not defined which is what exactly
let us that it binds to the for loop as
well the scope of that for loop now
another thing would let is that if you
define variable like let my variable is
Freddy and you define regular will work
my variable two is let's say 30 now you
can access this war my variable width
window as well as long as you have
defined this variable inside global
scope
right but would let these variables do
not actually attach themselves to the
windows code so there's nothing like my
variable here you can see that it's
undefined
right so that is one more use case of
lit now finally what let actually fix
this and that's actually what you could
use in your code as well it is a very
simple I will just show you a very
simple demonstration of the problem
which is closers in JavaScript and what
this actually means is that pretty much
let me just show you that happened so if
we create a bar graph it hurts our class
and we do it just multiple times like
that and let's just say we go with
something like Augie bar for now right
so I'm going to say you're Barris is
documenting dot query selector all
selector all let me just make a little
bigger that might help and I'm going to
move with bar graphs right and now I'm
going to stay for floor I is equal to 0
is less than Paris dot then I plus plus
I know there are better ways to I trade
over that but I'm just going to cool
with this basic one I'm gonna say Baris
Russ I not on click which is apparently
just attaching a click event to every
paragraph I'm just gonna a lot I fair
enough
so what intuitively this code looks like
is that it is going to attach an on
click event with every paragraph which
pretty much alerts the index of that
paragraph if we see so I click on
paragraph 0 we get number five when
what's happening here well what happens
apparently is that this I actually loses
its value to the last value which the
swore I got now let's fix this problem
and how does that fix the problem it's
not a fun business because it does that
under the hood but with making body
making use of
let you could actually fix this closer
problem and you do that let me just
reload the page and I guess we lost the
elements as well so I'm going to go
ahead again and write paragraph and if I
copy this will lose the over the heck
let's just do it one more time
this is paragraph and there we go and
now if we take a look we can say let
paragraph and you can just make use of
wire here as well it doesn't matter
document God creates the lecture all
lecture I'm going to move the paragraph
I'm going to say again the same code but
this time making use of let I is equal
to zero instead of War I and then we
have a list in paragraph length and I
plus plus right I hit enter and if you
click on now we see that we get a zero B
click this one we'll get four pretty
cool
that's exactly what we were looking for
or rather this code inside so that is
how pretty much let differs from war and
there's there not a lot of differences
but you know you might encounter some or
if you're creating an app like that if
you want to dynamically add the value to
the elements there are actually
workarounds with work you will itself as
well for the closure problem but anyhow
let's just bring the to a very simple
solution so yeah that's all for this one
and if you liked it then don't forget to

I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
