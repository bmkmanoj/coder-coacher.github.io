tenth HTML and CSS tutorial in which
we'll be looking at a tag and some of
its attributes now in my previous couple
of tutorials back I told you about a tag
which is used to link a document with
another document or file or PDF or
whatever you like and let's see how you
use that for example if I want to link
this page with nine dot HTML file then
what I'll do is a hf9 dot HTML and where
I would say go to nine dot HTML pretty
simple and now let's reload this let's
see
let's click on this we get 9 door HTML
page now we could directly link this
file as well this image as well and to
do that let's pass the image dot PNG as
the path same as here make sure it's
exactly same because this is
case-sensitive
and let's say go to image let's reload
this or basically the previous one and
let's click on this and we directly
arrived on this image page and now let's
learn about another attribute called
target no target is an attribute which
basically decides how the action would
be performed when the link is clicked
for example if you set target equals
underscore and blank now this underscore
is basically just fancy way of writing
blank you could also write it like blank
but most of the programmers and geeks
write it like underscore and black and
you should follow that so you start it
underscore blank
and reload this and see what happens now
instead of redirecting this tab to image
dot PNG recreated a new tab or kind of
new instance to this tab so target blank
is used to open the link in another tab
instead of the same tab and we have a
bunch of values for target as well like
target parent and your target --top' and
all that you are free to try them and
now when we are talking about this let's
take a look at mildew in each ship now
for example let's say I have link email
me and I want when the user clicks on
this link then
default email client of users should pop
up and should ask for or basically fill
in my email inside his to field
automatically so what I'll do is I would
write mail to and my email address right
here for example - Meho Nvidia the red
jingle calm now notice the syntax we are
writing the keyword mail - in H Rev and
I'm writing with a colon separated my
email address so what it'll do is
whenever the user clicks on this link he
would be redirected with a default email
client and this - filled in the email
client would be automatically populated
with this email address and if you want
also want to populate the subject field
then use a question mark and write
subject equals
my subject
and basically that's how it would
populate this subject as my subject so
that's how meant to work the target work
in a tag so that's all for a href a
target attributes I'll see them next
time till then stay tuned and keep
watching thanks for watching don't
