and welcome to your seventh ACMA script
tutorial in which I'll be showing you
something called like object literal
short hands you can say this is the name
I just told you out of nowhere so this
is not a technical term like object
literal shorthand so don't ever use it
in front of anybody
well what this actually means is that
with like if you create a function let's
just say foods and favorite food and bad
food and if you want to do like return
favorite food is favorite food
like that and bad food as bad food so
what in EMC is six we can do is that
there's a shorthand for this so many a
times even I have used this myself like
you have to write the property name as
the same name as the variable which
contains the value for that particular
property
so with ACMA script six what you can do
is you can just get rid of these so that
literally means that you are referring
it just like this thing right there so
if you don't have a property assigned to
a variable then it would automatically
if it or not it isn't an object it would
automatically interpret it like this so
if I just run this war my food is foods
burger and the bad food all right so let
me think what I don't like well nothing
so if I just call so log my food runs in
the browser you can see that I get
it perfectly like an object as if I have
written it like this so if I do
something like this as well you see I
get the same result so that is a
shorthand which might come handy when
you are coding just to save a bunch of
seconds for you but there you go for
this new ACMA script six feature and
that's all for this one and don't forget
to subscribe and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
