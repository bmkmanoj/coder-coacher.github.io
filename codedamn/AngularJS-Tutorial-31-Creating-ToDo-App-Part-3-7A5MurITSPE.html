and welcome to your 31st angularjs
tutorial in which we'll be continuing
with our the dualist
application which we have developed in
the past two tutorials so and this dural
will be continuing and would be making
our application more functional and
working so in the last of tutorials what
we did is we just created the simple
application when we enter the text and
hit enter then it just pushes hard tasks
into an array so now we actually need to
populate the stuff into this array so
let's just take a look how we can do
that so first of all let me just get
over through the core again
so this is our array of the tasks so
this is the search enter function which
I have bound it binded with this input
so whenever there's a key up then this
function would be called and if the key
up is the key is enter which has the
code of 13 and the task is not blank
obviously then we are calling this
function and this function is just
simply appending the tasks do the
average right now so now let's take a
look how we can enhance this code so
first of all let's just make sure that
the tasks are visible on screen so for
that what we can do is and the square
separate dev here
and inside this let's just make use of
the UL which would create just a simple
unordered list and let's just say the
Allies inside this you world will repeat
and what would their feet they would
repeat it ask inside this array okay I
guess we had already something else task
so okay so I'll just write here one task
and the array is tasks so what task
would contain this kind of a temporary
variable for every element in the array
task which is binded with scope so this
should repeat and that's pretty much it
for now we just want to display
one task right here so let's just take a
look in the browser let's see if that
works so you see that kind of pushes the
things included on our list
mix that is kind of working okay so now
we have a bunch of stuff more to do and
that is to let the user allowed to you
know just mark a task as complete or to
remove a task so for that we need
somehow to maintain a you know we need
to retrieve some information that we
need to bind every task somehow to some
key or something so that we can upgrade
that later on so for that either we can
assign each task an ID or what we can do
is we can actually append a property
another property as well with this task
so let's just say this is the task which
is being upended right here and I would
like to append the status as well of
this task and the status would carry
information like it is incomplete for
now let's just cancel aughh
scoop tasks and I guess we need to
change a bit of things here so let's
just say this task message so it doesn't
cause any conflicts and all right so
here I need to do one task task in
message yes so that's pretty much it
okay so let's just check it this out in
the console so we get an object which is
expected this contains the status of
incomplete tasks missus SDM then two
objects we have in this array incomplete
SDF and this is the incomplete SDF okay
so now we just need to trigger the
incomplete property of this object and
if this is not if this is complete then
obviously we would like to remove that
from our page from the users view area
and we'd probably like to remove that
from the area as well alright so now
let's just write this thing in a span
tag and just give it a glass of one task
not status
okay so now what we're doing here is
first of all I am just trading the Li to
show all of the tasks in one go inside
the re the one the tasks here and then
one-by-one appending each of those right
here with angular I'm assigning a span
class of one task the status and why I'm
doing this I'm gonna show you right now
so let's just refresh this so let's add
some text and as you can see here inside
the HTML you see that it has got a class
of incomplete so now the only thing we
have to do here is to create a span
class of complete and just trigger it
with like color gray and straw strike
font style let's just say this is a pair
of metallic
next declaration this was like line
through I guess let's just check out
yeah so that's okay so I'll just copy
these tiles and I'm gonna just face them
right here okay so what I'm trying to do
is I just have to now trigger this
incomplete class to complete right here
somehow so for that what I can do is I
can just create a input type checkbox' I
am going to write ng-model
as since we are working with one task
and this one task is a temporary
variable for every task so I'm gonna
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
write one task dot and since we are
binding this to status so I'm gonna
write a status here so ng-model
one task that status would actually just
store the true or false value so I guess
we need to make a little bit of change
here so instead of just giving it a
status of incomplete we can give it a
status of false so right here
I can check
if yes so that should probably work so
if the glasses let's say done done false
and untrue so that would work so if it
has done true then show this these
styles otherwise show this one so I'm
just gonna show you real quick how this
is working
task one dust to dust tree let's try
this out okay so when I check the check
box you see that these styles are
applied so I'm just gonna show you now
what's actually happening so here right
here what I'm trying to do with first of
all I created another property status
and I set it to false now what happens
is that whenever I create a input type
checkbox' and I write ng model one tasks
da state first what happens is that the
check box in its checked State returns
true to ng model and it's unchecked
state returns false so if it is checked
then one task which is the qur´an task
the temporary task variable dot status
which is this property right here for
any of of every task it changes
automatically to true boolean value and
once it changes to that it changes here
as well so I'm just gonna show you that
so if you see right here this one so in
fact check this task you see that it
changes to done true instead of done
false and it changes again and again
again so what we can do is in the next
tutorial we can make sure that this
check box is not you know the user is
not allowed to uncheck the done task
already and we could also show a little
cross button here which will just pop
out the element from the array
so that's it for this tutorial and I
hope you liked it if you did then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
