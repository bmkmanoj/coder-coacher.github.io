Mabel and welcome to your eighth angular
six tutorial in which we're gonna take a
look at what data binding is an angular
and how do work with it so let's get
started okay so in this tutorial we're
gonna take a look at what data binding
is source to target data binding target
to source data binding and how to
actually perform or what actually is
two-way data binding and how to use that
so first of all if we take a look in the
code what we need is that sometimes we
need to pass data from our component
files to our view files that is our HTML
files right so in that case what you can
do is for example let's just say we
learned about interpolation right so
let's just take a look here if I say
like my variable here and inside here
I'd say like my variable is app right
now if you take a look at in the browser
you can see that we get app now how
about if I want to get put this value
set this value to an HTML attribute so
what I can do is I can say something
like input type text that value is
something like this you might think
something like this would be good
whereas what we want is the property of
this now property if I can explain you
here a little okay so if you take a look
here you can see that I have slept in
this input type and if I write here
value you can see that I get app now if
I change this it's value is updated now
value is a property whereas if we had an
attribute something like something like
this now what happens is that it's
property actually
if we take a look you can see that the
one you attribute which this element has
how the value of ABC whatever we set in
here so Dom has two things they are HTML
has two things in the dorm property
value and the actual attribute value so
we want to work with the attribute value
so in this case what we're going to do
is we're going to bind this to this my
variable so now if you get rid of this
and have a look you can see that we
still get app but the thing is now if we
do something like let's just say mess
around with this variable a little so we
can do let's say that my variable
obviously this is test of my variable
and now this my variable based on the
file
my variable is
not defined
you can say something like this
and what we are getting here is a math
dot random okay now you can see that we
are actually we have actually
successfully binded the data from our
typescript file to our view files with
updates automatically whenever there's a
change now all right now if we change
this code back to what we had earlier
you would see that this thing still
works so if we change it here take a
look you can see that this thing is
still working then what's the difference
well let's just take a look at let's say
we add an attribute here disabled and
let's just say this is mine disabled
value right and now if we do something
like this dot my disabled value is false
yeah something like that we do like this
dot my decimal values math.random is
greater than 0.5 okay now if you take a
look you can see that my input is always
disabled irrespective of what number
it's generating in the background now
the reason for this is that the value
which we get from the interpolation is
actually reflected here and if we just
write that in quotes but that that is
not how HTML works right because if you
see then whenever you have even a
disabled attribute on your input text
field it does not matter what which
boolean value it contains it would
automatically disable the input field
however if you use property binding here
instead of interpolation what you would
see
is that now you can see sometimes it is
enabled sometimes it is disabled now the
reason for this is that angular would
automatically take care of property
binding whenever it sees that there are
numbers greater than 0.5 then it would
add disabled attribute and if it's less
than 0.5 and then X move it you might
see that sometimes it adds attribute
even in the reverse condition and that
is because these two numbers are not
same these two are different calls so
they generate different numbers okay so
now if we take a look what we have done
it's the source to target data binding
now target to source now what if I want
to get information from the view to my
typescript file in that case what we
have is this target to source finding
for example if somebody clicks on a
button then I want to know let's say
that coordinates of the mouse so we can
create a button here button and then I
can add a click you can see I write
parenthesis and click here and then I
can say call my function and then I can
say hey there
and now if I create a call my function
here you will see tion I'll just get rid
of all of this you can Descanso log here
button called our function called Adam
you
right if we go to console click this
button you can see that we get function
called successfully now what we can do
is that you would be able to find all
the events associated to be here on the
documentation so I'm not going to list
each and every event which we will not
even use ever so what we can do is that
we can link these two together so when
this function is called what I want is
that my disabled value it's false right
now but I would like to set my disabled
value to basically toggle it right so if
you take a look here you can see that
whenever I click it it gets disabled
enable disabled enabled and so on and so
forth
so yeah that is it that's how you bind
data now there's a way for example if
you want to perform two-way data-binding
for example if you're writing some text
and you want to mirror it outside then
what you would need to do is perform
two-way data-binding
with something known as ng model which
we're going to take a look at in the
next video so that is all for this one
and I'll see you then in the next one
