Mei hole and welcome to your eleventh
reactors tutorial in which book I'm
gonna do essentially is that we're going
to start with a reaction simple to do up
and that would allow us to help a lot of
things in react on how to create actual
apps and the I guess I have done that in
angularjs as well so that would help so
to create an app first first of all we
need to decide how the app would be laid
out right so let's just get to our
favorite tools that as you might have
guessed and we would just grab a
rectangle there and we would start
creating our apps so let's say this is
our app we would have something like a
header here like anything like to do or
something then what we would have is an
input field which will just allow us to
add some more tasks and then what we can
have is a list of tasks we have unbel it
a row of buttons or something like that
to you know add and remove to remove the
task or mark them complete or whatever
so we'll just take a look at that later
so that's how pretty much how our things
would be laid out and we would basically
need one two three and at max four
components right well that's so pretty
okay so anyways let's get started
so first of all let me just get rid of
these two right there and inside script
okay are gonna do is a simply render our
to-do app or let's just say like to do
only I will just pass some props if we
need and inside index as well we can
just say it to do to do
okay so again you just make them for to
do from components main this is Namath
main and in a new file I'm going to
create you and archaea and I'm going to
say input Korea from react react for
react like that right and we're going to
explore this class obviously and what we
have named it is to do extend reacts dot
component and you just need we have
component as well of not really it only
back okay then we can have a constructor
here well I'm terrible with spelling of
constructor Co NS TR you CD or look in
the scholar super well that's not really
required but anyways so now what happens
is that it had to do up you're going to
create a render function which would
return us this so we can say that H one
first or let's just name it to do up
each one and then we can say something
like add new tasks as our component and
to do have list as component as well so
we need to create these two components
for now
and we can do that by creating a new
file and let's say SAS dodges and what
we have next
Atlas application right so again for our
task and Atlas we need twist two and
four add new task what we can do is
copy this thing again we can say add new
task right there and what we can return
from here is simply an input field or
actually we can just do a form so that
our Enter key works as well so I want to
stay on some bit SUV MIT and we need it
even here we just define in a minute now
we can just say input type text oh yeah
that's pretty much what we need right
okay so let's leave this for now we'll
just take a look at that later on
first let's just get our components
ready and this is add new tasks done and
then we have to do app lists again we
can just copy this thing and where we
can stay this is to do that list and
this right here what we have to do is
somehow create a variable like I don't
know something like item list and just
you know get Rob start to dust and
something like that we just do that and
there you see a fix that we can just
return something like Ally items we'll
just take a look at that later on but
pretty much we'll just get the items
dynamically from experience and we'll
just later on create a ul which would
pretty pretty much be like Ally task one
added or you know task one to simply
ally attacks to we'll just make this
thing dynamic later right so let's take
a look what we have done so far we have
created our main script which just
renders not to do up inside to do then
it renders from main and then we need to
import these two as well and put
would add new tasks from task and import
produces tap note to the add list from
up just not there are this put them in
curly braces make them work because we
are not making them default right and
yeah okay so if you take a look in the
browser we get some sort of errors yeah
obviously we are returning a lot of
parents here so we can just make it a
div or something and you can see that we
have got our very basic already but it's
not at all dynamic and it's kind of
reloads as well so we just want that do
not happen so that's how very much you
set up you have to do app and in the
next tutorial I'm going to show you how
to add life to this some magic and all
that good stuff so that's all for this
one and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you there in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
