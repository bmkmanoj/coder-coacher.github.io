HTML and CSS tutorial and in this will
be discussing about table and table tag
and all its sub tags in this miniseries
kind of so if you see that I have the
title as introduction to tables and
html5 now before starting with tables I
would like to give you a brief
introduction to what basically tables
are and why do we needed them earlier so
as you know that tables are pretty much
like an excel sheet or you could
actually create a table in ms word by
simply grabbing the table tool and then
drawing your own table and obviously you
know that table has something like row
and then another or this should be
actually a column name call name then
call name too and like that then we have
another row and this thing right here is
a row and these this vertical thing is a
column the horizontal thing is a row so
I hope you know about tables in your
day-to-day life but in HTML earlier what
used to do what we used to do as web
developers is that when we don't had
much of the CSS properties and values
then we used to create layouts in table
tag now by that what I mean is in HTML
we could actually customize the width of
any column or row in side table tags for
example if I want that this should be my
logo section and then this should be my
advertisement section and that's it and
I say that this these two should be
empty
for the spacing and then right here I
should have my content which is my
articles or anything you have site
related to and right here I want to have
the sidebar so what I'm doing here is we
can just create it down a bit so this is
a kind of layout you have created in
HTML with table tags now earlier we used
to create such type of layouts with
table tags because we didn't have much
of the CSS knowledge and browsers didn't
support that much of CSS for the
customization but now we have way
powerful CSS and now even css3 which
adds various kinds of animation effects
and reduces the need of JavaScript but
anyways now we don't make use of table
tags for the layout and that is
officially deprecated as well so the
main objective of teaching you table
tags is to create just normal tables
that you used to create with your MS
Word and in your Excel files and not on
only Excel but there are many online
softwares to create tables but one thing
you have to remember is though creating
like layouts with table tags is easier
but never create those now there's
nowadays because that's officially
deprecated to create layouts with table
tags and I would just recommend you to
go with CSS and all the html5 stuffs
like header tags and main tag div tags
and all that so that was a little
introduction to tables usage in html5
and now let's take a look at how do you
actually create some tables and this
looks pretty much good so I'll just
comment out
so it looks nice why are there - is
right here anyways never mind
so now let's take a look at what table
tags are and how do you write one so to
start with the table what we need to do
is write a opening table tag which is
like this and a closing table tag and
it's a container tag show so it should
be opened and closed so inside this now
we have got a dock container layer for
the table to be created now first of all
let's say I just want to create one row
and one column in the table so to create
a row in table we have the tag TR not TR
TR tag right here signifies that a row
is started and obviously this would be a
container tag because we want to tell
the browser where our row is ending and
now we have created our row inside a
table tag so now let's say I want to
give some data inside this and I say
let's TD
and I would say data one I will just
close TD and I would give another TD and
I would say data to I'll just close that
so here's my HTML document and when I
reload this I get theta 1 and theta 2 as
the output now this doesn't seem very
nice to you right now because this
doesn't look like a table but actually
when we give it a border now water
basically is it deprecated attribute for
table and we have some deprecated
attribute for the table and it's some
elements as well but for this tutorial
I'm just gonna teach you for the
perspective of or how you see tables but
you don't use make use of border and
from the next tutorial onwards I'll
teach you how to use CSS instead of this
border attribute and since we are using
doctype HTML so I should not actually
use this model 1 but let's see it quick
if I give border let's remove that so
what would happen let's reload this and
now as you can see this pretty much
looks like a table now though board
water is deprecated attribute but it
would still work in browsers because
browsers do support have a compatibility
support with tables till now
so as I told you border is deprecated
but anyways we are using that so just
like we have created a simple table
right now in the future tutorials we'll
create some more good tables for
displaying and organizing data with some
non valid sorry with some valid html5
table attributes and all those
attributes for TR and TD and there are
many more tags for the table as well so
thank you for watching and don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you then next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
