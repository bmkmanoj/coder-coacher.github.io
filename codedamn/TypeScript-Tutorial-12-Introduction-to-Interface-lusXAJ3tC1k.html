May ho and welcome to your twelfth
typescript tutorial in which I'm going
to show you what interfaces are real
quick and why do we actually need them
well
interfaces are very useful not only in
typescript but in many of the languages
including Java so interfaces what they
essentially do is that they allow the
developer or you know whoever is making
a sort of framework or something to
declare how a function should behave
right so what should be its return type
what number of arguments it should get
its overloaded function overloaded
functions and pretty much how you have
to actually write the definition of that
function so it kind of gives the
developer which would go later a
blueprint about what you what she or he
has to do with the function right so
that is basically the main use of
interfaces but right now what I'm going
to do is I'm actually going to create a
function first let's just say this is
area or let's just say this is operate
right and then right here I do like
operate and then I pass in an object
literal and I can say that its shape is
square and then its side is five right
so right here I can again accept it
other than X but I can say that it
should be of the types shape of the
string and side as a number right so you
know so what we need to do now is that
we can just return something like side
times side like that so actually not
this X dot side times X website and what
you can do instead is that you can
create instead of this mess you can
create an interface out of it and what
this essentially would do is that you
can just do like interface operate
interface and then interface would allow
you to define the type of stuff which
you are looking for and it is
essentially just like structures if you
are coming from C or C++ then you have
struck my truck than all that defining
then you define your object or you know
your structure object or whatever then
you make use of like my struct not
something and then you will just see in
that or whatever so it's essentially the
same not completely that and not
completely different so now what you can
do is that you can just define it as an
operator interface at the input and it
would work just fine right so what
happens is that I don't want this side
to be actually a very you know mandatory
input because if I pass in shape as a
circle it won't have any side it will
have a radius instead so what I want to
do instead is that I want to make this
side an optional so we just do that
simply by putting a question mark in
front of whatever you want to make
optional and that is a very basic usage
of interfaces well interfaces what you
can do instead is that you can define
your function as well your functions
definition not definition but actually
just the headers and then you can define
your functions right here but for that
you need to set the return type of this
as a parade interface as well and that
is pretty cool which we'll take a look
at in the next tutorial but for this
tutorial I'm just going to keep it low
so that you understand all of the stuff
so you can see that I build it it been
successfully without any fuzz and right
now it doesn't so show pretty much a lot
of code to us because we are just making
this a fairly basic sort of interface
and by default JavaScript doesn't
work with interfaces it doesn't have any
support but typescript do have so we can
just make use of that so yeah so that is
all for this tutorial
and if you like that then don't forget
to subscribe and thank you for watching
I'll see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
