and welcome to your fifth react.js
tutorial in which I'm going to finally
be touching components now what
components are actually is that your
whole webpage can be divided into
components right so let's just say if
your webpage consists of a header
sidebar content area footer then you
know some sort of chat application at
the bottom right or you know anything
like that which could be used as a you
know interactive sort of thing that
could be a component right it's up to
you how many components and what sort of
components you want to create on your
webpage so react makes it easy to create
different sort of components now I'm
going to specify quickly show you what
fundamentally react considers our
component as so react say is that
programmatically you can call a
JavaScript plain JavaScript function the
component as well so let's just see what
we mean by that so what a component is
essentially it is simply a JavaScript
function so we create a function let's
just say hello planet right and passing
the process and as you might have
noticed I have kept the H as capital
this is important your first letter of
the name of the component should be in
capital right and this should accept a
props object which we would see what
this would contain right so what we can
do is that we can return we've done
let's just say Q or less is saying hello
and then we can say props dot name now
what we are essentially doing is and I
know some people would have some sort of
trouble reading this goal while you're
writing HTML data inside of JavaScript
but again remember that we are not
presenting this as just to the browser
there's a lot of things going on in the
background and this is completely valid
react code and es6 as well
so here we have our very first component
and we can do something like hello
planet name equals something like this a
card and things like itself loading we
want so what happened here essentially
is that we pass a component to the
render function of react and react Dom
renders it it actually needs first time
to have a you know reference to the Dom
element so we'll just make it a little
sports tab right here this div right so
it needs a reference to first tab which
we provided and then we are passing our
component which has a property set name
equals earth right and this drop subject
if you just console.log this before
returning right and we can say like any
other property as well like has Wi-Fi
equals true
something like that so let's just see
what happens and obviously we will need
to have our game on it running right and
okay
hello earth are in the console if you
check we see an object which says
advisor is true and name is Earth which
is the same thing which we found in and
this component right so that is how you
create a component but this is an ugly
way to do now because we have es6 ways
and how to do that with es6 classes is
that we create a new file so let's just
go ahead and actually create a folder
instead let's say component and the
inside here I'm going to create another
component let's just say this is again
hello planet dutchess right I'm gonna
again need react and then I'm gonna need
create a class this now this is es6
stuff class hello planet and this is
just you know these do me not too much
it's not necessary for your file name
and your component name to the same is
just coincidence in my desk so class
hello planet extends reacts dot
component now this thing here is
necessary you need to extend reactor
component and then here in the render
function now this render function is the
same function which will just render the
component what they don't do is they
simply return this dot drops not name
now again this props property
automatically comes in because you're
extending a component so actually we do
not want to return now we want to write
on something like h1 okay you are on and
then we can be something like that okay
now finally we want to expose this so
that we can make use of this in another
file so I'm just going to export it and
inside my script I'm gonna say input
what's my component its hello planet
from
ponents and fellow planet you can just
probably not GS extension it's not
required actually so now we have hello
planet name earth and has five five will
do true here enough and what we can do
is that we can create some more
components but remember that the
rendered function should return only one
good component right right here we are
just returning one and here we are
returning actually three so what we can
do is we can just include that in a div
so that it just works and we can just
get rid of this half-life that property
now we can just say Mars include or why
not
okay so let us take a look and okay so
we have some problems there oh you're
only not comander just here right now
you can see we get here you are on earth
aur marcio Ludo now that's how pretty
much you create a very basic component
and react and use it from another file
so that is all for the story --all and
if you liked it then don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching I
will see you then in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
