another ionic tutorial and in this
tutorial we'll be pretty much finishing
off with our application by just fixing
a bunch of things like making this
Center just enlarging this a little bit
and just pretty much changing colors
undoing all sort of good stuff so that
it looks nice on a mobile device so
let's get started well if I just take a
look here this color right here
I can change this to a hex value and
this one is I guess the color actually
so the next one is this one so I can
just change the BG color as well then
what I want is actually this one which
is actually centering this thing looks
like sort of dynamic styles and get
style if I just take a look what this
get style is get style so this is a
function and let me just copy this
function as a whole set my average is
just paste this function right here just
you can see pretty much it's just
returning a bunch of styles to the
element and because we are not making
use of the semicircle mode so we can
safely on with that and actually we can
just omit this one as well again we are
not making use of semicircle and it just
throws it the top coat to 50% the bottom
to auto transform is transform then
these are browser prefixes then font
size is something so we need to care
take care about that
okay so scope dot radius
since we have hard-coded this what I
want is actually just get the radius
here and because you're making use of a
variable you can I guess just I'm at
this this let's just make use of this to
keep the things simple
now since our application is responsive
therefore we actually doesn't know
wizard right here so it's right now some
sort of broken so we actually doesn't
know what the radius is so if I do
something like scope dot radius then
hundred then the font size might work
well for a specific point but it would
eventually just break down for other
device views I guess we are missing some
sort of Styles there so if I just take a
look what we are missing so I guess
these ones yeah so let's just open our
CSS folder progress here we go so it
appears here but a bit misaligned okay
now we need to get our radius some sort
of so again we need inspect element this
element is SVG with a class of wrong
progress so document dot query selector
or let's just keep it to get elements my
class name because this is a bit fast
and on mobile devices you would probably
like to get this one only so this is how
we get our width and I can just assign
this to my scope doc radius and the
radius would be obviously divided by two
because it is the diameter kind of so if
I reload and why the heck is circle not
appearing
all right
let me see we have God sponsor if I just
remove this number free apart
the timer doesn't really work actually
so what was the last working state of
this function I just close this up GS
and just commented this out this return
statement let's just see this works now
not really
and for this one yes it does work so
there's some sort of problem here yeah
so there's some sort of problem here and
let's find out that so again I can just
determine this out and for radius if I
just allowed this scroll dot radius okay
so we get zero so that might be the
problem and the reason we get zero is
that document kind of doesn't have
loaded actually so one thing we can do
is for SVG is this thing right there and
then
SVG dot onload is a function because you
can make use of the onload on SVG's just
like you would make use of on window SVG
get box and that stuff so if I a lot
scope dot radius now okay
I guess we should probably get rid of
this because that is creating problem
and the reason is that that radius
attribute is actually just used before
our application is loaded so the radius
actually turns to zero and the reason we
can omit that is because we are making
use a responsive here so our code really
doesn't require radius actually so we
are just requiring this radius for font
size again if I just reload this okay
the alignment doesn't look very
appealing does it so it's top 50% bottom
left 50% off 50% left Bruschi 50% then
transform translated by minus 50% and
top 50% doesn't look like it's 50% does
it because it looks way more down than
it should probably okay so I guess that
did the trick so we need to just set a
relative position to progress wrapper as
well
progress wrapper position is relative
and here we go so if I just resize this
text again you can see we pretty much
then got a very nice font size there
if I just take a look at this font size
it's 25 point something again if I
reload it's still 25 point something and
why is this so if I get the this thing
right here it's still 180 and actually
it's 540 so if I just make use of
instead of get B box I make use of get
bounding client rectangle okay so I
don't know maybe get B box is returning
only the SVG coordinates accordingly in
which the SVG was coded so we can make
use of wait am at this thing and pretty
much we need to make use of instead of
just get B box what it was
get bounding blind rectangle okay sweet
knife I reload reload you can see the
text doesn't look very small actually so
now it looks kind of better and finally
we have almost done our application this
is the SVG one so instead of this timer
I can just simply get rid of this and
for this button what we can do is
actually I can just wizard this side the
official talks actually and I can just
say this is a button positive class of
positive
and what the assertive one we can just
say this is a class of
just change it to start and stop because
it's obvious we get something like this
but if you want it in a single line
you can do that as well so we can say
this is dividing buttons and div and
right here we can very much like let's
just get rid of this a lot in buttons
button actually I was just writing it's
a style button float left button first
child you can say first child then
buttons last child is float right and
you would probably like to clear that as
well play a block all right so we can
see pretty much that it has what and we
just need to get rid of that BR and
change its width to buttons width to
100% and
I guess we could just probably
this one is float right actually isn't
it yeah so now that makes sense
float right adding 30 pixels zero
actually zero 30 pixels are actually not
even 30 pixels let's just give it to 10%
so on the width again 30% and something
so here's our application if I scale
this down a little bit you can see it
still looks good and one last thing you
can do is just give it a margin big
circle of 20 pixels and reload so here's
our application you can see it looks
really cool and awesome
and the only thing pretty much is left
is that we have just hard-coded this
number right here so we can just get rid
of that so in the next tutorial we'll be
looking at how to just soft code this so
that the user can actually set their own
timer so that's all for this video
tutorial and if you liked it then don't
