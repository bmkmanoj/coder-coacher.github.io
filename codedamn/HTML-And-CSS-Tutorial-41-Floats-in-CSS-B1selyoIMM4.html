hole and welcome to your 41st HTML and
CSS tutorial I know it's been a while
since I created a tutorial in the series
I was just occupied with some of the
stuff but I'm just gonna extend the
series a little bit again so that we
cover most of the topics we have left so
far in the HTML and CSS so this tutorial
focuses on floats using floats in CSS
now so far we developed this web page
right here and since the stylesheet we
have been using floats but we didn't
talk about it like professionally so
let's take a look professionally how
floats work so in CSS you can imagine
just floats like being you know just
placing elements on the screen here and
there basically left and right so I'm
just gonna create a div real soon there
one dev - dev tree I'm just gonna go to
stylesheet
move everything right here just make it
a width of 400 pixels height of 400 as
well so background okay Dave - should be
green and the tree should be blue why
not
so you see three big rectangles so let's
apply some flows here let's say I wanted
us to float:left I want this to float
right and as you can see what happens
this we have no green so where's the
green well if you look at the source
code you'll see that this is the one and
if - is just behind it so what happens
is when you set a float on an early
element then it would carry on its
floats unless any other element has its
own float or you have cleared the floats
so let me just show you that I'll just
bind this in a table diff okay and then
I'm just gonna say table div and I'm
just not gonna add anything I'm just
gonna show you that the parent element
is of width of height $400 so you see
this is a height $400 right here you see
I'm just gonna zoom in the cursor just
keep looking here so you see that it's
one five eight three by 400 that only
because of the stiff - if I remove this
div - then you see that these two come
in online and the parent collapses to
height zero now why this happens is
because other told you these floats
would carry on adding their elements you
know to their floor directions only
so like if you write any other text here
like to say this text shall not be
visible to user but if I make it really
really long then you might see it if I
reload this then you see that it is
actually visible and why this is visible
is because of this tip to the moment I
remove this you see that this text comes
between these two and what was supposed
to happen is that this text should be
right here underneath these two blocks
and this happens because of these floats
so this davon floats to the left the
three floats to right and this P tag
also is occupying the top position so
that is why the parent has no height so
this P tag starts from the top of the
document to fix this what we make use of
is something known as a clear so clear
clears the float so if I have like I do
like div class here and death and I
write right here div dot clear clear
both alright so now if I take a look
here I reload this you see that Oh
actually I just think this I'm just
gonna get rid of this stiff too actually
so you'd see that this appears here
where it should so clear what clear does
is it will just clear your floats so if
I pick this clear and place it between
Devon and ev3 then what happens is that
Devon and then the floats are clear and
therefore this appears in a different
line because obviously you know that div
is a block element so it cannot appear
it
you know it cannot appear by default to
dips cannot appear by default in a
single line so what this clear does is
just clears the floor then it starts as
a new light so I'm just gonna place this
here again and as you can see these two
becomes and a successive line and if you
just just gotta add this another div
I'll show you a real quick example again
person if you want to create like
containers which are equally lint you
can say and reload this then you see
that it's not very much effective
because you need to apply a float to
device world now if I look at it then
you see that these three boxes occupied
the exact same position and you cannot
do with this without using floats one
ways to use make use of display:inline
but that itself has some other things
like you cannot have space between two
death code and all that stuff but I
would just recommend you to make use of
float so now when you have floated them
now this div one floats to left
they've two floats to left and the three
floats right well it doesn't even matter
if you said this one to left as well
because since they are occupying the
full screen it doesn't matter but what
happens if I reduce this width to a
little bit and then I change this to
right so now you see things this turns
to right and what left the stones to
left and if I take this right I'm gonna
place this right then you see that these
two interchange their positions and
obviously you know the reason that this
is def to this comes before def tree so
div two falls to right first and then
diff tree follows the float of this div
to and if you said this to left that as
you can see you have switched the
position of elements kind of so go ahead
and try and play with these floats
they are very useful for websites when
you learn them and that's it pretty much
for this tutorial and I'll be teaching
you some more interesting things in HTML
CSS real soon
like positions on how to make use of
them and that's pretty much it so don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
