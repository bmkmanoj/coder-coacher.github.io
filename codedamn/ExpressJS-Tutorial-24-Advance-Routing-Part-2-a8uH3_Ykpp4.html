and welcome to twenty-fourth no chess
tutorial or expressed yes again and in
this tutorial I'm gonna just show you
and play around with basic routing with
some rigs and yeah so that's pretty much
it what we are gonna do in this tutorial
so there's an update that I finally
figured out how to just move this thing
right there to no photo without any fuzz
and without just screwing it up so
eventually if I just create a new file
and save it you can see that I get this
where and if I just change this to node
and save it then it just saves into this
folder but eventually this doesn't work
as promised because if I create another
new file and save it it automatically
changes to documents so I probably think
I'm gonna screw it up again and then I'm
just gonna talk about pieces all day
long well this is not happening today so
you're lucky well let's get started now
I'm just gonna copy and paste all of
this code here
alright now let's just clean some things
up and now what I'm gonna say is that
let's just say you are creating a next
stack overflow community website and you
want to just display the profiles of
some people right there which have
joined your form and you have this URL
right there users register to this
router and what you want to do is you
want to just forward all of these
requests to router and you want to
manage all of these requests to our this
router so what I'm gonna do is that I'm
just gonna say this is the username of
the user so what this column means well
this column means that this username
could be actually anything so that
accepts anything in the URL and it would
just show you this what's going on
message which is not very helpful so if
I just change this to response dot and
json dot stringify
request dot params well what this is
let's see so I'm just gonna run my
browser and reload this whoa
so I was not up note no Mon squirt 24 GS
here you go
reload cannon get this all right let's
get to users yep and hit anything all
right okay so yeah so this should be
router right we actually don't need this
code so let's reload here you go
well right now as you can see we are
getting this as a key value pair thing
so you could have technically another
field here and I can just add some more
text here and as you can see we get this
as well register well you won't get
another one because you haven't prepared
your script to accept that but you can
again do that so that's how you do that
so I'm just gonna restrict it to one
field on e for now and here you go so
for now as you can see it shows me
anything and if I write like a semicolon
or some characters like those well the
hash is not included because this means
something else well if I just do like
some brackets right there then some
quotes right there then some brackets
again right there well eventually you
won't want your user to have user name
like this so what you would want to do
is that you want to restrict this to
some words or alphabets and numbers
so to do that you can make use of
regular expressions as well and with the
regular expression just write them
inside your bracket and for now I'm just
gonna say this is my word plus regular
expression and I guess I need to double
escape that because I need to escape the
blah
backslash as well so if I reload this as
you can see now it got a looks resolved
so if I just get rid of all of this crap
and hit enter you can see we get this
nice little username right there and
with numbers as well it should probably
work as you can see so that's how you
basically do basic routing with Express
router and feel free to ask me any
question which arises in your mind and
that's all for this one so don't forget
