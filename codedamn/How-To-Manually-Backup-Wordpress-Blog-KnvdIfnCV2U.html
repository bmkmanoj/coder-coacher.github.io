this tutorial in which i'll be showing
you how to manually backup your
WordPress blog fully with all the
plugins and themes and your content as
well now there are a lot of plugins in
the market like wordpress backup pro and
other plugins which help you to do that
but this method since it's a manual
method therefore it would work even when
you are not able to access your
WordPress dashboard so to do that what
you need is a couple of things first of
all a ftp manager like FileZilla the
second thing you need is the axis of
your cPanel so first of all open
filezilla and connect to your ftp
currently my side is my premium frix com
so I'll just connect to my side
i'll just create a directory back up
right here go to public underscore HTML
go to
WP content and just select all of this
and drag and drop here I won't do that
because I already have a backup I don't
want to backup it again and create
duplicate copies so just select all this
and drag and drop it here now you have
successfully backed up your plugins and
themes and your images you have uploaded
on your WordPress blog now what about
your content now to backup your content
you need to go into your cPanel because
your content isn't storing files it is
stored inside the database so go to your
cPanel minus my opinion tricks calm /
cpanel
and login into your cpanel with your
provided details
and once you're logged in to your cPanel
go down go down
to PHP my admin click here and it will
just redirect you to PHP my admin
whatever your version is here it doesn't
matter because there's not much of
change ok so now the next thing you need
to do is to select your own WordPress
version the database version and if you
have got a lot of a lot of databases
like I have God you need to filter out
which ones is the active database
because there's only one active database
at your side at a given time so I'll
just check so it doesn't look like my my
database
but i'll still check you see that there
are only four to five posts but i have
actually got like 60 to 70 posts on my
blog for now so this d 6 is not my
database let's try with d5 and if I
go to this post so
okay so let's see that is mine
yep it looks like it is mild
but I would just like to confirm with
okay so i don't think this is my active
one because i've got a couple of more
databases running for different
subdomains so
try to find out something you have
already linked with your database
previously like you recognize any active
post here
okay so this is something completely
different language so this is not mine
at all
and since this is the last one which is
left
let's see if this is the one
and yes I guess this is the one because
the scanner looks like my post okay so
once you have got your database minus
wr/db three once you got your database
go back to your PHP admin page
now click on your database go to export
and
just select quick format should be
anything xml PHP ra or SQL but i'll just
select SQL on i would recommend xq el
and hit go now it will download a file
for you which may be a light or heavy
depending on how much content you have
on your blog and save this in those
inside a secure place because using this
you could back up your blog okay so now
once this is downloaded let's suppose
you don't have access to your blog at
all and you have God in completely blank
blog so now what you need to do is again
go to your wp-content folder and i am
assuming now that your vlog is white up
and you want to recover the backup copy
of your blog so go to your wp-content
folder delete everything you have have
right here and replace that with the
stuff we originally backed up so once
you do that you're this folder would
look something like this and you have
got your themes your images and your
plugins backed up successfully now again
go to your cPanel right here click on
this PHP myadmin
go to your this front page click on
import and now make sure to select the
same file which you have my SQL three
WordPress whatever your name is and
click on go and make sure you select the
same format as well so once you do that
your database would always be ready for
you just like before it was when your
site was working so that's how you
manually backup your WordPress blog
without any problems and if you do face
any problem to let me know in the
comments section so that's it for this
tutorial and I'll see you then next time
good bye and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
