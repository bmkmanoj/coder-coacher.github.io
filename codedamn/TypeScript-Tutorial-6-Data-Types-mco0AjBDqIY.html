and welcome to your sixth typescript
tutorial I guess and in this tutorial
I'll be showing you some basic data
types of typescript how to make use of
them so what types rep provides is that
it can actually let you bind your data
into a custom data type so that you are
not able to or you don't accidentally
modify your data anywhere else your
variable anywhere else in your code so
you can just make your data of a fixed
data type so how to do that let's take a
look at the boolean one first so let's
just say this is my flag and I set it to
a boolean now this column right there
you can see you first have to write the
name of your variable then a colon then
it's data type and this would be the
basic syntax for all of the code in
typescript
so once you have done that that means
that this flag is now a boolean type of
variable alright now I want to do what I
want to do is just assign it a value of
true now I can assign it a value of
false here and true here again but I can
do something like flag equals Wow so
that is not allowed so if I just compile
this right now this code as you can see
it just compiles perfectly fine with a
comment as well but if I just uncomment
this code and compile it again you see
that it throws me an error type string
is not assignable to type boolean so it
doesn't compile where you will but it
still compiles into a JavaScript file
and that's what I told you is that type
thread would always compile into a
JavaScript file no matter how wrong your
code is and sometimes your JavaScript
would look and work completely fine
as if there is no error but sometimes it
won't and this would be the best
practice is that you don't leave any
sort of error in your come
Pilar of typescript now this was with
the boolean one and with number what we
do is just write here the number and
just like that you can do like assign a
number and that's pretty much how you
create a number so if I just change this
to num number with string you just do
like start with then you have got Ares
okay so arrays are a bit you know
interesting because they can hold
multiple values and to create an array
you just do simply the thing we were
doing and that is my array and then a
column and then you need to write the
data type let's just say this is numbers
number and these two square brackets so
these two square brackets to note that
you're going to write an area here and
then finally you will just write your
array and what you observe here is that
if you write something else so you see
that I have assigned this a value a data
type of number but I'm writing numbers
and string though this kind of thing is
allowed in JavaScript and works
perfectly fine when you're coding in
JavaScript still the typescript shows
you an error because you have explicitly
mentioned that this array would be a
number so if I just compile this you'll
see that it rules me a couple of lines
as error but it still compiles because
of the reason I told you so how to fix
this well to fix this what we make use
of is any data type now this any data
type what it would do is that it would
basically create a variable just like we
used to do in the vanilla Jas right
there so in JavaScript what you need to
do is you just
create a variable anything anything like
that and you can just assign it any
value so the moment this is false
the next moment this is a string the
next moment this is a number the next
moment this is something object
something like that so this works
completely fine with typescript as well
you can achieve this functionality by
making use of DNA so if I just write any
here instead of number or anything else
now you can just write any value right
there so if I just create like if I do
like num equals string and just compile
this code you can see that on line 3 it
shows me that type string is not a sign
able to type number but the moment I
change it to any and compile it again
you can see that it compiles without any
errors so that's pretty much how you do
the basic datatype manipulation with
typescript and yeah so that's all for
this tutorial and in the next tutorial
we'll be discussing some more cool
features and how to's on typescript and
I'll see you then don't forget to
