May ho and welcome to your fourteenth
typescript tutorial in which I'm gonna
quickly go over what is constructor for
your class and typescript well
constructor would be the very first
function which would be called whenever
you create your object like new website
and you can pass arguments to
constructor and obviously it wouldn't
return anything because you actually
assign the object to it when you're
calling the constructor so it doesn't
make any sense for constructor to return
anything right so four types web
you just write constructor like that
because I guess some languages and not
some actually almost every language
which has actually opened emendation
kind of has a constructor like website
or you know the same as a class name or
maybe like I guess PHP has this
construct I haven't used had in a while
so I don't remember actually I guess
it's something like that so anyways so
constructor is the keyword which you
have to use for constructor and this
would be the first function to be called
right here right and then you can pass
in a bunch of arguments like URL as a
string and remember that this URL and
this you are a lot different right this
is the this is just the copy of whatever
is passed right here you can just name
it
URL x as well it doesn't make any
difference so URL is a string and then
FB likes other number right so now what
we have to do is say this dot URL this
dot URL refers to this URL the variable
of the actual class right so that is how
pretty much with differentiate between
the variable of the class and the local
variables which are created by this
constructor or any method right so
that's what URL is URL now this URL
refers to the argument which is passed
and then we can do this dot Facebook
Likes is FB likes right so here we go
and now what we can do is
side our constructor we can create it
right away like that and we can get rid
of these two lines right having just
combines perfectly fine but now in our
compiled JavaScript you can see that
just like it will expect this function
website which is enclosed in our kind of
class accepts two arguments and then
pretty much assigns it just like we
would have done in JavaScript right so
this is how you create a constructor in
typescript and that is all for this
tutorial and if you liked it then don't
forget to subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
