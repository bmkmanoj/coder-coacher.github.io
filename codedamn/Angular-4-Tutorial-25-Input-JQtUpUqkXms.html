your daily first angular tutorial in
which we're going to take a look at the
input decorator and how we can make use
of it in our code so what the heck
actually this input decorator is well
just like you child was one what we can
do is write something like input and
then something like I don't know
anything like my input my first input
and you need to import that as well
using the from the angular core module
so once you do that now what this
actually means is that input is actually
used to inject the values into your
components so that you can actually
access them inside here inside your view
so how do you do that
well let's just say I create another
component right here and let me just get
rid of all of this extra code which we
have this one as well
so let's just say I hop back to terminal
and say ng chain trade or let's just
move into an to first ng generate
component and what we have in Hitler's
to say child try and just like that
because component would be automatically
added to it so now what I want to do is
inside my child come for and if you take
a look we have this app child so I could
say something like up child and like
that so now here I can as a parent one
to inject some values and would like to
get them as well inside that child so
let's just say I say something like my
awesome value is something like 3 plus 5
plus 7 and that would do for now and now
if we take a look I want to actually get
this awesome value inside my add child
so how do we do that well to do that you
need to actually explicitly tell angular
that you are expecting a value of my
awesome value actually right here and
actually this line should not be right
here it should be inside our child
component right so if we go to child
component and paste it right here you
can see that we get ten error and then
we are so now we have successfully told
angular that we would be expecting an
awesome value from the component which
is calling it in that case it is just as
a child and we can now access this
property value so we can say something
like console dot log my awesome value is
what I got and obviously this should
with this there we go
so if we take a look we get 15 is what I
got from our app component which is
three plus like five plus seven so in
this way we can actually send some
values down the components with this
input and if you take a look if you
remove this then we would get an error
because you are not actually binding to
what angular is sending right so angular
explicitly needs to know that which
value you are binding to what another
thing is that it's not like if you want
to send a particular value only so you
can actually send any value with any
variable name and change the variable
name here as well so we can do something
like input my have some value but I want
to reference it as like my bad value we
can change this to my mad value and we
would still get the same result it's
just like if you want to just rename
your variable and if you just decide to
omit this then this should exactly match
the thing you are standing right here
and this could be obviously anything I'm
just writing a simple math expression
but you can send in objects or arrays or
whatever you want so yeah that is pretty
much what's up with input decorator and
in the next story we're going to take a
look at the output decorator and then
finally create a little application so
that we can actually understand what
this is so yeah that is all for this one
and if you liked it then please don't
forget subscribe and thank you for
watching I'll see you then in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
