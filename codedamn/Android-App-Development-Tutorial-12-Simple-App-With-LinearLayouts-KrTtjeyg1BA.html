me hole and welcome to your tenth
Android application development tutorial
in which I'm gonna show you real quick
how to build a simple application with
linear layout and let's get started so
I'm just gonna get rid of all that first
and change the weights I'm 200 why not
and the orientation to vertical because
kind of horizontal on a vertical screen
would right now wouldn't look very much
cleaner so I'm gonna say this is edit
text and this is where it is match
parent and height as wrap content which
is pretty much sets the weight 200
percent on high to whatever it needs
then I'm gonna say this as Android hint
and I guess I have a typo right there a
and D are OID
it has your name then I want a similar
thing three times actually this is your
email and then your message and then
again I'm gonna set it to a height zero
then I'm gonna say this has a weight and
weight of 80 and you could just set that
same for these guys as well and wait 10
an Android height 0 then Android wait
Stan again so just make sure you change
the gravity to top so that the message
appears right here okay so now what you
can do is actually we just create a
button as well so let's say that this is
much actually match parent and this is
wrap content so I'm gonna say
that this has Android weight of 10
actually and let me just change just 270
okay so now it makes kind of much sense
and I'm gonna say this is Android text
of let's just say send this right away
like that and pretty much looks cool
isn't it so okay now what we need to do
as a dummy application we can just leave
it our application right now or like
that what we need to do is go to me an
activity and attach an event to this
have I told you about events I guess not
so okay so I guess we would not be able
to make use of that because I haven't
explained events and it is quite
important and I just couldn't merge it
with a linear topic like that you see
bad pun
well anyways so this kinda makes up our
tutorial where is Jenny motion where are
you bro and this kind of makes up our
toriel and I'm just gonna try it on on
God any motion for now and let's just
see if it works like that only and if
you just try this out on some other
devices why not
so if I say like this is where it is
Android TV you see that it's pretty much
just like the proportions we wanted to
10:10 7010 then it's 10:10 7010 this is
well Android viewer is Kanna awkward to
look at because no not much people would
use your application on Android where it
just includes some important
applications then pretty much you could
just view it on all the browsers and we
just change it for Nexus 4 only and it
would probably
we change it which I don't like so here
we go and we are live on getting motion
as well so let's just launch our
application and let's just wait for it
to install here we go and you can see
that it looks pretty cool so I can say
like this is mijo then I have Mable like
that so we just send it right away and
when we will learn about the events you
could actually send this data across
servers and actually for that we need to
learn about how to communicate data from
application to Internet as well but that
is something we would do later on so
that's all pretty much for this tutorial
and if you like that and don't forget to
