May Hill and welcome to this tutorial in
which we're gonna create a fully
functional NPM package and publish it to
NPM as well so that you can distribute
the command like if you have a huge
JavaScript for awhile you must have seen
that people say like install this
package like NPM install anything like
node Mon for example you do this right
so who coded this package or the person
who coded node mod has put this code
online on NPM right so how do you
actually put your code your modules
online so that you can say to people
like if you do NPM install node Mon - to
save then that code gets downloaded into
node modules folder and then they can
import it from node modules and you make
use of it so let's just create an NPM
module here really quick
so first of all let's just create a
directory with just say is NPM
HelloWorld and this would be a simple
package so first of all what you need to
do to publish to NPM is you need to have
a package store JSON file so I'm gonna
do an NPM in it here and let's just keep
the package name version same
description this is hello world in
dextra Cheers fine get repository you
can add a git repository if you want
otherwise
mallet later as well it just pretty much
shows up in your NPM package page that
this package also how to get repository
so if you want to check out contribute
for clone whatever so they can do that
so I'm gonna leave it blank here
keywords can be like NPM and BM hello
world something like that you can write
your name here
and license is fine yes okay so now if
we take a look you can see that we have
back in stock JSON file ready with us
now what I want to do is actually open
this package dot JSON file or rather
this full folder inside our sublime text
so right here you can see that the entry
point is indexed yes for us so what I
want to do is quickly create index
torchy as file here right and there we
are
so now what I want to do is let's just
say pretty much I want to create a
function which returns me I don't know
let us say area of a circle so we can't
go that so what I want to do is say
module dot exports here is a function
which is radius and once we get the
radius what I'm gonna do is return well
that would be very simple I think by R
square by R squared yeah well your
modules won't be that shot but yeah for
this one we're gonna keep it only that
so I can just name it area so that we
can add some different things here as
well like very meters basically you can
create a kind of circle
module which includes all the inbuilt
methods to know information about a
particular circle given that it's radius
is something so well you can actually
use of make use of classes here as well
to make things a lot easier
so anyways to keep it simple I'm just
gonna keep it to these two lines and
inside package.json we already have our
main script main file as script and we
can just remove this thing from here
because it's not required and now what I
want to do is actually login into NPM
right so publishing packages you need to
have an NPM account so if you're a
first-time user what you want to do is
say NPM add user and hit enter and it
will ask you for your username and your
password once you do that I guess it
asks for your email address as well yeah
so it asks for your email address you
need to verify your email address when
to verify that then your account is
active so I already have an account
there so I won't create another one so
if you have an account here you can do
NPM login to login into your account but
before that if you think you have
already signed in before you can run NPM
Who am I to actually know who you are so
you can see that I have I'm already
signed into the NPM package okay so
someone was here anyways so where were
we
NPM Who am I gives me the username with
which I am registered on NPM right and
yeah so you can login into your account
by NPM login entering your username and
password I guess it was something like I
don't remember exactly this could be
wrong
yeah male mvt let's see okay so yeah so
once you have logged in what do you want
to do is publish the package now how do
you publish it
first of all right NPM worship no you
can see that NPM version gives you NPM
hello world with a version of one which
is exactly the version here you can
update the version here as well so you
can say like if you made some changes
you want to update the version - what
more zero one you do like this and your
NPM module version now becomes 1.0 one
as you can see now what if you want to
publish this module what you want to do
is write NPM publish and before that you
have to make sure that the name of your
module here the name of your module here
is unique because you cannot have two
modules to the same name right so to
make it unique I'm just adding some
random garbage to it and I hope that
nobody has done a tutorial like this
before so nobody has created this
package name and yep so let's just
revert back to version 1.0 and there we
are
now I can just publish by hitting NPM
publish and just wait for it to publish
for me on the Internet okay package name
triggered spam detection okay so these
guys have some filters so we can add
something like NPM hello world example
code damn and then I can hit NPM publish
here and let's just see what they have
got
so it's still publishing let's just give
the sky a moment that shouldn't be that
long I guess let's just try one more
time okay so you can see that our
package was added to the NPM repository
I can go at the NPM side I can search
for this package and okay so it might
not be indexed yet but I can go to my
profile and I can see that I have NPM
hello will example go down as the
package and you can see that this
package has no readme so what you want
to do as an update is add a readme
not MD file here let's just say this is
just an example example package and this
would be removed soon don't worry
so readme or dot MD contains all of your
information at this time you want to get
add and they get commit and all that
stuff because you have chain made some
changes but since we don't have a git
repository here I'm gonna leave that bad
so now if we take a look at NPM version
I want to update this to version 1.0.1
it's done and I I'm gonna publish it
again now when you publish it again it
will just update the package online so
now if you reload this see it's 1.0.0
right now and becomes 1.0.1 and you get
your readme here
perfect now let's just go back a little
and delete this directory here let's
just create let's just think this is my
project work I open my project work and
I do NPM init of Y which is regularly
what users would do now what I want to
do is I want to install this
package right I can just save it as well
close the sublime text for now let me
just close all of this right so yep and
now we can open the directory you can
see our package dot JSON is here I'm
gonna create an index dot GS file here
and what I'm gonna say is import import
or require whatever syntax you want to
make use of you can I'm gonna go with
require for this one so I'm gonna say
constant area and very meter area meter
is required and BM hello will example go
down and what I can do is console.log
area of a circle with a radius one that
should be just by and console.log
parameter of circle with radius it's two
PI R right so if we pass in half that
should give us PI ok so if i know'd
index touches now you can see that we
get the value of pi in both the cases
which was expected because inside our
module you can see that this is the
install module we have the radius as
area as this thing and parameter has
this thing so we just canceled out
radius by putting one here and this do
by putting radius half here right so
that is how pretty much you would put
your module your work on line on NPM and
it's as simple as that easy free
everything good is mostly free yeah so
that's all for this one and if you liked
it then please don't forget to subscribe

you then in some other video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
