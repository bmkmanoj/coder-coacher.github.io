last video we only covered the two main
type of variables and of course that was
string and number variables but there
are other variables and we will cover
them later in the course that being said
you can see here I've added three new
string variables one with the string
hello how are you doing our second
string variable will contain the name
mark and then our third string variable
will contain today and it will also
point to our second string variable so
you'll notice that for string variable 3
we're actually referencing string
variable 2 to get its value which of
course is Mark so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna combine the first string
variable with the third string variable
and that should produce the sentence
hello how are you doing today mark and
then of course it's a question mark
now you'll see the intellisense here
from notepad plus plus PHP recognizes
that we are in fact referencing this
variable you can see that the color of
this text is bold so it knows that I
have to use the value of string variable
2 for the output here so again the point
of this lesson is to use concatenation
now concatenation just simply means
chaining something together or combining
something together so that's what we're
gonna do so we want to use our favorite
function echo and then let's go ahead
and specify our string variable 1 and
here is what you use to concatenate
strings together you use a period it's
that simple so this so that will be used
to combine our string variables and then
let's specify string variable 3 and
there we go and of course we need to
close this out with a semicolon so let's
go ahead and save this and let's go
ahead over here and select our lesson
dot PHP and there you can see we got
exactly what you wanted and you'll
notice here that we also received the
value from string variable 2 it was in
fact rendered correctly so we get the
sentence hello how are you doing today
mark now you can also use single quotes
for your string variable instead of
double quotes so let's do that on this
third string variable now I want you to
notice something you notice this isn't
bold anymore
did you notice the intellisense changed
here that's because there is a subtle
difference between using double quotes
and single quotes and that is when you
use single quotes PHP treats this as raw
text
absolute text so this no longer is
treated as a variable it's just plain
old text now so when we reload this over
here we should just get dollar string
there too of course that's not going to
make a lot of sense but that's what we
said we just want the raw text now so
let's go ahead and save this and let's
reload our lesson dot PHP and there you
can see this is exactly what I expected
to get we will only get plain text
because these single quotes treat
everything is just raw text so that's
the subtle difference between using
double quotes and single quotes I do
think for the most part you'll probably
use double quotes but I just wanted to
explain the difference okay that's going
to do it for this video I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
