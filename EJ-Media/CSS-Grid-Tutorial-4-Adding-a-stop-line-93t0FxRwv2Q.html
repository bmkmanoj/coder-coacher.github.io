created this grid and we've added nine
sections now previously we've only been
adding a start line we have not actually
added a stop line so that's what we're
gonna do in this video we're actually
going to go ahead and learn how to add a
start line and specify a stop line so
what we're gonna do is create a section
ten down here and it's gonna span all
three columns and we're actually going
to go ahead and span two more rows so
let's go ahead and do that and we'll
flip to the code and of course we need
to add our section right here so let's
go ahead and do that and we'll call this
section 10 and then let's flip over to
our style sheet and then let's scroll
all the way down and let's go ahead and
just copy and paste this code right here
and we'll call this section 10 so now
we're gonna go ahead and use the same
property which is grid column and we're
gonna go ahead and start this off at
columbine one which is right here and
then what we do to add a stop line is
put a slash and then we specify the stop
line and in this case we want to stop it
at line four so let's go ahead and put a
4 here so the way this will work now is
this section will span all the way from
column line 1 and work its way over to
column line 4 and we're actually gonna
put it down here so we're not actually
adding a new column here but we do need
to add new rows because we want to put
it down here and of course we need to
add the rows up here so let's go ahead
and just add those rows really quickly
here so we need a fourth row and we're
gonna create a fifth row there we go ok
so let's go ahead and go back down here
and so what we're gonna do now is start
this off at row line 4 and then we're
gonna end it at row line 6 and of course
I don't have this in this diagram here
but you can kind of see how it would
work we're gonna start at row line 4 and
row line 5 would be roughly here and
then row line 6 would be roughly here so
we're gonna go all the way down to that
row line 6 and let's go ahead and make
the color green okay so let's go ahead
and save this and then let's go over to
our index.html and save this and this
go ahead and run this in the browser and
let's see what we get and take a look at
that
there's our section 10 look at that it
worked perfectly
it takes up two rows and it spans across
our three columns so there you go now
that you know how to add a starting line
and a stop line you can go ahead and
create different sections now and put
them wherever you want okay that's gonna
do it for this video I will see you guys
in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
