four elements the bold element the
strong element the italic element and
the e/m element now the bold and strong
element are very similar but there are
some subtle differences and the italic
and the e/m element are very similar as
well with some subtle differences so
we'll discuss those differences in this
video as well so to make our text bulb
we use the B tag which gives us a bold
element so let's just go ahead and do
that really quickly and we'll just go
ahead and copy and paste this over here
and of course we need to close this out
now so let's go ahead and save this
let's hit refresh and there you can see
we've got our bold text now let's go
ahead and create a strong element and
you guessed it the name of the tag is
strong and then let's just go ahead and
copy and paste this as well over here to
close it out and let's do that and then
let's go ahead and hit save let's
refresh now you're going to take a look
at this and go what is the difference
here visually and the answer to that is
there is nothing different visually they
look exactly the same because visually
they are the same well what's the
difference well in fact there is a
slight difference and the strong element
in addition to making the text bold also
adds emphasis to the text and what do I
mean by that well it adds some
additional information and that means it
can be used in different ways and
perhaps the biggest difference is that
the strong element can be used by
text-to-speech programs which of course
are used by blind people with a bold
element you do not get that it's just
purely for style so again with the
strong element you can place emphasis on
certain words even though stylistically
the two elements look exactly the same
so if all you care about is the visual
style then by all means use the bold
element now I will say that going
forward if and when there is an HTML 6
they might add additional functionality
to the strong element but not to the
bold element so you may want to just use
this for future purposes as well now the
italic and e/m element have the same
relationship basically the e/m element
also adds emphasis in the way the strong
element does and it can be read by
text-to-speech programs which again are
used by blind people but let's go ahead
and put both of these elements in now so
we'll just do that
and we'll go ahead and just close it out
and let's just go ahead and put the EML
iment in as well because we can and
let's go ahead and save everything up
let's hit refresh and there you can see
we've italicized some of our text now
and again the e/m and the italic element
look exactly the same but once again the
e/m element just like the strong element
add some additional information to the
text okay that's going to do it for this
video I will see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
