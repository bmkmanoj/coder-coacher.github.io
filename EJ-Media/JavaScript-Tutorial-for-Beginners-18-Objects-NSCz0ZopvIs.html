JavaScript objects and we're not
actually going to do any coding in this
video so you can kick back and relax put
the keyboard aside because I want to
just explain the concept of objects and
then in the next few videos we'll
actually code an object up but in this
video and in the next one we're just
going to talk about the concepts of what
a JavaScript object is now objects are
used in literally every hopi language
and javascript is no exception to that
now when people first hear about objects
they are very very intimidated by this
and they really are not intimidated
actually once you understand the concept
they're pretty easy to understand now
what if we were creating a game and we
wanted to create an orc in our game and
so could we use a single variable over
here to describe that work in this case
we've just got a single variable that
holds the value of green now can that
really describe what an orc is not
really could the variable height with
just one value here could that describe
an orc not really so by themselves these
variables don't mean a lot but if we put
them all together wrap them all up and
assign them to one variable now they
mean something all these variables
together assign to this variable orc and
yes an object actually is a variable but
we can call it an object now because we
are putting all these variables into our
object variable as I like to call it and
so at a basic level that's what an
object is we're just taking all of these
variables wrapping them all up and
putting them in between these squiggly
brackets and that gets us our object
because we can now assign it to one
variable our variable work now the other
important point to make here is it the
variables that we put in here should be
related to an orc not something else so
for instance I wouldn't put a value in
here for a car engine or something that
is unrelated to an orc that's the point
of an object these all should be related
in some way to our object which is an
orc now once we put variables inside an
object they are actually called
properties and so that's what they call
them they are variable State but they
want to use the name property so they
actually are called properties so again
I want you to start thinking of objects
as something that exists in real life
and
objects in real life have multiple
properties and you can think of
literally anything think of a lamp a
lamp has multiple properties it has a
height it has a width it has a lampshade
it has a manufacturer those are all
properties that we could put inside of
our object and store them now how do we
access an object it's very simple we use
the object name which in this case is or
that always comes first followed by a
dot and basically all the dot does is
tell JavaScript what we're going to
access inside of our object in this case
height so think of it that way it's just
a way to access a specific property
inside of our object and in this case
height we could put weight here we could
put color and so that's what that dot
does and so the property always comes
after the dot the object name always
comes before the dot so that's the way
to understand that now you might have
also noticed something else this
variable or property inside of our
object looks a little bit different from
our standalone variable you'll notice
that we lopped off the var and that's
the key point here we don't put the var
keyword in here and you'll also notice
we drop the equal sign and now we're
using a colon and we don't use a
semicolon we use a comma to separate
each one of our properties the last one
doesn't actually need a comma so the
last one doesn't need one you can
actually put a comma there but it
doesn't need it now you will also hear
these properties referred to as name
value pairs so this is the name this is
the value together they're called name
value pairs so just yet another
nomenclature that you might hear out
there so at a basic level that is how
objects work now you might ask the
question well wait a minute in the last
video we did these arrays and they hold
multiple values aren't those objects as
well in the answer to that is yes but
they are not normal objects in the way
we like to think of them they're a
little bit different now the main
difference is you will remember in the
last video each one of these values has
an index so this first one would be 0
the second one would be 1 this third one
would be 2 and so on
but normal objects have the name value
pair we don't need to use index we just
specify a name here
and then associate our value over here
it's just an index number now it's a lot
easier to remember a name than it is a
number so that's why objects are much
easier to use if you have different data
types and in this case we have a string
data type this case we have an integer
for our data type we could also have a
boolean as a true/false so arrays are
really not practical for storing
different types of data types they're
actually better if you're storing one
type of data type and especially if
you're using integers so if we go one
two three four five six seven eight we
had to store a bunch of integers and in
that case arrays are useful because we
don't necessarily need to remember the
name but we'll talk about arrays in
future videos and why we want to use
arrays as opposed to objects but objects
are going to be the primary thing you're
going to be dealing with because once
again that name value pair is much
easier to use that an index so if we
wanted to access the height I don't have
to go in here and find out what the
index is I can just write ork dot height
and then we can go ahead and do whatever
we want with the value so let's flip
back to the other slide so once again we
are simply taking a bunch of variables
that are doing something similar and
wrapping it up into an object in this
case ork
and again that gets us our object now in
this video we've just talked about
properties that describe our object but
what if artwork needs to run and perform
some actions well that's different
because properties don't do that they
just describe the orc but they do not
provide any action and so there are two
parts to an object there are the
properties that describe the object and
then there are actions that the orc can
do such as run swim eat all these
different actions and that's what we
will talk about in the next video see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
