JavaScript syntax and we've been talking
a lot about functions and so far we've
just been passing information into our
functions and so this six would go into
the X and the five would go into the Y
and then they would be multiplied and in
this case the function would write out
the result which of course is our
variable and if we ran this this would
be written out to the browser the key
point here is the function is doing this
and the other point is that we're only
sending information into the function
but what if we want to send information
back to where we called the function
from and that is done with the return
statement and so again we can send
information into a function and we can
also have the function return
information and that's what we're going
to cover in this video so we use the
return statement so let's go ahead and
get rid of this document dot right
because we're not going to have the
function do this now we're actually
going to use a return statement here so
I'll copy and paste that in here and so
now what will happen is the value that
we got after we multiplied this will be
returned to whatever called the function
and in this case of course we called it
right down here when we specified the
add function now we could just return it
to here but let's actually return this
to a variable and so let's make a
variable here and I should also point
out that you don't have to necessarily
just specify the function name to call a
function variables also can call
functions also and we had actually done
that in earlier videos so again you
don't have to just specify the function
name you can actually create a variable
and the variable can call into the
function so I'll show you that now so
let's type in the variable keyword we'll
call this variable the result and of
course we'll have to use the equals
operator and there you can see now we've
got a variable and it's kind of doing
the same thing right we're actually
going to call it but we're doing it with
a variable and so let's go ahead and
save this and let's go ahead and run
this and we didn't get anything and I
expected that and I'll explain why and
the reason is we didn't do a document
dot write but before I get to that let's
actually walk through what happened
again the variable called the function
and we did the same thing as when we we
just used the function name before we
passed in a 6 &amp;amp; a 5 it came in through
our parenthesis and then it was
multiplied right here and here's where
it's a little bit different again we
returned the result back to the variable
so we sent something back we sent the
value back to the result variable that
called the function in the first place
so the value of this now is actually 30
now the reason we didn't see that is
because we need to do something with
this variable now right we didn't do
anything with this variable so let's
actually go ahead and write this out and
so if we go ahead and do a document dot
write and we'll write out the variable
let's go ahead and save this and now we
should get the result of 30 and there
you see we got the expected result so
again all you're doing when you use the
return keyword is you're sending
something back to whatever called the
function in the first place okay that's
going to do it for this video I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
