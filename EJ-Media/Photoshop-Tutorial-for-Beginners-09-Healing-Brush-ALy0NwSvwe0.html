Healing Brush in this video we're gonna
cover the Healing Brush now the main
difference between the Spot Healing
Brush and the Healing Brush is that in
the Spot Healing Brush as I mentioned in
the last video it automatically will
attempt to heal whatever it is you're
trying to heal you do not pick the
sample with the healing brush you pick
the sample so that is the key difference
and so what we're gonna do is try to
remove the portion of the building right
here so we just want to show the sky
against this rough and we're gonna use
the healing brush for that but first
let's go ahead and zoom in a little bit
here so we're just gonna right-click and
zoom in and there there we go and again
what we want to do is get rid of this
portion of the building so let's go
ahead and select the Healing Brush and
it's already selected for me but if you
haven't selected it go ahead and select
it now if you try to go ahead and heal
this before you've picked a sample area
watch what happens Photoshop is going to
go ahead and tell you to all click to
define a source point so basically we
need to pick the sample before we can
attempt to do a repair so let's go ahead
and hit OK to this so go ahead and hit
down the alt button now you'll notice
that we get a target and basically
that's your prompt to go ahead and
select a sample area now what we want to
do is kind of sample some of this rough
as well as some of the sky so let's go
ahead and do that right here as much as
we can now notice when I let up on the
button it now shows what we went ahead
and picked as a sample that's the
preview and so what we want to do now is
drag this over here and sort of just
line this up nice and neat and when you
think it's lined up appropriately go
ahead and click and there you can see it
merged it in now sometimes you can see
it left a little bit of blend there so
sometimes you have to retry this over
and over again so let's go ahead and try
it again and see that worked a lot
better so again sometimes you'll get the
result you want sometimes you won't the
key is just to keep trying it over and
over again till you get it to your
liking so that's how you use the Healing
Brush now what I'm going to do is go
ahead and open up some shapes that I
created so we're gonna open up this PNG
file here you can see here it still has
that sample that we selected in the last
photo now the Healing Brush is not just
used to heal things it also can be used
to create some really
cool effects so for instance let's say
we wanted to go ahead and blend in this
square with this red circle over here
well let's go ahead and hit the Alt
button and let's just go ahead and
target all of this there we go now let's
go over here and let's just start
painting and see how it's blending in
and I'll take a look at that so you can
do some really cool effects with the
Healing Brush as well again it's not
just for healing it also can be used to
blend in shapes we can even blend in a
portion of this photograph into this so
let's go back to this image and let's
just go ahead and hit the Alt key and
we'll target this window right here so
let's just go ahead and target all this
and then let's go back to our shapes
image and we'll just start drawing over
there see how it's blending it in take a
look at that so you can do some really
interesting effects again with the
Healing Brush you can blend in all sorts
of objects from different photographs
okay that's gonna do it for this video
thanks again for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
