at how to nest columns inside other
columns in bootstrap and it's actually
not that hard once you get the concept
down that's really all it is now let's
go ahead and load up our web page so
what we want to do is go ahead and nest
some columns inside of this main column
so that's what we're going to do so
we're gonna go right here of course here
is our div for our main columns we want
to nest it within this div right here so
we're going to go ahead and create some
space here and we're gonna do it right
after this text this main call text so
we're gonna go ahead and hit enter and
make some space so there we go so what
we want to do now is place some new
columns in here that's exactly what we
want to do now the first thing we need
to do is create another row right
because we know that rows organize our
columns so we just go ahead and copy and
paste that up here and we're going to
create another div we got to close it
out so let's just do that real quick and
there you can see we've got our row now
now we can go ahead and start to create
our columns so let's go ahead and just
copy this column right up here and we're
just gonna go ahead and copy and paste
this right into here there we go so now
we've got our first column so let's size
this and let's actually make this an MD
for now keep in mind this will scale to
the size of our main column and
bootstrap handles that for you so
basically this MD 4 would be a different
size if it was outside of our MD 6
column but since it's inside here it'll
scale to this MD 6 just wanted to let
you know that okay
now let's go ahead and we're gonna
create a different class and we're gonna
call this inside 4 column inside so
that's what we're going to name our
class and for the text let's just call
this inside column that works okay so
let's go ahead and save this and now
let's open up our style sheet and then
what we want to do is just go ahead and
create some rules here for our new class
and so we'll just go ahead and copy and
paste out here and remember that was
call inside good and we don't need
margin let's get rid of that we'll set
the minimum height to 100 pixels will
Center the text we'll continue doing
that and let's go ahead and set the
color to orange okay so let's go ahead
and save this and let's go ahead and see
what we get hey good look at that now
you might be wondering well why do we
have all this gray space here keep in
mind this is a row with columns so if
you want this column larger you could
make this an MD 8 9 10 11 12 - size it
all the way and let's let's do that
let's go ahead and do that right now so
let's set this to a 12 and this should
scale the entire remember that's as far
as you can go 12 I believe so let's go
ahead and save that and let's rerun this
there take a look now that column goes
all the way across that basically means
hey set the width at a hundred percent
of this main column now you could say
hey I'm done that's fine that's all you
want and that's great but what if you
want to add multiple columns here well
it's pretty simple right you could
actually create another row in here like
we did with our main page but let's go
ahead and set this back to four and
let's go ahead and copy and paste this
in a couple times now oops
we just need all of this right here I
know this is not aligned but I'm just
sort of moving along here pretty quick
well let's go ahead and just copy and
paste this twice over so we'll go ahead
and one more paste after this and let's
go ahead and save this and now we should
have three columns in there let's take a
look take a look at that we've got three
columns now and they are all sized
appropriately so again it's sort of the
same concept that we've been talking
about when you play around with the size
of the columns you just use that number
at the end of the class four or five six
seven eight whatever you want you can go
ahead and arrange these in whatever
manner you want okay so that's how you
nest columns in bootstrap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
