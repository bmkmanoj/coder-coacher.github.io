look at what events are and we covered
the on click event and of course we set
up a button so that when the user
clicked on that button the on click
event triggered JavaScript code in this
video we are going to look at the mouse
over event this event gets triggered
when the user moves his or her mouse
over an HTML element and this mouse over
event works with almost all HTML
elements so you can choose the element
or elements that you want to change when
a user rolls over that element now
similar to the on click event the mouse
over has the word on before it so it's
actually on mouse over and you'll see it
in a few seconds so again a mouse over
event gets triggered when your user puts
their mouse over a particular element so
in this case we have a paragraph element
so remember we need to place the event
in our HTML element that's the first
thing we have to do the element that we
want to change so I'll go ahead and just
copy and paste here and there you can
see we have the on mouse over event
that's what the name is and then we're
going to call our function which I have
named change background so when we hover
over our paragraph element the
background color over our text should
change and then let's go over and take a
look at our JavaScript code and you can
see here I'm defining a variable text
and we're doing what we've been doing
right we're going to get the element ID
para that's the first thing we have to
do in our two-step process and then we
have to do something in this case we're
going to use the style object we're
going to use the background color
property which of course is part of the
style object and we're just going to
change that to red so let's go ahead and
see what we get here and we'll launch
this in chrome and there you can see we
got our background color red but you'll
notice that when I move the cursor off
of the text the background color just
stays up and that's probably not what we
want we want this to be a little bit
more responsive so what we want is when
the user moves is cursor off of the text
we want that background color to go away
and we actually have to create another
event to handle that
so actually you get to learn about two
events in this video two for the price
of one so let's go ahead and set that up
so we need to come back to our HTML code
and add that other event and it's
actually not onmouseover because that
event occurs when we put the cursor over
our element so we need to put the event
right past our first event here which
was onmouseover and I'll go ahead and
copy and paste this in here and you can
see it's called the on Mouse out event
appropriately named so when we move our
mouse off of this element the background
color will go away and I've
appropriately named the function back to
normal so now we actually need to add
this function so let's go over to our
JavaScript code and we can just copy and
paste what we had here and then we're
just going to change this back to normal
now what's different here is that we
just need to get rid of our styling so
we're doing the same thing we have to
get the element ID we have to use the
style object and then the background
color property and all we do is just get
rid of the red here the value and this
will remove the styling and let's go
back to our web page and you know what I
need to put a quote there because this
won't work without a quote big mistake
okay we don't need to close we just need
one
so let's see what we get here and
there's our background color and there
you can see when we hover over it it
works and when we go off it it did not
work so I made a mistake so that's fine
let's go back and see what we did wrong
here what I did wrong so we have our
back to normal function let's go over to
our JavaScript code and take a look here
ah take a look at that these function
names are case sensitive I'm actually
glad this happened
you can see just how sensitive
JavaScript code can be so let's try this
again and now it should work hopefully
and there you can see it works so you
can see now how we can use multiple
events to do multiple things in
JavaScript okay that's going to do it
