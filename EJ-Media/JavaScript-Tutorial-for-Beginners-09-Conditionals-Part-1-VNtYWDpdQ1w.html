JavaScript syntax and in this video
we're going to take a look at
conditionals now if you have experience
in other languages conditionals will be
very familiar to you now there are many
different types of conditions in
JavaScript in this video we're going to
examine the if statement and the else
statement but first we will start out
with the if statement now an if
statement simply examines whether a
condition is true or not and we'll talk
more about that in a second now this is
just a basic if statement that we're
starting out with here and it always
starts out with the if keyword and
that's always in lower case now our
condition goes inside these parentheses
right here and this can only be true or
false there is no in-between here true
or false if it is true then we will
execute all of the code that is placed
between these squiggly brackets if it is
false
then nothing will happen with this code
that I currently have so we would
actually just get a blank screen because
no code will be executed now what our
conditionals conditionals are all about
decisions you make decisions every day
in your life whether you go to work or
not whether you brush your teeth
whether you do any number of thousands
of things that you do every day but a
computer doesn't know that and so we
have to tell it when to execute
particular pieces of code that we want
to execute and actually conditionals are
very important because you might not
want to execute all of the JavaScript
code that you have in your file you may
only want to execute certain sections
and that's where conditionals come into
play now as I said we put the condition
between the parentheses and what are we
testing out here well in this case we're
going to test out whether a variable has
a particular value or not so first let's
create the variable and we're going to
create a variable called food and it's
going to store our string called Apple
which of course is a particular type of
fruit now let's place the condition
inside the parentheses so what I've done
here is I've said food which of course
is the variable double equal sign here
and then of course our value now let me
explain this this double equals is not
an actual assignment operator
now you will remember up here we are
assigning the value of Apple to the
variable food this is actually
completely different here we are
examining this variable to see if it has
the value of Apple and so that's what
the equals equals does it has nothing to
do with assigning a value that is simply
examining this variable scrutinizing
this variable to see if this indeed
equals Apple and in this case of course
it does
so this condition would test out to be
true and so we would execute whatever
code we put in here so let's go ahead
and put some code in here and we will
just do an alert and we're going to
alert with the following string we ate
some fruit and specifically an apple
okay and let's save this and we'll run
this from our web page and you can see
we get the message we ate some fruit and
specifically an apple so let's close all
this out
now let's change the value of our food
variable to meat now of course this
condition is not true so this should not
be executed and we should get a blank
screen so let's see what happens here
and nothing and that's what we expected
and maybe you want that maybe that's
exactly what you want you want in this
case nothing to happen but let's say you
do want some code executed for a false
condition then that is where the else
statement comes into play and that
always goes right below the if statement
so let's put an else in here and I'm
just going to copy and paste this in
here and here is our else now basically
as I said in else is an else will only
be executed if this condition is false
so for every other value other than
Apple the else will be triggered so I
could put airplane in here I don't know
why a food would be an airplane but any
value other than Apple will get the else
statement triggered actually let's just
say we ate something else about that and
let's go ahead then and save this and
we'll run this and there you can see we
got the alert we ate something else and
so that is how the if-else works now I
will point out that an else does not
work by itself you must have an if
statement first and then you can add an
L
if you want but it's not mandatory you
could just use an if statement but you
must have an if statement in order to
have an else statement and again this is
the false condition okay in the next
video we're going to talk about adding
multiple conditions and we're actually
going to use this same code so if you
type this out
save it and I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
