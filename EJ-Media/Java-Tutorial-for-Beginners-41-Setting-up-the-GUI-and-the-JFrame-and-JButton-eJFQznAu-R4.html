we're finally going to look at gooeys
and we've all heard of those now if
you're going to be building a business
application or a game you're eventually
going to need a graphical user interface
and so over the next several tutorials
we're going to be going over setting up
a GUI now in this tutorial we're going
to set up a windowpane and then I'll
show you how to add a button to that
windowpane and we'll be using Java swing
now there's also Java FX we'll get into
that later on right now Java swing is
kind of the mainstream default Java GUI
toolkit to use but it really doesn't
matter which you use the basic concepts
are the same you have to setup user
events and action listeners and that
we'll be getting into in a few videos
and so of course we need a window and it
is the jframe you see that right here
we're going to create a object that is
what the window will be and then you can
see right here we're going to create a
button and again they're both objects we
create an object for our window which is
the jframe
and then we create a button to add to
that window or inside the window and
you'll notice that when we fire this off
it looks like a normal window that you
would see in any Windows app you can
minimize it maximize it close the window
all those types of things and so the
first thing we want to do is use the
import feature and we want to import
java swing and you want to type this out
if you're following along here exactly
like this we don't want to put a star in
front of the swing because we only want
to import the java swing classes because
that will add a lot of unnecessary
overhead if you add all the java X
classes we don't want that and so what
does this do it gives us access again to
all the java swing classes and that's
what this is this jframe class that's
what we're going to be building our
object off of so we don't have to create
the class it's a class that's already
there and we can tune it the way we want
to use it in our application and here's
the object name we gave it which was
frame and it's just like we've been
doing all along we've been creating new
objects no difference the only
difference is we're going against a
class that's already been created for us
and so we don't have to create that
window so again this will create the
jframe or window or window pane whatever
you want to call it and then we need to
add stuff to it right and we're going to
add a button and we're going to use the
J button class for that that's in swing
as well so it's all
err it's all ready to go and we're going
to create a new object in the
constructor we're going to actually
create a title for it which will be
called submit that's text as you can see
so it'll be a submit button now in a few
videos I'll teach you how to actually
create a user event with this to trigger
a user event and then it's just like
we've been doing all along once we have
our object created our jframe object we
can go ahead and use it so you know if
we type in frame here we can go ahead
and use all the methods that are
associated with that and it says please
wait because there's a lot of them you
can see all these methods now we can use
these have already been created for us
and you could go in here look all these
up and see what they do and we'll get
rid of that so we're going to be using a
few methods here to start out with the
set default close operation method now
basically what this does is once you
close out of the window the program will
stop if you don't have this actually
will keep running how does it know so
you need this exit on close parameter
and this actually adds the button so
we're going to add the button now you
might be wondering well why or why don't
we do J button dot well because we're
adding this button to our J frame so we
need to actually use the frame object to
add the button object the button is an
object within the frame object so we're
using the add method to do that and then
we're going to set the size of the
window you guys can play around with
this I believe this is the width and
this is the height now if you're not
certain you can always right-click on
these methods navigate to the source and
it'll take you to the actual class that
we're using and here you can see right
here it says it right here for a set
size its width and height and they are
int values so that's very useful you can
always drill down into these classes to
see what they're doing and they have
some nice notes sometimes these make
sense sometimes they do not make sense
there you go with that okay and then
we're going to set visible to true
that's another method now if we don't do
this we won't actually see our window so
that's another thing that needs to be
done you need to set it to visible and
so let's go ahead and run this and you
can see we got our very first window
here and we've got our nice little
submit button
and you know we're clicking on it
nothing's happened we're going to get to
that in another video but you can click
on it nothing is going to happen of
course but that's what we've got you can
move it around you can minimize it you
can maximize it just like any normal
window in Windows now you might be
asking how do I Center this because if
you'll note let's run this again
actually and you'll notice the window is
situated on the top-left corner how do
you actually get that to Center and
there's actually a method for that I
will show you that right now and then we
can do our usual frame dot will use our
object and get all the methods for the
jframe and I believe it's set location
relative to I believe this see there's a
lot of these methods here this is it
right here
and we're going to set this to null and
now let's go ahead and run this again
and it should go in the center hopefully
and there you can see the window is in
the center okay that is going to do it
for this video in the next several
videos again as I said we'll be setting
up action listeners responding to user
events and doing all sorts of things
with gooeys see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
