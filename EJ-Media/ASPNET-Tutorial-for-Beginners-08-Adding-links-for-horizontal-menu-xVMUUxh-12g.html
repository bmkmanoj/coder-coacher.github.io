horizontal menu that we created in CSS
layout tutorial number eleven so if you
want to see how I created that code and
how that code works please go watch that
video now if you haven't already so the
first thing we're gonna do is open up
our master page and so I'm going to go
ahead and paste the code that we used in
CSS layout tutorial number eleven the
HTML code that is and this will look
very familiar
I've eliminated a couple buttons we're
only gonna do a home button and a
contact us button for now now we will
add some future buttons and later videos
but for now we're just going to add a
home button and a contact us button now
let's go ahead and open up our style
sheet and we're gonna go down to our
navigation section and I'm going to go
ahead and copy and paste over the
existing code we have and I'm going to
copy and paste the CSS code that we
created in CSS layout tutorial number 11
and you know what I forgot something we
need the you ELLs here forgot those and
let's just go ahead and close this out
there we go all right let's go ahead and
load this up and we'll see what this
looks like just to make sure our
horizontal menu is there and it's
looking good and it is and there you can
see and that looks very similar of
course to the menu we designed in the
CSS layout 11 tutorial now this is where
we're going to get to the ASP part of
this and we want to add a link for our
home button and then a new page for the
contact us we want to actually load a
new page but for the home button we
actually want to load this page and what
do I mean by that well let's say we
drill down into one of our articles and
now we want to get back to the main home
page if we hit the home button nothing
happens right so that's the goal is to
be able to get back to the main home
page with all of our mini menus and so
let's handle that first so we'll close
this out and so let's go back to our
master page and now we're gonna put our
link right here and we want to link back
to our default page right that has all
of our menus in it right if we take a
look at this right here here's our mini
menu our Rome mini menu of course
so that's what we want to link back to
and so let's go ahead and put that in
for our href so I'll copy and paste it
in here and there's the backslash of
course for root directory and then
default dot aspx a little point right
back to our default content page which
of course is the first page on our
website which of course is where we want
to link back to to get you back in case
you drill down deep into our website so
let's go ahead and see if it works
so we'll reload our website and now in
order to simulate this we need to drill
down into our article we hit the home
button and look at that we're back at
our default content page and this gets
the user back so that they can go ahead
and browse another subject if they want
now let's create a page for our contact
us so let's close this out and go back
to our visual studio session and off of
our web pages let's create a new folder
and we're going to call this Mis see for
miscellaneous because this really isn't
a major subject it's just our contact us
page so we really don't need to create a
subject folder we'll just have a
miscellaneous folder where we can dump
various pages into and so there we go
now let's right-click on that and we're
gonna go ahead and add new item we're
going to create a web form of course and
that of course is always a aspx dot web
page and we're just going to call this
contact that's good and of course we
select our master page to base it off of
and again there it is we just need to
have that selected we do and we hit OK
and there we go we've got our contact
aspx web page and you can see here as I
mentioned the last video our content
placeholder ID is automatically created
for us so I'm gonna go ahead and copy
and paste the code I created for this
and it's just some simple code and we're
gonna reuse the div class that we've
been using for our content pages which
is content text and you will remember
that gives us a nice margin and
increases our text size to 16 pixels and
so what we have here is a feel free to
contact us you know all this stuff and
an email now will add forms later on to
this but for now we're just gonna use
this code so let's go ahead and save
everything up now and let's see if that
link whoops wait before we do that sorry
we've got to go actually add the link I
forget that and I'll just copy and paste
the path and there you can see we've got
our path webpages the NISC folder and
the contact
aspx page so let's go ahead and make
sure it works let's go ahead and load up
our website and we'll hit the contact us
now isn't that nice we've got a contact
us web page now you'll notice that we're
actually linking to our content page and
that of course again is done with this
main content one here and you'll notice
that's from our master page because we
didn't put a content placeholder in the
nav right we want all the content to be
in our main content panel even if we
create other links on our master
template we want those to be shown in
our main content panel okay that's gonna
do it for this video in the next video
we're gonna move on to some new subjects
that we'll come back to the navigational
side of things but we're gonna explore
some new subjects in the next video
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
