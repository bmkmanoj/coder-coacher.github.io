tutorial on filters today we're going to
go over some of the filters that are
available up here on the menu under
filters and as you can see there are
several of these guys so obviously we're
not going to have the time to go through
every one of them and another thing I'd
like to point out is if you go out to
Google and do a search out there you can
find several free designs that you can
use so you just type in free designs or
designs in the public domain you can
also type in like spirals free spirals
and you'll find several things that you
can play with ok so let's go ahead and
look at some of these filters now I'm
going to select this first one this
black one if you go up to filters I'll
show you some of these under Port Rouge
ins you can add fire to this and you can
see how this can really add some nice
effects to whatever designs you make and
let's undo that you can add you know
cracked lava to these things and you can
get some really as I said before he can
get some really neat designs and then
you can go ahead and add you know what
you can add more effects on top of that
like we just did fire let's go ahead and
add that again and there you can see you
can do multiple filters on the same
design another one that I like is under
bevels and it's called bright metal now
bevels is really good there's several
good ones you can use under here there's
one that will make it look like jelly as
you can see there let's undo that
there's another bevel that makes it
bright metal which gives it a metal cast
so that's kind of a cool one now another
filter that I like is the snow filter so
you go down to four to Xian's
and hit snow crest and this one you can
actually tune you can actually make the
drift you know larger if you want hit
apply and then you see you get a snow
effect so that's pretty cool now let's
add an effect of this gray rectangle and
one that I like to use is the stone
effect now where is that there's so many
of these as you can see believe that is
under textures okay so and you select
stone wall and you get a nice stone
effect now if you have some photos
there's also some image filters that you
can play
with one image that you might want to
add is film grain so you can see we
added film grain to that so under the
image effects you can do the various
things to this you can make it look like
an oil painting if you want so that's
pretty cool as well you can also play
around with text so if we select this
Inkscape text that we created here you
can give this a black outline and if you
select black outline again it actually
gets thicker and thicker so that's
pretty cool and there's some other
things you can do with text you can
create a feathered effect okay that's
going to wrap it up for this tutorial
