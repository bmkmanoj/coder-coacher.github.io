vertical menu using the jQuery UI and
you might recognize this layout we
developed this of course in the CSS
layout series and if you took that you
probably already have this code but if
you don't I will upload it in the
description of this video now we're
going to add a vertical menu to this
sidebar right here and so let's go ahead
and do that but before we do that I want
you to open up your previous website
folder now you may want to save that and
just copy and paste the entire folder
and we'll be using the same jQuery UI
folder as well as the same jQuery
library so these two will be the same
and you can use whatever version of
jQuery that you're using and then I will
provide the source in the description of
this video for the index.html and the
stylesheet and here is our index.html
now you can see this is very similar to
the previous web pages we've been
working against in this series I've just
added the CSS for our main style dot CSS
and of course the jQuery UI CSS files
and down here this will look very
familiar again I've added the main
jQuery library and you may need to
change this part for whatever version
you're using and of course I've added
the jQuery UI library and then of course
you'll recognize here is our jQuery
source so we're all good to go now we
want to add that vertical menu to our
sidebar and we have of course a div
section for that that we created in the
CSS layout series here it is right here
so let's go ahead and as you know the
first thing we need to do is create an
unordered list with list items before we
can create any menu so let's go ahead
and do that and the first thing we need
is a UL element tag and let's go ahead
and give that an ID and this will be the
ID that we'll specify in our jQuery code
and let's just call this vertical menu
now let's go ahead and add our list
items that we want
and let's go ahead and add an anchor tag
placeholder so we won't actually put in
a page here but we'll go ahead and put
in a placeholder and then let's go ahead
and the first subject will be for
ancient Rome now what we want to do here
is create a secondary menu off of this
subject so we won't close out the li and
we need yet another unordered list so
we'll have another unordered list
embedded inside of this list element
because we want another series of
options so let's go ahead and do that we
need another unordered list element and
then we'll add the list items that we
want off of this list item so let's go
ahead and just we can just actually just
copy and paste this and for these
subjects let's say we were going to talk
about the early period in Roman history
and somehow I lopped off the anchor tag
there now since we're done here we can
go ahead and close out this list item
and let's add a few more list items here
let's go ahead and we'll add a middle
period and we'll go ahead and add a late
period as well
okay this is looking pretty good now we
need to go ahead and close out this
unordered list element so let's do that
and then we need to close out this li
element so let's go ahead and do that as
well
okay looking good so now let's go ahead
and add a few more items and we'll do
we'll just copy and paste all of this
and let's add another subject we're
gonna add a subject on ancient Egypt
let's say that and we'll keep the same
periods and then let's go ahead and copy
and paste once more and we'll add a
subject on Greece as well that's good
now we have to go all the way up here
and we will need to close out this first
unordered list element so we'll go ahead
and close that out right here and then
let's save everything up and let's make
sure our page looks good
so far so we'll watch this in Google
Chrome and great look at this this all
looks really good everything lined up
really nicely now we need to go ahead
and add the jQuery code so let's go
ahead and do that so we'll come down
here and we'll go ahead and specify that
ID that we created of course which is
vertical menu ups I don't need a capital
and then all we do is specify the menu
method which of course is part of the
jQuery UI so let's save this up let's
fire this up and hopefully this looks
really good and I think it will and take
a look at that there it is doesn't that
look great look at that everything fits
really nicely and it's perfectly sized
and if you know from experience these
menus sometimes are very difficult to
size but the jQuery UI handles that very
very nicely indeed okay that's going to
do it for this video now in the next
video we will explore some of the
options that you can use with this menu
