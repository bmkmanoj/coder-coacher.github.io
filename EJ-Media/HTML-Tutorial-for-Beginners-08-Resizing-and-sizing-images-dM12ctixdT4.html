beginning HTML we're going to continue
on with images and specifically today
we're going to cover resizing and sizing
your images so we'll use the same code
that we did from the last video and if
you deleted that I will open that up now
and you can go ahead and hit the pause
button and just copy this and we'll
continue I now so similar to the last
video make a folder called HTML source
and put the image and the HTML file in
the same folder now before we move on I
want to make a couple points first is
you usually use jpg for your best images
so if you have a beautiful landscape
that you want to display you should use
a jpg image but if it's something like a
logo or some little artwork that you're
doing you probably should use a PNG file
or a jiff file so that's kind of the
general standard and of course here I'm
using a jpg file because this is a nice
wonderful photo of Washington DC ok so
let's go ahead and open up the source
now and I'm going to show you how to
resize an image but actually before we
do that let's open up this HTML document
in IE and there you get an idea that's
just a huge image so this was a
realistic website we were doing we would
want to actually change the size of this
image and I will show you how to do that
right now so let's go ahead and reopen
this up in notepad and between this
angle bracket and the ending quote we're
going to go ahead and put in a parameter
called width and we're going to say that
equals and we have to put this in quotes
to 200 and that is pixels so 200 pixels
and then we also have a height attribute
and so we will go ahead and make that
200 as well and let's do a save and
let's reopen this and you can see it's
much smaller now now that might be too
small we could increase that you know to
400 whatever but you get the idea now I
want to point something out here to you
that resize that we just did is done
within the browser so let's imagine that
I'm sitting at a remote computer here at
some other location around the
three and this source is on the server
so this is being sent to my browser the
resize gets done on the users browser so
what I'm saying there is the original
image is sent in its full size so if we
take a look at this image you'll see
it's still a huge image so that will get
sent to this browser and then the
browser will read that HTML document and
resize the image so the point of guess
I'm trying to make here is that that's a
lot of overhead for a huge image like
that
so I'm guess I'm saying if you're making
some minor adjustments to the image you
can go ahead and use that width and
height attribute but if it's an
extremely large image you may want to
just reduce the image itself in one of
the Photoshop editors so if we went to
for instance Microsoft Paint we could go
ahead and resize it right here and we
wouldn't have to put the attributes in
the HTML code so that is how that works
okay I will see you guys in the next 80
