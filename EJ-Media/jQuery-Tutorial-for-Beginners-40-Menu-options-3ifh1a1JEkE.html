some of the options that you can use
with the menu widget in the jQuery UI
now the first thing we can do is replace
these icons kind of like we did in the
accordion so it's the same process you
go to the icon page on the jQuery UI is
main website and you can pick the icon
that you want to use and again it's the
same process so what we want to do is
replace these icons right here that
point to our sub menu or hover menu
whatever you want to call it so let's go
ahead and do that so this is the default
icon that's provided but we want to go
ahead and replace that so let's go ahead
and take a look at the code first of
course you have to specify the icon
property and then within the icon
property we want to use the sub menu
property and that works against the sub
menu that I just showed you and the icon
that I picked off the jQuery UI website
is this circle triangle icon but you can
pick whatever you would like to use so
let's go ahead and save this let's go
ahead and load the page up and there you
can see we got this nice circle triangle
icon down that identifies our sub menu
or hover menu so that's looking pretty
good now what if you want to divide
these sections up in other words divide
our roam section from our Egypt section
while there's a way to do that with the
menu widget and I'll show you so let's
go ahead and close this out and actually
this is not a parameter that we passed
into the argument we can actually do
this within our HTML code up here and
what we want to do is put the code that
I'm about to show you
between our main Rome li element and our
main Egypt li element so right here and
then I'm gonna go ahead and copy and
paste the code and I'll explain it in a
second so there it is so all you do is
you put in an opening and a closing Li
tag and then you put a hyphen between it
and then the jQuery UI will actually
recognize this and put in a nice little
bar between these two sections and the
reason they have this - is because you
probably would never do something like
this so what happens is the jQuery UI
recognizes it and it will create a nice
bar that will separate our section so
let's go ahead and save this and we'll
see what this looks like and there you
can see now the Rome in the Egypt
section are now divided by a horizontal
bar now what if you don't want this over
menu what if you want all the options in
the hover menus placed in
one large panel so our main section
along with all of the options in each
submenu will be placed in one gigantic
panel well you can do that and you can
do that with the menu property so let's
go ahead and edit this a little bit
we'll get rid of all of this and
actually the property we use is called
menus and then the value that we want to
set here is div and actually we don't
need this extra squiggly bracket anymore
and so let's go ahead and see what this
looks like now so we'll save this well
go ahead and refresh our page and take a
look at that the sub menus are all gone
and everything is in one very large
panel and so that's another option that
you can take a look at okay that's going
to do it for this video I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
