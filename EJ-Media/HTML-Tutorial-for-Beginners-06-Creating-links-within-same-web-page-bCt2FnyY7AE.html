HTML in the previous video we set up a
web link to an outside URL in this video
we're going to set up a link within the
same page and so this will kind of be
like a table of contents or we'll set up
a link to an article that's lower down
in the page and so we're going to use
all the tags that we've been doing in
the previous videos so first let's set
up our table of contents
okay so first we're going to create an
unordered list and you'll remember that
from the previous video that we covered
that and then you will remember we have
to put in list elements inside that so
let's create the list tags and then we
are going to go ahead and put that over
here give this some space and close that
now we need to create our anchor tag
remember our anchor tag is our link to
whatever it is we want to go could be an
outside page which we did in the last
video but in this case we're going to
link down to a section in this page and
that will be the article that we are
writing about so let's go ahead and
create our anchor tag remember we keep
that open and remember we have to use
the href attribute to give the anchor
tag a destination that is where are we
going where are we linking to we're
going to put a quote and then we're
going to put a hash tag and the hash tag
is what tells the anchor tag that this
is going to be linking to something
within this webpage that something is
going to be called birds and so we will
call this birds then we will use another
quote and another angle bracket and then
we're going to type in some text and
it's going to be the text for this link
which is birds and actually let's make
that Birds section and then we will
close the anchor tag and let's delete a
few spaces here and let's go ahead and
create another section so we can just
copy and paste that
and we will have a section on ducks and
that's all we need at this point so we
have our menu all set up to link to
lower sections in our web page and now
let's go ahead and create those sections
down here and we will actually let's
create some break tags here just to make
this a little bit realistic and let's go
ahead and use the paragraph tag to
create some text and now we've got to
create another anchor tag because this
is what we are linking to and I will
show you how these hook up in a minute
and we will do name equals quote birds
and then we'll use another angle bracket
and here's what we put in some text this
is the section actually let's say this
this is the article about birds and we
will go ahead and close this with an
anchor tag and close this P tag as well
now this name attribute right here links
up and corresponds to this href
attribute here this hash tag is what
connects to this name attribute so
that's how it works we use this hash tag
and it will look for the anchor tag that
matches birds this attribute name so
that's how this all links up and let's
go ahead and create our other section
and we will just say this is a section
about ducks
and you know what let's add a ton of
breaks here so you can see exactly how
this works because then you'll actually
see the jump that occurs so let's just
put in some massive breaks here assume
that this is a very large web page and
then let's take all those and go down
and copy those in between okay good
let's go ahead and save this and let's
open this up and we click on the birds
and you will see that that jumped to
this article if we go back up here and
hit the ducks it jumps to ducks so okay
and so that's how this works I will see
you guys in the next video where we will
deal with images</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
