html5 now right away I should say that
this is not a beginning series on HTML
so you should have a very good
understanding of HTML CSS and JavaScript
before you take this series because
we're not going to cover those core
concepts so we're not going to cover
what a tag is or an HTML element that is
all discussed in my HTML and CSS series
so again if you are just starting out
you want to go take those three series
and then come back to here so you want
to think of this series more as an
add-on to everything we've done in HTML
CSS and JavaScript and that's the good
thing about html5 if you know HTML it
will be very easy for you to pick up
html5 because as always the core
concepts are still the same now what do
you need for this series well we will be
using notepad plus plus but you can use
any text editor that you have or IDE for
that matter so if you have Dreamweaver
or Visual Studio you can use those as
well or you can just simply use notepad
everything will work just fine now let's
talk about some html5 tidbits the
biggest thing is html5 is backward
compatible so that's a good thing
because all of your old webpages will
work just fine with html5 and that
includes the last release of HTML which
was 4.01 so if you have everything
coated in that format it will work just
fine in html5 html5 is a little bit more
forgiving some elements you don't even
need to include in your webpage anymore
and other elements you do not even need
a closing tag and elements are no longer
case sensitive anymore so you can put
them in uppercase if you want and we'll
talk about that when we cover html5
syntax of course new elements will be
the major focus of this series and we're
going to cover the new semantic elements
for page structure so instead of using a
div tag you can use something more
descriptive like a footer tag and again
we will talk all about this when we get
to page structure in html5
perhaps one of the biggest additions to
html5 is canvas and this allows you to
do all sorts of graphics and this is
becoming very very very
egg in html5 so you can do everything
from drawing to animations and even
gaming and so we will be covering canvas
quite extensively now amazingly HTML had
no built-in support for video or audio
so before html5 you had to use a Flash
plugin
but now html5 has audio and video
elements so we will be covering those in
this series as well and there are some
new features for CSS and JavaScript so
again you need to know those languages
before you take this series so we will
be covering some of those new features
ok we will get going with html5 in the
next video see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
