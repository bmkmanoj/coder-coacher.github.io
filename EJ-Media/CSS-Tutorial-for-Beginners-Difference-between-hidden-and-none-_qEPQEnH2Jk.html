and asked me the difference between the
visibility hidden and the display:none
property what is the difference between
those two because they seem to do the
same thing they both hide the element
and on the service they do but they are
actually very different and so we're
going to talk about it in this lecture
now I want to point out that this is the
code I'm using from the CSS layout
series so some of you will recognize
that if you follow this series so let's
go ahead and load this page up and I
just want to show you something really
quick so here we've got our first main
element which has an ID tag of main and
here is our second element which has an
ID tag of main two so what we're going
to do is we're going to go ahead and
hide this first one but we're gonna go
ahead and keep this second one in both
scenarios because I want to show you how
this works it's better just to see it in
action so again we're keeping the second
element on the page but we're getting
rid of the first main element so that's
what we're gonna do so let's go ahead
and just take a look at the HTML code
real quick and there you can see here's
our first section with an ID tag of main
and here's our second section with an ID
tag of main - but we want to work out of
our style sheet so let's go ahead and
flip over there and let's go down to our
CSS code for our first section which of
course is right here and this is the
only one we're going to be altering
because this is the one we want to hide
so let's take this first one the
visibility:hidden and we're gonna go
ahead and just put this right at the end
here and it should hide it hopefully so
let's save this and let's go ahead and
load our web page and there you can see
the first section is now hidden which is
what we wanted now here is the
difference you'll notice that this
bottom element the main - element did
not move up so that's what the
visibility:hidden does it basically
hides the element but the element is
still there in the background it still
retains its space that's the key it's
still keeping its area the display:none
eliminates it completely so not only is
it hidden
it basically blows the element
completely away it's not even there
physically in the background and we're
gonna see that in a moment so that's the
key difference
okay so let's close this out now and
let's go back to our style sheet and now
let's flip this to display:none
all right there we go
so let's go ahead and save this let's
flip back to our index.html let's go
ahead and load this up and take a look
at that this second main section main to
now moves to the top because as I said
the display:none completely eliminates
the element it is totally gone so that's
the big difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
