how to style the accordion now like many
frameworks there are lots of CSS files
and lots of CSS classes in the jQuery UI
framework and so sometimes it's
beneficial to go ahead and use the
inspect option that is provided in
Google Chrome
there's also similar tools in ie and
Firefox but we're going to go ahead and
do this from the chrome perspective so
the first thing we want to do is go
ahead and alter this header we want to
alter the colors so let's go ahead and
actually expand this out now in order to
do an inspect it's very simple you just
come down here you right click on the
element that you want to inspect you hit
the inspect button and then look at all
this information we get and the critical
piece here is you can see the CSS file
where all the properties are located and
it's in the jQuery - UI dot structure
dot CSS file we know about that one we
use that one before and then we can see
where the rule set is it's in this UI -
accordion - header so that's what we're
looking for so let's go ahead and resize
this again and now let's go ahead and
we'll go to the jQuery UI folder and you
guessed it we're going to go to the UI
dot structure CSS file and we're gonna
edit that in notepad plus plus and then
remember what we're looking for we're
looking for that UI accordion header so
let's go down here you could actually do
a search on this but I'm just gonna go
ahead and scroll down here and it's
usually in these visuals and what right
there it is UI - accordion header so by
using the inspect button this is how we
found this it's really easy to use and
again it's very useful if you have very
large CSS files and actually to prepare
for this lecture I had to actually use
the inspect button trust me I can't
remember everything and that's certainly
something I can't remember so you know
what let's close this out for now and
what do we want to change in here let's
change the color of the text and let's
change that to red we'll give this a
little bit of a roman look or something
so we'll put in color red and let's make
the background black so we'll change
that color
and then let's go ahead and give this a
more meaningful border so we'll go ahead
and use the border property of course
and let's make it five pixels wide we'll
make it a nice big border and we'll make
it solid green so let's go ahead and
save this let's refresh our page take a
look at that and actually I kind of like
that better than what the jQuery UI
provided now we want to change the
content panel as well so let's go ahead
and expand this out again and let's just
right click right on that element and
we'll hit inspect and there you can see
we need the accordion - content class
that's what we need to update so let's
go ahead and look for that so we'll just
scroll down here I think it's pretty
close actually
and it is right there take a look at
that actually let's go grab these two
properties right here and we'll just
come down and copy and paste these right
in here
so what do we want let's go ahead and
we'll make the color of the text brown
and let's make the background of the
content panel light yellow and then
let's actually make the text bold so
we'll go font weight and we'll make that
bold so let's go ahead and save this
let's expand this out again
let's hit refresh and there you can see
we've got our new theme so again it's
not too hard to navigate around
complicated CSS style sheets using the
inspect option in Google Crump okay
that's gonna do it for this video I will
see you guys in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
