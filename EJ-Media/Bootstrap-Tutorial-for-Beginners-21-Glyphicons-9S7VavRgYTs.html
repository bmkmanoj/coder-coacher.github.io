to use a glyph icon in bootstrap so
let's go ahead and we'll add it to our
existing navbar that we've been working
on in the last several videos so let's
go ahead and fire up what we've got so
far and what we want to do is put two
new buttons over here a login button and
a contact button and what we want to do
is add bootstrap Clif icons to those as
well but first let's go ahead and create
the buttons so we can just borrow what
we coded here so we'll just copy this
and we'll go right below our existing UL
element and we'll copy and paste right
here good and we can use these same
classes that's all good
we don't need an active button so let's
go ahead and get rid of that and we
obviously only need two buttons so we'll
get rid of this Flast one and so for
this button again we're gonna call that
contact us and then again for this
bottom one we're gonna call this login
good now we also want to float this to
the right so we're gonna go ahead and
use that navbar right class that we used
in the last video okay great so let's go
ahead and save this and let's go ahead
and run this in Chrome and let's see
what we get there everything looks good
now you might be wondering why isn't our
search bar all the way to the right
shouldn't this be to the far right well
it works a little bit differently in
bootstrap and I'll show you what happens
here so if you have two elements that
are using navbar right the first element
that uses that class in other words our
two buttons that we just created will be
placed to the far right so it works in a
top-down order so that's why our search
bar actually isn't on the far right
because it's on the bottom so it'll
actually occupy the second position from
the right so once again if you have
multiple elements that are using this
navbar right class the first element
that uses it will go to the far right
and then so on and so on okay so now
what we want to do is go ahead and add
our glyph icon now before we do that I
want to point out that bootstrap has a
page that lists all of these icons and I
will provide a link to this in the
description of this video so you can
pretty much choose whatever icon you
want to use here so for our contact us
we're going to use this envelope icon
right here and this is pretty much a
standard icon
that is used out on the internet for
contact us links and then we're going to
use a login icon for our login button so
let's go back to the code now how to add
this well if you remember in my HTML
series we talked about the span element
and what is the span element well one of
the functions it is used for is to
update text and I think in that series
we actually highlighted the text well in
this case we just want to add an icon to
this text and so that's what we're gonna
do and we use the span element to do
that so let's go ahead and create our
span element and then we're gonna call
our bootstrap class that goes along with
this and the bootstrap class that we're
gonna call is glyph icon very
appropriately named so it's sort of
similar to the button class right we've
call a generic button class first and
then we actually specify which button we
want same thing here we call the glyph
icon class first and then we specify the
glyph icon that we actually want to use
and again we want to use the glyph icon
envelope class which we can select right
here great and then we just need to go
ahead and close out our span now one
thing I want to point out here is
remember we're adding this icon to our
text so you want to leave a space here
because this will leave a space between
the icon and the text so whenever you're
doing this just remember to always leave
a space so that looks pretty good so
let's go ahead and copy this span
because we're gonna use it right below
again with our login and let's just go
ahead and we'll copy and paste it right
here and let's create that space again
and then this class actually has a
couple more hyphens to it and so we're
gonna put log and then you need a hyphen
right here I don't know why they did it
this way but they did and then you just
put in for login and you know what this
needs an H boy I'm always making
mistakes in these last couple videos
probably just typing too fast so there
we go I think this looks good now so
let's go ahead and save this and let's
go ahead and launch this in chrome and
let's see what we get and take a look at
that we get these awesome looking icons
and this adds a nice touch to your
website it makes it look very very
professional okay that's gonna do it for
this video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
