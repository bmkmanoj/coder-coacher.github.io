along with jQuery selectors and we're
going to look at a new selector called
the has selector and I'll just copy and
paste the line right over the last
jQuery selector that we learned about
which of course was contains so there
you can see the code that I typed out
beforehand and here is the has selector
now what is the has selector do
basically what this does is it allows
you to select elements that are inside
another element so what we're saying
here is that for every div element on
our web page that has the B element go
ahead and hide that so and so once again
we're saying hey every div on our
webpage that has the B element select
that so like that div that has the B
element so if we look at our code here
we can see that there's a bold element
right here
and so this div section will be selected
and of course hidden so let's go ahead
and save this and we'll run this and you
can see this section right here of
course has the bold text so this should
be selected and of course hidden with
the hide method if we hit that it indeed
is so that's how the has selector works
now we don't necessarily have to stay at
the div level we could target every
paragraph that has bold text and so
let's go ahead and do that we'll put a P
here so now we're basically saying for
every p element that has a bold element
go ahead and hide that let's go ahead
and save this and we'll run it just to
make sure and if we get our button you
can see that the paragraph is now hidden
of course the div stays right because
we're targeting the paragraph element
itself that has this bold element right
here this paragraph element so that is
how the has jQuery selector works ok so
let's close this out now let me copy and
paste a new line here we'll talk about
another jQuery selector and that is the
intellect err and this is another jQuery
child selector and what it allows us to
do is pick a child by its index and in
this case we're specifying a two and by
the way this is not zero based just to
let you know a lot of these selectors
are but this one is not it so it starts
out with a one so what we're doing of
course we have our CSS selector here
we're saying
ul and then Li and then of course we're
saying the second Li element so if we
scroll up in our code here you can see
that this is the Li element that will be
selected this is in the second position
this one is in the first position so
let's go ahead and save this and we'll
run this and if this works correctly the
wildcats bullet should be hidden and it
is now we could also go ahead and pick
other child's why don't we pick a div
after all a div is a child of the body
right so let's go ahead and pick a div
here so what we'll do is we'll say body
which of course is the parent element
and then we'll put div here so we're
using a descendant selector like we did
in the last example and let's go ahead
and we'll hide the third div so we'll be
hiding this div right here so let's save
this up let's go ahead and run this in
chrome and if we hit the button there
you can see the third div is now gone so
really you can use whatever CSS selector
you want here the only prerequisite is
that that element has children if it
doesn't then it's obviously not going to
work so let's go ahead and close this
out now jQuery also provides a selector
that will allow you to target empty
elements and what do we mean by empty
elements well they have no content
nothing is in it so let's go ahead and
I'll copy and paste a new line here and
what we're saying here is for every li
element that is empty go ahead and
select that and of course we'll hide it
as usual and so again this empty jQuery
selector allows you to select elements
that have no content in them but do we
have an li element that has no content
in it and we do not so let's go ahead
and just get rid of this wild cats here
and we'll save this and now this has no
content so this will be selected so
let's go ahead and run this in Chrome
and you can see our bullet here is now
empty so if we hit this button that
empty element should be selected with
our jQuery selector right here so we hit
this and it is it was hidden so with
these last three videos we've covered
the main jQuery selectors there are many
more jQuery selectors and I will be
introducing them throughout the series
but this is a good start so I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
