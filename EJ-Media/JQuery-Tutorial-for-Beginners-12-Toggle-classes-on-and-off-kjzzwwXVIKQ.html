removeclass method and the add class
method and I mentioned at the end of the
video there is actually a method that is
provided by jQuery that combines both of
these methods so sort of a best of both
worlds and what that allows you to do is
give the user the ability to toggle
things on and off on your web page and
so you noticed I changed the text of
this button to something a little bit
more appropriate hit button to turn
styling on and off and in this case
we're gonna allow them to turn this
styling off and on as they please maybe
they don't want this highlighted maybe
they don't like this pink text so the
method that we use is the toggle class
method and so we'll go ahead and save
this as an example for you and then
we'll put in that toggle class method so
here we go we just switch this to toggle
and this is gonna be a very short video
by the way because it's really pretty
self-explanatory so again now we've got
both of these classes here in one class
and we can toggle this on and off so
let's go ahead and save this and we'll
refresh our page and there you can see
they can turn it on and off now we will
be using this method later on in future
videos to do more complex things we'll
actually use this to add or remove
entire sections but in this video I just
want you to be familiar with what this
method doesn't and so again that's what
it does it it just combines these add
class and remove class methods okay
that's gonna do it for this video in the
next video we will move on to a new
subject see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
