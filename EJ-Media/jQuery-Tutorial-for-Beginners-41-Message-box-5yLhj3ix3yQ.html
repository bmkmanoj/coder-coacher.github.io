message box using the jQuery UI now what
we want to do is create a message box
that will pop up when we load our page
now we have to decide where we want to
place our message box and let's go ahead
and we'll place it in our main content
paint we'll put it right in here so
let's go ahead and close this out now
you can see here I've created some code
already this of course is our main div
section right here and I've nested
another div inside of it right here this
div I've given it an idea of box so all
of this content in this div will be
displayed in our message box so again
that's why I've given this an ID of box
and then you can put basically whatever
content you want I put a paragraph here
that just says thank you for visiting
our history site and I've brought back
Julius Caesar we're going to use that
image again so let's go ahead and save
this and let's go ahead and refresh our
page now we're not going to create the
message box yet let's just go ahead and
see what this looks like and there you
can see the content is displayed in our
main content pink now let's go ahead and
create our message box and we're going
to do that right down here so let's just
go ahead and copy and paste this code
over again and we need to specify our
box ID right here so let's go ahead and
do that and we don't need this argument
anymore this isn't going to be a
vertical menu and we just specify the
dialog method that is the main method
that we need to call so let's go ahead
and save this and let's go ahead and run
this and take a look at that we got our
message box isn't that pretty cool and
notice how all of the content is now
displayed in the message box the jQuery
UI basically pulled all the content out
of the main content pane and put that
into our message box that's how it works
so basically all the content that we
associated with that box ID is now
placed inside this message box and again
you can place whatever content you want
in here and actually let's go ahead and
refresh this page real quick that's a
little strange it looks like the border
the bottom border of our clothes button
is actually bleeding here that's
interesting that's actually a bug in the
jQuery UI I don't know if you guys are
getting that too that's really
interesting but
if I move this around so I clicked on
another part of the page and it's gone
it's only when you're in focus on this
message box that you get that that's
really strange let's actually load this
in ie this is a good test actually and
let's see if we have that same issue
and take a look at that we didn't get it
that's interesting so it's a bug with
chrome in the jQuery UI let's see if we
get it in Firefox and we didn't either
that's really interesting in any event
now you know how to add a message box in
the jQuery UI now there are many options
with this and we'll talk about those in
the next video see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
