how to style the tooltip widget now you
could use the theme roller we talked
about a few videos ago but there are
going to be times when you want to go
ahead and update the stylesheet
directly that the jQuery UI provides and
so that's what we're going to do in this
video is go ahead and update the file
directly so what I want you to do is
open up your website folder and I want
you to browse to your jQuery UI folder
now the stylesheet we're going to be
updating is this jQuery - UI dot
structure that's what we need to work
against to alter the tooltip widget so
what first thing I want you to do is
actually right-click on this copy and
then paste it right back into the folder
and what that gives us is a backup copy
of the stylesheet in case we need to
revert to it for whatever reason then
what I want you to do is go ahead and
edit this with notepad plus plus and
that should pull up the style sheet and
we're gonna go all the way to the bottom
here and these are the two CSS classes
we need to work against the UI - tooltip
and the body UI tooltip and so we can
close this out now and let's go ahead
and load up our webpage by the way go
ahead and clear any arguments you have
in here let's just keep this empty for
now so go ahead and open this up in
Chrome or whatever browser you want to
use and let's go ahead and expand this
out and there you can see we've got our
default tooltip so the first thing we
want to do is increase the width of the
tooltip so in order to do that we need
to go ahead and update the stylesheet so
let's flip back to the stylesheet and
we're going to go ahead and specify the
width property so let's type in width
here and we're going to go ahead and set
that to 200 pixels now you'll notice
this max width property that they
provided basically this means that the
tooltip could not expand out past 300
pixels so if you want to your tooltip at
500 pixels I don't know why you'd want
that but if you did you'd have to
increase this to 500 and then set the
width to 500 as well but in any event
we're just gonna set this to 200 pixels
now let's not save anything yet let's go
back and hover over Julius just to see
the width again and there you can see it
now let's go ahead and save everything
up let's refresh our page and there you
can see now we've got a much larger
tooltip
that's how you increase the width of the
tooltip now what if we want to increase
the width of the border we can also do
that and we can do it right here so
let's increase that to 8 pixels so let's
go ahead and save this refresh our page
and there you can see the border is now
8 pixels now what if we want to go ahead
and give the border a color let's go
ahead and do that and of course we use
the border color property now I've
already got that typed out so I'll just
go ahead and copy and paste this so
let's go ahead and save this will
refresh our page and there you can see
now we've got a nice color for our
border now let's go ahead and change the
color of the text to yellow and let's
also give a background to our tooltip so
we'll go ahead and just use the
background property if you took my CSS
course you will remember all of these
and let's set that to green so let's go
ahead and save everything up here let's
refresh our page and there you can see
that tooltip looks a lot nicer and it's
sort of a Roman theme right with all the
red the green and the yellow so that's
how you alter the tooltip using the
jQuery UI stylesheet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
