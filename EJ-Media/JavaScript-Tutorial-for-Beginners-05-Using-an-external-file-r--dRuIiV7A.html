JavaScript we want to start using an
external javascript file because that is
the best way to utilize your JavaScript
code and that is the way most websites
do that now similar to the CSS series we
are going to create a website folder
where we'll keep all of our website code
and we'll call that simply website and
we're going to use the HTML code from
the second video I think that was on
statements so let's just move that into
here and let's open that folder now and
now let's create our JavaScript file
it'll be empty in the beginning but then
we'll populate it with a couple
instructions so let's go ahead and just
make a simple text document let's open
that up and then what you want to do is
save that as a dot J's file so we're
going to call this test dot J s and then
you want to select all files and make
sure this is on C right here and it will
hit save and there you can see we've got
our nice little JavaScript file now and
we can delete our original text file and
then let's just go ahead and open this
up with notepad and we'll just size this
over here
and let's go ahead and open up our web
page and there is the JavaScript that we
created from the second video and we're
just going to reuse this this isn't a
tutorial about creating JavaScript code
it's about actually using an external
javascript file so let's just put in
something different just to be different
and let's just say we are now using ajs
file something like that now all we have
to do is copy the instruction we don't
need the script tags because this is
just a JavaScript file so we just copy
and paste that over here and we end the
statement with a semicolon as we always
do and so we can go ahead and get rid of
this now but we need to specify it in
our HTML our external javascript file so
let's get rid of this angle bracket and
we will use the source attribute by the
way this is the same process for an
external CSS sheet the same idea so
let's point to that file and
and it's test dot J s and we will close
it with another angle bracket let's save
this oops we need to save our J s file
first and let's save our notepad file
here and then let's again open this up
in notepad plus plus let's run this in
Chrome and there you can see we are now
using a Java Script file so let's close
that out let's close everything out now
and now we've got our folder now there
are two main reasons that you want to
use a Java Script file the first is that
we do not want to unnecessarily clutter
our HTML page because it will become
unreadable and again that is similar to
why you would use a CSS external
stylesheet the other reason is that a
lot of our Java Script code will be used
by other webpages so it makes sense to
share that among all of our web pages
rather than having to re-type that out
for every webpage that's just kind of a
pain so it makes sense again to create a
external file that we can use over and
over again throughout all of our web
pages ok that's going to do it for this
video I will see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
