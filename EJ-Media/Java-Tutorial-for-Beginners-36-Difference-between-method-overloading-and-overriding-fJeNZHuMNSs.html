the 36th Java tutorial today we are
going to talk about overloading a method
and overriding a method so we're going
to talk about the differences between
the two but first let's talk about
overloading a method now when you
overload a method that involves having
two methods with the same name but
different argument lists and the other
key point is it's always within the same
class inheritance and polymorphism is
not involved here so just keep that in
mind so again same class same method
different arguments and that is what
defines an overload the arguments are
different now the return types can be
different that is allowed and or they
could be the same but what defines the
overload is different arguments that is
what has to be different so I could put
you know an int here and make these
three intz and this would be an overload
still but if I put two ends here and an
int here this was no longer be an
overload so that is what defines it
different arguments but you can as a
bonus have different return types if you
want but again it's not a requirement
now you might ask a question well why on
earth do I want to do this
well maybe you like the name of this
method multiply and want to use it over
and over again because it's just easy to
understand we're doing multiplication in
this method you don't have to do it that
way you could call this you know
multiply int that's fine you could make
these individual methods and a lot of
people prefer to do it that way again
Java is how you prefer to do it if you
want the same method name and to
overload these you can do it that way or
you can have these as individual method
names it's really how you prefer to do
it okay so let's go ahead and run some
of these and we will go ahead and do our
usual system out and we'll just do a
call our test object that we just
created
and we'll do multiply we'll do the first
one and we're just going to put in some
nice whole numbers here and we'll run
this and we got the expected output now
let's go ahead and switch to our other
method and now we get to go ahead and
pick our method that is using three
arguments with a double now I should
point out you know maybe we had like you
know five subtraction here you know a
couple additions it's easy to read this
right that's one of the benefits and
like I said you could always call these
different method names it's really how
you want to do it so let's go ahead and
select this and we'll put in some you
know decimal points here just copy and
paste this thing in 13 or something
switch things up a little okay let's go
ahead and run this and we got the
expected output now overriding a method
is a little bit different and we're
going to get into that in a few videos
that's why I'm not doing a coded example
of that here we'll be doing that when we
get into polymorphism but that involves
inheritance so if we have a superclass
and we create a method in that
superclass and in our subclass we create
another method with the same name we
have to use the same arguments and the
same return type they have to match what
is in the superclass otherwise you are
no longer overriding that class you're
doing something else so for instance if
I put some int argument right in here
well that's no longer a override right
because the argument is now different
and this is something else so that's the
main difference and like I said we will
be getting into that in a few videos
just remember overriding a method we are
doing inheritance or polymorphism and
our arguments and our return type need
to match okay that's it for this video I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
