exclamation point important role in CSS
now CSS can get very very complicated at
times especially if you have multiple
style sheets and maybe you have
JavaScript it's generating CSS it can be
very difficult to tell where a
particular HTML element is being updated
in terms of the selector where is it
coming from and that is where the
exclamation point important rule comes
into play in CSS I like to call it the
nuclear option because it will literally
overwrite every other CSS rule that you
have created for that particular element
and wherever you place that important
rule again it will take priority over
everything now we're just going to do a
simple version here just to show how it
works but in reality the use case for
this is a situation like I said in which
you have multiple style sheets you have
literally hundreds of lines of CSS code
and you're not sure where the HTML
element is being updated and if you need
to make a quick change and you need to
get something working that's why the
important rule in CSS is very nice now
you can see here I've created a simple
class and a simple ID and we're gonna
use those in our CSS style sheet over
here so here's where I have the class
selector here's the ID selector and you
can see here I have a type selector for
the paragraph as well now the way this
works in CSS is the most specific rule
will take priority so the type selector
is always the least specific so we
shouldn't see the color green anywhere
and the paragraph class selectors are
more specific so they should take
precedence over the type selector so the
color of the first paragraph should turn
blue because this class selector is more
specific than the type selector and it's
the same situation for the ID selector
the second paragraph where we had the ID
should turn to blue so let's go ahead
and open up our webpage just to make
sure that is in fact the case and it is
both of our text turned blue actually
you know what let's actually make this
red so that we know for sure that this
is working correctly so let's go ahead
and rerun our page and there you can see
we made the text red in the class
selector and we made the text blue in
the ID selector now let's go back to our
style sheet now
say we need this type selector to have
priority over all the rest of these
selectors that's where we can use the
important selector so we just put an
exclamation point here and of course we
type in important and now this type
selector which normally wouldn't take
priority over the other specific
selectors will override everything else
so this should get precedence now
because we put in what I like to call
the nuclear option so let's go ahead and
save this let's go open our bar page
again and there you can see we got the
green text now I do want to point out
that you should only use this as a last
resort you should always try to debug
your CSS code first rather than using
the important rule because again this is
sort of seen as the nuclear option it's
now let's say we go ahead and put the
important role down here now we need to
ask well which one takes precedence well
because the ID selector is more specific
this important rule will take precedence
over the important rule that we placed
in our type selector so now the color of
the text in the second paragraph should
be blue and let's just make sure that's
the case so we'll go ahead and open up
our page again and there you can see
that rule in fact did take precedent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
