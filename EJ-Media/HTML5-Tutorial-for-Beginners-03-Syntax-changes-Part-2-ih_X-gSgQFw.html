with some of the syntax changes in html5
now one big source of confusion is the
line break element which of course gives
us a line break now in XHTML you were
forced to close your line break element
you had to put this slash here and that
didn't make a lot of sense because the
line break element only has one tag that
doesn't have an opening and closing tag
so why on earth do you need this slash
you really don't need it so in html5 all
you need is BR you don't have to put any
slashes now this old format will
continue to work so you can go ahead and
do it that way if that's the way you're
accustomed to using your line breaks it
will also even support a slash in front
of the BR so that will work as well and
I think you can even get rid of this
space here so there's like four
different flavors of this and they will
all work in html5 so it's really how you
want to do it but again all four of
those flavors are actually supported but
they also now allow you to use the line
break without any slashes and that's
actually probably the preferred way
going forward now also they have
eliminated the requirement to have your
tags in lowercase so you can put your
tags now in uppercase if you want so
let's let's go ahead and do that you can
make this uppercase if you want no
problem and it will still continue to
work you can even mix and match it so we
could make this closing paragraph tag
uppercase and it will all work so that's
another change that was made and I
commented this out but I also wanted to
show you that there was a change to the
source attribute you no longer need
quotes so if you don't want quotes you
don't have to put them around your
source attribute I recommend that you
don't do that that's why I actually have
this commented out I recommend you
actually keep the quotes but I just
wanted to give you an example of this to
show you how this works so let's make
sure all of these line breaks work we
should have three line breaks right and
if one of them doesn't we will only have
two or three lines right so we should
get four different lines if all three of
these are working so let's go ahead and
save this and we'll run this in chrome
and there you can see it all works we
have four lines so all three of those
different types of line breaks work okay
going to do it for this video in the
next video we will move on to the new
semantic elements in html5 see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
